      <P>The Commission on Mental Illness was established on 21st July, 1961.  It held ten meetings during 1962.  The last meeting was held on 23rd and 24th November, 1962, a two-day session.  A further meeting will be held on 25th and 26th of this month.  In addition, Committees of the Commission held 24 meetings since it was established, three of which were held since the last meeting of the whole Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount which local authorities are permitted to retain from old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, while <Col N="169" /> being maintained in (i) institutions, (ii) mental hospitals and (iii) general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments by persons who are in receipt of institutional assistance, i.e. shelter and maintenance in a county home or similar institution are governed by the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1954. Article 12 of the Regulations provides that where a person while receiving institutional assistance is in receipt of an income in money exceeding ten shillings a week, he may be required, out of so much of the income as exceeds ten shillings a week, to contribute such amount as the health authority consider appropriate towards the cost incurred by the health authority in providing him with institutional assistance.  This provision covers persons in receipt of either contributory or non-contributory old age pensions, as well as those in receipt of other cash income.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of Section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960 provides that the whole of any amount payable on foot of a non-contributory old age pension to a person detained in a district or auxiliary mental hospital shall be appropriated towards the cost of maintenance of the person concerned. Subsection (2) of Section 8 of that Act provides that where the pension of a person is appropriated under subsection (1), the person in charge of the place where the person is detained may, in his absolute discretion, pay to the person for his own use such portion (not exceeding ten shillings per week) of the pension as he considers proper in the particular circumstances, if, in his opinion, the person is capable of making proper use of the portion so paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income from old age pensions, contributory or non-contributory, is treated in the same manner as any other income in the case of persons availing of services in a general medical or surgical hospital, or as voluntary patients in district or auxiliary mental hospitals.  Similarly, income from contributory old age pensions is treated in the same manner as any other income in the case of contributory old age pensioners <Col N="170" /> detained in district or auxiliary mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>If the health authority determines that the pensioner comes within the terms of subsection (2) of Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, i.e. if he is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide the services he requires, he is entitled to maintenance and treatment free of charge.  Save in exceptional cases, persons in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions would be so entitled.  If the health authority determines that the pensioner is entitled to institutional services under the Health or Mental Treatment Acts but is outside the scope of Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, he may be charged such reasonable amount as is regarded as within his competence to pay.  In this connection it should be borne in mind that there may be a considerable difference in the total means of a person in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension and a person in receipt of a contributory old age pension.  Whereas there is a means test in determining eligibility for a pension in the former case, there is none in the latter case and a person in receipt of a contributory pension may have substantial other means as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a contributory old age pensioner has no other means but the contributory old age pension would the Minister say whether, in accordance with the spirit of the recent Social Welfare Acts, the local authority should appropriate the entire increase of 5/- granted as from 1st January last or was it intended that at least some portion of the 5/- would be left to the recipient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will see from the reply, this matter is a rather complicated one.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension, the local authority is entitled to appropriate any amount in excess of 10/- for the purpose of defraying the cost of maintaining and looking after the old age pensioner, if he happens to be in a local institution. If the Deputy will put down another Question stating the precise information he seeks, I shall attempt to get him the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="171" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting this question now and I should like a reply to it now, if possible, because there are a number of such cases throughout the country.  If a person is a patient in a county home and is in receipt of a contributory old age pension, is that person expected to yield up to the local authority, or is the local authority entitled to demand from that person, the entire amount of the recent increase of 5/-, because if the local authority is entitled to do so, which, in effect, means the manager, it means the recent Bill, so far as these persons are concerned, might be described as an Act to relieve the local rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not get away with that.  The fundamental principle is that every person who is able to maintain himself is expected to do so.  If he happens to be an inmate of an institution, then the health authority or the authority responsible for the institution is doing very well if it allows him to retain 10/- a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if an old age pensioner has a medical card, is the local authority to take any of that money or is he given treatment without taking any of the pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will study my answer and if it applies to the case he has in mind, he will see that if a person happens to be in a health institution, as distinct from a county home, the probabilities are that he is entitled to free maintenance and treatment in the institution, but if it is a county home the position is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the county home is being used&mdash;and very many of them are being used in this way&mdash;by the local authority for taking from the county hospital aged patients who are receiving treatment&mdash;they are not in for food and shelter&mdash;and when they have been treated and subsequently <Col N="172" /> discharged, are the local authorities to deal with the pensions in the way the Minister has stated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These are really not matters which should be put by way of supplementary question.  If the Deputy will put down a precise question putting the case he has in mind, I will try to answer it to the best of my ability but I cannot give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to the question in the way he has put it.</P>

      <P>The adjustments in our fiscal system which membership of the Community would involve are briefly (a) abolition of customs duties on goods imported from within the Community, (b) the adoption of the common external tariff of the Community for goods imported from outside the Community. These adjustments would be made during the transitional period ending in 1970 in accordance with timetables to be agreed.  The net loss of revenue would have to be made good by other taxation.  As I indicated in my Budget Statement, the technical questions which would be involved in the adoption of various forms of broadly based taxes on expenditure are being examined.</P>

PAYE came into operation on 6th October, 1960.  The tax collected under PAYE for 1960-61 and 1961-62 amounted to £3,387,000 and £9,064,000 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The revision of the acreage or the rateability of any holding is not a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The ownership of the embankments or of the land on which they are built is not affected by the drainage scheme. These banks were constructed at full State cost to protect the adjoining lands from flooding and it is essential that they be maintained in good condition. The banks have been fenced off from the protected lands in order to facilitate farmers in preventing grazing by heavy cattle which would cause serious damage.  There is no objection to grazing by sheep or to the lands being meadowed.  The proper maintenance of the embankments is, of course, in the interests of the landowners and their co-operation is expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amount of money <Col N="174" /> allocated to local authorities as Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote grants, the amount allocated to each local authority and the method used in calculating the amount of the allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to the allocations made to local authorities in 1962/63 under subheads C, Urban Employment Schemes and D, Rural Employment Schemes, of the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.  These are in the form of tabular statements which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The subhead C allocation is settled by making an arithmetical division of the total provision, proportionate to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area, and then making minor adjustments in these figures to secure suitable weighting in favour of the smaller areas, and also to avoid as far as possible extreme changes in the amount of each grant compared with previous years.</P>
      <P>The subhead D allocation is related to the combined number of unemployment assistance recipients and unemployment insurance benefit claimants in each non-urbanised town.  As the provision is not sufficient to cater for all towns a minimum qualifying figure is fixed and the grants are allocated to the qualifying towns on a scale proportionate to the number of eligible unemployed in each.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason for the considerable delay, in some cases more than two months, before his Department send a valuer to farmers in County Limerick wishing to dispose of reactor cows; and whether he proposes to take any steps to expedite the clearance of reactors in the country so that dairy farmers will be in a position to purchase replacements before the commencement of the milking season.</P>

      <P>My Department has purchased reactors at the rate of 800 a week in County Limerick during the month of December, which is not a bad performance. The weather since then, of course, has been unfavourable but, <Col N="177" /> apart from this, it is not possible or reasonable to expect that we can respond immediately in all cases however anxious we are to do so.  Arrangements have been made to open a separate district office in Limerick in the near future to deal with the administration of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme in County Limerick.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will make a statement on the progress of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme in the southern creamery areas since 1st October 1962; and if he can indicate whether any extension of time beyond June 1964 may be necessary in certain areas where an exceptionally high incidence of the disease has been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that there has been encouraging progress in this area.  The vast majority of herds have had their first clearance test and since 1st October 1962, 42,000 reactors have been removed, bringing to 104,000 the total removal since the counties in question became a clearance area on 15th June.  About 40 per cent. of the herds in the area have earned the clear herd bonus.</P>
      <P>The 30th June 1964 has been set as the target date by which it is expected that all reactors, following the second round of testing in the south, will have been removed.  Experience shows however that further testing and reactor removal will be necessary at that stage before the disease can be said to be completely eradicated.  I see no reason at present to contemplate any change in the programme now in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals have been made to me from time to time for the establishment of an airport in the north-west as well as in many other parts of the country.  As I indicated in my speech on 28th November, 1962, introducing the Estimate for my Department&mdash;Column 257 of the Official Report of the Debates&mdash;I believe that the country is now adequately served with major airports, having regard to traffic potential and the rights available for economic service. The Exchequer commitment to the operation of airports is substantial and before any further capital investment in airports can be undertaken, the concentration must be on the problem of achieving economic operation of those already in existence.  In these circumstances, the provision of further airports would be a matter for local enterprise.  I would, however, be happy to make available the technical advice of my Department to any group interested in the provision of such local facilities.  There would not appear at present to be a need for talks with the Northern Ireland authorities, but if there was a definite project of an economic nature and of mutual interest, this possibility would not, of course, be ruled out.</P>

      <P>The Second Interim Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, which was published in August 1962, set out a comprehensive survey of the ways in which exports might be promoted by co-operative action.  Government encouragement of exports is effected largely through the medium of Córas Tráchtála and the resources of that organisation are being specially strengthened to enable it to intensify its promotional work in general and in particular to foster the types of scheme referred to in the Committee's Report.  A principal function of the Adaptation Councils, which are now being set up in a number of industries following on surveys by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, will be the promotion within each industry of joint export arrangements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="181" /> for Industry and Commerce whether, following on his statement in regard to the Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation on the motor assembly industry that motor assembly firms which produced plans for the conversion of their plants to other uses, which would give continued employment to their workers, would be given special facilities for the import of assembled cars, and motor assembly firms who had not already produced such plans prior to the publication of the Report have now done so; and, if so, how many firms have produced such plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that a number of assemblers are considering the possibility of undertaking alternative manufacturing projects, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that plans for going into some new line of production cannot be matured by a firm in a matter of days.  My announcement of the arrangement to which he refers was made on the 3rd January and since then this and other suggestions have been discussed with the Committee which represents the motor assembly industry.  All assemblers have been notified of the points discussed and asked to consider urgently what steps they can take to provide continuing employment or alternative employment whether on the lines suggested or otherwise.  If worthwhile proposals are to be expected, it is necessary to allow firms some time to consider what they can do, but a direct approach to each individual firm will be made in the very near future.  While I trust that these approaches will reveal solid progress it must be recognised that the working out of proposals will take some time.  The Deputy can be assured that everything possible will be done to secure the speedy development of such proposals.</P>

If any assembler can show that he has adapted himself to absorb his workers in other ways, the facilities announced by me will be available to him.  Another decision of the Government, to be implemented shortly by legislation in this House, will enable any such assembler to benefit if he adapts himself to alternative purposes.</P>

      <P>The possibility of finding alternative employment for workers who may become redundant in the motor assembly industry is under active consideration and I feel it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement at this stage on the matters raised by the Deputy, other perhaps than to say that the question of arrangements to deal with redundancy, retraining and resettlement in industry generally is being actively investigated by the Committee on Industrial Organisation and by the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Retraining and Resettlement of Workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation makes it clear that for the most part the motor assembly industry as at present constituted cannot continue in free trading conditions.  Since the Report was published, however, some assembly firms have stated that they expect to continue in assembly.  In addition my Department has been in <Col N="185" /> close touch with the assembly industry with a view to encouraging assemblers to develop proposals for alternative manufacturing projects to replace assembly activity.  A number of proposals of a general nature have been examined but it is too soon as yet to state specifically what the results may be.  As I stated in reply to an earlier question the Government will continue to use every effort to foster employment-giving projects, including the existing financial and other facilities which it provides to encourage industrial development, supplemented by the provisions of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1962, and the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill, 1962 which are at present before this House.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the increase in the Agricultural Grant will affect the earnings of county council rate collectors who are paid on a poundage basis.  The earnings of salaried collectors will not be affected. The initiative in revising the remuneration of rate collectors rests with the <Col N="196" /> local authorities.  Any proposals submitted by them will be considered on their merits.  I should point out, however, that it is inherent in the poundage basis of remuneration that earnings rise and fall with the amount of the collection.  Even when the present reduction is taken into account, the increase since 1945-47 in the earnings of collectors so remunerated has been greater generally than the increase in the remuneration of salaried officers.</P>

    <P>NOTE 1&mdash;The mileage figures show the position at 31st March, 1962, and are taken from returns furnished by local authorities.  The county council mileages include main roads in urban areas (excluding those in the County Boroughs, Dun Laoghaire, Drogheda and Dundalk), which are normally the responsibility of the county council.</P>
    <P>NOTE 2&mdash;The grant figures show the aggregate of all road grants allocated through the Road Fund to each local authority, in the years in question.  They do not include grants made available by Departments other than the Department of Local Government and spent on Roads.</P>
    <P>NOTE 3&mdash;The Cork and Limerick Corporations grant figures for 1962-63 include provisional figures in respect of Main Road Upkeep Grant Allocations.</P>
    <P>NOTE 4&mdash;Grants for urban roads were introduced in 1960-61.  The 1962-63 figures include grants allocated to urban authorities in compensation for the Estate Duties Grant which was terminated from 1st April, 1962.  In addition the Drogheda and Dundalk figures include upkeep and improvement grants for the main roads in these areas.</P>

    <P>In regard to (iv), road improvement grants generally are distributed on a mileage basis.  Some road improvement grants, however, e.g., the Tourist Road Grants for the Gaeltacht and Congested Areas and the special grants for Bridges are distributed on the basis of the relative need and urgency of the problems to be dealt with, the limited resources available to meet those problems and other relevant factors.  The Main Road Upkeep Grant for 1961-62 consisted of 40 per cent recoupment of approved expenditure on upkeep of main roads in counties and county boroughs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice of my Department to advertise changes in the rates of contributions and benefits under the Social Welfare Acts only in the daily newspapers on the grounds that the publicity thus achieved together with that given to these changes in the Department's network of local offices and by its field officers is sufficient.  Associated Irish Newspapers, which represents the weekly provincial press, has recently, however, expressed dissatisfaction to my Department with this arrangement and, having reviewed the position, I have decided that their representations will be favourably considered in relation to publicity of this kind which is undertaken in the future.  Associated Irish Newspapers has already been informed to this effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Its purpose has been outlined in the explanatory memorandum and I feel that there will be general agreement that the Bill is not a document of any great complexity.  In fact, the provisions of the Bill are generally identical in effect, if not in wording, with those of the Acts of the Oireachtas dealing with the financing and control of the other State concerns such as the Electricity Supply Board, Irish Steel Holdings Limited, Bord na Móna and Min Fhéir Teoranta.  In the course of the detailed statements which it is my duty to give to the House on the various sections of the Bill, I shall, for the convenience of Deputies, make reference to the corresponding provisions in the existing legislation in relation to State companies.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for repayable interest-bearing advances from the Central Fund to enable Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to undertake on behalf of the State the establishment at Arklow of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  I consider it desirable to stress the fact that all moneys advanced to the company will be repayable with interest, on the lines of advances made to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  There will be no grant or subsidy assistance for this industry and there will be no tariff or quota protection in any shape or form.</P>
      <P>In the matter of placing before the House all the information which, at various stages of the development of the project, I could disclose without jeopardising its economic and orderly planning, I think it desirable to refer Deputies to the Dáil Debates of 15th November, 1961, 21st February, 1962, 17th May, 1962, 26th July, 1962 and also 31st October, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be found that full information was given on these occasions about the selection of the site for the factory, the nature of the products, the quantities to be manufactured of the different products, the raw materials <Col N="216" /> to be used and the fact that there would be no protection or subsidy.</P>
    <P>Deputies generally and, in particular, those Deputies who are directly concerned with the business of industry and commerce will understand that industrial concerns engaged in the negotiation of a contract involving some millions of pounds, in relation to which it is known that there is keen competition between international consortiums, cannot be required or expected to make a public disclosure of the details of such negotiations.</P>
    <P>I can give the House an unqualified assurance that, since the inception of the State, no industrial proposal has received a more thoroughly searching examination than that to which the Arklow project has been subjected.  The decision to seek binding tenders for the establishment of the factory was taken by the Government on the basis of a unanimous report made to them through me, after a final objective and completely uninhibited investigation by a committee set up by me to undertake the assignment.  The subsequent examination of the tenders, with their guaranteed costings, confirmed fully the findings of the committee that an industry could be established at Arklow to produce nitrogenous fertilisers to meet the growing requirements of Irish farmers and to make such fertilisers available at prices at least as favourable as the prevailing import prices, without protection or subsidisation.</P>
    <P>The case, economic and otherwise, for the establishment of the factory has been given broadly in the Explanatory memorandum.  I have, of course, been furnished by the company, in confidence, for my consideration and for consideration by the Government with comprehensive information on all the commercial aspects of the project including capital, production and distribution costings. The procuring of this information involved a full-scale and intensive investigation over a protracted period. Deputies will be aware of the critical views expressed on the scheme but I have seen no evidence that any comparable intensive survey had been <Col N="217" /> undertaken by any person or group of persons.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might qualify this latter statement by saying that the National Farmers' Association have been quite commendably engaged in the critical appraisal of the project over a period and, latterly, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association has had an objective examination of the project carried out.  I believe each Deputy has got a report of that examination and I think the action of the ICMSA in this respect is very commendable.  An intensive survey has not been carried out by this organisation since it would not be practicable to secure outside the resources available to the Government the services of a group as well equipped as were the Committee assigned to the job.</P>
    <P>The House may wish me to recapitulate the history of the investigations which led up to the Government decision to go ahead with the project. This industry has been under consideration since the early 1930's and might well have gone ahead some years later were the negotiations not interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in Europe.  The prospects for the industry were kept in careful review during the post-war period, and when it became clear in recent years that considerable expansion in the home demand for nitrogenous fertilisers was about to take place, a special committee was set up in 1959 to report on the practical considerations involved in establishing a factory based on peat.</P>
    <P>This committee consisted of senior officers from the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna and Ceimicí Teo. with special qualifications and experience in the engineering and chemical fields, as well as economist and administrative representatives of the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Finance, and Agriculture, who were experienced in dealing with the fertiliser industry over a considerable period of years.</P>
    <P>The Report of this committee was submitted in July, 1959 and while it was being considered by the Government a considerable reduction in import prices of nitrogenous fertilisers took place.  The Government <Col N="218" /> announced in October, 1959 that, having considered the committee's report, they were satisfied that the project would be economically feasible at prices prevailing before the recent drop in import prices but that it was not intended to put the project into operation until it could be shown that such a step would be economically sound and of advantage to the farming community.</P>
    <P>In September, 1960 the committee was re-established with additional representation from the Department of Transport and Power and the Economic Development Branch of the Department of Finance.  Detailed studies were secured from the foremost chemical and engineering firms in Britain, France, Germany and America, and further consultations took place with all possible sources of technical and commercial information in this country about production, distribution and application of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The committee in their report published in June, 1961 unanimously concluded that a nitrogenous fertiliser factory operated by a State company, at Arklow, using fuel oil and Avoca pyrites, could produce nitrogenous fertilisers for sale, without subsidisation, at prices in line with prevailing import prices.  The committee's recommendation was made in the context of a factory with a design capacity of about 125,000 tons a year, but they pointed out that with the increases which were taking place in the home demand, a capacity of the order of 150,000 tons a year might be necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to pay a tribute to the memory of the late Professor Thomas Wheeler, who was a member of the faculty of science at University College, Dublin.  He had been associated as adviser with my project and he rendered important service to the State as Director of Ceimicí Teoranta and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the committee's recommendations and established Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to implement their decision to go ahead with the factory.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the explanatory memorandum, the discontinuance of supplies of Avoca pyrites resulted in a change over to imported sulphur as <Col N="219" /> an ingredient of sulphate of ammonia, one of the factory products.  While sulphur from Avoca pyrites would have been more economical than imported sulphur, the change has proved not to be significant in the economics of the project as a whole.  Sulphur is now in excess supply in world markets and prices are falling.</P>
    <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta have confirmed to the Government on the basis of the capital investment required and of the production costings guaranteed by the contractors that, using fuel oil, limestone and imported sulphur, sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate can be produced at Arklow at prices which will ensure that Irish farmers will continue to receive their requirements of these fertilisers at the present favourable levels.</P>
    <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta was incorporated as a private company in October 1961 to acquire, erect and operate a nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow, County Wicklow.  The Company engaged as their technical consultants the United Fertiliser Company of Holland, and its associate Shell Chemical Company Limited, England, both of whom are fully experienced in the operation and management of major nitrogenous fertiliser factories. The Electricity Supply Board provided consultancy services on the civil engineering side.  The factory site selected by the company in the townland of Shelton Abbey, situated about 1½ miles west of Arklow, has outstanding advantages. It can be readily and economically connected to road and rail.  Movement of the products out of the factory will not cause any traffic problems.  In particular, road traffic to and from the factory will not have to pass through Arklow town.  In addition, the site is screened from public view and it will be suitably screened from the Forestry School at Shelton Abbey.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I have placed outside the Library of the House, a photograph of the site.  Deputies will be able to see how convenient the location is for road and rail connection and for adequate water supply. The factory will use a minimum of 1½ <Col N="220" /> million gallons of fresh water per day. Fuel oil, which is the main raw material for the factory, will be delivered there by pipeline from Arklow harbour.</P>
    <P>As I explained to the House in May last, the closest possible consideration was given to the question of location before the site at Shelton Abbey was ultimately selected.  Representatives of the Arts Council inspected the site in April, 1962 and, having received full information as to the layout of the buildings, etc., they intimated to representatives of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta that they saw no objection from their point of view to the location of the industry as planned.  Full information about the site was also given to An Bord Fáilte, who raised no objection from the tourist amenities viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The plant will include special equipment for treating such waste gases as oxides of sulphur and nitrogen to absorb any elements which could be harmful to local vegetation, or in any way unsightly.  In this respect it can be said that the factory will be ahead of any of its kind in Europe and will more than comply with the requirements of the most modern clean air regulations.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that much of the criticism of the decision to build the factory in the townland of Shelton Abbey must have come from people who have never either set foot in the townland or set eyes on sulphate of ammonia or ammonium nitrate.  The house and out-offices in this townland, known as Shelton Abbey, are used as a Forestry School under the aegis of the Minister for Lands.  It is not open to public view save with the permission of the Minister.  Contrary to the impression sought to be given by the critics of the site, the house in Shelton Abbey has not, as a matter of fact, been a tourist amenity of Arklow. The house is situated 1½ miles from the town and, without travelling that distance along a private road, it cannot be seen.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of any Deputies who may not be acquainted with the appearance and other characteristics of sulphate of ammonia and ammonium nitrate, I have, with the <Col N="221" /> permission of the Ceann Comhairle, placed samples of these products on display in the House.  It will be noted that both products are granular, odourless, and dustless.  Deputies, I hope, will agree with my view that the production of these materials in a modern well laid out factory, giving permanent employment to upwards of 300 persons, should not detract in any way from the amenities of Arklow.  I believe that, in the event, the factory will become a place of great interest to the public, and that planned landscaping of the grounds between the buildings and the Shelton Abbey house will add greatly to the tourist value of that property, should it be decided at any time in the future to throw it open to public view.</P>
    <P>Following the selection of the site, invitations to tender for the factory were issued by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to consortiums of chemical engineering firms, comprising fifteen firms of international repute from Britain, France, Belgium, Germany and the USA.  Four Irish civil engineering firms were associated with the consortiums.</P>
    <P>Tenders were received from those firms on the due date, 31st July, 1962, and the Board of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, having received a report from the consultants on the capital and guaranteed costs submitted in the tenders, furnished an immediate report to me indicating that the contractual offers had more than confirmed the costings in the Report of the inter-departmental committee in June, 1961, on which the decision by the Government to establish the factory was based.  The Government, after full consideration of the circumstances of the project, approved the placing of a contract which was then awarded by the company to the consortium of contractors headed by Messrs.  Lurgi of Frankfurt-am-Main, West Germany. The basic contract price was of the order of £5 million.  In accordance with the practice in the chemical industry and to ensure that work could commence on the site before the onset of winter, a letter of intent to place the contract was given to Messrs. Lurgi.  The preliminary development <Col N="222" /> work at the site commenced in November last and the entire factory is expected to be in commercial operation by 31st March, 1965.</P>
    <P>The factory will have a design capacity of 150,000 tons of nitrogenous fertilisers per annum in the forms of sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate.  These products are not manufactured in Ireland; neither is ammonia, which is a key intermediate product.  For the information of Deputies, who like myself, may not be familiar with the chemical processes involved, I should say that I am advised that the process to be used at Arklow is very well established and is of standard design.  Briefly, the process involves the separation of oxygen and nitrogen by compression, the partial oxidisation of fuel oil to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the removal of the carbon, and the treatment of a mixture of the hydrogen and the nitrogen to form ammonia.  This is the main basic process.</P>
    <P>Ammonia contains over 80 per cent. pure nitrogen.  Part of the ammonia produced at the Arklow factory will be used for reaction with sulphuric acid produced at the factory to manufacture sulphate of ammonia.  Ammonia will also be used for the production of calcium ammonium nitrate, the second main product of the factory, which indeed is expected to become the main product of the future.  The manufacture of calcium ammonium nitrate involves the production of nitric acid from ammonia. The reaction of this nitric acid with additional ammonia gives ammonium nitrate, which, as a pure dry product, contains about 34 per cent. pure nitrogen.  The nitrogen content is reduced while the product is still in slurry form by mixing the product with finely ground limestone.  This treatment ensures that there can be no danger of fire or explosion which could happen in certain conditions with pure ammonium nitrate.  The grade currently favoured by Irish farmers contains 20.5 per cent. nitrogen, but the indications are that calcium ammonium nitrate containing 23 per cent. and perhaps 26 per cent. nitrogen <Col N="223" /> are likely to find favour in the foreseeable future.  These higher concentrations can readily be produced at Arklow.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, sulphate of ammonia has been the main nitrogenous fertiliser used here.  When imports were resumed after the war, calcium ammonium nitrate had come on the market and the imports for 1952-53 amounted to 51,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia and 4,000 tons of calcium ammonium nitrate.  Since then, the demand for both products has increased steadily and substantially. This is not surprising and the trend is likely to continue in view of the spectacular results achieved by An Fóras Taluntais in experiments in the use of fertilisers generally and particularly in grassland experiments with calcium ammonium nitrate.  The actual figures of imports over the past three years have been as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The continued growth in the demand for these fertilisers has been closely studied throughout the entire post-war period and was the subject of the following comment in the publication <i>Economic Development</i> published by the Department of Finance in November, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, while it has been estimated that ammonium nitrate fertilisers based on milled peat could be produced more cheaply than imported nitrate or sulphate of ammonia, it is unlikely that the economic output of the factory (100,000 tons) would be absorbed on the Irish market for some years.  The current demand for all types of nitrogenous fertiliser is of the order of 80,000 tons per <Col N="224" /> annum.  A factory producing 100,000 tons of ammonium nitrate per annum would, therefore, be faced with the initial disadvantage of having to sell its surplus production on export markets in competition with large-scale British and Continental producers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 26th July, 1962, Deputy Norton reminded me that when he was dealing with this matter as Minister for Industry and Commerce his one concern was whether there would be sufficient use of nitrogenous fertiliser of the type contemplated to make the proposition an economic one, and he asked if I was satisfied on this score.  I replied that I was satisfied beyond doubt and that it would not need tariff or quota protection. A factory with an output of 150,000 tons per annum is well above the minimum economic size and should be able to dispose of its whole output on the home market.  Deputies will have noted from the figures I have already quoted that the total demand in the latest 1961-62 season was over 132,000 tons in all.  Having regard to the trend of user and to the rate of increase in previous years, it is a reasonable expectation that when the factory is in production in 1965 the total demand in the home market should have reached the 150,000 ton level, at least.</P>
    <P>It is a fortunate circumstance that the very substantial daily requirement of cooling and process water is available free from the Avoca river, without affecting in any way the river amenities or the availability of river water for other possible users.  A suitable water supply is essential for a project such as this and the ready availability of adequate supplies from the Avoca river was an important factor in the selection of the site.</P>
    <P>The factory will operate on a 24-hour/day, basis, 7 days a week throughout the year, and to meet this requirement, operations on the basis of 4-shift working will be necessary.  Permanent employment will be given to over 300 persons, the majority being males.  These will include senior supervisory engineers and chemists, <Col N="225" /> foremen and skilled operatives engaged on the plants producing ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, sulphuric acid and sulphate of ammonia, as well as the storage and handling plant.  Unskilled labour will also be employed on those units.  The maintenance personnel will include instrument operatives, electricians and fitters. In addition, there will be the usual factory employment for accounts and sales staff, clerical staff, despatch clerks, security officers, gatekeepers, messengers, etc.</P>
    <P>As soon as the design documents have been drawn up by the contractor, the main civil engineering work in connection with the factory will commence. Orders have already been placed for the major plant items such as compressors, and it is expected that many of the plant units will be ready for installation next Autumn.  Substantial employment will be afforded on construction and development work.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have seen published statements that the employment content of this factory is out of proportion to employment in comparable industries elsewhere.  These statements are simply not correct.  The actual employment in each separate section of the plant and in administration and sales etc., has been assessed by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in agreement with their consultants, who are themselves operators of nitrogenous fertiliser factories in Britain and the Continent. The figures have been very carefully worked out and compared with the employment content of similar production units elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards the factory costings, I would like to point out that Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta will be operating a nitrogenous fertiliser factory in open competition with imported products, i.e. in conditions of free trade.  While therefore, as stated in the memorandum, it is desired to give Deputies as much information as possible about the project, they will understand I am sure, that there is no precedent for the disclosure by industrial concerns of such information.</P>
    <P>It is quite understandable that Deputies are anxious to satisfy themselves <Col N="226" /> as to the soundness of a proposal to invest £6,000,000 in an industrial project even though the money is to be provided on a repayable interest-bearing basis.  I can assure this House that the Arklow project as planned will be fully economic in free trade conditions.  I have no doubt whatever that the company will be in a position to honour the undertaking already given that nitrogenous fertilisers will be made available to Irish farmers without subsidisation or protection at prices in line with prevailing import prices.  This undertaking assures the supply of nitrogenous fertilisers to Irish farmers at the prevailing favourable prices.</P>
    <P>There is, moreover, another potential advantage.  Dumping will presumably be prohibited in free trading conditions, consequently there can be no expectation of a continuance of the current low level of import prices. Without the factory Irish farmers would, in European free trade conditions, be at a substantial price disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> their farmer competitors on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Any commercial or technical assessment of the optimum location of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory must take account of the final cost to the consumer arising from the cost of raw materials, production and distribution of the products.</P>
    <P>The best location for a nitrogenous fertiliser factory is a point convenient to a port where imported materials can be secured, and as close as possible to the principal areas of consumption of the factory products.  In Ireland, nitrogenous fertilisers are mainly consumed in the east and south, and the largest compounding factories which need sulphate of ammonia for bulk are also located in the same general area, i.e., Dublin, Wicklow, New Ross, Waterford and Cork.  It has been established from detailed studies that the average cost of distribution of nitrogenous fertilisers to farmers is very favourable from the Arklow area.  The actual factory location is most convenient for distribution purposes.  The railway and public road are beside the site and no <Col N="227" /> traffic problems will be involved in connecting up with these facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the factory site has the advantage, as I have said, of providing excellent foundations for the heavy factory equipment and stores. The factory will consume about 1½ to 2 million gallons of fresh water per day.  The availability of adequate supplies from the nearby Avoca river at no cost, apart from pumping, was therefore a vital consideration.  The factory's fuel oil requirements will amount to less than 100 tons per day. There will be no need, therefore, for large scale importations.  Indeed the provision of substantial storage capacity and the financing of excessive stocks of oil, which such large scale importations would involve, would very quickly offset the benefit of any transport saving which might result from using large ships.  To summarise, the location selected for the factory is the most favourable from the engineering and economic aspects.</P>
    <P>This area was originally selected by the inter-departmental committee which reported in June, 1961, that a factory located at Arklow using fuel oil and Avoca pyrites could produce nitrogenous fertilisers for sale without subsidisation at prices in line with prevailing import prices.  It is, of course, a matter for regret that sulphur from the pyrites is no longer available.  However while that material, at the price at which it was available, would have been more economical than imported sulphur, the difference is not significant in the economics of the project as a whole, particularly as sulphur is now in excess supply in world markets and prices are falling.  The House is aware that investigations into the future prospects for the Avoca mines are taking place at present and I am sure I am expressing the hopes of all the Deputies that it will be found possible to reopen the mines on some basis which will be found to be economic. Bearing this in mind, the factory is being planned so that pyrites-burning plant can be readily installed if there are prospects for production at the Avoca mines on a reasonably long term basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> The cost of transporting from the Continent bulky materials such as nitrogenous fertilisers is relatively high, representing about £2 10s. 0d. per ton.  The total transport costs represent, in effect, an addition of some 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. to the European ex-factory prices.  The c.i.f. value of imports last season amounted to £1,800,000.  It has been suggested in some quarters that it might be economical to import more concentrated materials such as ammonia, from which bulkier fertilisers could afterwards be made.  I am aware of a number of commercial quotations for deliveries of ammonia to this country based on natural gas, and I can assure Deputies that such supplies are in no way competitive with the guaranteed production costs based on the use of fuel oil at the Arklow factory.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is that ammonia, is a difficult commodity to ship. Freight and storage charges are heavy. Fuel oil is, of course, an international commodity freely available from commercial sources throughout the world, and is readily transportable.  In addition, fuel oil has a very high calorific value and one ton of ammonia can be obtained from four-fifths of a ton of fuel oil.  It is clear from our investigations and from the practice in other countries that it is more economical to import materials such as fuel oil for fertiliser production than to import either the basic chemicals such as ammonia, or to import the finished products such as calcium ammonium nitrate.</P>
    <P>Imports of nitrogenous fertilisers are generally arranged on a c.i.f. basis. This means that the foreign supplier arranges for the shipping and the importer pays in foreign currency for the whole cargo on a c.i.f. basis.  Total cost of imports of sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonia nitrate last season amounted to about £1¾ million, and this figure may be expected to increase in the future. When the Arklow factory is in production the imported materials used in the process will be fuel oil and sulphur and the home materials limestone, water and air.  The total annual cost of the imported raw materials will be in the <Col N="229" /> region of £350,000 for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers for which without the factory we would require to send out of the country some £2 million per annum.  By any standards, this is a very significant and important contribution to our overall balance of payments position, particularly when it can be achieved without any degree of subsidisation by way of capital grant or otherwise and without the imposition of quotas or tariffs.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have seen from the Bill, it is proposed to provide finance for Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund, i.e. on the lines of advances to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  I feel I must stress the significance of this arrangement. There is no question of a grant or subsidy to this industry.  The money is being advanced on a repayable basis and the company will be required to provide for the repayment of principal and interest in full to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The maximum total sum provided in Section 5 of the Bill by way of advances out of the Central Fund for the purpose of enabling Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to perform its functions is £6 million.  The balance remaining after meeting the basic contract for the design, erection and commissioning of the factory will be needed to meet the cost of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Electrical sub-station and power connection to the National grid.</P>
    <P>(2) Supplies of mechanical spare parts.</P>
    <P>(3) Initial stocks of raw materials.</P>
    <P>(4) Factory mobile equipment, furniture and fittings.</P>
    <P>(5) Training of factory operatives.</P>
    <P>(6) Salaries, wages and other expenses before commencement of production.</P>
    <P>(7) Provision for contingencies.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for advances totalling £6,000,000 to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to guarantee <Col N="230" /> borrowings by the Company not exceeding £1,000,000 at any one time.</P>
    <P>The House will, I feel sure, readily recognise the importance, in the context of our industrial and agricultural economy, of a factory capable of producing nitrogenous fertilisers in adequate quantities at economic prices.  There is, of course, the further attraction that the production of basic chemicals, such as ammonia, nitric acid and sulphuric acid, provides excellent prospects for the development of subsidiary industries and for facilitating the existing fertiliser manufacturers to bring their production programme more in line with the modern demand for more concentrated forms of fertilisers.  As I have said, the factory is being laid out so that there can be a major expansion of capacity in due course.  In addition, provision has been made for space for subsidiary industries which we may reasonably expect to result from the availability of ammonia and other chemical products at this factory.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <P>As the House has ordered, it is proposed to take Supplementary Estimate No. 44 in conjunction with the Second Reading of this Bill.  This Estimate is necessary to cover the anticipated cost of repayable advances to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to enable the company to repay certain borrowings to their bankers.</P>
    <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta were directed by the Government to award the contract for the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow so that the preliminary development work could commence before the onset of winter. The contract was awarded to Messrs. Lurgi of Frankfurt-Am-Main, West Germany, on 23rd October, 1962.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of the contract for the factory, the company are required to pay sums totalling £900,000 to the contractor by 31st March, 1963, i.e. in advance of legislation which is now before the House. The company were authorised by the Minister for Finance to secure this sum as short-term borrowings from their bankers to enable the company to be put in funds pending the enactment <Col N="231" /> of legislation.  Advances from the Central Fund are now required to enable the company to repay the borrowings.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have a full opportunity of discussing the project in all its aspects in connection with the legislation before them and I recommend this Estimate for their approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A large scale capital investment of this nature requires to be justified by sound economic or social reasons.  In promoting this legislation for the purpose of giving statutory sanction to what is already an accomplished fact, it is reasonable to assume that the Government are satisfied beyond doubt that the proposal is a viable one.  I should like at the beginning to express the view that the manner in which this project has been presented to the House is not very satisfactory.  A matter of this sort should be introduced by submitting the legislation before or at the same time as the steps taken to establish the company.</P>
      <P>In this case, the company was established first and, indeed, has been in operation for some time, and now the legislation has followed.  It is not that the legislation presented any drafting or technical difficulties.  There are many precedents so there was no great difficulty in formulating and drafting the legislative proposals at the same time as the company was initially established.  When a matter such as this is presented in this way, even if Deputies believe that the project should not be proceeded with, they find themselves presented with an accomplished fact.  It is not in accordance with the normal procedure of the House.  Neither is it in accordance with the normal procedure which all Governments have adopted in promoting proposals such as this for consideration by the Dáil and for approval, or rejection, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, this matter has been the subject of consideration periodically for many years.  Until the present proposals were brought forward, the last published information indicating the Government's view was <Col N="232" /> contained in <i>Economic Development</i> published in 1958.  For a moment now, I wish to advert to some of the remarks in it because I believe that, while the White Paper, or memorandum, circulated with this Bill and the Minister's speech have answered some of the queries which are uppermost in many people's minds concerning this project, there are still certain questions which require to be answered.</P>
    <P>The publication, <i>Economic Development,</i> published in November, 1958, referred to this matter.  At paragraph 6 of chapter 19, page 179, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In 1953, Ceimicí Teoranta submitted a report recommending that ammonium nitrate should be produced, using milled peat or anthracite duff in conjunction with limestone as raw materials, the factory to have an output of 100,000 tons per annum. This recommendation was confirmed in a detailed report, prepared after consultation with Dutch consultants and furnished in 1954 at the request of the Government.  An investigation of the position in the Netherlands and other countries had shown that there was a marked preference there for ammonium nitrate, mainly because of the lower cost of production and the absence of the soil acidification which may result from continued use of high doses of sulphate of ammonia.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 7, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Consideration of the matter has recently crystallised in a proposal to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Shannonbridge to produce ammonium nitrate fertiliser using milled peat from the nearby Blackwater bog, which has already been partly developed by Bord na Móna for the production of electricity. Until this proposal is further developed, however, detailed estimates of capital and production costs will not be available and it would be premature to attempt any conclusive assessment of the economics of the project.</P>
    <P>That was as late as 1958.  When the Minister recommends this proposal, he says that the matter has been the subject of inquiry by a committee set up <Col N="233" /> by him in 1960.  First of all, there was a committee established, which reported in 1959 and, on the basis of that report, the Government decided that it would not proceed with the project.  I assume the project is the project of the Blackwater bog.  Subsequently a committee was established in August, or September, of 1960.  That committee consisted of representatives of the various interested Departments and they had advice, or the result of studies, from firms in Britain, France, Germany and America.</P>
    <P>One of the disadvantages in the presentation of this measure is that we have not been given the names of the firms concerned and it is difficult to assess the value of these comments in their absence.  It is true that later in the Minister's speech he refers to the fact that the company, that is, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, engaged as their technical consultants the United Fertiliser Company of Holland and its associate, Shell Chemical Company Limited.  I am not sure whether that is the same Dutch company as had already advised in 1954 because the name is not given in this report, but I believe the Minister should indicate the reason for the sudden change of opinion between the proposal in 1958&mdash;late in 1958, in fact&mdash; and the apparent rejection of that proposal in 1959, although a public announcement had been made to the effect that it was proposed to establish the factory, and then the re-establishment either of the original committee, the 1958-59 one, or a new committee in 1960, which subsequently got technical advice from this Dutch firm and its associate company in England and also had information available from chemical and engineering firms in Britain, France, Germany and the United States.</P>
    <P>The most satisfactory way of dealing with this proposal is to consider it on its merits.  One of the drawbacks in the presentation by the Government and the Minister is that they have either pleaded too much or attempted to justify the project by utilising every available argument.  It is reasonable enough in certain circumstances to adopt such tactics but in a serious <Col N="234" /> project in which large-scale capital investment is involved something more definite is required.</P>
    <P>This project is confidently recommended because, although it was originally based on pyrites from Avoca, there is now available a world surplus of sulphur and the price has tended to drop.  Cheap supplies of the necessary raw material are readily available.  On the other hand, over the past four years, there have been readily available ample supplies of cheap fertilisers at exceptionally low prices.  That may not continue.  I accept that, but it is equally valid to argue that the surplus of sulphur may not continue either.  If it is argued, on one view, that supplies of fertilisers at cheap rates may not continue, it is equally valid that we should accept the fact that cheap sulphur may not continue to be available.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this proposal has been the subject of very protracted examination at periodic intervals, if not continuously, over many years. One of the facts which we recognised many years ago was that the land of this country, particularly the grassland, required substantially increased application of fertilisers.  Because we recognised that, an independent expert was invited by the inter-Party Government in 1948&mdash;Mr. Holmes of New Zealand &mdash;to advise the Department of Agriculture and the then Minister and Government on our grasslands.  He reported in that year and said in fencing, water supply, drainage, cultivation, liming, fertilising and regrassing, Ireland is still largely a virgin country.  I saw hundreds of fields growing just as little as it is physically possible for land to grow under an Irish sky.  It is a miracle that some of the land is able to grow at all.</P>
    <P>This report was adverted to in the publication <i>Economic Development</i> in which the comment was made that the progress achieved since then, substantial though it was, has not eliminated the force of Mr. Holmes's remarks. If we examine the quantity of fertilisers used by Irish farmers compared with the quantities used by other countries who are members of the OEEC like ourselves, we find a very <Col N="235" /> great disparity.  The consumption per acre of nitrogenous fertilisers in OEEC countries compared with Ireland for the following years gives this picture. These figures are taken from OEEC statistics: from 1950-53, the average of the OEEC countries was £13.1 per acre of nitrogenous fertilisers.  In 1956-57, that had increased to £17.2 per acre.  In 1960-61, it increased to £20.4 per acre.  For Ireland during the same period it was: 1952-53, £2 per acre; in 1956-57, £3.3 per acre; and in 1960-61, £5.4 per acre.  All this indicates the extent to which this country must increase its utilisation of fertilisers if we are to measure up to the standard achieved in other OEEC countries.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must make up the backlog of the deficiency in the many areas and on many farms that some of these countries who have had more advantageous circumstances have not to contend with.  If, on the other hand, we compare the consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers in this country and in OEEC countries, there are certain interesting facts which come to light from OEEC publications.  One is that between the years 1952 to 1957, when the prices of artificial manures and nitrogenous fertilisers tended to rise, the annual rate of increase for this country was about 18 per cent.  The annual rate of increase in OEEC countries was substantially less.  For those countries using nitrogenous fertilisers, particularly ammonium sulphate&mdash;and most of the European countries use far greater quantities of ammonium nitrate than we do&mdash;the increase was between seven and five per cent.  When the price of fertilisers dropped between the years 1957 and 1961&mdash;and this, I think, has a certain bearing from our point of view&mdash;the consumption of fertilisers increased here by between 11 and 14 per cent. It is significant that although the price dropped, that period also coincided with the period in which the farmers' incomes were either static or lower. One of the facts is that farmers naturally tend to spend money on other matters before they spend it on manures and if income contracts, there <Col N="236" /> is a likely contraction in this respect or, as in this case, the rate of growth of consumption was not maintained, whereas in the other OEEC countries the rate of consumption increased slightly in the same period.</P>
    <P>One of the necessary factors which must be borne in mind and indeed one of the incentives necessary for full utilisation of fertilisers is adequate credit facilities.  In that connection, it is obvious from consumption in the past and from the fact that this rate of growth to which I refer was not maintained during the period when farmers' incomes did not maintain the increase and when costs were rising, that increased consumption depends on the maintenance by the farmer of an equivalent or increased income or, in the alternative, adequate credit facilities.</P>
    <P>The publication of the results of the investigations by Mr. Holmes certainly stimulated thought and inquiry here and resulted in a substantial increase in the utilisation of fertilisers. To that extent, the decision taken to give expert opinion on the state of the grasslands, which was completed by Mr. Holmes in 1948, was a decision which was justified, not merely by the increased output subsequently but by the increased input of fertilisers which has been shown in the figures available here as well as in OEEC statistics.</P>
    <P>One other factor in connection with utilisation of fertilisers here is that approximately ten years ago the import of ammonium sulphate here came almost entirely from Britain but between January and October of last year, we imported 90,000 tons of ammonium sulphate, of which over 10,000 tons came from Britain, showing that the imports from other countries here had increased substantially. I wonder whether the Minister or the Government have considered whether this project could have been undertaken by any of the existing firms.  It is somewhat remarkable that although we have here well-established efficient fertiliser firms, none of them for one reason or another, saw fit to engage in this undertaking.  It may be that because <Col N="237" /> of their contacts with firms outside, or for other reasons, they did not want to engage in it.  On the other hand, if the prospects are as satisfactory as the Minister and the committee investigating it believe it seems to me somewhat strange that the matter has not been considered by existing private enterprises, or undertakings operating here which are efficient concerns.  So far as capital is concerned, no one can describe any of these firms as poor or those who operate them as people short of money. So far as capital is concerned they had readily available to them adequate financial facilities and should also have had adequate technical facilities.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which have been the subject of concern to those who have examined this is the question of costings.  I believe that the Minister should have given costings in greater detail.  On at least one former occasion when a large scale investment was undertaken here, very detailed costings were given.  The figures given here indicate only a general overall position.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to get certain facts in order to try to base an examination of this matter on the available information and, so far as one can see, the costings available indicate that the cost per ton of the ammonium sulphate which would be manufactured would be made up on the following basis: depreciation in interest would amount to about £4; raw materials about £3 7s.; labour £1 16s.; power £1 6s., and maintenance about 10s., arriving at a total cost of £11 per ton.  That is based on certain assumptions.  It is based on the assumption that the charges in respect of plant maintenance would amount to about an average of £4 to £6 per annum, operating on the basis of the cost of the plant, that this would be on the basis of the funds available to the Government at the prevailing rates.  Allowing for some variations in rates, there would be a certain change in that, but the writing off period would be approximately 15 years at 6 per cent., and on the basis that the total capital involved is £6 million, <Col N="238" /> this would work out at approximately £600,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in other countries factories of this nature may have a shorter period of obsolescence but it varies, as I understand, between 10 and 20 years, and in this case, striking a balance between the two, I arrive at 15 years.  On the assumption that these costings are right, the cost per ton would be somewhere between £11 and £12.  Whether these figures will be altered, as they would be by a change in the supply position of the raw materials, is a matter which only time can tell, In that connection, the factor that has given rise to the greatest apprehension among farming organisations is the question of whether supplies of fertiliser from this factory will be sold at either existing price levels, or at prices comparable with those which would prevail on a free import market.</P>
    <P>In Paragraph 27 of the White Paper published with the Bill, it is stated that &ldquo;the Government are fully satisfied that this country can make nitrogenous fertilisers available without over-subsidisation or protection at prices at least as favourable as the present import prices.&rdquo;  Provided that undertaking is honoured, I believe that the farmers' organisations and farmers generally will be satisfied.  Where one has any doubts is that while the Minister and even the farming organisations themselves express the view that it is unlikely the present favourable trend of import prices for fertilisers will continue, the same is surely true in respect of the supply of sulphur.  If for any reason the supply of sulphur alters or the price alters, as a result of a change in supply, then of course it will affect the economics of the proposal.</P>
    <P>We feel that these proposals have not been fully examined by the committee which was set up.  They had available to them technical, engineering, chemical and scientific advisers who are not available to any body other than the Government, and they must have been satisfied on the basis of that information before this project was introduced.  In the light of that advice and the fact that this matter has been the subject of consideration <Col N="239" /> over a lengthy period&mdash;although I am bound to say that I have read whatever information is published on it&mdash; I am somewhat disturbed by the fact that the project which was contemplated only four years ago has been abandoned and that in a relatively short space of time, an entirely new location and an entirely new process in many respects have been adopted. However, perhaps the Minister will be prepared to indicate the basis of the technical, scientific and chemical advice that has been given and the costings presented to him but not presented to the House, because the costings that were given in the memorandum were very inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to work out the general basis of costings on the information available and on comparable figures for similar industries or establishments elsewhere and I have arrived at a general figure which may be disproved or altered by a number of factors, but nevertheless it is one which gives some indication of the cost involved. If the Government are prepared to guarantee that fertilisers will be provided at prices in line with existing prices, then I believe the farmers' organisations and farmers generally, as well as this House, may be satisfied with the proposal which is being brought forward.  At the same time, there are certain facts which the Minister has referred to which may or may not alter.  It is true that at present the consumption of fertilisers is mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country.  On the other hand, it is desirable that the increased use of fertilisers should be extended to other parts and that may alter to some extent transport costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adverted to the fact that Arklow is well served by road and rail.  He would be a rash man who would presume that CIE might not close that or any other line, because up to the present no one knows when the next line may be closed.  In any event, there is available there a good road system to meet the needs of the area.  However, having weighed up all these various factors and on the basis of the assurances given in Paragraph <Col N="240" /> 27, and recognising the value of a project of this nature, the capital investment, the prospective employment in Arklow and in Wicklow which is very attractive at the present time, especially in view of the disappointment and dislocation caused there by the closing down of the Avoca mines, the fact that it will provide worthwhile employment of a new kind in an industry that offers prospects for development, providing employment for technicians and scientists, engineers and skilled personnel, as well as unskilled and semi-skilled, we believe that the facts which have been brought forward and the information which has been given to the Government and to the Minister in particular justify the decision to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>Subject to the comments I have made which I hope will be satisfactorily answered when the Minister is replying and the fact that this offers an opportunity for the development of a new enterprise of a somewhat different kind from anything undertaken here before, although we have a well-established and efficient fertiliser factory engaged in different aspects of the work and provided the Minister can guarantee that there will be no increase in the price charged for fertilisers, we have no objection to it. Indeed, so far as the opportunities provided are concerned, we welcome the prospects offered for technical, scientific, engineering, skilled and unskilled personnel which may be provided at Arklow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a nitrogenous fertiliser industry has been the subject of much discussion, not only in recent years but in an intensified way in recent months.  There has been a great deal of newspaper controversy on the subject.  Statements have been made and contradicted. Fresh claims have been made as to the economic and uneconomic character of the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser industry.  The result is that a sensible man in the welter of all this wades through these statements and then tries to extract the facts from all that has been said and all the propaganda that has been used, according to the viewpoint of the person concerned. <Col N="241" /> Basically nobody can deny in a country like this where 40 out of every 100 people are gainfully employed in agriculture that it is obviously desirable that we should have a first-class fertiliser industry because fertilisers are the raw material of our entire agricultural industry.  The price we get for the agricultural goods we export, the quantity we export and the quality we export will all depend in the long run on what we put into our agricultural production.</P>
      <P>There is no better way of determining that than by ensuring that what comes off the land is fed by the best we can put into the land.  Therefore, I come to the stage at which I ask myself the question: Is the nitrogenous fertiliser industry necessary here?  The answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to anybody who has ever given even the most perfunctory consideration to the necessity for boosting in every possible way our exports of agricultural produce.  In the long run, and against the economic scene now emerging in Europe, this may bring us a better return than perhaps our industrial goods or other services upon which we rely so substantially for balance of payments purposes.</P>
      <P>If one looks back through the vista of yester years, one can remember the long controversy over the Shannon Scheme.  Should we ever develop the Shannon Scheme?  That in its day was a case for much disputation.  The wiseacres, or self-appointed wiseacres, said it would ruin the country; the country could not finance the Shannon Scheme.  It is quite unnecessary, it was said; it is all right for some highly industrialised countries in Europe to finance an electrification undertaking like the Shannon Scheme but it is absolutely absurd for a small country like Ireland.  But in spite of all the groans and the prognostications of the Jonahs, the Shannon Scheme went ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you searched the boulevards and the cross-roads of this country, would you find a fellow who ever hinted in the slightest way that it would not be a good job to develop the Shannon? Everybody was proud of the fact that the Shannon was developed, but in its <Col N="242" /> day, as the 1926 Official Debates of this House will show, it was the subject of great perturbation and more acrimony until the facts justified the prophecies of the prophets.  Thus we have the Shannon Scheme which is now not only the admiration of our own people but the admiration of many people who come from other small countries to see what a small country like Ireland has been able to do for the electrification of its industries and its private dwellings.</P>
    <P>There was another subject of great controversy, that is, the establishment of the sugar beet factory.  That in itself held the stage for quite a long time.  It was denounced on many a platform and many people also denounced it as something we should never have attempted.  But the sugar factory was established and now there are four such factories, all processing not merely Irish beet but imported raw materials for processing and for re-export.  There is nobody here now who is so intellectually impoverished as to assert that the sugar beet scheme was not a good one from the point of view of strengthening economically the fabric of the nation.  It is no harm, when we are discussing this nitrogenous fertiliser factory, to remember the self-assumed wisdom which distinguished our consideration of the Shannon and the sugar factory schemes in the light of the fact of what was said here in condemnation of them, and said outside also.  Both of these schemes have added virility, life and stamina to the economic fabric of the country.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  This scheme has been under consideration by a couple of Governments over recent years.  In principle, there was a general desire that the nitrogenous fertiliser factory should be established.  The great difficulty was to find out whether, if it were established, at certain times during recent years, it would not involve an increase in the cost of fertilisers to farmers.  It was certainly felt that it might be dangerous to go ahead with the establishment of a fertiliser factory if that meant increasing the price of fertilisers to farmers <Col N="243" /> During my time in the Department of Industry and Commerce, it was felt &mdash;I cannot say anything about the present Minister's term of office&mdash;that it might be difficult to go ahead if the establishment of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory meant increasing the price of fertilisers to farmers because it was recognised that the fertiliser was the raw material of the farmer who had to compete in a pretty tough competitive market and had to sell his goods in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>With changes in sulphur prices and the availability of new processes of fuel oil for the purpose of making sulphate of ammonia, it has now been possible to look on this whole project in an entirely different way.  Even up to as late as four years ago, thinking on the subject was along the lines of utilising peat for the purposes of producing the nitrogenous fertiliser, but, as I say, other experiments and developments elsewhere have shown perhaps that the production of nitrogenous fertilisers from gasification of fuel oil would probably give cheaper and perhaps better results.</P>
    <P>At all events, the whole subject has now been thoroughly examined, not merely by the Government in office, but by their predecessors.  It has been the subject of examination by competent civil servants in a number of Departments who had no axe of their own to grind.  The Minister now comes to the House and says: &ldquo;After having the whole matter thoroughly vetted by all the staffs available to the Government and by taking consultation with firms in different parts of the world who themselves have established nitrogenous fertiliser factories, and with builders who have had experience of building them, we now come to the Dáil and ask you to pass this Bill, involving the expenditure of £6 million, for the purpose of enabling us to establish a fertiliser factory in Ireland&rdquo;.  The ground has been cleared by all the examination done beforehand.  The position has been thoroughly sifted and so far as the Minister's statement is concerned, although he was obliged to be reticent in regard to the costings, the broad basis of the scheme was sufficiently <Col N="244" /> put to us to enable us to make up our minds on the whole business, fortified by the opinions of people who have no axe to grind personally and by all the advice he could get from responsible people in the fertiliser world.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where the Minister says he wants £6 million to go on with the job.  I think that at this stage we are entitled to ask him certain questions and to answer these questions ourselves or to get the Minister to answer them in the House.  It has been said that the numbers of staff to be employed in the factory which will be established here will be completely out of step with the numbers employed in any other similar factory known in the world.  The Minister says: &ldquo;We have taken steps to check that and we are satisfied that the numbers to be employed in the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow will be approximately the same as the numbers in similar nitrogenous fertiliser factories in other parts of the world.&rdquo;  That is either true or it is not.  If the Minister says after consultation with firms who are specialists in this business of operating fertiliser factories, that Arklow will be staffed approximately the same as any other such factory, we must accept that as a positive assurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that as far as price is concerned, the farmer will get his nitrogenous fertiliser at no higher price than he is paying today.  Possible he may get it at a lower price but he will not be asked to pay a higher price and it will not be necessary to impose a tariff on imported fertilisers or to institute a quota for imported fertilisers in order to maintain the viability of the fertiliser factory at Arklow.  If we take these four items together: the fact that the factory at Arklow will give adequate employment commensurate with employment given by similar firms elsewhere&mdash;the fact that the price will be no higher and possibly lower, and the fact that there will be no need for tariffs to be borne by the farming community in order to maintain this industry and no necessity to adopt a quota as a protection device to sustain <Col N="245" /> the factory&mdash;it seems to me that if the industry passes these four vital tests, there is no need for the misgivings of people who fear that the factory price will be higher, that there will be heavy tariffs to be borne and that only half a dozen people will be occupied in pushing buttons in the Arklow factory.</P>
    <P>It has been established that the factory will give employment to a substantial number of people, that the farmers will be able to use Irish-produced fertilisers without having to pay increased prices for them and that no tariffs or quotas will be necessary to maintain the factory.  These questions having been answered satisfactorily, there is good ground for the establishment of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory in the same way as the sugar company was established and the River Shannon harnessed.</P>
    <P>I should like some information on one or two matters.  The original proposal was to locate the factory at Arklow because of the fact that there was a substantial quantity of pyrites in Avoca, more than could be used in this country unless an export market could be found for surplus processed pyrites.  I sincerely hope it will yet be possible to reopen the Avoca mines and I should like to know if it would then be possible to revert to the utilisation of Avoca pyrites instead of having to import sulphur.  You can get all the sulphur you want from the Avoca pyrites and if you can get the copper mines working again, it should be possible to utilise the Avoca product as a substitute for imported sulphur in the Arklow fertiliser factory.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister if he would elaborate on the passing reference he made to the possibility of establishing subsidiary industries arising out of the establishment of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  Such industries have gone hand in hand in every country where they have been established with other types of subsidiary industries.  I am quite sure that the committee which dealt with the possibility of establishing the fertiliser industry must have come up against the possibility of the establishment <Col N="246" /> of subsidiary industries on many occasions.  Would the Minister pull the curtain back a little and give us a picture of what may follow from the establishment of the fertiliser factory? In Holland and elsewhere where the fertiliser factories exist, subsidiary industries have been established which provide substantial employment as well as making a useful contribution to the economic fabric of these States.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he estimates that the economic use of this factory will probably necessitate a production of about 150,000 tons a year. When one remembers that the present use of sulphate of ammonia is roughly 101,000 tons a year, one sees that we have some little way to go, unless, of course, we include the calcium ammonium nitrate as an equivalent fertiliser. From what the Minister said, I gather the objective is to produce at an economic level from the outset.  I hope there will not be a deficit for a few years because of the fact that the fertiliser is not in sufficient demand to cover the entire product of the factory. No matter how we get rid of the product of the factory, we should, I think, produce to the full economic possibilities of the factory, finding ways and means to attract the farmer to buy at no less than that necessary to make the factory an economic proposition from the outset.</P>
    <P>It should also be possible to find an outlet for some of our nitrogenous products in the Six Counties.  These products would have a much shorter haul than those that are imported to-day. An export market to the Six Counties, especially in view of what may emerge in the future, might make a substantial contribution towards financing a company of this kind.  My view of the project is that overall the case for the establishment of the factory has been well made.  Economically, it is fully justified.  I regard it as one of those substantial steps which take us further along the road of building here a nation which can provide full employment for its people instead of spraying them out over all parts of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has stated exhaustively our position in <Col N="247" /> regard to this project.  There are certain specific queries, however, which I would wish to address to the Minister. There are certain facts the House ought to know.  This is not the first proposal for a nitrogenous fertiliser factory adumbrated in Government circles here in the recent past.  There have been three or four previous proposals, some of which I considered when I was Minister for Agriculture. On each of these occasions, the Department of Agriculture was in a position to make a case which carried conviction to the Government when Dr. Ryan was Minister for Agriculture, when the late Deputy Tom Walsh was Minister for Agriculture and when I was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The proposals then brought forward were of a character which would increase the cost of nitrogenous fertiliser and impose an intolerable burden on the agricultural industry of the country.  In consideration of these representations, on each occasion the several Governments to which I have referred turned down the proposal.  It is of interest too, and the House should note it well, that in respect of at least two of these proposals the product which it was proposed to produce is now generally deemed to be unsuitable so that we may thank our stars that millions were not in the past invested in the production of that commodity because, if there had been, we would now be constrained to make do with something that was not the best.  In that respect this proposal has an advantage because, if this factory is adaptable for either the production of sulphate of ammonia or calcium ammonium nitrate, so far as I am aware, these two commodities between them represent an adequate spectrum of nitrogenous fertiliser availability for the agricultural industry, given the information we now have as to the most satisfactory medium for the application of nitrogen to the soil.</P>
      <P>I want to dwell with special emphasis on paragraph 27 of the White Paper circulated by the Minister with this Bill.  Paragraph 27 reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> As already stated, however, the Government are fully satisfied that this industry can make nitrogenous fertilisers available, without subsidisation or protection, at prices at least as favourable as the present import prices.</P>
    <P>I read that statement with relative satisfaction, but I was not quite so happy when I looked at paragraph 36 of the speech the Minister made to-day.</P>
    <P>There is moreover another potential advantage.  Dumping will presumably be prohibited in free trading conditions.  Consequently there can be no expectation of a continuation of the current low level of import prices.</P>
    <P>Now, dumping has a thousand meanings, according to whoever uses the word.  Is it dumping if we can buy Chilean nitrates cheaper than fertiliser produced by the European <i>cartels</i>?  I do not think it is, and the House should know that, when I was Minister for Agriculture, I was on one occasion notified by the nitrogen <i>cartel</i> that in the coming season the cost of sulphate of ammonia would be increased by 15/- per ton.  I got sanction forthwith from the Minister for Finance to enable Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to embark on a programme of importation of Chilean nitrates and that programme had not begun before the representative of the European nitrogen <i>cartel</i> called on me to say that the proposed increase of 15/- a ton had been cancelled.  I told him I was much obliged for the information &ldquo;but would he mind telling me why had they ever proposed it.&rdquo;  He looked at me and said, quite frankly: &ldquo;Well, after all, Minister, sure, there was no harm in trying.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I suppose there was not but was it not fortunate there was someone here who headed you off before you got away with it?&rdquo; We parted on terms of cordiality.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to be quite clear on this: If supplies of nitrogen can be made available to the farmers at prices more advantageous than those available from the continental <i>cartel</i>, I do not want to be told that this is dumping and, therefore, must not be <Col N="249" /> regarded as a price suitable for comparison with the cost of nitrogen from the Arklow factory.  This House had better make up its mind to this fundamental fact because there are too many people in this country, particularly in Dublin, all too inclined to float away from it: the whole economic life of Ireland ultimately depends on the land of this country.  The President of the French Republic is at the moment squaring off to the whole Free World because he says he has a community to preside over in which 20 per cent. of the population are involved in agriculture and therefore he has an interest in maintaining price levels and profits for the agricultural industry not comparable with any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Forty per cent., if not 50 per cent., of our people are involved in agriculture, not to mention all those engaged in industries based on agriculture, such as the creamery industry, the bacon curing industry, and a variety of other industries whose basis is the land and whose existence is dependent on the land of this country being able to produce the raw materials required at prices which make it possible for these factories to carry on.  I could read a list of them a mile long.  I give you the bacon and creamery industries, the dead meat industry, the leather industry, the felling industry, which deals with sheepskins, and a variety of others.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that between 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. of our people are, directly or indirectly, depending on agriculture for a living in this country.</P>
    <P>We are in the difficult position that we may not be allowed into the Common Market if the present negotiations collapse.  Our farmers will have to accept world prices which are not necessarily fair prices for their exporting surplus.  We are trying&mdash;and every country is trying in some measure &mdash;to divorce world prices from domestic prices, but, in the last analysis, you will find that the domestic price for any commodity for which there is an exportable surplus will drift slowly towards the export price, in spite of whatever precautions are taken.  Fix the price of butter for the <Col N="250" /> domestic market in a measure substantially higher than that which is exported and butter will start trickling in over the Border leading to cut-price butter on sale in Dublin and in every town in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the fact that at this moment we are obliged to pay world prices for such commodities, as are not protected by the 1948 Agreement. That largely consists of some cattle and, in some measure, sheep. It is true that most of us in this House welcome the prospect of the Common Market in the belief that we would accept the more realistic concept that the farmers are as much entitled to live as independently as any other section of the community.  They are entitled to a standard of living at least approximately equal to those in industrial employment, and industrial employment is now coming more and more to mean a five-day week, a 45-hour week.  There is no farmer in this country who has a five-day week.  A cow has to be milked every day of the week and a pig has to be fed every day of the week.</P>
    <P>The monetary reward derived from work on the land bears little or no comparison, even at present levels, to the monetary reward in almost any other walk of life in this country.  It is the industry which rules the destinies and circumstances we may encounter here when we consider this project.  I want to make no invidious comparison but I am prepared to say this.  I cannot persuade myself that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will come in here and pledge his word to this House with statements which he believes to be untrue.  I am very constrained to accept what he says and I take it he is pledging his word that facts set out in his statement here today are true, to the best of his knowledge or belief.  I make no apology at all for our position in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have given this matter most protracted consideration.  Neither I nor my colleagues have information enough to make a full technical examination of this project but the Government ought to have.  I had the peculiar experience myself of consulting <Col N="251" /> a variety of authorities and one adviser says the thing is unviable&mdash;&ldquo;It can never work; there must be a very substantial increase in the price of nitrogenous fertiliser or else a substantial defalcation on the redemption of the capital and its service.&rdquo;  That man sticks to his opinion now.  The second advisers came with substantially the same story and they come back in a fortnight and say: &ldquo;We want to withdraw what we said before; we do not take that view any longer; we take the view that this thing can work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I have before me a copy of a report prepared by Mr. Crotty, which he submitted, I believe, to the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association. It reaches the conclusion that this project is viable and should be approved by Oireachtas Éireann; and he is advising a body of farmers. Then, on the advice of the late Professor Wheeler, who was perhaps one of the most distinguished experts on chemistry in this country, and who in the last pronouncement he made before his untimely and universally regretted death, declared himself in favour of this project.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult in these circumstances to say that you condemn it.  It is an immense expenditure of public money.  The capital investment involved in this enterprise is as great as the capital originally invested in the Shannon Scheme.  On the other hand, if the undertakings as given by the Minister are valid and true, then that substantial capital can be serviced and an economic project can be made available, employment given and the agricultural industry put to no cost.  If these propositions are true, how can anyone oppose the scheme? But let the House remember the minimum annual application of sulphate of ammonia, or its equivalent, to the land of Ireland ought to be in the order of one cwt. to one statute acre. I regretfully assert that the consumption of 150,000 tons of nitrogen per annum on the land of Ireland is an object which we should easily reach, and far exceed, if we had a proper agricultural advisory service operating <Col N="252" /> in this country, which we have not; but that is another day's work.  I have no anxiety in regard to our ability to consume more than 150,000 tons of nitrogenous fertiliser per annum.</P>
    <P>If there is a differential in the price charged for the nitrogenous fertiliser by this factory over and above what would be otherwise available to Irish farmers from world markets, that is the equivalent of levying a tax on every acre of arable land in this country.  If this Government, or any Government, are responsible for such an outrage, their name will go down in infamy.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to the categorical statement in paragraph 27 of the White Paper in which we are assured that nitrogenous fertiliser will be made available without subsidisation at prices at least as favourable as the present import prices. But what happens if fertiliser were to become available at prices substantially less than the present prices?  I should like the Minister to answer this question.  The House is entitled to an answer because we have to sell butter abroad; we have to sell eggs abroad, if we have any to export.  We have to sell everything else abroad at whatever price it will fetch.  Supposing the price of nitrogenous fertilisers goes down, however, and farmers have an opportunity of buying them at substantially less, what will the position be then? Will our farmers be denied access to these reduced prices or will we continue to allow the farmer to have access to nitrogenous fertiliser at the best price he can get anywhere in the world, as we did when we authorised the importation of Chilean nitrogenous fertilisers, because they have to sell their surplus on the world markets?</P>
    <P>Remember, if we start levying taxes on the fundamental raw materials of the agricultural industry of this country, the whole economic fabric of the nation will collapse.  That is one question which I categorically ask the Minister and I suggest he has an obligation to answer it.</P>
    <P>The second question I want to ask is this : has his attention been directed to the report submitted by Mr. Crotty to the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers <Col N="253" /> Association and, if it has, has he found difficulty in communicating to us the economic costings of this end product, sulphate of ammonia, from the Avoca factory?  I do not know why he finds this extraordinarily difficult.  I do not see why he should not tell us what it will cost to produce sulphate of ammonia.  On page 16 of the memorandum, an estimate is made of the likely cost of production of sulphate of ammonia at the factory and it is made up on the following basis: Raw materials, £3 7s.; labour, £1 16s.; power, £1 6s. 8d.; maintenance, 10s.; depreciation and interest, £4 2s. 6d., a total of £11 2s. 2d.  It was pointed out that no guarantee of precision could be given with such approximate calculations and that, therefore, a safer figure would be £12 per ton, the factory cost.  Do these figures correspond with the information the Minister has as to total cost?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to elaborate somewhat on paragraph 36 of his speech in introducing this Bill. The Minister says, at paragraph 40: &ldquo;I am aware of a number of commercial quotations for deliveries of ammonia to this country&rdquo; and then refers to ammonia, which is one of the raw materials of the industry, &ldquo;based on natural gas&rdquo;.  He continued: &ldquo;I can assure Deputies that such supplies are in no way competitive with the guaranteed production costs based on the use of fuel oil at the Arklow factory.&rdquo; That is an important undertaking and inasmuch as the Minister gives it as his own undertaking, I feel constrained to accept it.</P>
    <P>He assures us at paragraph 8 that the most exhaustive investigations have satisfied him that nitrogenous fertilisers can be made to meet the growing requirements of Irish farmers at prices at least as favourable as the prevailing import prices, without protection or subsidisation.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 16, he says:</P>
    <P>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta have confirmed to the Government on the basis of the capital investment required and of the production costings guaranteed by the contractors that, using fuel oil, limestone and <Col N="254" /> imported sulphur, sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate can be produced at Arklow at prices which will ensure that Irish farmers will continue to receive their requirements of these fertilisers at the present favourable levels.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the figure he gives for the daily consumption of water by this factory, which he says runs between 1½ million and 2 million gallons.  I assume that adequate surveys have been carried out and that the water supply of the Avoca river will be adequate to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, however, to elaborate on paragraphs 35 and 36 of his speech and to re-assure me and the House that there is no sinister significance in the statement:</P>
    <P>There is, moreover, another potential advantage.  Dumping will presumably be prohibited in free trading conditions, consequently there can be no expectation of a continuance of the current low level of import prices.</P>
    <P>That is not to be taken as any qualification of the Minister's assurance given in the previous paragraph that this undertaking assures the supply of nitrogenous fertilisers to Irish farmers at the prevailing favourable prices?</P>
    <P>The whole project boils down to this.  If this enterprise ensures the supply of nitrogenous fertiliser to the farmers of this country at prices not in excess of those of nitrogenous fertilisers from any other source, then this project is to be commended.  If this project results in our being saddled with an investment of £6 million or £7 million of public money, which involves either the farmers paying an annual tax in perpetuity through the purchase price of nitrogenous fertilisers, or the taxpayers being called upon to pay an annual levy in order to subsidise the project of this factory, then this project should not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association that if the prices of nitrogenous fertilisers fall in world markets, our farmers should continue to import the <Col N="255" /> nitrogenous fertilisers at world prices and that the entire output of this factory should be exported to Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the 1948 Trade Agreement and thus benefit from some of the <i>cartel</i> prices which it is suggested will continue to be substantially higher than the cost of production here at home.  I cannot believe that holds out a very fruitful hope for an industry of this kind, but our position is that if this enterprise will provide the farmers of this country with nitrogenous fertilisers as cheaply as they can get them anywhere else, then it ought to continue on.  If, however, it means an annual tax on the farmers or an annual levy on the Exchequer, then it ought not to go on.</P>
    <P>We are constrained to accept the personal undertaking of the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, and I am proceeding on the assumption that the Minister would not suffer himself to be made the instrument of misrepresentation in this House.  On that understanding, we are prepared to give this thing a run, but there then devolves on the Minister a very special and peculiar responsibility. He has certified his facts. If these be true, we are not opposing the Bill, but if they should prove false, the responsibility is his and he will have to answer for it when the birds come home to roost.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Army Pensions Acts: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of Dáil Éireann the Government should introduce legislation (1) to amend the Army Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 to 1949, and see that justice is done to legitimate claimants for Military Service Certificates, and (2) to amend the Army Pensions Acts of 1923 to date so as to (a) extend the Disability Pensions Acts to those who suffered from disease attributable to service, (b) include the <Col N="256" /> widows and dependent children of persons in receipt of disability pensions due to gunshot wounds or disease contracted on service, or attributable to service, and (c) amend the regulation governing the means test for special allowance.&mdash; (Deputy MacEoin.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been suggestions that the smaller pensions should be brought up to a certain minimum figure, but I think I should stress the fact that military service pensions were designed to be a measure of the service given by the applicants, and even if an arrangement were made whereby the low pensions were increased, it is inevitable that all other military service pensioners would seek a proportionate increase also.  The purpose to be served, which the proposers of that method of improving the low pensions had in mind, has been achieved in fact by the scheme of special allowances. Deputy Tully was not correct when he said that five-sixths of the service pensions are below £25 each. The proportion of the total of such pensions below the figure of £25 would not exceed one-third of the whole.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carroll mentioned on the last occasion I came before the Dáil with these pension matters, and again last night, that there was a small number of Fianna men who had been denied recognition.  I asked on the first occasion that Deputy Carroll should write to me about them, and in a conversation subsequently, I also asked him to do so, but I have not heard from him.  I repeat now that if he gives me the names of the cases he has in mind, I shall certainly have them examined as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second point of <Col N="257" /> Deputy MacEoin's motion, I should like to say that the Army Pensions Acts already provide pensions for those suffering from disease arising from service in the periods 1916 to 1923, and in some cases to 1924, and also the Emergency period.  The Acts also apply to service with forces operating under the United Nations.  Where a married pension was payable, a pension is also payable to the widow and children in cases where the death of the pensioner was due to the disability for which the pension was granted. Pensions are also payable in respect of wounds and injuries due to service in any period, and in these cases also, widows and children of the deceased pensioners are entitled to pensions where death is due to pensionable disability.</P>
    <P>Where a man had a disease like tuberculosis brought on by his service, there is not ordinarily a great deal of difficulty in regard to the cause of death, but it is somewhat difficult in the case of a man who received a slight wound or injury assessed at 20 or 25 per cent., and where the person lives for a period of 40 years.  It is very difficult in a case of that sort for the Army Pensions Board to decide that the applicant died after 40 years from the effects of a slight wound of that kind.</P>
    <P>I did indicate when the matter was before the Dáil earlier that there were certain aspects of this problem that would require further consideration and I undertook to give them consideration. I am doing that.  I refer to cases of major disability.  It is conceivable, and I know Deputies have made this point, that if a man had a high percentage of disability he might not be able so to order the course of events in the most favourable way for himself and his family.  In other words, the disability may be of such a magnitude that it would in fact interfere with his capacity to earn a living. I do not know exactly how far I will be able to go in this regard but I am very anxious to probe it to the fullest. As I have said, I am having that done.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that the Army Pensions Act, 1962, made <Col N="258" /> provision for the payment of allowances to the widows and children of disablement pensioners whose disablement was not due to service but was aggravated, accelerated or excited by service.  That was an innovation introduced into that Pensions Act.  It applies also to final pensions in respect of a disablement of less than 80 per cent. but not less than 50 per cent.  In these cases also death must be due solely or mainly to the pensionable wound or disease.  However, as in the case of the major disability cases which I mentioned already, that last point is also being examined.</P>
    <P>The problem that seems to me to be of most general interest is that of special allowances and I think it is true to say that the special allowances have met the grievance of those who say the average IRA pension is too small.  The special allowances have disposed of that grievance in the best possible way.  Originally, special allowances were introduced for the benefit of persons with 1916 service, and then they were gradually extended to military service pensioners, disability pensioners with pre-Truce service, the holders of the medal and Connaught Rangers pensioners.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that a special allowance is payable to qualified persons who are unable to support themselves for reasons of bodily or mental infirmity.  I think Deputies also know that when the applicant is 70 years of age or over it is taken that he is no longer capable of earning his own living and at that stage the only test is whether, in fact, he is in need.  I do not know whether Deputies generally are advocating the complete removal of the means test.  These special allowances are annual payments which last 12 months and are then renewed. Therefore, they cannot be called pensions, and for that reason, the means test is deemed to be an essential part of the scheme.  The allowance is calculated by reference to an appropriate annual sum which varies with married and single persons, the number of children and whether the applicant is under 70 years of age.  For those under 70 years of age, the appropriate annual sum is £130 for a <Col N="259" /> single person and £156 for a married person.  For those over 70 years, the appropriate annual sum is £104 for a single person and £147 for a married person, if the applicant has a noncontributory old age pension but his or her spouse has not; otherwise, the sum is £123 10s.  The allowance is increased by £11 14s. in respect of each eligible child.</P>
    <P>When the allowance was first introduced, the means test was quite rigid, but it has since been modified in many respects.  The first £30 of a military service pension, disability pension or Connaught Ranger pension is disregarded in the case of persons under 70 years of age.  The increases in these pensions in 1959, 1960 and 1962 are disregarded in the calculation of means.</P>
    <P>Another point that has often caused complaint is the inclusion of gifts from children.  I should like to say in that regard that gifts from the applicants' children are disregarded to the extent of £50 a year.  Previously, only the first £2 was disregarded.  The assessment in respect of other contributions from children has also been modified twice in the past four years.  The old age pension is disregarded to quite a considerable extent and the increases recently granted in widows' pensions and in old age pensions are likewise disregarded.  The value of free maintenance, where it imposes a hardship on the provider, is not taken into account. This is a valuable concession in the case of transfer of farms where maintenance is reserved as a right.  The value of maintenance in a hospital, sanatorium or other like institution is not assessed.</P>
    <P>Last August, when the appropriate annual sum was increased in all cases by £13 a year, I had to consider whether, with the money available, I should further modify the means test or give a uniform increase to everybody. I decided that a uniform increase was more equitable, as any specific modifications in the means test would only benefit some rather than all.  However, as I have shown, the means test has been very considerably modified over the years, and the <Col N="260" /> desirability of further modifications is always kept under review.</P>
    <P>There were references last evening to the amount of the special allowances and to the fact that some allowances are small.  Such borderline cases inevitably arise when means have to be taken into consideration and, as I said, marital conditions, family circumstances and so on also enter into the matter.  But there are also many special allowances considerably over £100.  The average special allowance at the present time is £80 and the annual cost of the special allowances is of the order of £550,000, not a great deal below the cost of military service pensions, £650,000.  When I mention that figure of £80 as the average amount of a special allowance, I think I have emphasised the point I made earlier, that in fact the scheme of special allowances has more than met the allegation that the average military service pension is too low and, in my opinion, no matter what increases in military service pensions took place, they could not be increased to this average figure for special allowances which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It was said here last evening that the Department accepts the assessments of the Social Welfare officers as final and conclusive.  That is not so.  If there is an appeal, the matter is always re-investigated, but even without an appeal, the Department frequently queries assessments if they appear to be too high and the Social Welfare officer's assessments are checked by his supervisor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>It would be the same local investigation officer.  What I want to point out is that there are two <Col N="261" /> agencies at work to check the assessment of the local investigation officer. There is the investigation officer's superior in the Department of Social Welfare and there are also the deciding officers in the finance branch of the Department of Defence.  They very often question the evaluation set on the means of applicants as reported by the investigating officer, if they think them too high.  As well, there are senior officers up to the permanent head of the Department to whom, in cases of doubt, questions of this kind can be referred.  The Minister is also there.  I do not want anybody to think that there is some impersonal machinery in the Department of Defence dealing in a cavalier fashion with these applications.  Most cases in which there is any doubt will come before the Minister in one way or another.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully coupled with his remarks an incident which I thought I dealt with satisfactorily here before.  That is the allegation that a verification officer from County Meath was summarily ordered out of the Department of Defence.  It so happens that the person he met on that particular occasion is incapable of being rude to anybody.  In any event, the incident did not happen in the way represented, and I have assured the man in question that he is welcome to come to the Department at any time he has any business there. I thought that I had disposed of the matter satisfactorily already and I regret that Deputy Tully thought fit to bring it up again.</P>

Now, the position is that 43,000 medals without bar have been issued and that less than 5,000 have been refused. That should indicate that wherever there is any doubt the applicant gets the benefit of it.  If there is an appeal, the senior officer dealing with the case submits it to the head of the Department and if he is not satisfied he sends it to the Minister.  We do not go very far astray.  I want to tell Deputy Tully that, in the interest of the Old IRA, I am anxious that anybody who was not a member will not get recognition.</P>

There is no spleen and there could not be any spleen on the part of the officials against any applicant because of the sieve through which the applications have to go.  I <Col N="264" /> would prefer that specific cases would be brought to my personal attention and I must agree that that is being done by some Deputies.  I think that is more satisfactory than any general reopening of legislation.  It is quite obvious from the speeches made last night that there is only a trickle of cases in which Deputies think justice is not being done.  It would be most unreasonable to open the entire sluice gates again so that that trickle could get through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Left or right, I believe the Minister has an interest in this group but that the people with whom he is associating in the Cabinet have none whatever.  The Minister is not getting the finance to meet the needs of these people to whom Deputy MacEoin and other speakers have referred.  The Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 were aimed at rewarding those who fought in the cause of freedom and gave the most important years of their lives to that cause.  Many of them suffered loss of employment or impairment of health.  Almost 40 years afterwards, it is a very sad state of affairs for any Deputy, on any side of the House, to have to get up and fight a Minister or a Department on this issue to ensure that we will recognise the old soldier who made this House possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the special allowance grievances that we have in the country. <Col N="265" /> The Minister has them in his own county.  We have people who rendered years of good service to their country. I have one case in mind&mdash;I shall mention no names&mdash;of a man who was in the column during the Tan days. He was on hunger strike during the Tan times and in the Civil War, he was on the Republican side.  He was also interned.  That man got a special allowance to bring up his small pension but because he made an error in regard to a small number of stock on his small farm, not alone did he lose his special allowance but the Minister's Department deprived him of his pension until the full amount has been paid back.  As far as I can recollect, he got the first small part of his pension in Christmas week.  That was a lovely salute from a Republican Government to a Republican soldier of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have Social Welfare officers coming down the country following complaints made by the Department, or perhaps made by someone else, and trying to find out whether the hens are laying on so many days of the week or the number of turkeys a man's wife is feeding for Christmas, or how many of the children are earning.  The result is that the special allowance is cut down.  We have the case of the old age pensioners who paid their contributions and received the increase from the Department of Social Welfare and the first week they drew the contributory old age pension, a similar amount was deducted from the special allowance.  I do not think that is just. I think that the widows of old IRA men who have died because of their wounds, or from sickness attributable to their wounds, should be in full receipt of widows' pensions of a fairly decent amount.</P>
    <P>Another point is that anyone who took the Republican side in 1922 or 1923 and who did not apply, as the Minister did not apply, until 1932 or 1933, have lost ten years of service and ten years' pension.  Those people having observed the instruction issued to them, to keep on the Republican side and not apply for the pension, one would imagine that the Minister or his Government would have compensated them for the ten <Col N="266" /> years.  Whether it is within the scope of the motion or not, it is even reacting on Garda who carried out their instructions and did not join the Guards.  They are now losing ten years' pension and service.  Whether it is a left-handed or a right-handed compliment, I think the Minister is genuine in his attempt to help these people but the people in his Cabinet have no time for this group.  I have great pleasure in supporting Deputy MacEoin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  I think this amendment is overdue.  I would refer the Minister to the cases I have drawn to his attention of widows whose husbands gave sterling service.  We could say that the measure of freedom that we now enjoy was due to the work of those men.  I say that, irrespective of what side they took in the Civil War.  It has become a recognised fact that the Government have no time for the widows of these men.  Recently on the Estimate for the Minister's Department, I brought to his attention the case of a widow whose husband had been crippled, his body riddled with the bullets of the Crown Forces and he carried one of those bullets in his body to the grave.  The Minister has proved to be a great disappointment. He had the ball at his feet and he could and should have done something. Public opinion now is that the Fianna Fáil Government used many of these Old IRA men while they were alive and not content with that, went further and rattled their bones when it suited them to bolster the Party on every occasion that presented itself.  Now they have turned their backs on the widows of these men.  I gather from the Minister's attitude that he has no intention of making any change and I must conclude that he is going to be a great disappointment to many of these widows.  We have forgotten them, just as we forgot the people who could die or freeze to death in the mountains of Wicklow and other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is a considered motion and, while I was Minister for Defence, the Fianna Fáil Party pressed me to amend the Act in this particular respect.  I undertook to do so.  The principal ground on which the Minister last night refused to accept this motion, though he did not state it until this evening, was that the previous Government, of which I was a member, had not authorised the drafting of a Bill.  In my opening remarks, I stated the circumstances in which I was unable to carry out the promise given to the Fianna Fáil Party: the then Government decided that no amendment of the Act would take place before the final report of the referee and board then sitting was made, but I was authorised to set up a committee to draft a Bill to meet the requirements.  I did so.  That Bill is there.  It is true it did not get even a First Reading, but the Bill is there.</P>
      <P>On the point with regard to repudiation, it was not I who was repudiated but Deputy Boland, as Minister for Defence.  He came before the Federation of Old IRA at the change of Government and he said he would amend the Act on the lines I had suggested. The then chairman of the Federation would not allow me to speak because he said the Minister was going to amend the Act.  I accepted that.  The present Minister says he will not amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second ground for refusal is that amendment would cause a flood. The greater the injustice, the bigger the flood; the bigger the flood, the larger the number involved, and the bigger the number, the more important it is that justice should be done to those who have not yet got justice. It is true that some people got pensions who did not really deserve them. I will not go into specific cases.  There <Col N="268" /> were abuses as there will always be abuses under this type of legislation. There are abuses in relation to old age pensions.  Abuses are discovered in time.</P>
    <P>I want the Acts amended so that the Minister can investigate a claim if he is satisfied there are grounds to justify examination.  I know that it will not be ten cases he will have to examine, nor even ten cases from every Deputy here.  It will be hundreds of cases, and the only reason he will not do it is that the task would be too big.  Deputy Gilbride says the Minister has statutory authority.  Here is the Minister's answer to that: &ldquo;The time limit for such a claim has long since expired.&rdquo; Where is the statutory power?  The Minister has no power; he can do nothing.  It is no use saying he can make regulations.  He cannot.</P>
    <P>With regard to the widows of those who had disability pensions, the Minister says there is no difficulty where tuberculosis is concerned, and he thinks something should be done.  Is not the time to do it while the widow is still alive and while she can benefit by it?  It will be no use doing something when she is dead.  Time is fleeting. It would be a great relief to these widows if something were done.  The Minister himself knows several cases.</P>
    <P>I assert the Acts should be amended, the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1949, inclusive, and the Army Pensions Acts from 1916 to date.  The Minister brought in in 1962, a provision in relation to the Congo; disability aggravated by service is admitted.  Is it too much to ask that the soldiers who fought for this country, and not the Congo, should get the same treatment?  Is it unreasonable?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the investigation officer where the special allowance is concerned.  I challenge the Minister to say where there is a single officer in his Department with the same authority as the deciding officer has in regard to the old age pension.  The latter can reject the assessment by the local Social Welfare officer.  I know of an income of £20 being placed on five acres of land in Ballymore.  It would <Col N="269" /> not feed a snipe, but one little patch could produce perhaps half a ton of hay.  The pension officer put that down at £1 per cock.  I am not blaming him. He did not see the hay in cocks.  He calculated so many cocks out of the lumps he saw on the ground.  If I went in to the officer in the Department, or even wrote him a letter giving him the facts, he would wipe that assessment out without batting an eyelid.  No single officer in the Department of Defence could take the same step without the concurrence of the Minister. The Minister is a very busy man.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has taken the line he has.  I know that that line has not the support of at least 50 per cent. of his Party.  This is the last time <Col N="270" /> probably that I shall have an opportunity of fighting for the rights of my former colleagues, irrespective of what side they were on.  It is a sad commentary that this appeal has to be made at this hour of our lives. Memorials will be put up when we are dead and gone.  We do not want them. The memorial should be now.  Those who have not got pensions and who believe they are entitled to them should at least know what they have to prove in order to establish their claims.  But I do not think they should even have to do that.  The records are there.  Service can be decided from the records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the continuance by the Electricity Supply Board of the special service charges, and feels that the time has arrived when these charges should be abolished, thus removing this unfair burden on rural dwellers.</P>
      <P>Many people may not be aware that the ESB are not prepared to connect certain houses in the country, not alone houses in the wild, mountainous parts but even houses within a very short distance of our cities and towns, unless a very high special service charge is paid by the house owner or occupier. The position is, in fact, that people living within a stone's throw of existing ESB installations have been, as recently as a few weeks ago, quoted as high as over £10 per two months of a special service charge in order to have a three-roomed county council cottage connected.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party feel that while there might have been&mdash;we do not agree there was&mdash;some case to be made when rural electrification was being started for charging extra to those who were not immediately convenient to the areas being developed, we cannot at all agree that, in the year 1963, there is any justification whatever for charging an extra special service charge to persons because of the fact they do not live in an area which the ESB say can easily be serviced.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example.  We do not believe that because a person lives in Gormanston Camp, the centre of County Meath, in my constituency, he should be asked to pay £10 15s. per two months extra.  We feel the people who live in such places are as much entitled to have the ESB current connected to their homes at a reasonable charge as those who live in the cities and towns.  The question of whether or not there is any justification for what the local people call a ground rent, a meter rent, is a matter which might be decided here.  However, it is not the issue to-night.  We are not suggesting the meter rent should be done away with completely, but we are suggesting there is no longer&mdash;if there ever was&mdash;any justification for continuing to charge extra to people in order to give them the same facilities given to those living close to them or indeed far away from them.</P>
      <P>The ESB is paid for in two ways. The people who use the current pay their two-monthly charge and they pay also a certain amount for the current used.  It is true there are different charges&mdash;one for the town and city areas and a higher charge for the rural areas.  There is a different charge for industry and for ordinary household use.  While we agree there may be certain reasons for that, we do not think any case whatever can be made for the matter we complain about to-night. The fact that the whole burden of the ESB cost is not carried by the user makes the matter even worse, because the time comes when the general taxpayer is contributing a certain amount towards the running of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true loans and grants were made available by various bodies down through the years for the purpose of developing the Shannon Scheme, and subsequently the electrification <Col N="273" /> of towns and cities, and then rural electrification had to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>As has been said in the debate on another Bill here to-night, we will remember, no matter how young we were at the time, the trumping around of the famous white elephant of the Shannon Scheme.  Then it did not turn out to be a white elephant and everybody wants to claim responsibility for supporting it.  Whether it was a white elephant or not, it certainly is very much so to the person who is asked to pay a high charge, or who is in fact refused service altogether if he happens to live in a place which the ESB consider is a little outside the area they are servicing.</P>
    <P>Some very extraordinary situations have arisen as a result of this charge. When the ESB were planning their rural electrification schemes, they decided to do it in a certain way.  They decided&mdash;and I do not quarrel with the experts' advice&mdash;to do certain areas in circles.  The result was when four adjoining areas were done, there was what the ESB referred to as a pocket and the people who lived in that pocket were refused service.  They were told that because of the fact that it would take so many extra poles to bring service to them, a very much higher charge than that being charged to their neighbours 100 yards up the road would be required.</P>
    <P>We were under the impression last year when the Government decided to take a hand in this matter that practically all those pockets would be wiped out and those who were being asked to pay the high charge would then, or now, be able to get current at a normal charge.  We and the people concerned are sadly disappointed when we find that very many of these people, far from getting the service at the normal charge, when they ask for a new quotation discover that in fact the charge has been increased, and in some cases, more than doubled.  The quotation had been more than doubled and there did not seem to be any sense at all in the approach which the ESB had to the matter.  When protests were made by <Col N="274" /> the people concerned, and by public representatives, to the ESB local officials, they were informed that that was the regulation, that was the way it was laid down and the ESB could do nothing.  If, however, they liked to apply for a grant, they could possibly get a £10 grant for the supply of bottled gas.</P>
    <P>I took up a number of these cases, which I thought were a glaring example of injustice, with the Minister and he went to great pains to give me a very full reply.  The reply consisted of two typed pages of foolscap in which he went into great detail about the matters of which I complained. He finished up with the gem that, of course, these people, if they still wanted current and could not afford to pay the charges, could apply for a £10 grant for bottled gas.  One of the complaints I made was about five small dairy farmers who had been given farms by the Land Commission. Most of them were migrants to my constituency from the West.  No matter how much we object to bringing them in, we treat them as if they were born and reared there.  They asked me if there was any possibility of getting current for them at a reasonable charge.  They gave the reason that they were dairy farmers and that they supplied milk to one of the dairies and had recently been informed that, unless they were able to instal cooling equipment, the dairy would be unable to continue taking their supplies.  I explained this in detail to the Minister and I felt they should get the current at the normal charge.  They were quoted what I and they consider to be a very exorbitant amount for the supply of current and those were some of the people who the Minister suggested should apply for a bottle gas grant.</P>
    <P>I understand milk can be cooled by using bottled gas but I believe it is a very costly way of doing it.  I do not believe it is done very widely in this country but I think it is radically wrong for a Minister of State to suggest that people who want electric current for many reasons, but mainly because they want to cool milk, should be asked to apply for a grant for bottled gas.  We know there are <Col N="275" /> inaccessible areas in this country. During the recent blizzard there were areas which some people said could not be reached by normal means.  I saw on a TV programme where a lady was explaining&mdash;in one of these areas&mdash;that of course she was all right until the ESB current failed.  In fact this good lady had ESB current out in the hills. That is as it should be.  But surely if the current can be supplied in mountainous areas, it is not too much to ask that it should be supplied at a normal rate to those who live in the particularly level portion of the country.</P>
    <P>I am referring again to places such as my constituency but I know it is not confined to my area.  The same applies to practically every county in the Republic.  People have asked for a quotation for ESB current again and again over the years and some years ago, it was the practice to promise that it would be &ldquo;post-developed&rdquo;&mdash; this was the expression used at the time.  When the post-development was being carried out, they would be considered for connection at the normal rate.  When this post-development work did not materialise and they asked again, they were told that they would possibly be able to get current at a higher charge than that being paid by their neighbours.</P>
    <P>In the early years, the charge quoted was usually a couple of shillings more than the ordinary rate per two months.  While a couple of shillings to a person of low wages or income in the country district is a lot of money, the ESB at the time did not seem to think that it mattered so much. As the years passed, for some reason or another, the amount those people were quoted seemed to increase more and more.</P>
    <P>One of the peculiar circumstances about all this is that it is sometimes suggested that it is necessary to get a return from the connection which would compensate, over a period, the ESB for the cost of the connection.  I am sure if that were applied to the connections being made all over the country, since the Shannon Scheme was first introduced, we would find very many areas that would not <Col N="276" /> measure up to that requirement.  This is sometimes used to justify the connection of a wealthy farmer's place, for instance, on the ground that he will use much more current for lighting, heating and machinery than the cottier who lives near him.  While there is a certain amount to be said for that, it does not seem fair that the cottier with a big family has to depend on the old-fashioned lamp while his neighbour who is better off is able to get current.</P>
    <P>I know of a recent case of a person in those circumstances who applied for ESB connection.  He pointed out that the line passed within a very short distance of his home and he felt that there was no justification for charging him anything extra for connection.  He was informed that it was not a service line and, therefore, it was not possible for him to get a connection from that line.  The line from which he had to get connection was much further away and a figure was quoted which he just could not meet.  Being a sensible man, he accepted the situation.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards, a wealthy individual came to the area and bought a large house further away from this so-called service line.  He re-decorated it and promptly got ESB current from that line.  I do not know what justification there can be for that sort of thing.  I have not the foggiest notion how any justification could be given for it, but this has been done. I have brought the matter to the notice of the Minister in a previous debate and I should like, if possible, to get an explanation as to how the ESB can do things like that.</P>
    <P>I referred in a previous debate to the situation in certain areas near airports, particularly to the military airfield at Gormanston Camp.  Here we have the electric light connected by overhead lines to the pylons in the camp.  They have been connected for many years.  I served there myself during the Emergency and we had electric light then.  A number of the houses adjoining the Camp have also got electric light from overhead lines. Some of them have been informed that <Col N="277" /> they cannot get electric current from the normal lines, that they will require to have underground cables, and the figure of £10 15s. which I quoted here is one which was quoted to the tenant of a county council cottage.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that the reason given by the ESB for the extra charge was that the Department of Defence were insisting on the cables being run underground for safety reasons.  We cannot quarrel with that. If they consider it necessary for safety reasons, it is necessary.  However, a few yards from the Camp, there have been overhead cables for very many years.  Nobody will suggest that it is dangerous for a plane to fly over a county council cottage to which electric wires are attached but not dangerous to fly over a hut in a military camp where there are wires attached.  That seems to be the argument made by the ESB and by the Department of Defence in this case.</P>
    <P>I believe that if it is at all possible, most of the electric wires should be run underground because the country is disfigured with these electric pylons and electric wires all over the place.  If it is necessary for Gormanston to do that, surely the responsibility for extra demands should fall not on the unfortunate tenant of a cottage but on the Government Department.  I feel this matter should be dealt with by this House.  The Government should accept the motion.  I would remind them that when the present Government were in opposition, they submitted a somewhat similar motion in the House, but it was not carried.  There was a free vote on it.  If it was right then, it is surely right now.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the country should be treated on equal terms, and this is certainly one matter in which there should be equity.  I can see no reason at all why I should have to pay&mdash;if I live in a certain district&mdash;anything from 3/- or 4/- up to £10 15s. per two months extra, while my neighbour who lives down the road only pays a normal service charge of something like 15/- or 16/-.  The ESB and the Minister may feel that this situation has been allowed to continue for so <Col N="278" /> long that there is no point in changing it now.  Nobody has been kicking up a row about it: therefore it must not be improved.  If the Minister requires written evidence from discontented people all over the country I shall be glad to let him have one or two complaints. Indeed, I have a very hefty file, built up over the past 12 months, of correspondence from people who were under the impression that the recent change in the ESB regulations would let them in at the normal charge, but who now find that they will have to pay as much as or maybe a little more than they would have had to pay if they had taken the current some time ago.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to get the impression that I am blaming him entirely.  This is something which has been handed down from one Minister to another, from one Government to another.  All the time, the ESB have been simply sailing along and when questioned about the matter, reply: &ldquo;This is a Government regulation: there is nothing we can do about it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that it was because of the abolition of the subsidy in 1955 that this situation arose?  If it was, then there should be no justification for it before 1955.  It would be rather interesting to look at what the Minister said when he and his Party introduced a motion on somewhat similar terms.  When in opposition&mdash;the Minister is as well aware of this as I am&mdash; you can say all sorts of things should be done, but when you reach ministerial level then you can try to be a Smart Aleck at the expense of a motion which is put down simply to right a wrong.  It is not aimed at this Minister. I do not believe the Minister had anything to do with the decision.  I do not believe he is fully aware of what the decision is.  I am under the impression that as far as he is concerned they are people&mdash;they just do not count.  If they live out a mile or a mile and a half from an area and the Minister <Col N="279" /> felt they were entitled to any service, he would run a mile and a half of poles to them.  That would be all right.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann disapproves of the Registration Council (Constitution and Procedure) (Amendment) Rules, 1962.</P>
      <P>The Registration Council referred to in the Statutory Order, which is the subject matter of this motion, was established under the provisions of the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1914.  It is a council which is concerned with regulations dealing with secondary teachers.</P>
      <P>The object of this motion is to bring to the notice of the Dáil, and it is hoped of the public, what we believe to be the unjustified discourtesy and autocratic treatment experienced by an association of Catholic lay headmasters of secondary schools.  It is an association known as the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  This Order on which the opinion of the Dáil is sought, has the effect of withdrawing from the Registration Council membership of the Federation's nominees. I should, however, at the outset of my remarks give a brief indication of the history, aims and objects of this Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Secondary schools was founded about 10 years ago.  Its members included between 40 and 50 Catholic secondary schools in this country&mdash;virtually all the lay secondary Catholic schools.  Its object, as a representative body of headmasters of lay Catholic schools, was principally to foster the growth and improve the quality of secondary education in Ireland.  The original title of this Association was that of the Federation of Catholic Lay Secondary Schools.  Deputies may be aware of this Association under its present name of the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools by reason of a very important, very full and very experienced study which this Federation published last <Col N="280" /> year with the title <i>Investment in Education.</i> This was a study of the facilities in this country for secondary education.  It is a study which, in fact, brought to light facts only half-known and very frequently ignored concerning the totally inadequate system of secondary education we have and the inadequate facilities in many parts of the country for children of school-going age.</P>
    <P>This Association, as I said, has concerned itself since its foundation with improving the conditions and the nature of secondary education in this country.  As such, it obtained the recognition of the Department about three years ago in that it became a member of the Registration Council. The effect of this Order is to cease that recognition.  From the point of view of this Federation the recognition given by membership of the Registration Council is not very important nor do I understand are they greatly concerned whether its members sit on the Registration Council or not but it is concerned to see that, in fact, the Federation and any similar association will be fairly treated by the Minister and his Department and that its motives will not be impugned and its work maligned.  It is hoped that the raising in the Dáil of the way in which the Government, the Minister and his Department have treated this Association may have a salutary effect on actions in the future.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil on 13th December last when Deputy Byrne and myself asked the Minister the reason why recognition was withdrawn. The Dáil was informed that the recognition was being withdrawn because of the new and misleading title of the Association.  It was pointed out, that because the Association had refused to change its name and had indicated it would not, that the name was new and misleading; accordingly recognition could not be given under that name.  It is my suggestion that that is not the real reason why recognition was withdrawn.  The name of the present Association, &ldquo;Federation of Irish Secondary Schools&rdquo; is no more misleading than the names of several other associations whose members at present sit on the Registration Council. <Col N="281" /> I refer to the &ldquo;Irish Schoolmasters' Association&rdquo;.  To those uninitiated in the affairs of secondary education in this country, the name &ldquo;Irish Schoolmasters' Association&rdquo; could have a very wide connotation.  In fact, the &ldquo;Irish Schoolmasters' Association&rdquo; refers only to Protestant schoolmasters. Anybody uninitiated in the affairs of secondary education here might well think that the Catholic Headmasters' Association was an association that embraced all Catholic headmasters. In fact, it is an association solely made up of clerical headmasters. It is quite obvious that anybody versed in the affairs of secondary education in this country would not be in any way misled by the change of title.  A number of organisations at the present time have different names and different titles which to the uninitiated may be misleading but which, nonetheless, has not stopped them being recognised by members of the Registration Council.  In fact, the reason the Minister gave for the failure to recognise this Association, that its title was new and misleading, is not the real reason.</P>
    <P>Before this Association changed its name threats were made against it that recognition would be withdrawn. Long before the Association changed its name at the beginning of last year allegations of discourtesy and irresponsibility were made against it by the Minister in correspondence.  It is quite clear that the real reason lies in the strong objection which it has been thought fit to have towards this Association.  I believe that the attacks made on the Association&mdash;and I think &ldquo;attack&rdquo; is the proper word&mdash;are completely unjustified and that the real reason why this Association has been refused recognition is the objection that has been taken to the fact that the Federation has been concerning itself actively with secondary education matters in this country; that its actions in this field were regarded as interference in the field of secondary education and that there was suspicion of the efforts made by this Federation to get reform in secondary education, reform which we all know to be urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> I think that what I have said is borne out by what the Minister said in the Dáil on 13th December of last year.  In Volume 198, No. 9, of the Official Report, Deputies will see that the Minister answered questions and supplementary questions which were raised on this matter.  Reference was made in the course of these questions and answers to the report which was published and sent to all Deputies and the public by the Federation last year, <i>Investment in Education.</i> This was the way in which that document was dealt with by the Minister.  He said:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it contains so many errors of commission and omission, false deductions and assumptions, and misrepresentations that its circulation internationally can be construed only as an irresponsible attempt to harm the country.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Minister that portion or all of that report to which I have referred contain these omissions and commissions and that it was an irresponsible attempt to harm this country that motivated its writers in circulating it internationally.  These are suggestions impugning the motives of this body of secondary lay headmasters and it is to this imputation that we object.  This imputation was against the motives of people who have voluntarily given up their time and who have been prepared to work in the interest of the public for months in order to produce this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy is so cynical.  The Minister said that this group of people were not competent to deal with this subject, that they were people who were studying in their spare time in order to get money for their schools.  The imputation made there was that they produced their report for a pecuniary motive, out of a selfish desire to improve their own pockets.  Nobody who read the report which was produced with such care and skill would agree with that but, if we are wrong in this, I think the Minister should do more than merely level accusations.  I <Col N="283" /> think it is his duty to point out to the public where are the errors of commission and omission in this report, where are the false deductions and assumptions, where are the misrepresentations it contains.  If they exist, we should be informed of them.</P>
      <P>A good many people have read this report with great concern and a great many people interested in secondary education are concerned with the facts about secondary education in this country.  It would be of considerable assistance to all those people, if it were true that the report contained all these errors, that they should be shown up. It is not sufficient for the Minister to make an allegation like that without substantiating it.  We feel that for this reason the manner in which the Minister has met the facts set out in the report has not been quite fair.</P>
      <P>I should also refer Deputies to the manner in which the Association has been met in the matter of representations made by it to the Minister and his Department.  One of the matters of concern to the Federation last year was the fact that an advertisement had appeared in the newspapers to the effect that seven inspectors of secondary schools were to be appointed. No requirement of a minimum period of teaching experience in a secondary school was mentioned and no university qualification was laid down.</P>
      <P>The Federation wrote to the Minister concerning the matter.  It pointed out that the successful applicants for these posts would play a large part in the administration of Irish secondary education for the next 20 or 30 years and that some minimum period of teaching experience or some university qualification should be designated.  The letter added:</P>
      <P>Our Committee must request you to reconsider the conditions of appointment of these seven inspectors and our Committee would be glad if you would consider the matter as of urgency and let us have your views at your earliest convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may or may not be agreement by the Minister with that letter.  All they were asking was that the qualifications for the appointment should be <Col N="284" /> designated but the Minister replied in a letter of 18th April that their suggestions could only be regarded as arrogance on their part.  It was suggested that they were arrogant when they asked that the matter be considered urgently and that the Minister should reconsider the conditions of appointment.  The Association was acting as it thought fit in the public interest and to level a charge of arrogance against it is unjustified.</P>
    <P>The Minister was away at that time and the Federation was very concerned with the matter of the appointment of the seven inspectors, perhaps without proper qualifications.  They wrote to the Taoiseach about the matter and said that they would not wish to be taken in any way as reflecting on the understanding and courtesy which Dr. Hillery and his predecessor had at all times shown in conversation with the Association.  They pointed out that their concern was that there might be such an accumulation of inertia in the matter as would cause grave difficulties for the best of Ministers to get things moving.</P>
    <P>Deputies may not agree with that letter.  Some may think it is paying too handsome a tribute to the Minister and his predecessors, while others may think that sufficient tribute is not paid to them in it.  The Minister's reply was that he objected most strongly as the letter indicated that neither he nor his predecessor was capable of handling the Department. That is not at all the suggestion or the implication to be drawn from the letter but it is an indication of the sort of feeling which has been building up between the Minister and this Association for some considerable time past.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this state of affairs has arisen.  It is to be regretted that a voluntary organisation such as this, concerned with reform in the field of secondary education, should be treated in this manner: but the way in which this association has been treated is a matter upon which this House should comment, and comment adversely.  The Minister, in the course of the discussion that took place on the questions asked here on 13th <Col N="285" /> December last, rather paternally suggested that Deputy Byrne and I did not know what we were supporting; a sort of vague implication was left that this Federation had in some way hoodwinked the Deputies who had raised this matter; they were a body which Deputies should not have supported by tabling questions and asking supplementaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne and I both know this association.  We know the Federation. We know what we are supporting. This is a body of experienced men concerned to improve education in this country, willing to work in the interests of secondary education, and to make available to the Minister and his Department, and to the public, the benefit of their knowledge, their attitudes and their experience.  That is the association we are supporting by raising this matter here this evening.</P>
    <P>The issues raised on this motion are not just the Federation and the affairs of the Registration Council.  We are concerned to see that any voluntary organisation, be it this one or any other, which takes part in public affairs, can do so without its motives being impugned.  We are concerned to see that any voluntary organisation, including this one, may criticise, if necessary, a Government Department without being insulted for doing so. We are concerned to see that any voluntary organisation, including this one, can advocate reform of education, or any branch of government, without being treated contumeliously. That is the reason we have moved that this Order be set aside.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello has made his case here, and made it well.  That is his <i>metier.</i> I have no doubt that any case can be well made.  I do not want to give the impression of having a personal quarrel with any group within the educational system.  Neither do I think it appropriate to list what I consider to be the differences which <Col N="286" /> arise between me and any particular group.  All the associations dealing with education have from time to time sharp differences with the Minister for Education.  Very seldom do these come into the open.  Nevertheless, they exist, but differences of opinion would never motivate me in my dealings with an organisation.</P>
      <P>We will look to the record now and to the facts of the case.  I have no contact with this group, or any other school group, except as Minister.  I have no feelings about these groups except my feeling of responsibility to the public.  I am, I think, the only person who is responsible to the public and who has to answer here for that responsibility.  I doubt if any group, large or small, can say that they are responsible to the extent that I am. It is my responsibility to the public which motivates me in any action I take.</P>
      <P>This school association, entitled the Federation of Catholic Lay Secondary Schools, was recognised in 1958 by the then Minister for Education as an association for the purpose of the normal negotiations which take place between my Department and secondary school associations.  In 1959, following on that recognition, the group was admitted to membership of the Secondary Teachers Registration Council. Last year, when this group, one out of some seven or eight, had endeavoured unsuccessfully to get other groups to join with them in a federation of the associations representing secondary school owners, it decided to take to itself the title of &ldquo;Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.&rdquo;  It did not succeed in getting any of the other groups to join in this.  As one group out of seven or eight, it arrogated to itself this title.  It represents about one-tenth of the secondary schools, about one-twentieth in terms of student numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be no question of my recognising an association of that size under a misleading title, and this certainly was a misleading title.  It was obvious to me during the debate on the Estimates that many Deputies thought that this group represented all the secondary school associations.  As far as <Col N="287" /> memory serves me, many Deputies seemed to think that it represented even the secondary school teachers. There could be no question of my recognising this Federation under such a misleading title.</P>
    <P>When I made it clear in a letter to this group that I would not recognise them under the title &ldquo;Federation of Irish Secondary Schools,&rdquo; they purported to withdraw themselves from recognition.  I might mention that all the major secondary school associations object quite strongly to the Federation purporting to be the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  That is the reason I withdrew recognition. This title is misleading.  It is unacceptable to me and my responsibility to the public demands that I do not recognise this group under a misleading title.</P>
    <P>The questions Deputy Byrne asked before Christmas were so arranged that those relating to my withdrawal of recognition were down side by side with the questions relating to a document purporting to be a study of investment in education in Ireland.  Deputy Costello, and others in the public press, have associated the withdrawal of recognition with the publication of this document.  The fact is that I had notified the Association before the publication of the document of my intention not to recognise it.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this document again, I am running into the danger of confusing the reason why I withdrew recognition from the Association.  I refused to recognise this Association under the misleading title and not because of the publication of any document.  Perhaps now I can go on to say something about the document and the attempt to link it with this withdrawal.  An attempt has been made to link the two together and I should like to deal with that.  Regarding this document, as I said, the people were not competent to do this study. This is not meant to represent them as incompetent in their own spheres, nor would I intend it to mean that I have no respect for their energy and enthusiasm.  A study of the economics of education is quite a big task and, as I told Deputies before, we have, in association with OECD, a study group of economists and statisticians doing this work at the moment.  I think economists and statisticians are the competent people to deal with investment in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The group was, of course, set up for this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is continuous publicity on behalf of this Association. I do not want to seem to quarrel with them.  The study group is of OECD origin and had taken origin before the publication of the association's document. I think I referred to this at Question Time once before.  I do not want to make too little of the document but there are errors of fact in it. Deputy Costello asks for some of the facts.  It is not easy to give them in such a way that people will understand them.  In arriving at the cost, they were dealing with the money made available to secondary schools and money available for vocational schools.  In reckoning cost, they took an hourly cost for part-time students in a vocational school as being the same as an hourly cost for a full-time day pupil.  Anybody with any knowledge of vocational <Col N="289" /> schools will realise that because of the technical nature of the classes and other considerations, the cost per hour of educating a part-time pupil is much higher than that for a full-time pupil. In making the calculation of cost per pupil in secondary and vocational schools, they divided the sum allowed for such education by the total enrolment in secondary schools, but, in vocational schools, by the average attendance.  This would give a figure which would not lend itself to comparison.</P>
      <P>In Table 1 of the document, which seemed to impress many people they quoted figures for the 15 to 19 age group and expressed them as a ratio of children who were mainly in the 11 to 15 years group.  This is quite wrong. People of the 11 to 15 age group cannot be put into the 15 to 19 age group. The result was that in the table for England and Wales a ratio of 88 was shown.  The value of that information can be judged by Deputies when I tell them that the present percentage of the 15 to 16 age group, for all types of schools in England and Wales, is about 30.  The corresponding percentage here is around 50.  I do not want to go into too much detail on this document.  It required study here by educationists and statisticians and it took a lot of time as it contains a lot of figures and was quite misleading.</P>
      <P>The only thing I felt strongly about at any time was that this document in the process of showing that secondary schools are not getting as much as vocational schools presented a false picture of education in Ireland.  It was sent abroad as if an official document and this is not a fair way of dealing with figures before they are checked. I feel this was an irresponsible act.  I did say to Deputy Costello and Deputy Byrne that they do not seem to realise what they are supporting.  I do not think the Deputies would like to have a false picture, and one which discredits this country, circulated abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could say a lot more in dealing with this.  I repeat that I will not recognise this Association under a misleading title.  To explain any strong feelings I might have had, I would mention <Col N="290" /> that the distribution abroad of a document with many errors of omission, calculation or commission was an act of, to say the least of it, irresponsibility and can do a great deal of harm.  The letter stating that I would withdraw recognition was sent on 18th April and their proof was sent on 10th May, not on 16th April.  Deputy Costello thought it was sent before my letter went out.</P>

      <P>The Minister, speaking in the House on the 13th December, made it clear, as he also did a few moments ago, what his real worry about the organisation was when they started circulating this document.  In the Official Report, column 1447, the Minister states:</P>
      <P>My real worry about this organisation was when they started writing&mdash;without authority and without letting anyone know&mdash;to European and American organisations showing up this country in a bad light.</P>
      <P>The facts show up this country in a bad light.  The basic facts in the report cannot be controverted.</P>

      <P>Facts such as those set out at Table 10 of the report make it clear that, out of State funds, we, in this country, spend £6 per inhabitant per year on educational purposes, as compared with twice that sum spent per inhabitant in Northern Ireland and three times that sum spent in Scotland. These are the realities of the Irish educational set-up.  There are no grants to build secondary schools, where you can obtain from the State a grant to build a factory, or to erect a pigsty or cow stalls.  These fundamental realities cannot be controverted if the Minister were to sit here till Doomsday.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant is very much less than half the cost of educating a child in a secondary school.  That fact has been shown up in this report and cannot be contradicted.  I invite the Minister to take a glance at any table in the report.  Appended to each is a footnote in which he will see the source of the statistics set out therein, unimpeachable international sources, publications of the United Nations and of the Council of Europe and, as far as this country is concerned, statistics taken from the annual report of the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>The body presided over by Mr. Lynch, the economist, was set up subsequent to the publication of this document.  It appears to me&mdash;I do not wish to be discourteous to the Minister when I say this&mdash;that the official mind of the Department of Education is that outside interests, members of the public and so on, should keep their mouths shut and leave the formulation of educational policy to those custodians of our national heritage who would choose, if they could, to lay down an educational system completely out of accord with the times we are living in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for radical reform in our educational system.  The public are growing sick and tired of gymkhanas and fashion shows, penny raffles and sixpenny pools, being resorted to for the purpose of financing educational development.  If I were to <Col N="292" /> elaborate on that particular line, the Chair would probably restrain me.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered Deputy D. Costello's charge that the style and title of the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools is not one whit more misleading than the style and title of three other educational associations which have been recognised by his Department for many years past.  We have the Irish Schoolmasters' Association, a title which is not strictly accurate, as it includes in its membership only the headmasters of Protestant secondary schools.  The Catholic Headmasters' Association is another title which is not strictly accurate, as it includes only the clerical headmasters of certain Catholic secondary schools.  Indeed, most of the recognised associations have titles which a pedant could quibble over.</P>
      <P>At this stage in the development of education here, it is not right or proper to quibble about the style or title of any association of teachers or of headmasters. There are far more serious and more urgent problems to be considered in the educational field than the title taken by the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools, a body which, as Deputy D. Costello pointed out, has always been most courteous in its dealings with the Minister, and with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Lynch.  Yet, in reply to their representations last January about the qualifications for extension of secondary schools, the Minister stated that they were dealing with them in an arrogant manner.  As I said a few moments ago when Deputies express out of the ordinary views in the educational field, they are told that they are being arrogant and are overstepping the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, if he has not already learned will learn very shortly that there is a mass of seething unrest and discontent amongst parents of this country in regard to the education of their children and in regard to the lack of opportunity.  As regards the system of education which we have, it is riddled with class distinctions of one kind or another.  In so far as the <Col N="293" /> Federation of Irish Secondary Schools have highlighted some of these anomalies, they have done a very good day's work for which they should be commended and congratulated.  I would say this&mdash;I would go this far with the Minister&mdash;that if there is any criticism which can be made, the major fault is excess of zeal and enthusiasm.  The Minister has not at all justified his stand to remove recognition from this Association and in the interest of advancing the cause of education in this country, we in the Fine Gael Party would urge him to review his decision.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Opposition to this matter has already been clarified by previous speakers on this side of the House, but it is no <Col N="294" /> harm to say that the Opposition, like the Government, must keep in mind the employment that will be given in a project such as this.  It is their function in public, as it is the Government's function in private, to examine analytically and with the most critical eye the question of whether or not the costs are to be greater to the Irish farmers as a result of Nítrigin Éireann being set up.</P>
      <P>I wish this project well.  The Government without the vote of this House, proceeded to place contracts and, therefore, as never before in any other case that I know of, responsibility lies directly with the Government and not with Parliament.  The Leader of the Opposition made that clear to the Minister and gave the opportunity to him, when replying, to accept that responsibility.  The Minister, and the Government through him, will then have the pleasure of saying that the project will not in any way impede the opportunity of the Irish farmer to get his goods and his raw materials at as cheap a price as he can and sell his finished product as well as anybody else at prices similar to those obtaining in world markets, where he must compete.</P>
      <P>The information given to us is scanty; it is sketchy.  It is skeleton information which tells us no more than that which we could possibly get in any reference book on such a product. While the information is sketchy, it is valuable and I do not want in any way to be excessively critical of the project.  I do think it is necessary from this side of the House to draw attention to certain facts in relation to the raw materials.  The raw materials for this enterprise are comprised of oil, sulphur, power, money, men and presumably labour and will not be any more expensive here.  In my opinion, it will be, on the average, of better quality than anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst there is a slump of sulphur on the world market at the moment, there is no guarantee that it will continue. For each ton of sulphate of ammonia used a quarter-ton of sulphur is used so that we are at the mercy of the world market.  The price at which we get it is very often not the price <Col N="295" /> at which our competitors get it.  The buyers of our finished products may also be the sellers of our raw materials. That was very true of the production of steel up to the time of the idea of the European Coal and Steel Community. You had the situation whereby those who manufactured steel would further process it themselves at one price and sell it to their competitors at a different price and put them out of the market.</P>
    <P>If you take sulphur, we are in the position of a buyer who must buy from somebody else.  That is even more true in the case of oil.  We have a figure given us of one-fifth of a ton of oil or about 450 lbs. of oil, and at 10 lbs. to the gallon, we get 45 gallons of oil.  Whether it is in the making of sulphate of ammonia or calcium ammonium nitrate or anything else, a difference of 1/- a gallon in the cost of oil can make a difference of £2 5s. 0d. per ton in the cost of the product.  That is not a savage criticism on my part but it is an expression of fact that cannot be refuted.  I am assuming that ordinary oil that can be sold without tax at 1/6d. a gallon will be used and in that case, it is unlikely that we would get the difference of 1/- a gallon, but if you went as far as America or any place where oil is processed, then I am certain that that shilling would be there and that it would offset the cost of shipping the nitrogenous fertilisers here.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of power. Power is going to be used to the extent of about £200,000 worth.  You can take your pick of how much of that will be manufactured from oil, peat or water. We have come to the end of our opportunities for the production of electricity from water power and are proceeding with the other two.  If the power is to be manufactured from oil, we are completely dependent on imported raw material.  The Minister did not give us any comparison between the proposed factory at Arklow and factories elsewhere in the matter of size.  He did not say that the normal factory elsewhere has twice the capacity of our factory, that it has the same capacity or that other factories have five times <Col N="296" /> the capacity or any such figure.  I think he should have given us those facts.  It would give us a better indication as to whether this will be as viable a project as is suggested.</P>
    <P>As far as this side of the House are concerned, we are as solicitous of the welfare of those who lost their jobs in Avoca as the Government or perhaps more so.  That is one of the things that condition our approval of this scheme, an approval that might be described as conditional.  We have approved of this project on the basis that the Government and the Minister accept full responsibility for it.  If we envisage an expenditure of £6 million for the employment of 300 people, it is easy to calculate that the cost per person is £20,000.  If we invested that money at 6 per cent. each worker could stay at home and draw £1,200 a year without getting rid of any of the capital.</P>
    <P>That is not the proper way to look at it because the cost of the employment of people can range from £1,000 to the figures that have been put before us but it is true that the expenditure here, relative to the employment produced, is of a very high nature.  While one could not say that it tends towards automation or anything like that, which has more reference to the assembly business than a project such as this, it is a very high figure, a figure of such a height that other very great advantages would be needed to justify it.  Money is not plentiful in this country.  Capital money for investment for the employment of our people is extremely scarce and a sum which if invested at 6 per cent. could produce the income I have mentioned, is a high figure of investment in an employment-giving project.</P>
    <P>However, you cannot look at it in that way.  The people in Avoca have lost their jobs and if this is to help in providing employment, if it is not to be a loss, if everything said about it is correct, then there is nothing done that should be undone and we will have helped the economy of our country in every way.</P>
    <P>The White Paper issued by the Minister seems over-anxious to justify the expenditure.  It is quite clear that the <Col N="297" /> expenditure is extremely high, even when we see, in paragraph 14 of the explanatory memorandum, that there will be a new market for two million sacks per annum.  The cost of a paper sack to hold a cwt. of nitrogen is about 1/- and it is an easy calculation to work out that two million sacks would result in a turnover of £20,000, so that we are talking, in connection with a project of this size, in terms of the turnover of a publichouse and grocery.</P>

      <P>I notice that the amount which the Minister for Finance <Col N="298" /> holds as share capital is extremely small.  I asked a Parliamentary Question yesterday as to what would be the position in the Common Market in relation to State-sponsored bodies and the repayment of capital and interest.  I got the answer that, as far as share capital was concerned, we could proceed without any limitation, but if there was a question of a loan, that matter would have to be examined under Article 93 of the Rome Treaty and that pending such examination, the Minister could not say whether or not such would be obligatory.  We on this side of the House must seek rather the same undertakings as the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association sought at page 21 of their memorandum. I quote from the memorandum:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That their finding&rdquo;&mdash;that finding was in favour of the project&mdash;&ldquo;is subject to the following two reservations: that the ICMSA seek from the Government an unequivocal assurance that in the unlikely event of the factory coming into financial difficulties these difficulties will be resolved by direct State assistance rather than by any interference whatever with the Irish farmers' right to buy nitrogenous fertilisers from the cheapest available source.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have here an answer to a Parliamentary Question which says that the Minister for Finance does not know whether or not, if the factory is going badly, he will be in a position to waive interest and repayment.</P>
      <P>The Rome Treaty would specifically forbid him to subsidise this fertiliser as long as the fertiliser was coming in from abroad, as that would be unfair competition.  How can he give this unequivocal assurance?  It is all extremely difficult and, if we are in the EEC, we may be in a position wherein we will be selling only one-tenth of the produce of this factory at home because, if the ports are free, is it not true to say that the distributive organisations, the large seed wholesalers and importers, will establish links with nitrogen factories in Britain and on the Continent and bring in nitrogen here, nitrogen which will be sold presumably at the same price as the home product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> If the home product, without subsidy from the Government, cannot hold its own, then the producers are out of production.  But if they can just break even, I would suggest that, if all the different wholesale seed organisations in the country, such as the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society, and others I do not wish to mention, all make their different links with the three or four different manufacturing bodies outside this country, is it not true that they will all take their slice of the trade, and we will not all be so patriotic as to insist on buying Irish nitrogen?  They will all take their slice of the trade, and we will have to export.  If we have to export, are we capable of doing it at the same price?  If we have to export, will we be given sulphur and oil at prices which will allow us to export?  Will the numbers employed be such that we will be in a position to produce at the proper price?  These are the questions which the inadequate information given poses and it is in no spirit of condemnation that I pose them from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a figure for employment. Salaries and wages, the annual outlay, are shown as £200,000 to £250,000. That seems small because there is a figure quoted of 300 employees and, if you divide 300 into that figure, or into somewhere between the two figures you get a wage of about £8 per week; but if you refer to the ICMSA memorandum on the subject, you find that there are about 50 out of the 300 who will be technicians, chemists, engineers, and all the rest of it.  I would calculate that these 50 would have, at a minimum, double £8 per week.  If that is correct, what wage then will the others have?  Or is this figure correct?</P>
    <P>These are the questions we have to put to the Minister.  We do not like being difficult; we do not think we are being difficult in this matter.  This is something that has been examined many times before.  The Minister now comes along and says: &ldquo;My experts tell me it is now all right; it can be done.&rdquo;  I think the Opposition are going very far when we say: &ldquo;Very well; <Col N="300" /> we accept this, but we want the Minister's solemn assurance; that is all we are asking for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition quoted Paragraph 27 of the explanatory memorandum. I should like to quote it again:</P>
    <P>As already stated, however, the Government is fully satisfied that this industry can make nitrogenous fertilisers available without subsidisation or protection, at prices at least as favourable as the present import prices.</P>
    <P>That is all we ask.  There is, of course, the other eventuality.  If we do not get into the Common Market, and we have to remain outside it, will we still be in a position to get the dumped nitrogenous fertiliser from within the Common Market which it is suggested we are getting at the moment?</P>
    <P>Again, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association memorandum suggests there is over-production of nitrogen &mdash; slight over-production &mdash; in Europe at the moment.  If that is so, and if we want to unload a little outside the Common Market, not being permitted to do it within, will we then be in the position that we will be precluded, either by tariff or quota, from enjoying that dumped nitrogen?  These are the problems.  I am not trying to pull this down.  There are 300 jobs. We have made our decision.  We support the Government, but we ask the Government to accept full responsibility; we would not ask the Government to accept full responsibility if the Government had given us all the details we require.  They have not been forthcoming.  It is a case of &ldquo;over to you&rdquo; now.  The Government have the responsibility and it is our duty to point that out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Norton who commented earlier on controversy over important measures such as this.  He was not very far out when he said that the magnitude of the controversy this Bill has aroused, is a measure of its importance. The amount of controversy that has taken place is an indication of its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the positive point of view, <Col N="301" /> what is the purpose of this project? The purpose is to provide material for increasing the productivity of our own land.  That in itself would justify the project, were it not for the fact that there is the possibility of supplying that deficiency by importing fertiliser. The question then is whether it is desirable to depend on imported fertiliser or to produce it here ourselves. Up to this, the answer to that, in the economic context in which we live, has been a very simple one.  If trade is in your favour, then go on trading. But what do you do when trade turns against you?  I think it was overall considerations of that nature that led successive Governments, and the many people who thought about the matter, to the conclusion that it was desirable, highly desirable, to make the effort to produce fertiliser here at home and only serious price obstacles should be allowed to block the project.  The situation was very similar to the situation in regard to our trade generally since we tried to strike out for ourselves in this community.</P>
    <P>My own interest stems from the experience gained in the last Emergency. There was an acute need for chemicals here.  We were practically in isolation at the time.  The approach to the problem was through the lessons learned at that time as to what can happen when we are deficient in basic chemicals and basic chemical industries.  That seemed to be further reinforced by the example of what could be done in other countries, countries with territories comparable with ours, to supply such deficiencies.  It was for that reason also that this project appeared attractive because not only did it appear to be a project which was aimed at increasing productivity in our fundamental industry but it offered us a hope&mdash; indeed, it seemed the only hope&mdash;of building some semblance of chemical industry to supply some of our other chemical needs.</P>
    <P>On another occasion here, I outlined, I think, how such industries would naturally be associated with a fertiliser industry.  I need not repeat my arguments now.  I should like to say, however, that the dual experience of the Emergency Research Bureau during <Col N="302" /> the war in regard to explosives, on the one hand, and certain other fundamental chemicals, on the other, all pointed towards the need for creating a chemical industry here; and the only way to create it would have been by setting up a fertiliser industry here.  It is from that point of view that I personally became interested in the subject.  That was approximately 20 years ago.  Before that, there had been a consideration of the problem both from the point of view of an explosives factory for the Defence Forces and also from the point of view of a fertiliser factory. For various reasons, the project had not matured before war broke out.  One of the reasons was an argument that is still continuing, an argument as to whether ammonium sulphate is a fertiliser of lasting value.  Whatever the reasons were, the project did not materialise.  During the war, on more than one occasion, we had reason to regret that something had not been done.  After the war, therefore, determined efforts were made to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Now we must be realistic about this. Technology is not static.  During the course of the examination of this problem, there have been developments in techniques.  There have been changes.  I should imagine it was difficult for the experts who examined this within the past ten years to make decisions, for the simple reason that there were very large developments linked with the use of hydrocarbon oils and gases in the basic synthesis in this process as against the solid fuels. That fact alone explains why&mdash;it may seem serious to some people&mdash;it was necessary to change the proposals, apparently radically, within the past few years.  I think it no harm to mention that aspect of the matter here, because of two questions asked earlier in the debate.  One was&mdash;if it was not asked explicitly, it was certainly implied&mdash;why the change?  There was reference to the change of plans.  Why the change from peat?  The other reference&mdash;I think it was by Deputy Norton&mdash;was as to what other industries could be based on the fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>The answers to these questions are <Col N="303" /> tied up with a rather spectacular development in the technology of using natural and fuel gases for such purposes. In passing, I would mention, in answer to Deputy Norton, that there is even the possibility of synthetic rubber, plastics, and industries of that nature, associated with the turn-over to the gas process proposed here as distinct from a solid fuel process using peat.  However, that is one of the things naturally associated with developments of this nature.  I shall not be surprised if, even before the factory is finally completed, there are some further improvements in technique which it may be possible for us to incorporate.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect in particular to which we should advert here.  One cannot be absolutely final and definite in technical proposals of this nature. The Minister, or anybody else, has no guarantee that some new circumstance of a technical nature, apart from the economic side of it, may not intervene and make it necessary for us to make further adjustments.  I think it is only right that should be said on this occasion.  I have already instanced the development in technology by the use of fuel and natural gases.  Originally one thought of producing the ammonia, using peat as one of the processes in making the hydrogen. Now the situation is different.  We have no guarantee that circumstances may not again intervene, but, if one waits until there is an end of development, or until one thinks one has the last word, then one will wait for ever, and do nothing.</P>
    <P>We should be clear, I think, that we are dealing with a practical problem. We have to make a business decision here.  One cannot guarantee that one has absolute certainty and finality for all time at any stage in such a project as this.  The &ldquo;have-it-both-ways&rdquo; attitude of Fine Gael, if the last speaker's attitude is to be taken as interpreting the Fine Gael attitude, may be politically clever, but it is certainly neither a realistic nor a practical way in which to approach a problem like this.  A decision must be made.  The Party opposite should face the situation. <Col N="304" /> They have to make a decision too; they either support it or they reject it.  It is not exactly appropriate, to say the least of it, to try to straddle both sides of the fence.  The decision is not that simple.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this project has been, as the Minister said, thoroughly examined. Proposals have been adjusted to date.  There has been a long enough period of examination to permit of a reasonable prognostication of the future, but nobody can guarantee that some new factory may not intervene. The same argument holds good in relation to the question of price.  I will not attempt to guess at what Common Market conditions could mean in this sphere.  I still instinctively feel that, if we can produce fertiliser here for our own farmers and achieve stability in that way, that is a good thing anyway.  I will not attempt to analyse a situation that to date is not capable of analysis.  I am sure that is a factor that has been taken into account in the various Departments involved because it is only such Departments, with the full information available to them, which can, as the Minister said, really make a rational estimate on so broad a basis as that involved here.</P>
    <P>Again, since this House has the right to direct these things and will assume its responsibilities in this matter, it is only fair to say that there are possibilities.  For instance, there has been a rumour of a huge strike of natural oil somewhere on the Continent. That could significantly affect prices.  I am sure all these things have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to say&mdash;this is a purely personal opinion, and I make no apology for it&mdash;our agricultural industry is so important, and the basic production from the land is so important, that, looking at the quantities involved, the sums likely to be involved should not be prohibitive. If I were put to the test, I should not hesitate to make moneys available for this project even if it involved something in the nature of long-term loans, or something like subsidy.  This industry is of such importance to the <Col N="305" /> farmers, to the country generally, and to all of us that, if it were necessary, we should be prepared to subsidise it. That is my personal view.  I am stating it simply because I happen to be a city man and I think city people and townspeople generally do realise the importance of the farming community to us and the importance of the farmer's place in the community and his production for the community.  I believe everybody should be prepared to co-operate with the farmer in getting efficient production.  As I say, that is my own opinion.  I stress that and say that, if anyone is to be beaten with that stick, it should be I.  It is I who am responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I do not stress the defence aspect of this.  Fifteen years ago, I would have made a strong case for this factory on the basis that it would provide us with certain reserves of explosives and food resources in time of war.  The defence situation has changed in the 15 years and that statement may seem somewhat naive now.  I do not base my case tonight on it, but I think it is always sound policy to be conscious, at least, of provisions that may come to one's aid in time of emergency.  In time of emergency an industry of this nature would be of great value to us.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the matter about which, from a technical point of view, I am not completely happy.  It goes back to the 1930s.  It is the question of the manufacture of ammonium sulphate.  This has been so discussed that it has, I am afraid, prompted a partisan following on both sides.  I want to avoid that if I can, but I think we should examine the question from a number of points of view.  First of all, let us admit&mdash;this is a big economic factor in the situation&mdash;that the Irish farmer is traditionally, as the Minister stated, wedded to ammonium sulphate and, if the consumption of nitrogenous fertiliser went up, the consumption of ammonium sulphate went up, as well as the consumption of calcium ammonium nitrate.  It could be argued the Irish farmer still wants ammonium sulphate.  Maybe he does.  Maybe that is tradition.  But we should not lose <Col N="306" /> sight of certain facts.  The first is that in other countries, in progressive agricultural countries, ammonium sulphate has given way to more efficient nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The second factor is&mdash;it is one I shall deal with more deeply in a moment &mdash; that ammonium sulphate from the point of view of active fertiliser is relatively inefficient.  The third one, something that is not to be lost sight of, is that if the farmer and fashion abroad lean towards fertilisers such as ammonium nitrates of some sort or urea, then the manufacture of ammonium sulphate may go down. If importation is free, we gradually come over to the new fashions and ammonium sulphate will go out, even amongst the Irish farmers.  These are three factors which should be taken into account in deciding to make ammonium sulphate here and the proportion in which we make it.</P>
    <P>I will repeat the point I want to develop, which is the actual efficiency and usefulness of ammonium sulphate. The Irish farmer has a tradition in this matter and in order to deal with this, perhaps I might be allowed to digress a little on the process.  There is no question on the manufacture of the ammonia.  It will be made by a process which depends on getting hydrogen from the fuel used and the nitrogen of the air.  It is the nitrogen in the ammonia which is active; it is a question of how to supply it and get it into the soil.</P>
    <P>There are two traditional ways of doing that.  One is to take ammonia with sulphuric acid and put it into the soil.  In that case, the sulphate is acting as a carrier and it has so much dead weight&mdash;something like 36 parts of the weight is active ammonia out of a total of 132 parts.  The rest is merely carrier.  This is ammonium sulphate, but the sulphate is merely a carrier as far as I understand and has no fertiliser value.</P>
    <P>There is another way of using the ammonia, that is to turn some of the ammonia into nitric acid and use the nitric acid as carrier, in which case the nitrogen in the nitric acid is available <Col N="307" /> also and there is a bigger availability of nitrogen.</P>
    <P>Pure ammonium nitrate has its particular peculiarities.  Five years ago, I would have asked for it because it was explosive.  It is not as important a factor now and therefore I will not press that aspect.  I will admit that concentrated ammonium nitrate has certain disadvantages from the handling point of view but where limestone and lime have to be used you can get calcium ammonium sulphate or a mixture of that sort.  We are providing in this factory for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate and nitrate fertilisers in various forms.  That is desirable, but I would ask the question as to whether we should not face the issue now, as to whether we should build on the basis that ammonium sulphate will fade out and will be substituted by a more efficient modern fertiliser of, say, the ammonium nitrate type or even possibly urea.</P>
    <P>I am raising that question here now for two reasons.  First, I am not satisfied with the Department of Agriculture traditional view, as I understand it.  I admit there is a problem here when the farmers are preferentially buying it but there is also a long-term problem here.  It might clear the air, if the view I have expressed here is wrong, if some authoritative statement on the value of ammonium sulphate, as compared with these other fertilisers, should come unequivocally from some such body as the Agricultural Research Institute.  I think the air would be cleared if we got a definitive statement from the agricultural experts. We have an Agricultural Institute, with a Director and all the rest, and a statement from them might, for one thing, stop people from speaking about such subjects without full information.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that is something which should be finally disposed of one way or another so that we may know where we stand.  Will we take an inefficient fertiliser merely because the Irish farmer will insist on buying it, or will we have a change for the better? Is it the right fertiliser to make?  On top of that, I again make the point in order to indicate that there may be <Col N="308" /> changes in development here.  We should be prepared to accept this Bill and the proposals in it to have this factory set up on the basis proposed and have an open mind with regard to development which will follow.</P>
    <P>Unless there is some good agricultural reason&mdash;not merely a traditional reason&mdash;to justify ammonia sulphate as a fertiliser, we should, while commencing in that way, be able to turn our production, so far as nitrogenous fertilisers are concerned, in other directions.  I do not think that would be a complete loss.  Ammonia sulphate is the result of a process in which you use sulphuric acid and the ammonia as manufactured otherwise. Sulphuric acid is a commodity which can be turned to several uses and a sulphuric acid plant would be one of the basic essentials of a chemical industry.</P>
    <P>What I am saying should affect our approach.  It is a subject which has bedevilled this project right from the beginning.  Some effort should be made at this stage to be definite about our outlook on it.  A relatively inefficient fertiliser, more than 50 per cent. of which is useless matter, is being put into the earth at the same time as you are putting in the useful nitrogen.  It may be that there is some virtue in the other that I do not know about.  If there is, let us be told about it and let the project be justified on that basis. The Agricultural Institute should make a definite statement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Experts whom I have spoken to maintain that ammonia sulphate is inefficient in that the sulphate half has little or no value in the soil.  If that is the position and that we are basing this on what the Irish farmer has traditionally bought, I am wondering whether the proper thing would be to win the Irish farmer over to a more efficient fertiliser rather than to produce the less efficient one just because he wants it.  I have strong views on it in so far as I am entitled to them.  I should like to emphasise again for our purposes here that that argument does not affect the validity of the proposals as a whole.  The fundamental things in this factory remain the same.  I would <Col N="309" /> hope, as a matter of fact, that it would form possibly the nucleus of a chemical industry for us.  Where you have ammonia sulphate or ammonium nitrate a sulphuric acid plant will have its own advantages.  We should undertake a sulphuric acid plant unless existing installations are wholly adequate. Our social reasons for not using the pyrites are eliminated.  There is a lot to be said for using straightforward sulphur from the point of view of a sulphuric acid factory.</P>
    <P>Is it a dream to hope that other basic element in a chemical industry may grow up here some day?  It is not directly associated with the fertiliser industry, but a chlorine plant, for instance, and other chemical installations may give us an opportunity to develop this community industrially. We need some kind of equivalence with the others in the environment in which we may find ourselves.  There are certain advantages in this island site. There may be possibilities in such industries for us, apart from our uses at home.  For that reason, apart from the basic reason for this industry, I welcome this proposal.  I am glad to say that this Minister has brought in at least a practical proposal and that we now have a Bill before us to implement this proposal.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be necessary to refer to a number of things which were said about this proposal.  The Minister has quite adequately answered those who attacked him about the site. The picking of a site for an industry of this nature is always a difficult matter. I think everybody is satisfied with the choice as ultimately made here. The objections that were put forward to the site are not in the same class as the economic objections urged at the beginning.</P>
    <P>There is one small point in regard to the title of the Bill which, to the mind of a chemist, might be a little confusing.  Why spell Nitrogen, in the Irish title, &ldquo;Nitrigin&rdquo;.  It is not an Irish word.  The general word &ldquo;Nitrogen&rdquo; is a coined word with a Greek or Latin ending, &ldquo;gen&rdquo; having the same root as &ldquo;generated&rdquo;.  It was called Nitrogen in English because it <Col N="310" /> generated nitrate.  The French have a word of their own for the element, but Nitrogen is internationally accepted, and the syllable &ldquo;gen&rdquo; has a meaning. I object on technical grounds, because chemists are wont to use vowels for specific purposes.</P>
    <P>Why not call it in Irish &ldquo;Nitrogen&rdquo;? Is there any justification for turning &ldquo;Nitrogen&rdquo; into &ldquo;Nitrigin&rdquo;?  We should be able to talk about chemical subjects in Irish.  However, if we are going to take the terms and change them in such a way that there is a danger of confusion in the chemical nomenclature it will benefit none.</P>
    <P>It is in order to make that point here.  I do not see why it could not be &ldquo;Nitrogen Teoranta&rdquo;.  It would be different if we had a new word of our own.  The French have a word of their own for it.  If I could translate it into &ldquo;ábhar nitrate&rdquo; or something like that, that would be fair enough.  That would be a fair translation.  It is only a small point but if you are dealing with chemical nomenclatures, in the language of chemistry, words have very significant meanings.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say.  I think I can claim to have had some little knowledge of, and an interest in, this subject for some 15 years.  I know from my own personal experience that even the enthusiasts were careful to weigh the pros and cons.</P>
    <P>On that note, I should like to join with the Minister in his tribute to one of the great Irish scientists of our time, Professor Wheeler, who died recently. I had the privilege of working with him during the Emergency and I knew his thoughts on this subject rather well. We often discussed them and I know the care with which he personally went into this matter.  I know he was a man who was very careful and critical about these things.  I think this is an appropriate occasion on which to pay a tribute, as the Minister has done, to his memory.  He was one of those Irishmen who had a deep scientific and technical knowledge with the optimistic driving outlook that gets things done, and who believed that we could, and would, develop in this country.  Apart from the work which he did in this <Col N="311" /> field he re-created his own Department, and met the challenge of the times and was building further.  It is a great tragedy at this stage to have lost such a man and I should like to join with the Minister in paying a tribute to his memory.  Indeed, I know that the work which he did is bearing fruit and, when this fertiliser factory goes into production, it will be in a sense a monument to his thinking in the initial stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know where to begin in connection with this matter.  I will just quote a few words to follow a certain line in connection with it.  It is stated in the explanatory memorandum:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed a Committee to examine the economics of a factory to compete freely, without protection or subsidisation, with imports and to meet the Irish farmers' requirements of nitrogenous fertilisers at prices in line with the prevailing import prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A good deal of the publicity and anxiety associated with the proposed establishment of this factory comes from a feeling amongst the farming community that if, and when, this industry gets going it will not be able to compete with the huge factories on the Continent producing nitrogenous fertilisers at competitive prices.</P>
      <P>We saw the other day that the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association gave their blessing to this proposal, but, having given their blessing to it, they immediately asked for an assurance, if this proposed industry folded up, that the farming community would not be required to contribute towards the losses involved.  Whether they like it or not, whatever the costs in connection with this industry may be, the farmers are the people who will be primarily concerned.  In the production of agricultural products, having regard to our agricultural economy, whatever projects come to the wall it is eventually the basic economy that must meet the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned in this memorandum that the farmers have been <Col N="312" /> enjoying very favourable prices for nitrogenous fertilisers during the past four years.  However, the memorandum says, in connection with this proposal, that these import prices cannot be controlled.  We have to accept the rise and the fall in prices that may occur outside the country.  However, there seems to be terrific competition amongst fertiliser firms on the Continent and they appear to be anxious to sell at very competitive and favourable prices to those who are prepared to use their fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The Table given to us here shows that the Irish farmer is becoming more conscious of the value of nitrogenous fertilisers and, of course, sulphur of ammonia, which has been the traditional fertiliser so far as the farmer is concerned.  The Table shows that farmers are moving more and more towards the use of these fertilisers because they are getting results.  The comparison between this country, Great Britain and the Continent in the use of fertilisers is fantastic.  There is a very small proportion, or if you like, tonnage, per acre used in this country.  The Table here shows that the farming community are becoming conscious of the real value to them, in connection with agricultural production, of using nitrogenous fertilisers. As the memorandum has said, we can look forward to a greater consumption.</P>
    <P>While we have this proposal before us we are not being given any guarantee by the Government, or by the Minister, that the prices here will be competitive.  We are not being given any guarantee, by reason of the fact that it is to be located in the country, that they will be able to compete and keep out the imported fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would read my speech he would see that undertaking given no fewer than three or four times.  I do not know why he should make that statement now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just turned to one part of the memorandum.  As I mentioned earlier, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers gave this project their blessing and at the same time they said that if this proposal does collapse they <Col N="313" /> should not be asked to make any contribution towards it.  At the moment this organisation are crying out loud regarding the prices being paid to them for their milk.  The use of nitrogenous fertilisers in connection with pastures is very important.  Certainly, if the price of them goes any higher the cry amongst the milk producers will be still greater because it will cut further into their milk costings.  That aspect of it does not seem to have been taken into consideration.  As I say, they are clamouring for this increase in the price of milk but the price the farmers pay for the fertilisers is going to be very important.</P>
      <P>I consider that this is a basic industry. It is one in respect of which there will be a local demand.  Our economy is mainly agricultural and we will require these nitrogenous fertilisers at an economic price for the improvement of the land and in association with our production, mainly in relation to pasture.  It has been shown already that as far as exports from this country are concerned, meat and milk products seem to be most in demand and the use of nitrogenous fertilisers on our pastures will help the output of meat and milk.</P>
      <P>There has been some dispute about the location of the industry.  Some people consider that if it were located elsewhere, the fertiliser could be produced at a lower cost.  I assume the Minister had to decide on some place, that he had technical advice and is satisfied that the location of this factory will not cause the price to go above a figure at which it could be produced at some other location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been hoping that we will get into the Common Market and, if so, our fertiliser factory here would find itself in competition with the fertiliser factories on the Continent, those very factories which are engaged in what has been described as price-cutting at the moment and which are making fertilisers available to our farmers at prices which are considered to be very reasonable and which have been quoted here as the lowest in Europe, if not in the world.  These prices are enjoyed by our farmers at <Col N="314" /> the moment and we can understand the anxiety that exists amongst them when we realise they feel that there is every prospect that they will continue to enjoy them.  They feel that there is no immediate prospect that the cost of imported fertilisers will rise and that they will continue to enjoy the benefit of the low prices.  As long as the cost of fertiliser to them is kept low, they have a better opportunity of competing in the export markets, particularly in relation to meat and milk.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that for commercial reasons of concern not only to the company but also to the potential suppliers of sulphur and oil, it is not possible to quote precise figures of quantities and costs.  That is in relation to questions put to the Minister in an endeavour to get basic costings which would give further assurance to the potential users of the fertilisers that they can be assured of getting them at a reasonable price for a reasonably long time, and that there will not be a sudden rise in costings, because they would be obliged to include these higher costs in the price of their exported products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned that this industry is expected to give employment to 300 people.  That is a fairly good figure but it is not a great number for an industry designed to supply the nation with nitrogenous fertilisers.  It is a proof of the fact that there is considerable automation in this type of industry.  There will be a lot of press-button work in it rather than the type of work which has a large manual content.  Even if there is a considerable measure of automation in this factory, we can be sure that the degree of automation in factories outside this country, particularly if we join the Common Market, will be still greater.  The argument that the factory will provide employment for 300 people is not a very great one.  Considering the magnitude of the industry, it is a very small number of people and a great number of them will be technical men.</P>
    <P>There has been mention here that the financing of the factory will follow the lines of the ESB, Bord na Móna <Col N="315" /> and Irish Steel Holdings.  We all know that of these three, the ESB has been outstanding, but even this evening we listened to a motion from Deputy Tully pointing out that the users of electricity must shoulder what appears to be an unfair burden to keep the financial position of the ESB in line.</P>
    <P>The materials which will be used in this factory, mainly sulphur and oil, must be imported and as a result the factory does not offer very much of a demand for native raw materials. While we are talking about the setting up of this new industry, we must at the same time look at the news we have been reading recently in our newspapers, the danger of a considerable amount of unemployment in certain industries, if we become members of the Common Market.  The motor industry has been mentioned but several other industries have also been quoted.  It has been suggested that there will be considerable redundancy in industry if we became members of the Common Market group and there is no assurance that this is not also an industry which will go to the wall if we became members of the group.</P>
    <P>I think that aspect should be dealt with in this memorandum because in these days the question of redundancy in our industry is very much in the minds of people who are examining the impact of the Common Market. I should like to hear from the Minister whether in fact he has asked his experts to consider that aspect and whether we might find ourselves in the situation of the motor assembly industry of expecting large scale unemployment. In view of the fact that we have not native raw materials and must depend on sulphur and oil imports for the manufacture of these nitrogenous fertilisers, is there a danger that these large <i>cartels</i>, fertiliser factories on the Continent of Europe with automation and modern methods, will be in a position to render the production of fertilisers in this new factory uneconomic?</P>
    <P>It is very reassuring to read in the memorandum that the Government are fully satisfied that this industry can make nitrogenous fertilisers available <Col N="316" /> without subsidisation or protection at a price at least as favourable as the present import price.  That is certainly a very valuable assurance because the prices at which fertilisers are available to our farmers at present are considered to be the lowest in Europe, if not in the world.  In our agricultural economy, the price of fertilisers is important since they are becoming more popular and also since it is essential for our farmers to gear their economy and production at a higher level and to have nitrogenous fertilisers for their pastures and crops.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the demand for these fertilisers will be far greater than anticipated.  Of course the estimate here is for the year 1965 and that is fair enough.  A quantity of 150,000 tons may be required by the country in 1965.  I agree fully that even if we had no factory here, imports would rise to 150,000 tons because our farmers have become fully aware of modern techniques and of the value of using these fertilisers for increasing their output in an economic way.  They are anxious to get more from their land within a specified period than they did in the past when they had the old tradition of leaving the land to lie fallow for years on end in order that fertility might return to the soil after it had been removed by the production of one crop or another.  They just cannot allow the land to lie fallow now.  They must make it productive and nitrogenous fertilisers will do that.</P>
    <P>It is also mentioned in the memorandum that this is not a new idea, that successive Governments have given consideration to this proposal.  That is quite true.  The circumstances now, however, are somewhat different which leaves a measure of anxiety among farmers and which makes us in the House ask questions.  The fact that the cost of these fertilisers has been falling rather than rising during the past ten years makes one wonder whether modern methods will find a way of producing fertilisers or anything, if you like, which will stimulate plant culture and pastures at an even cheaper figure than is shown on the scale&mdash;and the scale shows that costs have fallen consistently and continue <Col N="317" /> to fall.  That is a situation that did not exist ten or 15 years ago when this matter was being considered by experts so we now have to face the possibility that new or alternative methods may be found and that farmers will be able to get some type of fertiliser which will give the same plant culture at a much cheaper rate per acre and that higher output will give them greater profits.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are anxious to see this project become a success.  We have already asked many questions on this proposal, all the time trying to secure an assurance that it will be a benefit rather than a burden to the agricultural economy because we know it is the farming economy that will support this industry.  The industry will depend on the demand by farmers for the production of extra fertilisers. Certainly if we can become self-sufficient in the production of nitrogenous fertilisers at an economic price, it is something we should strive for and we should spare no effort to find ways and means to ensure the success of the project.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter I want to raise at this stage except to say that I feel that the estimate of 150,000 tons in 1965 will be far surpassed because statistics have shown that the volume of imports each year is rising very rapidly.  We can look forward to an output of a quarter of a million tons in a matter of a few years, so that, apart from the very large increased demand we can expect, the main problem at the moment is to ensure that the price of the product of this proposed new factory will be kept within the reach of the farmers so that we can continue our exports.  The proportion of our exports from the agricultural field is the major safeguard of our economy.  We need to ensure, whatever else we do, that our agricultural products will continue to compete on the export market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Government have seen, on the advice given to them, that there is a good sound proposition in bringing in this Bill is the greatest proof to me, and to <Col N="318" /> many people, of the humbug and nonsense spoken here about the wonderful future facing Ireland if we are allowed in as a full member of EEC.  Let me say that, personally, I am in favour of this project, but I cannot for the life of me understand how the present Government, who are wedded to free enterprise, who worship at the shrine of private enterprise and prize free trade, have seen fit, at a time when they are preparing to sell out other successful State companies, to embark on a venture of this size under State auspices.  If ever there were a condemnation of the policy pursued by the Government over the past five years, we have it here in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The fact is that in spite of all the talk we have had about private enterprise, and the extent to which the nation depends on it to give full employment and raise the standard of living in this country, the Government come in and say: &ldquo;We want this fertiliser project set up as a State company, to be run on the lines of the successful State companies which have been in operation here for a number of years.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance stated in his last Budget speech that the Government were contemplating the winding-up of the existing State companies, one of the reasons being a gesture towards private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every chamber of commerce in the country and at every meeting of so-called business industrialists, appeals were made to the Government to sell out those State industries in the form of shares, so that these gentlemen could reap the benefit to which the people and the community are entitled.  This Government were the first to send in their application for admission to the Common Market; they beat the British Government in the matter of time, so far as application for full membership was concerned. One of the reasons given by the Government was that the countries of the EEC, from which at the moment we get fertilisers, were an outward-looking group, anxious to help other nations and anxious to have trade with those countries less well developed than themselves.  It was highly desirable that Ireland should enter this new community of nations. <Col N="319" /> What do we find?  In this White Paper produced by the Government, the fear is expressed that, although fertilisers came here over the past four years at what might be described as tempting prices, we may not always have that happy position because of the fact that Nitrex, a group of Europeans engaged in a <i>cartel</i> or in control of the production and distribution of fertilisers, would be in a position to raise prices or lower them and hold the Irish farmer to ransom.  Would that be possible if Ireland entered the Common Market?  Could this terrible disaster face the Irish farmer&mdash;that this European <i>cartel</i> which obtains in the Common Market countries would be in a position, despite the fact that Ireland was not a full member, to exploit the Irish farmer by raising prices to whatever level they thought fit?  If that is the position&mdash;and that is the fear of the Government as expressed in the White Paper&mdash;does it not make nonsense of their application for full membership?</P>
    <P>I can only say that the Bill itself is evidence of the confused and erratic behaviour of this Government over the years.  They go on from day to day with a new policy as every new day dawns.  They cannot hold on to a principle or policy for 24 hours.  Let me say straight away that I believe that if the economic experts and scientists are satisfied that this is a sound proposition, then there is every justification for embarking on it and I feel that it was a sound economic proposition for years past.  I cannot understand the long delay on the part of this Government in dealing with it.  It seems very strange that they deal with a matter of this nature on the eve of their admission to the Common Market.  This measure, prepared and drafted, was introduced here some months ago in the light of the fact that we were to be protected and helped in the Common Market and that we would get, as full member, a fair crack of the whip with regard to the industrial set-up.</P>
    <P>I think it is no harm to have it on record that as far as the country is concerned we have a group of people <Col N="320" /> at the moment who are perturbed that this huge expenditure is not a wise one.  They feel that the Government's order of priority is mixed up.  It might even be suggested that far greater and more immediately productive work would be done if the millions involved were spent on drainage.  There is an argument which could be put forward on that basis.  If what is in paragraph 11 of this White Paper is correct, that the expenditure on imported materials for use in this project will not exceed one-sixth of the amount which would otherwise leave the country to pay for the finished imported products, on that basis alone and on the basis of the costings that have been given, it is a sound proposition.  That is if we can be sure of that, or if we can be sure of anything at all that comes from a Government who change their mind from day to day&mdash;that is my greatest worry.</P>
    <P>Logically, the only group in this House who should bring in a measure of this nature at this stage is the Labour Party.  If the Government believe in this policy they should be running 20 miles away from a proposition of this nature, and not try to be all things to all men.  I do not deny that in the process they may do some good things, but they do them in spite of themselves.  It is a better proposition to suggest that one-sixth of the amount of money which would be spent on the imported materials is going abroad. When we make comparison with the car assembly industry to see which is the sounder proposition, the fact of the matter, so far as that industry is concerned, is that only six per cent. of the entire turnover last year of that big assembly industry went in wages, and it is safe to say that almost 90 per cent. of the materials was imported.</P>
    <P>The Government should have used this approach down through the years instead of protecting and helping will-o'-the-wisp industries, which at the first breath of competition fold up, and are found by a Government or CIO report to be incapable of withstanding any competition.  When it is found that the majority of these industries, of which reports are being made available, are controlled from outside the State, it is all the more <Col N="321" /> necessary that a primary or a basic industry such as this, when it is in the State, should be owned and controlled by the State for the people.  It is a pity that this is coming up so late in the day.</P>
    <P>This is very desirable, especially in view of the fact that the Government's application for full admission to the EEC is not likely to be successful.  It will make this measure all the more important and beneficial and helpful to the farming community for the future. That is one reason why I am glad to see it here and to support it.</P>
    <P>I accept the fact that the explanation given in this White Paper is coming from experts who have advised the Government.  On that basis, I feel that some of the fears expressed by people outside the House and by Deputies in the House should be allayed.</P>
    <P>The question of the siting of the industry is something that I cannot comment on, because I am not an expert and I have no information on it whatsoever.  I do feel, if it were a feasible and economic proposition, that this industry should be placed in an area which badly needs development of some sort.  I do not begrudge it to the locality that has been lucky enough under the circumstances, but I do feel that if other areas were found to be as suitable a selection should have been made elsewhere.  The reason I say this is that the Government have tried for many years to persuade industrialists and other people to move to locations which are in need of industries.  If the Government desire to see big industries or small ones moved to the undeveloped areas and if they try to persuade private enterprise to do so, it behoves the Government to set a good example.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point as well as he can.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has made a statement on it.  However, I should like him to make it quite clear that, so far as he is concerned and on the full information available to him from the experts, <Col N="322" /> there is no other place in Ireland as suitable as the location chosen, taking into consideration population figures and the need for development, as well as the economic factors of transport and suitability.  If he confirms that, well and good, and more luck to the locality that has got it.</P>
      <P>I am in complete support of the measure and I am glad to see it coming in, especially in view of the situation which in all probability will develop in relation to our application for admission to the Common Market. It is time the Government and the major Opposition Party woke up to the fact that when they go over to Europe with their mouths open and a look of innocence in their eyes hoping for a fair crack of the whip from the cold, keen business men of Europe, what is expressed in the White Paper should send cold shivers up and down their backs.  In regard to the fertiliser industry the Government have found that the <i>cartel</i> in Europe, in spite of the Common Market, could harm the Irish farmer by exploiting him so far as the price is concerned.</P>

      <P>Like many other Deputies who have spoken on this Bill I have certain reservations. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we have to accept what the Government have said in their White Paper in which they have given a guarantee that they are fully satisfied that the industry can manufacture these fertilisers and make them available without subsidisation or protection.  That being the case, this Party feels that it cannot legitimately oppose this Bill although many of us may not be happy in our own minds in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I should like to ask the Minister is this: why is this, of necessity, purely and entirely a State concern?  I am personally aware of the fact that a particular firm would be prepared to make a considerable private investment, running, I might say, into hundreds of thousands of pounds, if they were permitted to do so.  In fact, I made inquiries a couple of years ago, when this was first mooted, of the Minister's Department to know if they would accept private investment or if it was conceived to <Col N="323" /> be entirely a State concern.  I was told that no definite decision had been taken on the matter.  Twelve months afterwards, I made the same representations and I did not get a definite or clear answer.  I am not a financial expert, but reading the White Paper which states: &ldquo;The project will not involve any charge on public funds which would have to be met by the taxpayer,&rdquo; the position is that this factory will cost £6 million and this money is to be provided by advances bearing interest at current lending rates and repayable as to principal and interest over an appropriate period.  Am I to understand in connection with the £6 million invested in this factory that they will pay interest at the current lending rates?  I am not absolutely certain what the current lending rates are but I think they are something in the neighbourhood of six per cent.  Will this factory be able to do that and at the same time, pay back the capital that is being lent to them?  If that is so, the Minister should give us some costings in this House.  I understand he has expressed some reserve in doing so.  Deputies would be anxious to know when this capital will be paid, how it will be paid and will this company be able to make such a sizeable profit to repay the amount borrowed to the tune of £6 million and pay current lending rates as well.  If that is the case, it would appear that this company is going to make quite a sizeable sum of money.</P>
    <P>They would have to pay directors' fees and all outgoing costs as well. If that is the case, surely one can reasonably ask, if this will be such a successful company, if it is to be such a profitable company to all those concerned with it, why did the Government wait such a long time to open a nitrogenous fertiliser factory? Perhaps the answer to that might be that the demand for this type of nitrogenous fertiliser has considerably increased over the past years.  From the statistics given to us here and those that have been made available by other organisations concerned in <Col N="324" /> this, that would appear to be the case.  At the same time, I wonder if we have any guarantee that there will be this increasing demand for the fertilisers concerned.</P>
    <P>I gather the intention behind this Bill is that the factory will manufacture for domestic market entirely, with no particular prospect of selling outside as I gather that nitrogenous fertilisers are in full supply from the already existent factories.  A factory such as this, in the final analysis, if it is going completely to fill the demand within the country itself, must of necessity have a certain surplus.  If as stated here the likely demand for fertilisers in the next year or so would be 150,000 tons, it is inconceivable that the factory is going just to manufacture 150,000 tons and no more.  They will have to have a small surplus so that they may achieve what they have set out to do, that is, to meet the domestic market.  Whether that surplus is 20,000 tons, 30,000 tons, or whatever it may be, what does the Minister propose to do with it?  Where does he propose to sell that surplus?  If he intends to sell it, has he taken into consideration that that surplus will have to be married into the domestic market?  Does it mean there will have to be some extra charge on the company to dispose of that surplus?  Perhaps, the Minister in his reply can allay some of the doubts that I have on that particular subject.</P>
    <P>In many parts of Ireland, particularly in the more fertile parts, we are able to produce&mdash;in fact it grows naturally on the land; it grows on my own land which is not very highly fertile&mdash;a vast amount of clover which is responsible for producing nitrogen, which is very good for the soil.  I may be a bad farmer myself.  I have a fair amount of land and I very rarely have to use nitrogen in connection with grass.  It is equally used for stimulating purposes on root crops and so on. The type of land that I have in my own district of North Wexford is not by any means superior to or as good as that in the more fertile parts of the country.  The Minister and his advisers are concentrating on the fact that many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies <Col N="325" /> have accepted the fact that grass is good; that it is an economic crop which they did not conceive it would be some years back.  They conceive that most of the fertilisers will be used on grass.  I wonder have they taken into consideration that there are probably wide areas in the country which might not require the quantity which they anticipate.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is concerned with the project, have been in full consultation with the Department of Agriculture, agricultural organisations and societies and their officials who would advise them on this particular project.  I am also advised that the question of producing nitrogenous fertilisers economically depends largely on the size of the nitrogen plant.  I have been advised from a source which I believe knows a lot about the subject, that, in order economically to produce nitrogenous fertilisers by the cheapest method possible and with your own capital or with capital from outside existing firms, you have to have a sizeable nitrogenous plant.</P>
    <P>I am told that we have, or anticipate to have, in this factory when it is set up, two small nitrogenous plants which may not be as economic to run as a big nitrogenous plant.  I am further informed that one of the bigger cross-Channel firms not very long ago closed down on the production of nitrogenous fertilisers because their plants were not big enough to make it economical and put them in equal <Col N="326" /> competition with some of the Continental firms.  There was a big British firm which closed down because their plant was not big enough.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the reasons we have a small nitrogenous plant is that it has a very much higher labour content.  While I would like to see employment given in the area concerned&mdash;and I can say that with an open mind here because it is not my own constituency&mdash;which I feel has suffered considerably with the closing down of the Avoca Mines, at the same time it seems to me, from the advice that I have had from a source which should know, that it would have been possible to have had a bigger plant and to have produced this nitrogenous fertiliser even cheaper than the figures which the Minister has given in the White Paper, though I admit by so doing there might not be the same high labour content in this factory as is anticipated now.</P>
    <P>The siting of the factory is a matter which I personally do not want to criticise.  It may not, perhaps, be the most desirable in the country itself.  I suppose we must accept that the reason it was originally sited there was that it was proposed to be an ancillary to the Avoca Mines concern and that the raw material of pyrites was available to the Minister.</P>
