    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to recent statements in the Northern Ireland Parliament suggesting the establishment of an All-Ireland Development Council and offering to co-operate with the Government in matters of national development; if he will set up a section of his Department devoted entirely to close co-operation with the Six Counties, pending a satisfactory agreed solution of the Border problem; and if, as a first step in this direction, he will appoint a consul or representative in Belfast, and arrange an early conference to discuss ways and means by which co-operation can be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the suggestion referred to by the Deputy, which was made by Mr. P. Gormley, M.P., a Nationalist member, when moving a motion for closer co-operation between the two parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions, my predecessor as Taoiseach and I have suggested that the two Governments should examine the possibility of extending co-operation in matters of common concern.  I stated in this House on the 21st July, 1959, that we would be prepared to consider adjustments in our trading arrangements which might expand trade opportunities for <i>bona fide</i> Irish products originating in the Six-County <Col N="736" /> area, and I raised the questions of setting up a committee to deal with internal Irish trade and of co-operation in the field of tourism and in the campaign to attract and develop new industrial projects.  Following subsequent conferences between Six-County and Twenty-six-County business people and the Department of Industry and Commerce, tariff reductions are being made voluntarily by us in the case of linen, furniture, electrical motors and paint.</P>
    <P>I have, on a number of occasions, made it clear that we would welcome any indication that the Government of Northern Ireland would be willing to pursue objectives such as I have outlined and to examine with us any matter of mutual interest.  Should such an indication be forthcoming, appropriate channels for practical co-operation can, I am sure, be arranged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that this is a very suitable occasion, now that a new Prime Minister is commencing his term of office in the North, to arrange for discussions between himself and Mr. O'Neill and further, in view of the fact that Mr. O'Neill is reputed to be a man with a greater degree of commonsense, intelligence and national understanding than his predecessor, would he consider arranging for talks between himself and Mr. O'Neill with a view to furthering co-operation and a greater degree of understanding between the two Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government at any time considered the appointment of a representative in Belfast who would be on the spot for the purpose of closer co-operation between the two Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the Deputy of my opinion that if co-operation should be desired, the practical arrangements will offer no difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government will issue an instruction to all Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries making orders or regulations, or granting licences under any Act, statutory regulation or order that the name, section and subsection of the empowering Act or Acts shall be mentioned in such order, regulation or licence with a view to ensuring that citizens will be made readily aware of the authority under which it has been made or issued; and that, if licences are being issued by virtue of power granted by a statutory regulation or order, the distinguishing number of such statutory regulation or order shall be indicated in the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Select Committees of Seanad Éireann issued a number of reports on Statutory Instruments in which they referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to shortcomings observed in the citations of authority in such instruments.  From paragraph 10 and Appendix XI of the latest printed report, issued in 1961 (Presentation number 6167), I gather that it would not be necessary to issue the instruction suggested by the Deputy as regards statutory instruments.</P>
      <P>As licences are, generally speaking, not of a restrictive nature, they do not appear to call for full citation of authority in every instance, and the instruction suggested by the Deputy does not therefore seem to be necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will add a table to <i>Economic Statistics</i>, 1963, giving details of the sale of social welfare insurance stamps in recent years for (a) industrial and (b) agricultural workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the sale of social welfare insurance stamps for industrial workers, as distinct from other non-agricultural workers, are not available.  It is not proposed to provide in <i>Economic Statistics</i> full details of the sales of social insurance stamps at the different rates but data from this source will be included in the relevant sector of the document as appropriate.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will expand Tables 10 and 11 in <i>Economic Statistics</i>, 1963 to give separate figures for Agriculture, excluding forestry and fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to expand Tables 10 and 11 in <i>Economic Statistics</i>, 1963, to give separate figures for &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo;, and for &ldquo;Forestry and fishing&rdquo;, since it is not the practice to show details in respect of small sectors of the economy in respect of which the figures cannot be estimated accurately.  It has, however, been decided to give in the text of the publication separate details for &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true that the composite figure has in it a large element and a small element, one of the elements can properly be described, as the Parliamentary Secretary has done, as small.  The other is very big and it seems to me that it would be of very material assistance to us if separate figures for agriculture were provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the total number of medical services cards current in the Dublin city area at present, entitling the holders and dependants to free medical and hospital treatment, (b) the number of persons covered by such cards, and (c) in respect of each dispensary district in the Dublin city area the number of current medical cards and the number of persons covered by these cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of general medical services cards current in Dublin County Borough at 31st December, 1962, which is the latest date for which the information is available, was 26,419. The number of persons covered by these cards, that is, holders and dependants was 77,362.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to free hospital treatment, I would like to point out that a person need not necessarily be covered by a medical card to obtain such treatment, free of charge, under the Health Acts.  In cases of hardship a health authority can provide such services without charge, even though the person concerned is not covered by a medical card.</P>

It was a very doubtful sort of season for wheat and the storage <Col N="750" /> of both these crops in some cases precented very great difficulties.  I came to the conclusion that we should do something to improve the storage position for the future in the knowledge that we were likely to have a very heavy barley crop in 1963.  For that reason then, and for that purpose, I went to the Minister for Finance and asked him to approve grants for the provision of additional storage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the total approximate cost of speed limit signposts in connection with the introduction of the speed limit in this country; and who decided where such signs will be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The approximate cost of the signposting is estimated at £70,000. The siting of the signs is determined by the terms of Section 45 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Regulations, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Act states clearly that the speed limit shall be observed through towns?  Is he aware of the fact that signposts have been erected in many cases almost three-quarters of a mile outside a town?  That is considered unreasonable in some instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly with the number of signs that have been erected and towns that have been signposted, as time goes on, experience will probably show that a number may have to be changed outwards or inwards.  I should like it to be clearly understood that the locations of the signposts now decided on were not chosen in a haphazard way.  They were chosen by local committees representative of the engineers and the Garda.  We got the views of the local authorities in question, and finally the actual sites for the signposts were visited by officers of my Department in company with the local engineers.  I agree that there may have been mistakes.  Time will show that we may have to makes changes, and we are quite prepared to do so, if we find that mistakes have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, it would be true to say that the locations were chosen by my officials and the local authority engineers, but without getting specific information about a particular complaint, it would be impossible to say which of the two parties made the decision.  My officials visited these sites with the engineers in practically every case but I could not possibly say who made the final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there would be no objection by the Minister's Department if the local authorities have to change the signs from the present sites <Col N="761" /> in a number of cases backwards or forwards by a few yards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The revision in relation to sites is contained in the regulations, and before any sign could be moved to a new site, the regulations would have to be changed by the Minister for Local Government, so the procedure would be that representations would come from the local authority as to any change which they felt was desirable.  These representations would be considered by us and if we thought well of it, it would be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us the exact qualifications for posting these signs in a village or a town?  I passed through a town this morning with only six houses and it was posted 30 m.p.h.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well happen. I should like it to be quite clearly understood that the local authorities, the elected representatives and their staffs, were specifically brought into this, because of the fact that we believed that their knowledge in the matter was of paramount importance. Copies of the regulations were circulated as early as last October and were in the hands of every local authority. I am wondering why there was no &ldquo;kick-up&rdquo; before now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why there is no speed limit for Cullohill village, County Laois, on the main Dublin-Cork road, having regard to the fact that Laois County Council included this village as one suitable for a speed limit; and if he will now take steps to have it so included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The technical committee <Col N="762" /> set up in County Laois to consider the application of the &ldquo;built-up area&rdquo; and &ldquo;special&rdquo; speed limits in the county, did not recommend that a speed limit be introduced in Cullohill. I understand that the county council, when considering the recommendations of the technical committee, &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; that Cullohill be included. A subsequent inspection by an officer of my Department indicated that, on balance, Cullohill was not a suitable village in which to introduce a speed limit.  Now that the regulations have been introduced, I feel that they should be given a trial as they stand, but, as I indicated in reply to a question on 21st February, the operation of the speed limits in each area will be kept under review by the local technical committee, and it is open to those interested to make suggestions to the local authority for consideration by the technical committee at the end of this year.  Where the local authority themselves wish to have a specific case considered, they can direct this technical committee specifically to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>More than one fatal accident has occurred in that village.  Everyone who travels the road knows that Cullohill is one village in respect of which a speed limit should be prescribed.  Laois County Council were unanimous in asking the Minister to make provision for a speed limit in that village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is true, but there is one missing link.  Last October, we circulated the regulations to the local authorities setting out what towns were to be signposted, and there was no response from Laois County Council until, I think, 29th March.  At that stage it was too late for reconsideration.  It may be that some places should have been signposted and others should not.  That will get consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider in this period of adjustment which must follow the provisional erection of the signs, delegating, say, for a period of six months, his authority to alter the location of these signs to the county engineers, on the <Col N="763" /> understanding that after the lapse of that period, which would be regarded as a period of adjustment, the more formal procedure of the Minister's sanction being required before the location of the signs is further adjusted would be reverted to?</P>

      <P>With your permission, <Col N="764" /> a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I have not received any proposals from Dublin or Dún Laoghaire Corporations for new road development on the line Ringsend-Booterstown-Dalkey. A number of schemes for the improvement of sections of the existing roads on that line have been approved in principle, including the reconstruction of Beach Road and Strand Road, and of part of Rock Road as well as the improvement of Upper Glenageary and Carrickbrennan Roads.  The question of further road development in both Dublin and Dún Laoghaire is likely to be greatly influenced by the findings of the recent traffic survey.  When the final report on the survey has been received, it will be for the road authorities concerned to consider what development schemes are desirable and practicable in their areas and to determine the priorities on which to base a programme of works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not given any instructions to Dublin Corporation or County Council for the preparation of a general plan for main roads; any plan of that nature would presumably be based largely on the findings in the recent traffic survey, the final report on which has not yet come to hand.  I have, however, conveyed to those authorities <Col N="765" /> my disappointment at the slow rate of progress in recent years in dealing with the necessary improvement of the major traffic routes, or arterial roads serving the city, for which special financial assistance has been available since 1947.  I have pointed out that the traffic conditions which have developed on these roads are a matter for serious concern and that the dimensions of the problem are such that it must now be tackled urgently and on a comprehensive basis.  I have also renewed the promise of financial support to enable these routes to be brought up to a suitable standard.  I have been assured on behalf of the authorities in question that the matter will be pressed forward with the least possible delay and that arrangements are being made to determine preliminary programming of the work and standards.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he has noted the great reduction in traffic accidents, particularly those involving pedestrians, which has resulted from the compulsory use of dipped headlights on motor vehicles in certain British cities; and whether he is prepared to introduce similar regulations here, even if only for a trial period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports of the results of the campaign in Britain for the use of dipped headlights in built-up areas on a voluntary basis suggest that a similar course should be adopted here and in the statement issued to the public on the proposed new lighting regulations it was recommended that dipped headlamps should be used in streets where public lighting is not of the highest standard.  It does not seem to be practicable to make compulsory regulations, but the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>There was first a preliminary try-out of this effort in one <Col N="766" /> of the English cities.  It was only for two weeks and there was a lot of publicity attaching to it.  The results after these two weeks, taken in isolation, would appear to substantiate the claim that this was a practice that should be followed.  On the other hand, it was felt that two weeks was too short a period and a further experimental period was commenced and after ten weeks a survey of the results was carried out which, again, goes to show that this is a practice that is worthwhile. Even after that ten weeks it is still felt that until there is a further and clearer picture of the real benefit of this practice, the ten weeks and the two weeks periods, including all the publicity that went with them, could not be a full and reliable guide.  We are keeping in touch with the matter.</P>

      <P>As already announced, the Government have authorised the drafting of an Extradition Bill which will include provisions for the reciprocal enforcement of warrants of arrest for criminal offences between the State and Britain and Northern Ireland.  These provisions are on the general lines of the existing arrangements with Britain but they follow the normal extradition practice of not executing warrants for political, revenue, purely military or trivial offences.</P>

In addition, the promoter of any event in a public place to which the public have access on payment for admission, and the owner of the place, commit an offence if they allow a collection to be made in the place during the event, unless a permit has been granted.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 55, lines 20 to 28, to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Council may, in pursuance of a resolution passed by the Council and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the Council voted, apply to the Minister for an order made in accordance with subsection (5) of section 88 of the Electoral Act, 1963, dividing the Borough into two or more electoral areas.</P>
    <P>(c) An order under this section shall appoint in such manner as most nearly secures equal representation on the basis of population <Col N="783" /> the number of members of the Council to be elected at a Borough election for each of the electoral areas created by such order&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Jones.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as set out, gives authority to the Minister to divide certain areas under the ward system.  I would say, without intending to be hurtful, that when the Minister was in swaddling clothes, we had in the city of Limerick a system of election under the ward system and at that time the city was divided into a number of areas or wards.  While the city of Limerick was nothing like its present size or population we had at that time 40 members on the City Council.  It was then decided that this was an unwieldy situation which led to a lot of skullduggery and the usual things that occurred in local authority and public matters, and somebody, in a saner moment, decided the city of Limerick should be left in one complete unit.  Instead of 40 members we elected 17 to the City Council.  The first four elected at that time were privileged by being named aldermen of the city.</P>
      <P>Limerick, like many other centres, is changing and taking on a complexion more in keeping with public welfare and with the progress of the area.  We are building vast schemes of houses, though, perhaps, not as quickly or in great numbers as the Minister's standards require&mdash;he certainly fired some abusive castigations on us on his departure to America recently to the effect that our speed or movement was not up to the standard he would wish to see.  However, Limerick is in a state of flux at the moment.  Numbers of parishes are being divided up by the Bishop who takes cognizance of building that is going on in particular parishes to the detriment of the oldestablished parishes in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole situation in Limerick is changing.  If the Minister thinks he can, without first consulting members of Limerick City Council, divide the city into wards and divisions&mdash;let him put it on a parish basis and there are something like seven or eight parishes in the city: we have 17 city members <Col N="784" /> in the City Council&mdash;I do not know how he is going to divide it in 1963 and think of Limerick as it will be in 1965, 1966 or 1970.  I suppose his guess is better and more realistic than mine, although I was bred, born and raised in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, in 1961 or 1960, I think, when the Minister made this proposal, it was followed up in Limerick City Council by a colleague of the Minister, the present Parliamentary Secretary.  The members of the council decided again this division. Despite what the Minister says regarding the number of runners declared for the Cork body, I think this is a good thing.  It would be a sad state of affairs if we did not have enough runners to fill the seats that are vacant in any council, urban, borough or county.  Competition is good and we all welcome it.  On 4th August, if my memory serves me well&mdash;I have not got my notes here&mdash;we discussed this matter in Limerick City Council and, as a result, the present Parliamentary Secretary who was then a member of the council withdrew his proposal to divide the city into wards or areas because on that occasion we and the members of his own Party were completely against the suggestion.  If my memory is correct, the Minister was informed of this by our city manager and the Minister replied by referring to a statement he made at the General Council of County Councils viewing with abhorrence the big number of contestants and runners for seats on Limerick and Cork Corporations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is overlooking one significant fact and I shall bring his memory up to more recent times.  Last Wednesday, we had about 40 runners in the Lincoln and on last Saturday something like 46 runners in the Grand National.  I am speaking completely from memory but I think I am not mistaken when I say that the people of Ireland were not so illiterate that they could not discern one runner from another.  Neither have the people of Limerick been so cursed with illiteracy as not to be able to discern one runner from another when the local election comes round.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I do not know what is in the Minister's mind regarding Limerick but I have a fairly good idea.  We are a discerning people and know what we want and how to get it.  If Limerick people want a man who lives in Garryowen or Thomondgate&mdash;I am sure these names are familiar to the Minister and his officials&mdash;they will take him and the people from Ballinacurra, two miles away, will take that man also if they think he is worthwhile. But Limerick is changing at the moment.  The City Council are building houses by the hundred and have schemes arranged for the next 700 or 800 or, perhaps, 1,000 houses.  If the Minister divides the city up into 17 seats and gives us two or three or four areas, he would want to be a bit of a Mandrake or a juggler to balance one area against another.  I should not like to take his chance, knowing Limerick as I do.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;You will elect three members or two members in this area&rdquo;&mdash;I suppose it all depends on the political strength of the area&mdash;and we then come along as the City Council and erect 200 or 300 houses in that area which will mean at least three votes per house, where is the Minister in his calculations?</P>
    <P>Without being hurtful, I want to impress on the Minister that he is biting off more than anybody can chew.  We are only in the growing stages in Limerick city and nobody knows what the position of the city will be in ten years time, particularly having regard to the new city being created at Shannon.  Whether that will have urban, borough or county borough status, nobody knows.  Even the Minister does not know.  That situation will have to be met, whatever charter the Shannon area will have. We are alert in Limerick to what is happening beside us.  Yet we find the Minister saying: &ldquo;I can&rdquo;, &ldquo;I may&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will&rdquo; and &ldquo;I shall divide Limerick into an area or areas and give these people areas and they will select their own men in these areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fought three city elections in Limerick.  I know what it is.  Thanks be to God, I do not know what it is to be defeated in Limerick but there <Col N="786" /> were many defeated.  We have at all times had two and three times as many runners as we had places in the City Council.  That is a very healthy situation and a very good thing.  It means that somebody is taking an interest.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the situation with regard to this city of mine.  We members, who were elected by the people of Limerick, do not want or desire the situation as envisaged by the Minister.  We want to leave Limerick until such time as Limerick has settled down, until we see exactly the final picture where this city is concerned.  At the present time, we do not know that.  If we do not know it&mdash;we who live there&mdash;the Minister&mdash;who works in Dublin&mdash;can have no notion and no possible idea of what situation or what picture will be presented within the next five or ten years by this city.</P>
    <P>I would impress on and appeal to the Minister at this stage with regard to the division of Limerick.  The number of spoiled votes in the Limerick election should be a barometer.  Thanks be to God, we are devoid of illiteracy in Limerick.  We know what we want and we can learn and read and think, which is allimportant. We can select our men or women in Limerick and let them be from any particular area.</P>
    <P>Limerick is a small town at the moment.  It is just an enlarged town, if you like&mdash;a good provincial town. We are all more or less neighbours in our city and everybody knows everybody else.  If the Minister is to carry out this idea of his at this stage, let me go on record as saying here today that within a shorter time than the Minister predicts, we will be faced with a situation in Limerick in which we shall have to review the whole situation because of our present building scheme, with approximately 1,000 houses on our stocks.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously before he makes any decision the views of the elected members of Limerick who are the voice of the citizen and who speak on behalf of the citizens.</P>
    <P>Just a short time after the Minister's statement to the General Council of <Col N="787" /> County Councils here in Dublin, when this matter was introduced in our council by a colleague of the Minister &mdash;his Party disagreed with the suggestion&mdash;we decided there and then that Limerick was not fit to be warded, zoned or divided into areas, as the case may be.  I am asking the Minister now to consider seriously the position of Limerick.  Maybe Cork is a completely different situation and certainly Dublin is, but, where Limerick is concerned, and maybe Waterford&mdash;I would imagine Waterford would come into the same category as Limerick&mdash; there is no necessity for this division.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, before he takes any step in this direction, to leave this matter to the local authority and let a decision be reached there. Whether or not it be a two-thirds majority, I do not mind&mdash; his decision is a matter for himself.  Certainly, before any steps are taken by the Minister or his Department in this matter, he should consult the elected members of the City Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, I think, understand what Deputy Coughlan has been saying in general terms but I do not quite agree with him in all he has said. Particularly do I disagree with him in respect of the manner in which he read into what I may have said in the past his own interpretation.  For instance, he seems to be quite convinced that I am against, and have indicated that I am against, the idea of so many people going for seats.  In other words, he suggests that I would like to see fewer candidates and less competition and that I was hitting at the big numbers standing in Cork and Limerick.  That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would still be competition in those areas.  It would not in any way reduce the competition but I assert that in a situation wherein you have 30 or 40 candidates seeking election for up to, maybe, 20 seats, the voter&mdash;under our system of election, which is proportional representation &mdash; has not a clue as to what effect his No. 25 or No. 35 vote will have.  He is entitled to have a fair idea of what the interpretation of his vote will be when it <Col N="788" /> comes to be counted.  But, because you put before him a list&mdash;and he has no other choice&mdash;of 40 names for, say, 17 seats&mdash;if he is to use his vote and not have it disappear by the elimination of his continuing candidates&mdash;he has to vote right through.  He has not an idea when he has marked that ballot paper as to whether or not he is really voting for the candidates of his choice or in fact helping somebody against whom he would prefer to vote.  I think that is wrong, fundamentally wrong.</P>

      <P>It takes days, with a very astute counting staff, to disentangle what it is all about.  Undoubtedly, there are results that are a surprise to everybody, not least to the people elected, and in some cases quite a surprise to the people left out.  It would be thought, from what the Deputy says, that I am asking for something outlandish, unreasonable, and something that has never been the right of any Minister for Local Government in the past.  That is far from the truth.  The situation today is, as it has been for very many years, that every county council, urban council and district council area is subject to being divided by the Minister for Local Government without request, without approval and, if necessary, without reference to any of the elected bodies of all of those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why it should be made now in that it is a little while since the Deputy <Col N="789" /> was a baby.  There have been changes. The Deputy has outlined that it would be impossible to know what will be the situation in Limerick, in three, four six or ten years from now.  If that is an argument against a change that would bring us up to date, surely no change since the Deputy was a baby is an argument that some change is urgently necessary at the moment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would be the people who would be deciding in that case.  It is not the people the Deputy is proposing.  He is proposing that it should be the people who are elected under a procedure which is not suited to the system and the type of voting practised in the greater part of the country.  They are elected under a system that could not possibly be understood by any human mind and yet the Deputy alleges that they represent the mind of the people.</P>

I am not questioning it in Dublin city or in any county council or urban council.

It is a reasonable request and one with which I think the House will not find fault, should they agree to this change.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister or his officials know about the situation in Limerick?  Nothing.  I was born and reared there and I know something about it and I know what the people want.  If the Minister and his officials tell me they know what they want in Limerick from one end of the week to the other, I say they are talking through their hats.  This is a matter which we shall decide in Limerick.  We shall make an issue of this as far as Limerick is concerned and we shall fight it to the last ditch. If the Minister or his officials think they can chop the city of Limerick into areas in a way that will satisfy the people of Limerick, they are sadly mistaken.  Before that day comes, I would ask him to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little interest in this because I can see that Waterford is coming next.  I am sure the Chair will not rule me out of order if I compare the two because the idea is the same in regard to both places. This is evidently in the nature of an attempt by the officials of the Department of Local Government to take all power to themselves.  As the representative of the people, the Minister should be very jealous of the people's power.  I agree with Deputy Coughlan that if a change were wished or asked for, that change should not be brought about by one, two or three persons in the Custom House but should be brought about by the elected representatives of the people of Limerick, the Mayor, aldermen and members of the Corporation of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very reasonable request. I shall not make any wisecracks about this but there is always the great danger that somebody other than the Minister would wield this power.  I do not think the Minister is asking this power for himself.  This power is being taken for all time by the officials of the Department of Local Government so that a Minister, maybe the present Minister, would not be consulted and the people of Limerick might find themselves in a strange position in regard to elections.  I would ask the Minister to ascertain whether the Corporation <Col N="791" /> of Limerick were at fault.  If they were at fault, it would look as if a change were needed.  I do not know what the position is in Limerick but 1938 or 1939 was the first time I had experience of this happening in Waterford. It should be left entirely to the Mayor and members of Limerick Corporation, to make the decision as to how the city should be divided for the purposes of local elections.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of another matter in connection with the division.  Maybe in the years to come, this will be a terrible weapon to have put into the hands of the Custom House.  I do not say that this Minister&mdash;because I know he has been antagonistic towards such a thing&mdash;or that anybody I know would do as has been done in the Six Counties.  I refer to the gerrymandering of a city such as Derry and I dare say that if this power were given to the city of Derry, the gerrymandering would continue.  I consider that there should be no division of elected areas in Limerick without the consent of the majority of the Corporation of Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was replying to Deputy Coughlan on this matter, he gave an indication of the effect of this amendment and of others which will follow it and said that, on principle, he is opposed to leaving the decision to the elected representatives of the people in that area.  That is something I deplore because the elected representatives of the people are the expression of the popular will in these areas.  When the Minister compares county council areas with builtup areas in a city, it is an invidious comparison.  In a county council area, which is a large physical area, the vote is scattered over many towns, villages and rural districts, whereas in the cities, there is a concentration of population, which, as Deputy Coughlan pointed out, is in the process of being moved about as housing changes.  As we are aware in regard to Dublin, there is a growing population in the cities to the detriment of the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> The Minister has decided that he will not leave the situation as it is because of the difficulties which he says the average voter will have in marking a ballot paper so as to give effect to his wishes in the matter of the government of his city.  I would point out that any voter in the cities of Limerick and Waterford, or indeed of Cork, is not faced with any greater task than that which will face the voters in Dublin North-East in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones:</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the Minister feels the voters will be faced with a difficulty.  For that reason, he believes he should divide up the area for them.  What generally happens is that people are fairly well acquainted with a number of candidates in areas contiguous to the areas in which they live.  They are equally familiar with candidates who have been before them previously and whose names are in the public mind.  They carry their vote to the ninth or tenth preference in selecting those who they think should represent that area on the city council. When that system operates over all the areas represented, you get a very fair representation of public opinion. Therefore, I think the Minister is being unwise in taking the view he has taken.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have had this power previously&mdash;he assures me it is in previous legislation.  He does not see any reason why anybody should fear it will be used in a wrong fashion.  I would trust indeed that any Minister for Local Government in the Parliament in this part of the country would not draw down on himself the ire that would descend on him if he attempted to do anything like what has happened in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously, this is the superior legislative body in the country.  We should not do anything which would seem to weaken the democratic process of allowing the locally <Col N="793" /> elected representatives of the people to decide these matters for themselves. If the Minister cannot see his way to accept that, I believe he is doing a disservice both to himself and to the system we know as local government. You are going to take away the word &ldquo;government&rdquo; and have local administration. You are going to have local administration imposed from a central authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The view taken by Deputy Jones is entirely wrong.

It will neither add to nor take away from any of their powers.</P>

That is wrong.  I do not see why it should be allowed to continue in these three isolated cases when it has been corrected in every other administrative area in the country, including even Dublin city.</P>

      <P>If they do not, these cities should be divided up and we should have only the appropriate number of candidates.  In our general elections, we have no greater number than five seats in any constituency.  The highest number in any country administrative unit is eight.  The tendency has been in that direction.  PR tends to bring that about.  We have 30 or 40 candidates for 17 or 20 seats.  There are 70 counts and 5 days of torture.

      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that the unfortunate thing is that when the Department produced a special Bill for Waterford, the Waterford Corporation at the time happened to be dissolved for some mysterious reason, and they consulted with somebody in Water-ford&mdash;we do not know who&mdash;but it was not with any of the political Parties.  The Department of Local Government brought about the state of affairs that now exists in Waterford. Then it was applied to Limerick, and then to Cork.  I am not defending this. I am showing that the Department was able to make the mistake when left on its own.  What I want put into the Bill is that if this is to be done in Limerick or Cork or Waterford, the Minister or his successor will consult with the Mayor and Corporation of Limerick or Cork or Waterford.  This whole system is wrong.  We seem to be bringing in legislation all the time under which everything is left to the Minister or his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was no more fond of work than anyone else but I am quite sure the Minister will not have any work if that goes through because if these things were done, they would not be referred to him.  The Irish people thought that they would be their own rulers but we are legislating their rights away.  If there is any change to come in this connection it should be through the local council, and if a local council makes a decision and asks the Minister to do <Col N="796" /> it, that should be the way.  What is wrong is that every day powers are being taken away from the local representatives and we are asked to vote them away.  We are constantly voting powers to outside bodies and when we ask the Minister a question about them, he says that he has no responsibility in the matter and that we have voted our powers away.  I do not think the Minister should let this go and I would ask him to be reasonable about it.  If these local authorities want this change, they are the best judges.  With all respect to the Minister's officers, they are not the best judges.  It should be left to the people's elected representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth:</NameTxt>
      <P>A local authority has a considerable vested interest in the present situation.  I have also had experience of local government and we have discussed this matter in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The elected representatives, having been elected under a certain system, have a vested interest in the continuation of that system.  A number of them feel that if the system were to be altered, their chances might be reduced.  That is a fact which we cannot gainsay. There is no use saying the people do not want it.  I know, and the House knows, that when any elector is faced with a ballot paper with 30, 40, or 50 names on it, he is appalled, mesmerised and mystified and there is no use saying that he never asked for the <Col N="797" /> constituency to be divided up.  The average elector does not know how that situation can be remedied.  All he knows is that he is being given something like the list of runners in the Lincoln and in all conscience, he cannot arrange that number of names in any numerical order with any degree of certainty.  We have only to look at the competitions in the Sunday newspapers to realise that the arranging of 12 articles, or words or photographs in any order of preference gives rise to an almost unlimited number of choices.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible to say that a vote given under those circumstances would in any sense be an accurate reflection of public opinion, because it is quite impossible for that number of candidates to make any impact on the mind of one voter.  Those of us who have been at the counting of votes in local authority elections know that we are faced with a very restricted use of the franchise and that a voter will either vote for the five, six or seven candidates who are personally known to him or will try to use up his vote fully by marking numbers up and down the ballot paper more or less at random.  I would be against any effort by any Government to take too much power into their hands but I do not feel this is the case in this instance.  The power is there and in every other case there has never been a suggestion that the power has been misused or that there is any danger in the future that it will be misused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the electors of Limerick, Waterford and the other boroughs concerned have no reason to fear that they are suffering discrimination in any way and to be treated in exactly the same way as all other electors is entirely reasonable.  I quite see what Deputy Jones is standing up for, and the other Deputies may support him in that, but in all conscience, I cannot see why this should be given to such a few areas for no particular reason. I would ask them to withdraw the amendment because the power is still in the hands of the local authority, through the Minister, to do it if they wish to have it done.  I would hope <Col N="798" /> that the withdrawal of the amendment would highlight the whole problem and they would have the right to act. I am all in favour of their doing so, if they would do it, but they have not and I do not think they ever will, simply because the vested interest of the present system is there and cannot be got over.  I do not think we should make too much of a song and dance about it, and I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>There are nine constituencies in Dublin.  I say that the people of Dublin are truly represented because the popular man in a particular area will get a good vote.  He probably would not get as good a vote in another area.  If the city were one constituency, it would mean that the man elected would be a Party man who might not live in the city at all.  Such people are elected only because they have the machine and the money behind them.  If the city were one constituency, it would mean that the poor, local man would have no chance of being elected.</P>
      <P>One of the arguments against the elimination of proportional representation was that it would give all the power to the machines and rub out the individual.  The country rejected the idea of the straight vote.  Here is a case where the local man with no machine and no money will have no chance of election.  It is incorrect to say that the local people do not want him.  When a man is elected, he has a local vested interest.  He wants to hold on to his position.  He cannot talk for the man who wants to be in his place.  Therefore, I am talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth said that he would like to see the local authorities acting and that, in his experience, they did not act.  I take it that Deputy Booth has been on a local authority only since the advent of the managerial system.</P>
      <P>My argument is that the local authority should have the say, and not the Minister or the Minister's officials. I submit to Dublin Deputies that Dublin is a very big area.  Surely we would not be representing the areas that sent us here if we did not say what we think.  There are 15 members of the Waterford Corporation, 17 members of the Limerick Corporation and 22 members of the Cork corporation. Those three corporations are the creation of the official who now want to take this power back again.  The officials have the idea that they did wrong.  They did it without consulting the local authorities.  I know they did not consult the local authority when they did it in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to leave these sections in the Bill.  I think that authority to change the electoral areas <Col N="800" /> should be left in the hands of the local bodies.  They are better able to do it. There is a trend towards thinking that only the officials of certain Departments and certain Government companies know what is good for an area down the country.  The sooner we make a stand against that type of policy the better.  I believe that if any changes are to be made, they should be made by the local authority in the area concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 56, to add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) An order made by the Minister under Section 7 of the Limerick City Management Act, 1934 or under Section 6 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939 or the Cork City Management Act, 1941 shall not take effect until a draft shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a Resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I want again to draw the attention of the House to the fact that local authorities or private bodies who promote private Bills must have those Bills brought to the Oireachtas for approval.  They come under the scrutiny of someone in the Oireachtas who is responsible for their examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make an analogy.  Some of the sections of this Bill are not the type of section which we believe should be inserted in the Bill.  The Minister has taken power to divide up areas and to make certain regulations and orders in regard to the divisions of those areas.  I want to ensure that the Minister will first have to make draft orders and bring them before the Oireachtas for approval before they are held to be binding in the areas to which they apply.  This is a watering down of what I had previously hoped the Minister would accept.  I want to ensure that before an order is made by the <Col N="801" /> Minister, he will bring a draft order before the House and that the House will have the authority to deal with the order before it has valid or binding effect.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, this amendment is related largely to what we have been discussing.  I do not agree with it in the form in which it is at the moment but, particularly in view of the fact that the House has accepted the position as it stands in regard to the divisions by order of the Minister, I would be prepared to provide that, instead of the draft of such regulations being laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval, the order would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and a motion to annul can then be moved.  That would meet what Deputy Jones would wish to have, that is, an opportunity to raise the matter contained in the order.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer that procedure and would be prepared to bring in an amendment on Report which would compel the Minister to lay before each House of the Oireachtas the actual order and enable a motion to annul to be moved.  It may be annulled or passed and it gives an opportunity of discussion here.  That would take care of Deputy Lynch's fears that the officials of the Department might run away with the Minister at any stage and that it might not be the Minister's wish but rather that of bureaucracy at work that would operate.  I do not think that is a real fear but in case it might happen and I would not be there to see that it did not happen, I propose to bring in an amendment to the effect that the order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It may be of some benefit to the movers of these amendments if I say that I think there is a misapprehension about what is intended in the section.  The section has really nothing directly to do with or any bearing on the ultimate results of any local election in any given area. The words &ldquo;wards&rdquo;, &ldquo;electoral divisions&rdquo; and &ldquo;district electoral divisions&rdquo; are merely terms to describe administrative units which make it possible to compile a register on which an election is fought but their boundaries or what they contain will not have any bearing on, and will not make it possible to bring about a change in, a boundary or the question as to who belongs to a particular area or who belongs to a particular local authority district or functional area. They do not play any part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remove any fear or misapprehension Deputies may have that the words in that section in any way interfere with what we have been talking about on the other two sections. These are purely names given to units which, <i>inter alia</i>, have a very useful purpose in enabling us to compile registers on which we fight elections but they are only supplementary and <Col N="803" /> subsidiary to and from part of an electoral area or a constituency or a borough area.  They cannot extend that or contract it.  No matter what we do with them, it will not interfere with the actual area boundary within which a number of candidates may be elected for the local authority concerned or within a constituency.  The section can neither expand nor contract any part of any area for either parliamentary or local elections anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>There is some apprehension that this has something to do with and is related to the section we have been discussing.  I just want to make it clear that it has nothing whatever to do with that, that it cannot affect the boundaries, neither contract nor expand them.  If there is any fear in regard to these matters, I want to remove it.</P>

There is confusion about this word &ldquo;ward&rdquo;, for the reason that many years ago the local elections in some cities, particularly Dublin, were fought on a ward boundary system.  Contrary to the generally accepted opinion, wards do not operate in Dublin for local elections.  They are not the real boundaries.  They have no standing in law, determining the area within which so many candidates are elected. The wards we are talking about in Section 89 likewise would not be the determining factor as to the areas within which so many people would be elected.</P>

If the Minister is preparing areas which are handy to handle, to use an everyday word, why should he have it in such a way that subsequently two or three of them would have to be joined together for the purpose of making an electoral division?  Surely the natural thing would be to say the area which you now call a ward is the one from which you elect representatives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Wards and district electoral divisions are comparable since they are designed for the same administrative purpose.  One such purpose for which they are administratively used is to help us in the carrying out of elections of various kinds, the compiling of registers which are easily identifiable, and so on.  Although a number of them may be joined together to form an electoral area, or a constituency, for general election purposes, it does not follow that there is anything inherent in the boundaries of these units which confers any benefit or takes away any existing advantage. The census is compiled on these.  DDs are used for that; they will continue to be used.  They are boundaries which, for good administrative reasons, can be changed from time to time.  A boundary may expand or contract to suit circumstances.  The whole idea is to make the system administratively workable.</P>

      <P>It is possible we speak for as many in Limerick as the Deputy does.  We could decide, for purposes of illustration, to divide Limerick into three wards and into three areas for election purposes.  If that happened then the three wards and the three electoral areas would correspond in boundary.  If they did correspond, the latter division would have to come here.  We do not have to bring the ward division here for approval but we do have to bring the electoral areas.  A ward is not an area from which people will be elected.  It is purely and simply an administrative unit.  It may form the whole, or only part, of an electoral area.  Our main concern is with electoral areas.</P>

One could have a large boarding school, a large hospital, or an institution which might bring about an imbalance, the imbalance the Deputy is afraid would take place.  We are not tying ourselves to population because that would tie us so strictly we would have to include everybody; it would be impossible to try to exclude from the point of view of drafting.  I assure the House the intention is to have regard <Col N="807" /> to population and valuation, but not to tie ourselves strictly to that because, by doing so, we would get ourselves into more trouble rather than avoid difficulties.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation, would the Minister say if it is his intention that this deputy agent will have the same power within the polling district as the election agent will have?

      <P>For an authorisation by a returning officer to a person to vote at one poll at a polling station other than the one allocated to him shall authorise the person to vote at that station at the other poll or polls in the same constituency.</P>
      <P>It does happen that presiding officers and polling clerks sometimes are appointed to areas other than the areas in which they reside.  You might have presiding officers and polling clerks working out in one division in a county which is not the area in which they reside.  I am wondering how does the Minister entitle such presiding officers and polling clerks to vote in their own areas if they should be acting outside them.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister see any way of getting over this difficulty? I am aware of the difficulties in the way of providing postal vote facilities for the persons I refer to but at the same time there is the right of the individual to his vote to be considered. There may be difficulty in transferring the paper for the presiding officer because of the secrecy of the ballot but people should not be put in a position in which they will be unable to record their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the old system, it was quite a common practice for a presiding officer who was acting in an area outside that in which he lived and voted to be given permission to get a ballot paper from his area.  At that time, there was the further provision that if a candidate's personation agent was in a booth, he also was regarded as an official.  The point was that the worker was not being deprived of the right to vote because of the circumstances in which he found himself. I do not know if that system could still operate under which a certificate by all those concerned stating that certain people had included ballot papers for another area, would be in order.  I admit that if there were a different returning officer, it would create some difficulty.  But the Minister should consider carefully making some effort to ensure that a person who is entitled to vote will not be left without a vote because he was willing to work on that particular day.  It is true that he need not take that job if he did not like it but it is a situation that is <Col N="811" /> serious enough and I should like the Minister to consider it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it would appear from subsection (f) that the matter we have been discussing could properly be discussed at this stage, in a sense it is only incidentally it arises here because we are really dealing with the holding of two elections on the same day.  I am all in favour of what Deputies have been saying.  It suits me if we can accommodate the people and the more people we can accommodate in any constituency the better.  I always feel that way and probably there is some mathematical reason for it with which we are not now concerned.  Even if it means trouble and difficulty, particularly if the trouble and difficulty can be overcome by the returning officer, I would go a very long way to meet the situation.  After all, it is the returning officer's disposition of the <Col N="812" /> staff in these awkward places which brings about the problem we are asked to solve and even if he must strain himself a little more in order to accommodate these people, I shall certainly see if I can do anything about it.</P>
      <P>I agree with the general idea that, if possible, we should be able to arrange for the transfer of votes from one lot to another.  Again I must say that this consideration is only incidental to this part of the Bill and it would properly arise on another occasion.  If that occasion arises, I shall certainly try to arrange it and meanwhile I shall see what can be done in this Bill or even in this section.  I can only promise to look into it fully.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy moving his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 67, to delete paragraph (1) of &ldquo;Directions&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Each ballot paper shall contain a list of the candidates as described in their respective nomination papers.  Before entry on the ballot paper the names of the candidates shall be put into a drum or convenient receptacle by the returning officer in the presence of the candidates or their representatives at a time arranged by the returning officer, and the names shall appear on the ballot paper in the order in which they were drawn from the drum or receptacle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to change the alphabetical form of putting names on a ballot paper.  Where a man's name is placed depends on his surname. If his name is Allen, he is on top and if his name begins with the letter W or T, he is at the bottom. I do not know how that came about. Perhaps I am the first person to raise it.  I can assure the House the matter has been debated a million times since I entered politics because the people whose names begin with the letter A, B or C have always boasted that they <Col N="816" /> had a great advantage over those whose names put them at the bottom of the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>I remember when certain people canvassing to get themselves nominated argued that they would have a good chance because the name began with the letter B.  That argument was based on the fact that a small percentage of the electorate mark the names at the top of the ballot paper. Everybody participating in politics, and especially everybody who has stood as a candidate and watched the counting of the votes, knows that in a fairly large constituency, some 200 or 300 papers are marked, beginning at the top, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on all the way down to the bottom, thus proving there is an illiterate vote of from 200 to 300 persons.  That means that a man whose name commences with the letter A, though he might not be known to a single person in the constituency, will get for certain 200 or 300 illiterate No. 1 votes.  That is admitted.</P>
    <P>When I raised this question before, the Minister joked a bit.  He said that maybe they vote from the bottom.  The Minister can joke away.  There is no evidence that people vote from the bottom or, if there is, it can be proved that only about one in every 200 votes is recorded from the bottom up.  However, it is admitted by those who benefit as well as by those who suffer that 200 or 300 No. 1 votes which were not intended are, in fact, given to the person whose name is at the top of the list.  If those votes were put into a hat and somebody whose name starts with the letter W managed to get to the top of the list, then that person would get those 200 or 300 votes.</P>
    <P>People who are illiterate come in. They are not concerned with who is at the top or the bottom of the list.  They just start to vote from the top downwards. I have seen it.  Everybody else has seen it.  Let us admit that, from the beginning, there is an advantage of 200 or 300 votes, in a fairly decent sized constituency, for anybody whose name starts with the letters A, B, or C.</P>
    <P>If there is an A and a B, as happens in many cases, then, if the A is only a poor candidate, on his elimination <Col N="817" /> his votes go on to B and represent No. 1.  It is admitted.  It is not denied. Everybody accepts it.  Further evidence of that, apart from the fact that it is admitted generally, is that people with political ambitions have changed their names.  They become Irishmen when it suits them and Englishmen when it suits them.  If a man changes his name to Breathnach when his English name is Walsh&mdash;W being at the bottom of the list&mdash;he will get 200 or 300 votes.  In the last election, there was a man who always described himself as an Irishman&mdash;Ó Cléir&mdash;only Ó Cléir: nothing else would do.  But, for election, he changed himself into an Englishman: he put in Clery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy should refer to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that that happens, depending on whether it will get them those admitted 200 or 300 votes. I have tried to think of any other contest or any other game where people would agree to be at a disadvantage. I have not found it yet.  If a few friends play Banker for a match, a button or a halfpenny, they will draw to see who will deal the cards.  They will not agree to anyone in particular dealing the cards all the time.  They will draw for dealer because there is a little advantage in it in that whoever deals the cards is last and, therefore, has an idea from what is on the table.  The deal goes around and, because it goes around, they accept it.  Nevertheless, they cut the cards to see who deals first.  In other words, nobody agrees to any game or any lottery where someone will be at a disadvantage and if anyone insisted that a certain section would have an advantage, well, they could play by themselves because the others would not play with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that nobody will enter into a contest or a game if there is a disadvantage without any just reason.  But here is a contest in which the prizes are big.  I am telling you.  A man, just because his name starts with A&mdash;he might not know B from a bull's foot&mdash;will get 200 or 300 illiterate votes and anybody else on the <Col N="818" /> list who might be just as good as he is or better, is at that disadvantage just because he is at the bottom of the list.  How does it work out?  I actually examined the last two elections.  I found in one case&mdash;I shall not mention names&mdash;that a man won the seat by 120 votes.  The man who came after him was four places down.  If it is true that in a fairly large constituency there are 200 or 300 illiterate votes then this man was elected unfairly, solely because his name was high up on the ballot paper.  I want to put it to the House that that has happened many times.</P>
    <P>In the elimination of candidates, too, let us take two men of the one Party. The name of the first man starts with B and for the sake of argument, the name of the next man starts with T. There might be only a few votes between them.  But poor T is eliminated before B just because he did not get the jump vote, if you like.  There are only a few votes between the two men representing the same Party but, nevertheless, poor T is eliminated because his fellow representative got a few more and his name turns out to be B.  Why?  If there were a lottery, it would not happen.  I am trying to point out that there is a definite advantage for some and a disadvantage for others; that it is unfair and that there are no just grounds for it.</P>
    <P>I shall be candid.  I had a mass of stuff here to prove how it works out in actual practice.  I was at a hospital inspection this morning and, after that, I rushed to the Corporation and I have come here without my material. I am making the case, and it can be proved, that in numerous cases men have been eliminated just because of their misfortune in having a name that left them low down the list on the ballot paper.  If there were a lottery, and others happened to get drawn above their comrades, they would be elected and not the persons whose names topped the list alphabetically.</P>
    <P>You cannot deny it happens.  There was a by-election in South City a short time ago.  The winner won by 50 votes.  You can win by ten votes. Down the country, some fellow won <Col N="819" /> by one vote.  You can win by one vote.  The whole democratic principle is that a majority can be one vote. Why should any man or woman, just because his or her name starts with A, B, or C, have an advantage over his or her comrades?  Why?</P>
    <P>I even examined cases of people who have double-barrelled names, especially people who dabble in politics.  I have always found that where they added a name to their original name they put the one that would bring them higher up on the ballot paper first.  This definite advantage is admitted throughout.  As further evidence, I was looking up on the B's, C's and D's in this House. There are 60 Members of the House whose name starts with B, C and D&mdash; and there are 26 letters in the alphabet. All of this must, at some stage, have been of help for their election, to the disadvantage of someone else.  It happens.  It must happen.  You can kid yourself all you like but it does happen.  I have spoken to some of those people.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, all the people whose names are low down on the alphabetical list should start a civil war in their Parties.  They should get guts and start it.  It is just that they do not like to be a trouble and that is why they keep their mouths shut.  However, they complain bitterly.  There are no valid or just grounds for that situation.  It does not help the electors at all.  If there are 200 or 300 illiterate voters then every candidate should have a chance of getting those votes by having all the names put into a hat and letting the returning officer draw out the names and, in the order in which they are drawn, having them printed on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>Here is another disadvantage for the Party group.  The Party submits the names, in alphabetical order, of five candidates.  Some poor guy's name is at the bottom of the list.  Quite obviously all the illiterate Party voters &mdash; there is an illiterate section at the back of every one of them&mdash;look at the card and begin at the top.  Naturally there is every chance that the poor guy whose name is at the bottom of the <Col N="820" /> Party list will get the last vote.  The disadvantage is all around for the person who is unfortunate enough to have a name which puts him at the end of the ballot paper.  It is not right or fair.  I do not remember this matter having been raised before but I would ask the Minister to examine it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>My number in the House is 144.  I think that is the answer to Deputy Sherwin's argument because I would not like to see the names jumbled up.  When people are contesting an election, it does not matter where their names are on the ballot paper, whether they are at the top or the bottom.  If people want to vote for them, they will vote for them.  If what Deputy Sherwin said were true, he would not be here himself.</P>
      <P>In regard to illiterate voters, there must be an extraordinary situation in Meath because I do not think that in my experience there have been more than a dozen papers marked 1, 2, 3. Maybe a dozen should give us a reason for changing the whole thing round but everybody else votes in a reasonable way and the fact that somebody's name begins with the letter T does not matter.  When we are voting here in the House my number is 144; yet I was able to head the poll in the last Dáil election and in the council elections so it would appear that whether your name begins with the letters A, B, C or S, it is immaterial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to reply to Deputy Tully.  He is thinking of himself.  He should think of the other poor unfortunate whose name begins with the letter T and T who has not got the backing.  I am not thinking of myself because I got in on the first count in the last election and headed the poll at the previous election.  I am thinking of the poor unfortunate who is only coming up.  Let us forget ourselves in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Depending on the way one looks at it, I suppose there could be a great deal of sense in what has been said by those who are contradicting each other.  I am afraid I shall not be able to throw any light on this except to remind the House that I did <Col N="821" /> assert&mdash;and I was not joking when I said this to Deputy Sherwin on the last occasion&mdash;that if there is an advantage in being at the top, the second best place is the bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is joking again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not joking.  The argument Deputy Sherwin puts forward applies to illiterate or semiilliterate voters and we have gone to a great deal of pains to provide a procedure for these voters and still have the secrecy of their vote maintained. I would say that the procedure we have laid down is the answer to this problem and we should encourage its use to the fully by such people.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree to a degree with Deputy Tully.  It is all very well to say that if you are having a game of cards and you cut for deal, the deal goes round but in a general election if the names are jumbled up and drawn out of a drum and that is taken as being the first deal, it will not be the same players who will be sitting in at the next deal or the deal after that.  Indeed, the one player right through the line could be getting the bad draw all the time.  Could anyone say that would be a fair situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that there is any significant number of people who are so illiterate or so simple that they will choose a candidate merely because he is at the top of the paper. It is amazing how people, even with the poor information they did get in the past, were able to sort out the names and distinguish between one Party and another.  They do make mistakes, go to the wrong candidate and to the wrong Party at times but I cannot see that any particular placing of the name of a candidate on a ballot paper will mean his election or his elimination.  In fact, if we were to work on that basis and if we took it that people would start in the second or third space and work down the list, there is no guarantee they would come back to the fellow at the top.  It can be seen that the candidate at the bottom has the best stand because <Col N="822" /> everybody will drop him a vote when they are passing by.</P>
    <P>I do not think the draw suggested by the Deputy would be an improvement on the present situation if a remedy were needed.  As far as I can see there is no great problem.  If there is a problem it is lessening and will continue lessening to the point of disappearing.  To upset the present arrangement would not, in the last analysis, be fair to anybody nor would it be an improvement to many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks remind me of what was said in relation to the Counties Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  It was suggested that any change should be left to the elected representatives, to the vested interests. If there are 60 B's, C's and D's here there are a great many who do not want any change and I am afraid that influences the Minister.  In regard to Deputy Tully's comments, it must be remembered that only one table can be seen at a time.  He says he saw about a dozen of these votes.  It must also be remembered that, on his own admission, he is hostile to the proposal, and in this game when you are hostile you exaggerate one way or the other and do not give a true picture.  It is like the people up in the North who control that area; they want no change because they have vested interests.  I am not speaking because I fear the loss of my own seat.  It may have been so in the early stages when I had to struggle but it does not count now.  I am speaking in the interests of fair play and that is what this Bill should be based on, fair play for everyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this Estimate last week, he gave a very wide coverage of everything, but if you read his speech carefully you will find that he really said very little about anything.  Perhaps that was designedly so, with the idea of encouraging a full debate on all the matters he covered in his speech. The first point I want to deal with is Civil Defence.  The argument of quite a few Deputies has been that Civil Defence should be a matter for central Government.  I do not agree with that.  If we are faced with a situation where we have to go into action in Civil Defence here, it is far better for us to have local organisations so that we may utilise all the resources at our disposal.</P>
      <P>That does not mean to say it should not be controlled and operated by a central Government service.  I took the speeches of the Deputies to mean they wished the system to be changed as a whole.  I do not agree.  I think we should continue the system we have. I feel that the response to Civil Defence, which, perhaps, is not as important in this country as in other countries on account of our not having very many big urban centres, has not been as good as it might.  I would go a certain distance with these people who advocate the centralisation of the problem in agreeing that the Government should, in so far as it is possible, sponsor it, perhaps, more actively than they are already doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not really give us any defence policy.  It appears to me we are going to keep on with an Army of a certain standard, largely, I suppose, for the purpose of being in a position to train personnel in the event of its being necessary, because of a flare-up in the European or world situation, for us to fight.  The idea is to train a greater number of personnel. He mentioned that the Army was up to date&mdash;at least, I think he did.  He did not give us any indication as to <Col N="829" /> how it was up to date, what kind of weapons we have or whether we were keeping in touch with other forces moving into more modern types of warfare.  Perhaps it is some top secret which the Minister does not want to divulge to the House, but he could have given us a little more information than he gave.  On reading his speech, so far as the Army is concerned, I found no information whatever except that it was modernised and up to date. Perhaps the Minister might care to enlarge on that when replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the Naval Service.  I have repeatedly asked questions in this House to ascertain if we propose to continue with the naval corvettes or not.  I think I am right in saying that corvettes have been disposed of by every navy in the world, with the exception of our own small navy.  I cannot see that these corvettes are suitable for the purpose for which we largely require them: the protection of our fishing grounds.  We have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands telling us we are to have a great expansion in the fishing industry here.  We all appreciate that is possible but, to have that, it must be fully and competently protected.</P>
    <P>I have tried to point out in this House on several occasions that the corvettes have several disadvantages. First, they can be seen hull up miles away, so that anybody can get away before they can get on the scene. Secondly, they are very slow.  Under modern conditions, they are probably one of the slowest fighting craft afloat to-day.  Third, their draught is considerable. As a result, there are only about three or four harbours around our coastline into which they can go.  It is not very difficult, therefore, for the fishing fleets to have a pretty good idea where our corvettes are located.</P>
    <P>The only thing that can be said for the corvettes is that they provide a means of training crews.  I wonder if that is a great advantage.  As far as I can see, we are training our naval crews to move subsequently into the merchant service.  Surely if we are training them for ordinary merchant ships, the up-to-date training they get <Col N="830" /> is not of any particular benefit to them one way or another?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if it is the intention to keep these corvettes indefinitely.  They are becoming more and more obsolete each year.  I was given to understand under the tenure of office of the previous Minister an offer was made for them and they could have been sold.  I do not know whether that is true or not. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to whether we are wedded to them for the rest of our naval history.</P>
    <P>There is one other point concerning the Naval Service to which I wish to refer.  About a year ago, a ship was in difficulties off the Wexford coast and the lifeboat went out and the crew did their best to take the marooned sailors off the ship.  They found it was impossible to do so and they radioed to their people ashore that a helicopter was required.  I am informed that the message was passed to the senior naval officer of the Naval Service at Haulbowline. He had not got the authority to order a helicopter and I believe he had to telephone the Department of Defence to get the consent of either the Minister or some of his officials or, if I am wrong in that, he had to get the consent of the Army authorities. In this case, it was a matter of life or death for the people on the ship which was breaking up and it took a quarter of an hour to phone from Haulbowline to Dublin to get the green light to go ahead, although anybody who has had experience of trunk connections during the past few years could reasonably have imagined that it might have taken half an hour.  Is it not possible for the Minister to give the senior naval officer in charge the necessary authority, when he thinks fit, as a trained sailor knowing conditions, to give a direction to get, as in this case, on to Cornwall to secure the available helicopter for the rescue work?  It is a small point but it might mean the difference between life and death.  Perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that we are to have a helicopter service.  We in Fine Gael are pleased to hear it <Col N="831" /> because over a period of years we have been pressing the Department of Transport and Power to do something about it.  As far as I know, we are the only civilised and up-to-date country in the world which has not got a helicopter service.  This service is to be operated by the Department of Defence and I think everybody will agree that that is the best arrangement. Again, when we examine the Minister's statement, the information appears to be fairly limited.  It may be that the Minister was hoping to initiate a discussion and, indeed, he has succeeded in doing that and there has been a considerable debate on most points in the Estimate, but the House would like to know what type of helicopter the Minister has in mind. One can only surmise from the figures &mdash;the only information we have had to date on this matter&mdash;the type of helicopter he may be considering.</P>
    <P>I am not a technical expert but I am advised that there are two types of helicopter.  There is the turbine type and the piston type.  The difference between them is that the turbine type can take off immediately; in other words, it can go into action as soon as the SOS message or emergency message comes in.  The piston type cannot do that and it is a matter of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before it is heated up and before it can go on its errand of mercy.</P>
    <P>I am also reliably informed that there are two types of turbine helicopters available to the Minister.  It may be that there are more but this is the information I have.  One of them is manufactured by a British firm and the other by a French firm.  The British type of helicopter is the type which has been used for lifesaving, ambulance work and hospital work and so on &mdash; in fact for all the different types of work which go to make up the uses to which a helicopter can be put under modern conditions.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the British manufactured helicopter, the &ldquo;Westland Whirlwind&rdquo; is the one very much in use across Channel in all these circumstances.  It is able to cater for six stretcher cases.  There is plenty <Col N="832" /> of room for manoeuvring in it.  It is also able to carry, as part of its equipment, up-to-date medical services so that any emergencies may be dealt with.  As well as that, it may, if necessary, be used as a vital maternity unit and, in fact, in other countries is being used as such.  I am told it is capable of travelling a considerable distance without refuelling which is important in regard to our helicopter service here as it might well happen that it would have to function out over the Atlantic in emergency rescues from aircraft and ships in distress.  I am informed that its overall range is about 270 miles and that it is capable of carrying a reserve fuel tank which, when it has been utilised, can be ditched so that the helicopter can travel another 80 miles or so.</P>
    <P>All things considered, it does seem to me that that would be the most suitable type of craft we should order. As well as that, there is always the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and this type of craft is manufactured only a few hours distance away.  I am also informed that if the Minister is considering a smaller type of craft it is possible to get such a craft manufactured by the same firm.  There is also a French type of helicopter which, admittedly, is cheaper than the other one I mentioned.  I think it is called the &ldquo;Alouette&rdquo; but it has not got the same ambulance capacity as the other one.  I am taking the long-term view and I believe that if we are starting helicopter services here&mdash;and it seems that from the amount of money being voted the Minister's mind is moving in the direction which I respectfully submit it should&mdash;we should get the bigger and better equipped type of helicopter.  He will then have a better service at his disposal, one which will be easily serviced, which will have a wide range and which has been tried and tested throughout all the rescue operations that have been going on around our coast by British helicopters because we had not got one of our own.  I would ask the Minister to take those factors into consideration.  It would also be useful if he would indicate to the House what he has in mind and whether or not any decision has been taken so far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The training of the personnel for the helicopter services is a vital matter and I feel sure the Department of Defence, which has shown itself, with one or two minor exceptions, to be an efficient Department, will be well able to provide the personnel to man these craft.  I would further ask the Minister, when he is arranging for the training of this staff, to bear in mind the fact that if we are establishing a helicopter service, we will have to have a round-the-clock service.  He should not stint himself in any way in regard to pilots and personnel.  We on this side of the House can claim credit for having fought during the past few years for a helicopter service.  Many people outside the Dáil were interested to learn that we are to have this vital and efficient service.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has decided that the price of the French helicopter is cheaper than its British counterpart, I would ask him to take into consideration that certain difficulties will have to be faced in regard to the training of personnel.  There may be a language difficulty.  I do not know the proficiency of the Irish Army in speaking French.  I know they are very good at speaking Irish.  The previous Minister was very keen on that.  It is easier to train pilots in a language which is known to everyone than in a foreign language.  I hope the Minister will give a full explanatory statement on this very vital and important new service.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to agree whole-heartedly with Deputies who have spoken about the Irish soldier's uniform. There is no doubt that the uniform of the private soldier and the non-commissioned rank is the most unglamorous outfit I have ever seen.  I understand there has been considerable difficulty in recruiting personnel to the Army.  There has not been the same difficulty since the start of the Congo operations because it has always been the wish of an Irishman to spread his wings.  I suppose he has it in his blood from the days of the Wild Geese.  If the Minister did something about the uniforms&mdash;which Deputies of all shades of opinion recommend&mdash;it would be far easier to get recruits. There does not seem to be any reason <Col N="834" /> why we should continue with the extraordinary outfit that has been worn over the years.</P>
    <P>In the south of my constituency there is a barracks, in Duncannon Fort, which I think would be suitable for the training of personnel.  In the summer months, it is used by the FCA, and I do not see why more use should not be made of it by the Army. I agree that it is rather a back-end and there probably would not be a lot for the soldiers to do, but it is a healthy spot and it is not too far from New Ross.  The Minister should consider using that barracks because that would help to preserve it in good condition. It is a fort which we might need some time in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to introduce a helicopter service, and I welcome the fact that the service has been taken over by the Department of Defence.  We have seen during the past couple of months how this service could be used to great effect, particularly during the bad weather in the Wicklow mountains and in the recent tragic incident on Lugnaquilla. It is good that we are to have that service.</P>
      <P>Looking over the past year, there are a few aspects of this Vote to which I should like to draw the notice of the Minister.  One is in relation to what are called temporary workers on the Curragh.  They are really permanent workers but they are not established. Workers in the other State-sponsored bodies have superannuation schemes but these people have not.  Some type of superannuation or pension scheme &mdash;call it what you will&mdash;should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men are civilian workers in the Curragh, in which I am very interested. There are some people who are living in my constituency and working in the barracks in Mullingar but this goes for all the barracks all over the country: when the civilian workers retire, they have to depend solely on the old age pension and I feel that some insurance or superannuation scheme should be brought in to cover them.  Men will always work better when their conditions are right <Col N="835" /> and they are happy.  It is always better to have employees happy, and I feel that some such scheme would help towards that end.</P>
    <P>Some of the lower paid civilian workers were rather disappointed by the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap.</i> Some of them were coming up for an increase in pay and they feel that it has now been postponed.  I know that in some of those positions the pay is anything but good, and it was hard that the White Paper had to be imposed on those people.</P>
    <P>The Army uniforms were mentioned and I fully endorse what has been said about them.  The uniforms could be greatly improved, and should be improved, particularly now when our soldiers are travelling abroad and meeting the personnel of other armies serving with the United Nations in the Congo, and prior to that in the Middle East.  A soldier definitely takes pride in his uniform and in everything connected with his army.  He likes to have a well-cut uniform of nice material when stepping out.  The stepping-out uniform of the American Army is particularly attractive, and the personnel are proud of it.  It would help the morale of the Army if our Irish soldiers could be picked out as having nice uniforms.  It would help in another way.  It would help our trade because new countries look for fresh places to trade.  I feel it would be a help to the country in general if our soldiers abroad had good, wellfitting uniforms.</P>
    <P>Sufficient interest is not being taken in Civil Defence.  At present there is no world war in progress.  Last Christmas was the first Christmas for 20 years that there was not a world war being waged.  Last October, the world was on the verge of war.  The President of the United States of America spoke for half an hour over the American television and radio network and the world realised how near it was to the brink of war.  The threat of war is always present.</P>
    <P>There is great enthusiasm about Civil Defence work in the Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock areas of my <Col N="836" /> constituency and in Kildare generally, but the people concerned are not getting sufficient encouragement from headquarters.  Where people have taken the trouble to attend Civil Defence courses provided by the Department of Defence, their enthusiasm should be kept alive.</P>
    <P>I attended a dance a few nights ago and was surprised at the number of people in Civil Defence uniform there. The people in the hall were impressed. Civil Defence corps have the idea that the general public do not know of their existence.  It is proposed to issue a handbook through the post to give the people some idea of what to do in case of an emergency arising from atomic war.  Where there is an enthusiastic Civil Defence corps in an area, it would boost their morale if the distribution of this handbook were entrusted to them.  That would have the effect that, in case of an emergency, the people would know to whom to go for help.  At present they do not know. It would be a very simple way of making known to the people in a locality the personnel associated with Civil Defence.  Where there is local enthusiasm, the Department should encourage it.  In peacetime, it could happen that no interest would be taken in Civil Defence and enenthusiasm would wane.  Army personnel should be engaged in promoting interest in this aspect of our defensive measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department is responsible for a section of the Curragh. It seems to me that artificial fertiliser could be used to great advantage on the lands of the Curragh.  Sections of the Curragh could be used for experimental purposes to demonstrate the beneficial effects of fertilisers.  Fertilising would have the effect of increasing the number of sheep that could be grazed.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that the Board of Works put out fertiliser on certain sections of Phoenix Park.  The Department of Defence could do the same in respect of the Curragh lands.  It would benefit sheep owners and would improve the appearance of the Curragh. There is a striking contrast at present between the appearance of the <Col N="837" /> enclosed racecourse and the surrounding area of the Curragh.  The turf on the racecourse presents a more luxuriant appearance.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of furze growing on the Curragh.  Steps should be taken to control it.  It may be picturesque but too much furze is wasteful of land.  The Curragh is the most important Army centre.  It is a show place.  Foreign army personnel visiting this country are always brought to the Curragh.  The main road to the south of Ireland crosses the Curragh.  The Curragh is a scenic attraction, being the largest open space in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the Army Jumping Team.  I was pleased with their successes in the past year.  They got seven first prizes.  In jumping, horse and rider form a team, a partnership.  In that partnership, the rider plays the most important role. From my own experience, I know that, when a horse falls or hits a fence, in 50 per cent of the accidents, the fault lies with the rider.  It takes a long time to train a rider and one of the things I have noticed about the Army Jumping Team in recent years is the frequent changing of the members of the team.  Before the war we had the one team practically all the time.  I believe one of the main reasons for the continual change now is the slowness of promotion.  Promotion in other sections of the Army is much more rapid.  Since the war, we have produced two outstanding riders.  No sooner were their names made than they left the Army and went back to civilian life.  Promotion was not coming quickly enough.  If a member of the team marries, it is only natural that he will need more money to support a wife.</P>
    <P>Another thing I have noticed is that our men are much lower in rank than are the members of other army jumping teams.  That means that they have less pay.  Presumably they are allowed expenses when they go abroad but those expenses would not, I am sure, permit them to rub shoulders freely with the more wealthy types with whom they come in contact. Naturally, they would like to feel they were the equals of their competitors from other countries.  One <Col N="838" /> way to solve that problem is by more rapid promotion.</P>
    <P>The training of personnel is all right.  It can be an advantage to have personnel without much prior experience because then there is no need to break them off faults.  Training can start right away.  If the Minister can see his way to encouraging more rapid promotion for these riders I am convinced our Army Jumping Team of the future will restore some of the former glory we gained and bring back plenty of prizes.  Nothing gave me greater pleasure a few years back than watching Loch an Easbaigh and Cloyne on television coming in first and second in Rome and winning the most coveted trophy of the Rome show.  A contented team will go a long way towards ensuring success and towards, therefore, recovering some of the pre-war glories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the number of Irish troops in the Congo would be reduced.  We are, I think, at the stage now when we should pay more attention to what is happening in the Congo.  Last December, I asked some questions about the Congo.  I drew the attention of the Government to the fact that several newspapers in America, Great Britain and France had said that fighting was about to break out in the Congo.  I was told the Government had no such information.  The House rose and we went home.  Two or three days afterwards, fighting broke out in the Congo.  The Government should take steps to ensure that we are better informed as to what is happening out there and for what purposes our troops will be used. They are a credit to the country and to the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Naval Service continues to be occupied with the demanding problem of fishery protection and also said it participated in air-sea rescue operations as required. When it comes to air-sea rescue operations we remember the famous case off Wexford when the lifeboat could not put out to help a small vessel which was breaking up rapidly.  At great peril to themselves, the British <Col N="839" /> Navy put a helicopter into the work from an aircraft carrier in the Bristol Channel.  Apart from anything else, we did not express ourselves as being very grateful to the officer commanding that carrier.  If he had been commanding a vessel of some other country I have no doubt such would not have been the case: we would have been very quickly off the mark in such circumstances.  And then we come to the problem of fishery protection.  As far as I know, the Naval Service consists of three outmoded corvettes, one of which is used as spare parts for the other two.  To use a seaman's words, these corvettes are capable of steaming at 15 knots.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Too fast, under our new traffic laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are capable of steaming at 15 knots.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that after the arrest of the Russian trawler off Waterford, the trawler captain when giving evidence&mdash;I nearly said he swore; he did not&mdash;he only gave testimony&mdash;said that he could have got away because his ship was much faster than the corvette.  That is the position.  The Minister said they have to engage in the demanding problem of fishery protection.  They are engaging in a job for which they are not fitted. They are slow and unwieldy and unsuited to the business of protecting our coasts from foreign trawlers.</P>
      <P>When asked what would be the most suitable vessel for the job of fishery protection off our coasts, people who have been in other navies throughout the world have recommended the cutter type of boat used by the Americans.  They have the speed required to overhaul modern trawlers.  It may be said I am off the line in discussing fishing at such length on this Estimate, but I feel compelled to dwell on the Minister's reference to the demanding problem of fishery protection. I want to point out to him that this protection is practically nonexistent. Only last week there were several foreign trawlers fishing into the rocks off Waterford and Wexford while the corvettes were at Cobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> I would suggest to the Minister that he should dispose of these corvettes and acquire some cutters of the type I have mentioned.  They could be based on ports all over the country, from Donegal right around to Louth. Then the Minister could say he was giving a 24-hour fishery protection service.  There is no use saying two corvettes can do that job.  As soon as they arrest a trawler, even while they are taking it into port the others are inside our territorial limits, fishing away.  I do not think I could exaggerate our losses in this respect.  If I said we were losing thousands of pounds I would be making the understatement of the year.  Our losses can be counted in millions of pounds.  We cannot say we are seriously defending our fisheries with the present service.</P>
    <P>Another point I would put to the Minister is in connection with his proposal to purchase helicopters.  He will have these craft at his disposal, and I take it they will be stationed at different ports.  With these, and with improved vessels of the type I recommend, the Minister could say he was giving a 24-hour protection service. It is a terrible thing to hear the crews of these foreign fishing armadas boasting, when they put into our ports, of all the fish they have been taking from our waters.  We should not let them get away with it.</P>
    <P>I am told we are to buy French helicopters, that we are not to buy British helicopters because they are dearer, even though they carry bigger loads than the French.  I would advise the Minister not to turn his back on the British like that.  We bought the corvettes from them simply because we could not get them elsewhere.  When we go to buy any type of aircraft, we always go to the continentals, to countries which buy very little from us.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the action of the Minister for Defence in Poland recently.  He cancelled an order he had given for British aircraft because the British had reduced the quota for Polish agricultural produce. Like good businessmen, the British very soon restored the quota.  We are sending trade missions to Britain, and here in these helicopters we have a <Col N="841" /> bargaining power which we could use. We have the balance of trade against us and we could use that against the French.  According to what I am told, the British helicopter would be more suitable for the kind of work we have for them and would be easier for the Irish Air Force officers to learn to operate.</P>
    <P>It seems strange to me that there are so many very well-equipped military barracks in the country that never have a garrison.  It can be said that it is peace-time, that there are not enough troops and yet we have personnel trying to maintain those barracks. I suggest that battalions should be sent out from headquarters to these barracks in the country for a couple of months each year and that it would be a good idea to issue a sudden order that a battalion should be moved within a time limit from Dublin to one of these outlying places.  We have such a barracks in Waterford but we hardly ever see a soldier there.  Deputy Esmonde has already referred to Duncannon Fort.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I do not like the idea of Government Departments thinking up schemes and asking the local authorities to carry them out and contribute to them.  It is a good thing that civil defence should be run locally as it gives local people the idea that they are useful.  Everything is not centralised in Dublin now as it used to be and if&mdash;God forbid&mdash; an emergency ever comes the people would be there and ready.  But the fault I find is that the local authority is made responsible and the ratepayers must foot the bill.  Deputies must try to get Ministers and Departments to break away from this arrangement.  It is a handy way of getting money, to make up some scheme and say: &ldquo;We will give 50 per cent or 60 per cent and the local authority must provide the balance.&rdquo;  The central authority can then wash its hands of the matter.  The central authority should be responsible for civil defence and should organise it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more Army personnel at various centres rather than in a few centres so as to train people and <Col N="842" /> let them know we have an Army in the country.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Army was got out of the bull's wool uniform but still, when we compare our young soldiers with visiting soldiers, we find the visitors have smarter uniforms. Young people at present demand a better standard in these things and that is a good tendency.  The Minister should see that our soldiers' uniforms for walking out are as smart as possible.  When I first came to the Dáil I mentioned the bull's wool in the case of the Garda and it was not well received by my colleagues in Government then, but I stood by it.  The Garda were entitled to smarter uniforms and I think the soldiers should have them also.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many Army bands we have but we have splendid Army bands which the people do not hear often enough.  I am associated with the group responsible for the Waterford theatre and I think it was during a recruiting drive that one Army band gave a concert there.  Up to then the younger generation had no idea that there existed an Army band. People do not listen very much to Army bands on the radio and I believe the radio cannot convey the presence of a band or an orchestra to the listeners.  It would be good for the Army and the great musical combinations in it if they were sent to various areas to play and be heard by the people.  They should be sent to our great seaside resorts to play in a season of music for, perhaps, a week.</P>

      <P>He must have been in Waterford for some time and got the benefit of some civilising influence. Now we come to something which is very important for soldiers&mdash;weapons. I am informed that we have a great deal of obsolete artillery, a museum of obsolete rifles, bayonets and a whole lot of stuff like that.  I am informed that the only battalion that is armed and equipped with modern weapons in the Army is the battalion we have in the Congo and that but for the fact that the arms were supplied by the United Nations they would not have such arms at all.</P>
      <P>I am told they have no self-propelling guns of any calibre in the artillery. I should like the Minister to tell us something about that.  I am told there is not a battalion in the Army which is equipped with fully automatic weapons and small arms.  I am told that a great deal of the range-finding equipment which the Army have is obsolete and the reason it is obsolete is that it is fit only for the artillery we have.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on this when he is replying.</P>

    <P>On the question of air-sea rescue work, I hope the Minister will make his commanding officers in areas commanding officers.

That is tying these men to the apron strings of the central authority here.  We have had some experience of that in the recent snow.  When people came to the officers and told them of the great difficulties they were experiencing&mdash;and there were officers and men willing and anxious to go out with their transport, some of which would have been very useful in pushing aside snow drifts&mdash;they could not go out to help because the order had been given to them not to go unless the local authority asked them to do so.  This is the usual by-passing of the Irish people again.  Surely it should be enough for a member of the local authority to see the commanding officer and tell him of certain roads with snow drifts six and seven feet high when the commanding officer is quite willing to go out?  The local authority may be 40 or 50 miles at the other end of the county.  The wires may be down.  Surely the attitude should not be that nothing can be done and to leave the people to freeze?  I would say to the Minister to do away with that.</P>
    <P>In the various areas where battalions of troops are stationed, men of high rank, colonels, commandants, and so on should be given <i>carte blanche</i> in an emergency so that at their own discretion, if members of the local authority or responsible people tell them there are people in distress, they may go to the rescue.  If that had been the case, there would not have been half the trouble in Wicklow or in the Nire valley in County Waterford during the recent snow storms.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of horse jumping.  A Fianna Fáil Deputy spoke about the men but never said a word about the horses.  I suppose the Minister knows what the steeplechase jockey said.  A man asked him: &ldquo;Why did you not win?&rdquo; and the jockey said: &ldquo;I could not win without the horse.&rdquo;  We know that the man contributes an awful lot but the horse does so as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> Buying horses is a chancey business, a gamble, and so on, and we all know that.  If the Minister gives a small subvention to the Army Jumping Team, they are confined to buying just a small number of horses that will eventually be ridden to find out which will be put on the team.  The only way to raise the quality in that respect is to give the people selecting them the authority to buy more horses and to keep on bringing in horses.  It is done in other countries, some of which are only small countries like ours.  They can see advantage in the great prestige for a country it is to have its flag raised at the great horse shows all over the world.  We have our great horse show here in Dublin but when you go to the Continent you discover that the horse shows there are greater still.  Greater numbers of people attend and there are many visitors from countries all over the world.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of pride to us that our flag is raised and that the Irish horse and the Irish rider wins a trophy.  Some very good riders have left the Army because they say promotion is slow in the Jumping Team.  The Minister can remedy that.  I agree with the Fianna Fáil Deputy who said we have too many lieutenants riding in the Irish Jumping Team.  The people with whom they are competing are colonels and officers of high rank.  The point is that those people contesting against the Irishman have the pay of colonels. It is very important.  The pay of the Irish Army man would not be considered great as against that of his competitors.  Our men have to go away and meet those people on level terms.  They have to mix with them and talk with them with the eyes of the world on them.</P>
    <P>It is very important that our men be turned out better than any of them&mdash; not just as good as them but better than any of their competitors&mdash;and it can be done.  Irish tailors have turned out magnificent outfits for the Irish Jumping Team.  The only thing that was wrong with them was that the men probably had to spend their lives in them.  The riding members of the Irish Jumping Team should be given <Col N="847" /> a special subvention and when they join the team they should be given at least two pairs of new hunting boots and a least two or three pairs of breeches.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to think carefully on that.  It is very important and is a source of pride.  I did see an Irish rider one day and it was a source of pride to me, when he was surrounded by Frenchmen and Italians who were talking out at the Show, that he was better turned out than any of them. However, when I saw him at a show two years afterwards, I think he had the same outfit on which had got a bit threadbare.  I am not casting any reflection on the man in that respect because I know he was doing the best he could.  It is only in this House we can talk about this and it is only in this House and through the Minister that we can remedy it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister now to let us see more of the Army around the country.  Let us hear more of the Army bands down the country.  If possible, let us have a ceremonial changing of the guard on what are called State days and holidays and at the opening of Parliament.  Let him get rid of his two corvettes and buy some oceangoing vessels that will be of some service to the country, more especially if they are used in conjunction with the new helicopters he is about to buy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any length on this Estimate because it is a waste of time to put any point of view before this House, particularly on the Defence Estimate. There is a vested interest involved, naturally enough, in the whole question of Defence, and speakers on both sides of the House are all part of this vested interest.  The vested interest in this is the matter of promotion of pals within the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people experienced in military matters who talk here about a defence system in this country will admit, if they are really honest, that a defence force of the type we have in Ireland is an absolute waste of money as regards the defence that could be put up by the forces available to the State. <Col N="848" /> That is not by any means meant as a criticism of the personnel involved. There is a sum involved here of no less than £9½ million, which is a very substantial sum of money.  On what is it being spent?  Is it for the purpose of having a couple of battalions out in the Congo for reasons of prestige?  Is it for the purpose of training a few soldiers and officers so that they can parade or mount guard as some Deputies want them to do?  Can we afford an expenditure of public money on flummery and nonsense of that nature, putting up a front?  Is that what we are prepared to spend the public's money on?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me what help the Army gave to the public during the very bad weather since last November?  On how many occasions have the Army come to the assistance of the community which is paying £9½ million to keep them there?  How many colonels or lieutenant-colonels got off their warm seats inside any barracks to move out and help in Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford during the snow storms and the terribly severe weather?  Surely if the Army is to be of any benefit it is on occasions such as this that this expenditure can be justified?  How many of them left or were directed to leave their barrack fires to go out and help the public who are paying for them?</P>
    <P>I do not know on whom the responsibility lies for the failure of the Army to help in these matters.  However, somebody must take the blame and the Minister is the responsible person in charge of the Forces.  Unless he is able to throw light on this then he personally must accept the blame for the deplorable lack of help on the part of the Army in the recent situation to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The main reason I stood up to speak at all was in connection with the policy that motivates the Government in sending troops to the Congo.  I know that in this House there are many people who have no compunction in the world about creating a number of war heroes, who would sympathise with the relatives and families of those who died in the Congo.  I know they are not worried about those who died <Col N="849" /> as long as the prestige of this country goes up in proportion to the numbers who die.  There is a blood lust in this country in regard to this business of fighting.  We can trace it down through the years in every history book or alleged history book that was ever written about this country.  There was never anything written about the advancement of human beings, civilisation or anything like that.  All Irish history is devoted to wars, fights, heroes and traitors.  Even today we have this situation of helping in the Congo, the belief that it is something we must do.</P>
    <P>Are we serious and are we honest about the use of our troops in the Congo?  The other countries which were asked to supply troops in the Congo include Sweden, India, Ghana and Nigeria, to mention some of the troops that were connected with the Irish troops and had associations with them. Will anybody in this House allege that the four nations I have mentioned are anything but neutral?  Is it not a fact that Sweden, Nigeria and Ghana are noted for their neutrality, that they were invited by the Secretary General of the United Nations to supply troops to the Congo on the basis that their neutrality could not be questioned? Ireland was so invited and our Minister for External Affairs in the past four to five years&mdash;I do not propose to bring in the debates in this House for record purposes again&mdash;has expressed himself before the United Nations Assembly as representing a country that does not want to be part of any power <i>bloc,</i> that deplores the creation of a third world power <i>bloc,</i> a country that is neutral.</P>
    <P>That is the reason Irish troops were selected for service in the Congo.  What is the position today?  We have the Taoiseach over in Bonn telling the Europeans that Ireland is not neutral, never was and never will be.  He tells the American journalists the same thing.  He says bluntly&mdash;backed by Deputy Dillon&mdash;that Ireland is not neutral and would accept any defence or political arrangements set up by the EEC.  How does the Taoiseach reconcile his European aspirations of non-neutrality with the fact that we have Irish soldiers risking their lives in <Col N="850" /> the Congo because Ireland is allegedly neutral?  Do the lives of a few Irishmen in the Congo matter at all?</P>
    <P>There are people here who are prepared to sympathise with the relatives of those who died in the Congo and say that Ireland has its heroes still. But the heroes are dying for a wrong cause.  These young Irishmen are idealists in their own way, but they are misguided in the sense that they do not know what they are fighting for.  They were sent out on the basis that this country is neutral in the terrible struggle between the two great world Powers today.  They are prepared to give their lives in the cause of freedom at the direction of the United Nations, while at home the Government who sent them out are prepared to say, for the purpose of gaining admission to this new commercial club of the EEC, that we are not neutral and never have been.  Where is the honesty there? Is it not hypocrisy from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I should like to go a little further. Last week, I asked the Taoiseach if he would elaborate on the discussions he and the Minister for External Affairs had with the members of the British Government in London.  I had to drag out of him&mdash;he would not say it&mdash;that one of the subjects discussed in London was the question of the Congo.  It was not important enough to bring the Minister for Agriculture when the question of trade was being discussed. However, the question of the Congo was also discussed.  I should like the Minister for Defence to tell me what was this discussion in connection with the Congo which his Taoiseach had with the members of the British Government within the past three weeks. Would it be correct to say that this discussion took the form of an assurance to the British Government that we were pulling out of the Congo as soon as this particular battalion, which has been invited, has completed its service? Is it a fact that we gave an assurance to some of our potential colleagues in Europe that we will no longer have hand, act or part in functions of this nature?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that certain countries in the EEC have been very <Col N="851" /> critical of Ireland's participation in this matter of the Congo.  We know that many of the false reports printed about Irish troops and alleging misconduct in the Congo emanated from countries which are members of the EEC. Deputies have rightly deplored the fact that Irish troops are blackguarded in official reports.  Why did those Deputies not point out that those reports emanated in many instances from the very countries we were down on our knees hoping to join in the EEC?</P>
    <P>While all this is going on, these young men are out in the Congo.  It is no thanks to this Government that more of them are not under the sod in the special plot in Glasnevin.  I notice when they die in the Congo now that, instead of the Taoiseach, the President, the Minister for Defence and all the other big knobs attending the funeral, they send their <i>aides de camp</i> and the lower fry.  They are getting used to the business.  It is an extraordinary situation that we find Senator Eoin Ryan going to Strasbourg as a representative of this Government, speaking on this question of Irish neutrality and saying that Ireland is not neutral and has no intention of being neutral in the future.  I am not quoting him but paraphrasing what he said.  He said that we in Ireland had the utmost sympathy with the Swedes who were neutral and that something must be done in Europe to get them in as associates of the EEC.  The Swedish delegate got up, however, and said that his recollection was that, up to a few weeks ago, Ireland needed the same sympathy because she was neutral also.</P>
    <P>Those two countries have sent troops to the Congo.  Our troops are fighting side by side with the Swedes, ready to shed their blood.  They were both sent on the basis that their countries were neutral.  What do these United Nation countries really think of Ireland when we say one thing as far as the Congo is concerned and another as far as the European situation is concerned?  The Government do not seem to know themselves what they have in mind, but the matter is too serious to let slip, especially when <Col N="852" /> the lives of young Irishmen are involved.</P>
    <P>I noted that Deputy Booth and one or two others referred to the troops who took part in the Jadotville action. I do not know how accurate it is, but I understand there has been no recognition, by decoration or otherwise, of the service given by the troops involved in that incident.  I should like to put it on record that I think the conduct of the Irish troops and their officers at Jadotville deserves the highest commendation. They showed common sense, intelligence and integrity.  Had they not displayed those characteristics, a further 50 or 60 young Irishmen might have been killed.  If there is no recognition of their services by the powers that be, it is, to me at any rate, positive proof that the mentality behind it is the same mentality as I referred to earlier, a bloodlust mentality.  The people concerned who have the decision in this would prefer to see these men as dead heroes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure him that it is a fact.  I should like the Minister, if he is in the inner circle of his Government, which I doubt very much&mdash;and the Minister is quite aware of the reasons why I doubt that&mdash;to tell the House what the discussion was in connection with the Congo that his Taoiseach had with the British Ministers. Was the Minister for Defence told what the discussion involved? Did a question of the use of Irish troops there arise in the course of the discussion and if so, was the Minister informed, and if he has not been informed, surely as Minister it is his right to know what took place at those discussions? Surely he will stir himself sufficiently to say to the Taoiseach &ldquo;Dear Taoiseach, can you tell me, as Minister for Defence, what this discussion about the Congo was?  I have a right to know as Minister for Defence, seeing that I am charged with the safety of all those young men we have sent out there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister should also seek clarification from the Taoiseach on this issue of neutrality.  The Minister is now preparing another battalion for service in the Congo and does he still maintain that as far as the Congo service is concerned, we are neutral and that we have been invited to send troops there because we are neutral in the eyes of the United Nations?  Does he consider it correct that for European purposes we say we are no longer neutral, that we never have been neutral and we are associating in very close union with the very countries who have been responsible for stirring up the tragic events which took place in the Congo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has drawn me to the extent of saying that I made charges against Army personnel and the people who give decorations.  I am now making a charge against the Government.  I charge them with a crime against the <Col N="854" /> Irish troops.  This Government obtained the permission of this House to send those troops over there because the United Nations invited them to go, on the ground that Ireland was a neutral country.  Deputies in this House at that time realised that vested mining interests of the Belgians and French in particular and of other countries were involved in the Congo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it is like the Charge of the Six Hundred&mdash; our troops are to go onward, onward to slaughter.  It does not matter what they have to face.  In this debate, we are not entitled to criticise their use or misuse, or suggest their withdrawal or continued use under the circumstances which obtain in the Congo. At any rate, all I have to say is that this Government, having acceded to the request of the United Nations to send troops to the Congo, are now in the process of ganging up with certain European States which behind the scenes were stirring up the trouble in the Congo in which Irish lives were lost.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that over £9½ million is requested in this Estimate for defence purposes and I posed the question: what is the purpose?  How is it to be expended? On other occasions here, I have asked for the setting up of a Select Committee of this House and the Seanad to examine into the whole question of defence expenditure.  The time is <Col N="855" /> over-ripe when such a committee should be set up and it would be a far better way of dealing with this question of expenditure than having an annual Estimate paraded in this House every year.  It is an insult to the people and to the Deputies who are asked to get up and comment on whether the jumping teams should get two sets of riding breeches a year, whether a barracks in Clare or Connemara should be opened or whether troops should be sent down to various barracks in the country rather than have them in the city.</P>
    <P>The main issue involved is: is the expenditure of money necessary and if so, is it being spent properly?  We are not going to get a proper answer to that by cross-examining a Minister who is the tool, shall we say, of Government policy.  The major Opposition Party, at the moment, are in the same boat.  What we want is to have those two Parties stop fooling and set up a Select Committee where we will have an opportunity of examining the whole question of expenditure and, arising from that, a proper decision can be taken on whether it is necessary to have a standing Army of the size we have, whether it is necessary for the purpose for which the money is now being used, whether the size of the Army should be increased or decreased, or whether we should consider the Army solely as an auxiliary to the police force and how much we are prepared to spend on the Army for prestige purposes.  All those questions could be examined coldly and calmly by such a committee.  They cannot be examined coldly and dispassionately in this House because Deputies are the last people in the world, when speaking in this Chamber, to speak in that fashion on a matter of this nature because they are out to collect votes.</P>
    <P>They have some kind of illusion that the Defence Forces will be able to protect this country in the event of an invasion.  I want to be charitable to those people who still think that is possible.  If such a committee as I have suggested were set up, all these questions of the proper type of recruiting <Col N="856" /> for the Army, proper treatment, proper dress and equipment could be properly discussed.  My opinion is that if we are to have an Army, we will certainly have to modernise the living conditions of the men.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister and other Ministers telling us that we are getting the most up-to-date equipment in so far as we have the money to purchase it.  They are proud of the fact that they have the latest submachinegun. What modern development has taken place in the treatment of the individuals who make up the force?  Has the same progress been made in that modern development as in the matter of modern equipment and weapons?  Do we still think in terms of big barrack rooms, and big long dormitories with no privacy for the soldiers?</P>
    <P>Do we still think in terms of an unfortunate young soldier who, through family responsibility in this country, may be tempted to go to work in England to make money to help his family in Ireland, being tried by a courtmartial and getting 200 days detention for what he was rightly entitled to do?  We have the shocking position here today that men in the Army can be punished by a group of officials comprising a courtmartial for a petty offence which would be thrown out of any normal civilian court.  An unfortunate young soldier can get 56 days detention.  That is done by men who have not the slightest knowledge of the law except what they have read up in Defence Force Regulations which have been there since 1922, which were, if you like, brought into one code a few years ago and some of which dated back 100 years or more to the early days of the old British army.  Modern treatment for the soldier, my foot.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 614 of the Official Report of 28th March, 1963, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The estimate for the pay of the Permanent Defence Force is, as usual, based on the full peace establishment of 1,359 officers and 11,607 men, with deductions in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength is likely to be below establishment over the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Instead of providing for 11,000 men, the estimate provides for 7,500.  In other words, at the moment we are 4,000 men short of what was envisaged as the standing army, and that has been the position since 1946, since the end of the emergency.  On paper, we have a standing army of 11,000 men, but since 1946, we have never filled that establishment and we have had about a half a dozen Ministers for Defence since then.</P>
    <P>We have had radio programmes and television programmes, and we have had bands going around the country with all sorts of gimmicks, to induce recruits into this wonderful Army, but since 1946, we have failed to reach the establishment figure.  What happened a couple of years ago, and what happened when the Congo business started?  The wise people in the Department of Defence, those brilliant gentlemen who were in charge of defence policy and administration said: &ldquo;Now we will get them in.  With the pomp, the prestige and the glory attaching to the Congo, wait until you see all the recruits, and we will not have to pay them one penny extra.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were people in this House who were foolish enough to believe that Congo service would bring a big influx of recruits.  I should like to challenge the Minister on how many new recruits joined the Army as a result of the glamour of service in the Congo. I challenge him to tell me whether one single extra man has come into the Army as a result.  Not at all.  We have the position that in spite of the Congo service and other service abroad in which our troops were engaged with distinction, the Government and the Army authorities have failed to get recruits.  Are we not living a lie so far as our defence is concerned?  Is money not being spent under false pretences? Is it not plain to the public that we have made provision for a standing army of 11,000 men, and that since 1946, we have not reached that strength, or come within 3,000 or 4,000 men of reaching it?</P>
    <P>The mentality behind this reminds me of the time I was in the Army myself. I was sent out on manoeuvres in charge of demolitions.  I was directed <Col N="858" /> to lay down anti-tank mines in a big area of the countryside.  That was the nearest approach we could get to the actual reality of war if it ever comes here.  Do Deputies know what the anti-tank mines were which it was my duty to lay down? &mdash; bits of trees, sawn-off lumps of wood.  I do not know how many hundreds of gallons of petrol I and the troops under me wasted going around laying the mines in the minefields.  It was stated on paper that it was a minefield, but we had not even one mine to lay if we had to do it in actual fact.  We were playing at soldiers, playing at minelaying, just the same as on the question of defence, we are playing at defence, but it is expensive playing and the public do not know what is happening.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Irish Jumping Team, I want to say to the Minister that if we want to win international events, we must widen the scope of the team. There is no justification in the world for making the Jumping Team a closed shop for Army personnel.  I think that civilians, if they come from the back end of Mayo but are good horsemen, should be entitled to represent this country abroad.  Whether they are in or out of the Army, they can bring credit to this country.  We are trying to gain kudos from Irish horses, and not from the Irish Army.  I am not criticising the Army and I want to get that into the heads of Deputies who may think I am.  If we are to win prestige from our Irish horses, we must pick the best horsemen.  If they are in the Army, well and good, and if they are not, we must go outside it. One year, four or five of our best horsemen may be Army men, and the next year, three or four civilians may be better.  The idea is that the team best fitted to represent the country is the team that should be selected.</P>
    <P>We know that the Government got rid of the cavalry escort and utilised motorcycles instead.  I heard Deputies talking about ceremonial parades and about the mounting of the guard that takes place at Buckingham Palace. I do not think any Deputy is serious in suggesting that we should ape that. At present a motorcycle escort is used on the occasion of visits by diplomats <Col N="859" /> and VIPs.  The motorcycles used by the Army may be assembled in Ireland but they come from Czechoslovakia, America, France or Britain.  The report of the CIO Investigating Committee made it quite clear that the motor assembly industry will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>If we are anxious to secure a good name for the Irish product, why is it that we do not utilise Irish horses for the escort duties for which motorcycles are used at present?  Would it not be a nicer spectacle for Deputies watching that type of ceremony if Irish horses were used for the purpose of escorting a visiting dignatary to Árus an Uachtaráin rather than 20 or 30 motorcycles?  If the Government are anxious to boost Irish horses, that is one way in which they can do so.</P>
    <P>Why was the cavalry escort discontinued and the motorcycle escort adopted?  Is it not a fact that a certain individual did not like the horses at the time?  Is it not a fact that he is no longer there and could not this question be revised?  What about the present occupant of the Park?  Surely he has no objection to the use of Irish horses for escort duty?  His predecessor had, but the present occupant of Árus an Uachtaráin is very fond of horses.  I would suggest that the Minister for Defence should have a chat with his former leader in the Park and say: &ldquo;How about going back to the cavalry escort?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No; I am referring to the obsolete jet planes which are the responsibility of the Minister for Defence.  I can well understand the Leas-Cheann Comhairle being slightly puzzled because no one has heard of these secret weapons for quite a while. I should like the Minister to tell us how many of these Vampire jets we have and how much of the taxpayers' money have these Vampires sucked out of the Department of Defence since they were purchased.  Were they utilised economically with regard to fuel, hours of flying, cost per hour?  How many Irish pilots have been trained in the Air Corps and are now employed by Aer Lingus as a result of the purchase of these jet planes?</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that when I criticised the purchase of these obsolete jet planes I was told, as I am often told, that I was anti-national, that these planes would enable numerous Irish pilots to be trained by the Army as short term commissioned officers, who would then be recruited into Aer Lingus.  How many have been recruited to Aer Lingus as a result of the purchase of the Vampire jet planes?  Is it not a fact that Aer Lingus had to go outside the scope of this arrangement and make alternative arrangements for the training of their pilots and that at the same time the taxpayer had to pay over £1 million for the purchase of these obsolete planes and for the construction of a runway to enable them to be flown?  To me it represented a scandalous waste of public money, a sum of íl million down the drain, and you cannot get a sixpenny bit out of this Government for social services or for old age pensioners or any other needy group.</P>

    <P>When I refer to these jets and make other criticisms of the Army, I do so, <Col N="861" /> not for the purpose of criticising individual members of the Army, many of whom are personal friends of mine, but of criticising the entire set-up, the thought behind it, the misuse of funds. The only way this question can be properly examined is, as I have suggested, by setting up a Select Committee of this House to examine into the whole question of defence expenditure. The sooner that is done, the better and the more the public will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>A number of matters were referred to by almost every Deputy and I take it that it is to these that I should direct my attention chiefly.</P>
      <P>With regard to resignations mentioned by Deputy MacEoin, and his reference to newspaper suggestions of large-scale resignations from the Defence Forces in the past 12 months, I want to assure the Deputy now that that is not so.  The Deputy was referring, I think, to resignations of officers.  The Deputy knows that under the pensions scheme an officer becomes entitled to pension after 20 years' service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past 12 months, 17 officers retired or resigned on grounds other than age or ill health. Three of these went to Aer Lingus as pilots.  So far as I know, the majority of the others went to good civilian jobs. The fact is that most of these men who leave the Army on the minimum pensionable service usually get good employment here and are available for the defence of the country should an emergency arise.  During the last emergency, a great many of that type came forward and we were, indeed, very glad to have them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accusations made against our troops, and against the United Nations Force generally, in the Congo some months ago, I am at one with Deputy MacEoin when he says that, while no one here in his wildest imaginings believed any of the accusations made, there could have been a black sheep, to use the Deputy's expression, and it was necessary to establish beyond yea or nay that no Irishman had any hand, act or part in such events there.  That fact was established.</P>
      <P>With regard to delay, I want to assure Deputies&mdash;there was more than one who spoke about this matter&mdash; that there was no avoidable delay.  A letter was published by a member of the Oireachtas referring to this allegation and charging undue delay.  On the very day that letter was published, the Minister for External Affairs issued a statement indicating the steps that had been taken and the date on which each such step was taken.  That statement was a complete refutation of the charge of delay.  It is hardly necessary for me now to go any further than that.  The Minister for External Affairs may have something to say on the matter when he moves his Estimate.  Certainly, if Deputies ask him about it, he will say something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter raised was the suggestion of favouritism in selections for <Col N="863" /> the Congo.  This is, of course, a purely military matter and, as Minister for Defence, I do not interfere in the discretion reposed in the headquarters staff in choosing personnel to form units for service in the Congo.  I get representations from Deputies and others.  These I pass on for consideration on their merits.  From the inquiries I have made, I am quite sure that merit, and merit alone, is the guiding principle in the decisions. There is one overriding consideration: the headquarters staff want to spread this service over as large a number as possible.  If it happens that certain officers and NCOs have had two trips &mdash;a very small number have had three &mdash;I understand there is a very special reason for that: the purpose is to keep the practical liaison that has been established since the beginning.  In other words, the purpose is to ensure that there will not be a completely new unit with no tie-up with its predecessors. That entails the sending of a very small number a second or a third time.  The principle of sending out new personnel is on the whole always observed.</P>
    <P>I was asked by several Deputies whether I was satisfied with the pay and allowances.  It is very easy for me to answer that question.  I do not think I am.  I do not think any pay would be too much for our Army. That, of course, is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Within the resources of our little country, I think we do reasonably well.  It is very easy to belittle the military effort of a small <Col N="864" /> country like ours.  There are, however, some of us who still retain our faith in such effort.</P>
      <P>With regard to the School of Equitation, I have yet to be convinced of the force of the argument put forward by a number of speakers that there should be a mixed team of Army personnel and civilians.  It is true that civilian jumping teams go abroad. As a matter of fact, I understand there are two organised civilian bodies catering for Irish horse jumping.  The Army teams go abroad but it has not been demonstrated by any of the speeches made here that a mixing of these two elements would produce better results. By all means, let the civilians go and bring the best horses and riders they have, but I cannot see why it is necessary that they should have a leavening of men in uniform, or conversely why the men in uniform should have a leavening of civilians in order to get better results.</P>
      <P>There is a set policy being followed by the Equitation School and I am satisfied from all the evidence supplied to me that it is a sound policy&mdash;sound with regard to the purchase of horses and sound with regard to the training of riders.  I was asked by Deputy MacEoin how the purchase of horses was effected.  There is a purchasing board composed ordinarily of three members&mdash;at the moment there is one vacancy.  The other two are the officer commanding the Equitation School and a senior veterinary officer of the Department of Agriculture.  With regard to the suggestion&mdash;I do not know where Deputy MacEoin got it &mdash;that a horse bought for £2,000 had been disposed of to the knackers, it simply is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion was made that a horse bought for £2,000 was not worth twopence, that it was sold for £45.  That is why I put down a Parliamentary Question <Col N="865" /> asking what prices were given and what prices were got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, the Deputy seemed to think there was some inconsistency between the reply I gave to his question and remarks made by me in my introductory statement.  What I was trying to do, while refusing to give figures for individual purchases, was to keep to the practice of not indicating the prices of named horses. The practice has been that we would not divulge the prices of particular horses and, while keeping to that practice, I gave the Deputy prices of individual horses without identifying the horses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
      <P>The uniform was mentioned by practically every speaker.  I am in full agreement with the sentiments expressed that our men should be turned out as smartly as possible.  I do not think, however, there can be any criticism of the good quality of the cloth.  It has been praised very much across channel.  Design, I understand, is the main cause of difficulty here and that problem has been under consideration for some time.  I am hopeful that before this Estimate comes before the Dáil again, a satisfactory solution of the question of design will have been reached.</P>
      <P>It is a matter, of course, of considerable financial import because of the large number of uniforms involved. Nevertheless, I think the financial aspect will not cause any delay in finding a solution.  The desirability of keeping a stock of material of the same cloth&mdash;this was raised here last week when the necessity for its purchase was questioned&mdash;was brought home very clearly to us when the Cuban crisis loomed up last year.  We had not the stocks which we would have liked.  That situation brought about a decision to lay in a stock.  This will enable issues to be made as the need arises and the current annual contracts will always be called upon to top up withdrawals as they take place in the normal course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> With regard to cadets, two speakers at least said we hold them too long before finding out that they are unsuitable material for officerships.  There is not much substance in this complaint. Looking up the figures, I find that 44 cadets were recruited in 1961 and that of these three were let go, one after six months and two after 12 months, while of 40 recruited in 1962, one was let go after three and a half months.  You have the two difficulties to face there, one being that you may not give a young chap a sufficient trial, and that is a matter of concern to the officers in charge of the Military College&mdash;they do not wish to send young fellows away until quite satisfied that they have not in them the makings of good officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is that possibility, but the number is not large. With regard to Civil Defence, I cannot agree with the opinion that it should be made a national responsibility.  Let us take one hazard&mdash;that of radioactive fallout.  We do not have to be militarily involved to have this to contend with.  Assuming there were a major war, it is obvious that we could have a radioactive fallout problem to deal with.  To meet this, Civil Defence must be civil in fact.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, dealing in the ordinary way with problems of the relief of distress, have fire-fighting apparatus, ambulances and so on, and if there is a natural disaster, the local authority is the first on the scene.  It is natural, therefore, to base Civil Defence on the local authority.  If there were radioactive fallout in a remote part of the country, there would be no point in sending military personnel there.  Radioactive protection is something that can only be effected locally. Civil Defence is designed to teach people what to do.  They must protect themselves and the methods of doing so are described in a handbook which we hope to issue at an appropriate time.  But if the people in an area affected by radioactive fallout do not themselves carry out these precautions, there is nothing anybody else can do for them.</P>

As it is, the Government contribute so much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not competent to answer that question.  Under Civil Defence, the vehicles are physically present at these locations and the Deputy may draw his own conclusion as to what would be done with them, if there were urgent need.</P>
      <P>Helicopters have been discussed.  It has sometimes been said here that it was <i>infra dig</i> nationally for us to ask others to supply helicopters in situations of danger or distress.  Most of these situations occurred at sea around our coasts and I could never see that it was <i>infra dig</i>.  We have never accepted lighthouses as a national service because the vast bulk of sea traffic off our coast is not Irish.  Nobody ever seemed to think it was nationally <i>infra dig</i> that that service was not taken over by any Government here.</P>
      <P>However, the Government have now made a decision with regard to helicopters. Too many Deputies, and too many people who have been reading what Deputies have said about helicopters, may be placing too much reliance on their capabilities as a means of lifesaving where other means fail.  So far as I can find out, there has been only one situation around our coasts, and that is the one referred to by Deputy Lynch off the Wexford coast, in which a helicopter would have been effective when the lifeboat was not.  Helicopters are not unfailing, universal lifesavers in all situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan thinks they should be used at Croagh Patrick pilgrimages but most pilgrims I know will continue to prefer to make the pilgrimage the hard way.  It has been suggested that helicopters, when not engaged in lifesaving, <Col N="869" /> should be used for spotting poachers inside our three-mile limit and it has been suggested that they should be placed at two or three different locations.  One or two Deputies seem to have quite a fund of technical information about helicopters but what I have been told is that this is technically and practically impossible. The service simply could not be provided unless these three machines are kept together.  You must have three as a minimum if you are to be sure of always having one in service.  That is what the experts tell me about it. I think it answers, without any further elaboration from me, the plea that the machines be segregated and placed at two or three different posts.</P>
    <P>With regard to their efficacy as poacher spotters, I have no doubt they will be able to spot the poachers all right but there is one thing that the helicopter cannot do.  It cannot arrest the poachers.  It can pass on information to the corvettes but it will not be able to do any more than spotting. Perhaps that may mean that information will be made available more readily to the authorities of the Naval Service but I do not think it means that the corvettes would be any sooner on the location than they would be by getting a call from the Garda.</P>
    <P>I have not got sufficient information to say that the corvettes are the most effective means possible of dealing with poachers.  We have had some expert opinion this afternoon about the type of boat that would be more effective.  As one Deputy says, it may be that they are too big, too slow and of too deep draught and that the previous Minister should have availed of an offer which he received for them.  The fact, if it is true, that an offer was made for them indicates that they are not quite as worthless as is sometimes made out.  The information supplied to me with regard to their seaworthiness is that they will be serviceable for anything from six to eight or nine years.  I take it that they will be retained for a number of years to come and that will give us time to decide what type of boat should replace them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any <Col N="870" /> international protocol in relation to the types of boats comprising a naval service even as small as ours.  It is possible that, as we are a maritime country &mdash; an island &mdash; international usage requires that we have craft of a certain kind.  We shall have time enough to resolve that aspect of the question as well as suitability from the point of view of fishery protection before it becomes necessary to replace them.</P>
    <P>I was interested in one remark made by Deputy T. Lynch with regard to the corvettes.  He had much the same to say about them as other Deputies. He said they were out of date.  He also said that a Russian officer &mdash; he was accepting the Russian officer's statement &mdash; said that the Russian boat taken prisoner recently could have got away: in other words, it had greater speed than our corvette.  The fact is that it did not get away.  Nevertheless, Deputy T. Lynch is prepared to accept that it could.</P>
    <P>With regard to the FCA, I think it was Deputy Corish who had a good deal to say about the rather quick turnover of personnel.  In such a force, that is inevitable.  Young chaps join it.  There is a good deal of comradeship and, in itself, that is an inducement to join.  Naturally, young fellows will tire even of military service. Furthermore, young chaps of the age of those who join the FCA have their careers to look after.  They must attend to their studies.</P>
    <P>There are various reasons in the life of a young lad why he may not be able to continue service in the FCA for as long as we should like.  They get a certain amount of military training&mdash; the rudiments, in any event.  To the extent to which they remain in the country, they will be better material than completely untrained material if their services should ever be required. Therefore as in the case of officers who leave at an early age and go into civilian employment, it is not an entirely unmixed blessing.</P>
    <P>There is always a difficulty in retaining the Army Bands at full strength.  The musicians get a good training.  They are taken into the Bands at an earlier age than into any other <Col N="871" /> section of the Army.  When they are trained, it is easy for them to get employment outside.  It is the policy, in so far as it is possible, to send the Bands around to certain places.  A number of seaside and other places have been chosen for visitation this coming summer.</P>
    <P>That reminds me also of the suggestion about marching our Army up and down the town displaying them and having them do guard duties, and so on.  Some people say that one of the difficulties in keeping young men in the Army is that there may be too much of this.  Deputy Tully said that all this marching is quite barbarous. There are opposing opinions on the amount of military duties that ought to be imposed on soldiers.  Personally, I think we have to strike as reasonable a compromise as possible.  If we largely eliminate the usual features of army life, then it will cease to be an army.  There is a minimum of discipline that everybody will agree must be observed.  I can assure Deputies that we are doing everything as quickly as we can to make the living conditions as comfortable as possible.  I mentioned a number of matters in my opening statement.  I will not refer further to them but they are constantly in mind.</P>
    <P>In regard to houses I do not accept that the local authority in an area in which there is a military station has no obligation for the housing of soldiers. Nevertheless we do the best we can to help and, as I said in my opening statement, we have built in recent years over 160 houses and 20 will be built this year.  I must say that, generally speaking, the local authorities are not averse from giving houses to the military, even though they may press us to build more.</P>
    <P>I was not terribly pleased with one Deputy's suggestion about the noncommissioned officers who achieved commissioned rank at the end of last year.  Quite gratuitously, in my opinion, he suggested that these newly-promoted officers might be looked upon as second-class officers.  That is a most un-called-for remark and if it were true, it <Col N="872" /> would be a reflection not on the men promoted but rather on those who held any such view.  I deprecate the suggestion very much.</P>
    <P>I do deal with the Organisation of National ex-Servicemen, of which, I understand, Deputy Tully, who made the remark, is an officer.  There are matters, however, touching the Army which are not appropriate for discussion with this organisation.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Deputies have continued to repeat that the Army failed to help in the recent bad weather. The allegation was made by two or three Deputies and perhaps I might be permitted to quote for the House a letter received by the officer commanding at Clonmel from the chief agricultural officer in Waterford:</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in transmitting to you a resolution of thanks passed by my committee at their recent meeting. The committee in passing this resolution pay a tribute to you and to the officers and troops concerned from Kickham Barracks for the prompt response made to the call for assistance to the farming people in the Nire Valley during the period of the snow blizzard there.  It is felt that the committee are not only speaking for themselves but for the people of the Nire Valley who greatly value the relief given to them in the work of the troops there.</P>
    <P>We had a communication in similar terms from the Dublin County Council in relation to their area.  It is very difficult to understand why Deputies keep on saying that the Army failed in this respect.</P>

      <P>We had a question from one Deputy in relation to help for a particular place.  I answered the question on the information available in my Department, but what we were not aware of was that the military were actually helping the people in that particular place at the time the Deputy sent his telegram and wrote his letter, and the Deputy did not know it.  The fact is that once the go-ahead was <Col N="873" /> given by the Department to the military, they went out and did the job.</P>
      <P>It seems strange to me that we should be asked to ignore the local authority which is always regarded as the authority for dealing with these natural disasters, that we should bypass them and act on the phone message or telegram of everybody who chooses to communicate with us in that way.  We would be sending off detachments of troops to Kerry, Connemara or Donegal to find that, in fact, the local authority was already adequately dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to the charge about the delay in refuting the Congo allegations and to say that if it was so hard for us to have the truth of what was happening here in the next county of Wicklow accepted, it can be realised how difficult it was to handle a similar problem 6,000 miles away.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó ná £1,458,210 chun slánaithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an muhirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhártha, 1964, le haghaidh Pá Scortha, Pinsin, Cúiteamh, Liúntais agus Aiscí is iníoctha faoi Reachtanna Éagsúla le Comhaltaí d'óglaidh na hÉireann agus d'Eagraíochtaí áirithe Míleata eile. <Col N="875" /> etc., nó ina leith sin, agus le haghaidh Ranníocaí agus Costais Éagsúla i ndáil leo sin, etc.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is for a net sum of £2,187,310, which is an increase of £321,850 on the original Vote for 1962-63.  As a result of last year's Budgetary increases, however, a sum of £171,150 was provided in the Vote for Increases in Pensions in respect of the pensions and allowances for which my Department is responsible.  The net increase, therefore, is £150,700, but the difference of nearly £322,000 between the present Estimate and the original Vote for 1962-63 shows that the cost, for a full year, of the last Budgetary increases is very substantial indeed.</P>
    <P>The Estimate itself follows the usual pattern.  It is clear and calls for little explanation.  Special allowances and pensions and allowances under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes continue to increase in number, while the number of military service pensions and wound and disability pensions shows a decrease&mdash;a development which, regrettably, has to be expected due to the effluxion of time.</P>
    <P>The provision for special allowances has now become very substantial at £587,000.  At present there are about 7,100 allowances on pay and with the increase of the appropriate annual sums and the relaxations in the means test the average amount of a special allowance is now somewhat above £80.  The combined provision for military service pensions and special allowances is £1,253,000 or considerably more than one half of the total Estimate and members of the Old IRA and kindred organisations, as well as their dependants, also benefit substantially from the other major subheads.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate on pensions generally only a few months ago on the occasion of Deputy MacEoin's motion.  I think, therefore, that there is no need for me to say any more in introducing the Estimate but I shall be glad to deal with any questions which may be raised in the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be no <Col N="876" /> harm to start where the Minister left off.  He has come to the conclusion it is not necessary for him to say much because he said it all a couple of months ago on a motion before the House in my name.  I would like to repeat what I said then, that the appeal I made on that occasion was the last appeal I was going to make to this Fianna Fáil Government for justice for my former comrades, whether they were with me or against me at a certain period in this country's history. I now repeat that it is not my intention to ask the Government to do anything further.  They mobilised all their battalions to vote against that motion. Indeed, they embarrassed some of my former comrades who had to vote against it.</P>
      <P>It is true the Minister said in reply he was examining some of the points raised in relation to the widows of persons in receipt of 100 per cent disability pensions due to wounds.  I thought that after two months, the Minister might have mentioned the matter now.  I am glad to note that the widow of a former soldier has been granted a pension, notwithstanding the fact that the cause of death on the death certificate was different from the disability in respect of which the pension was granted.  Would the Minister say in reply what decision he has been able to come to in these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also disappointed in relation to serving personnel and former members of the Defence Forces.  A strong case has been made here in relation to the withdrawal of the two years' extension of service for those in good health and physically and mentally fit or those who had a military service medal.  Their service could be extended for two years over and above retirement. The Minister and the Government withdrew that privilege, as it might be called, or the right, and gave them two years' pay in lieu of the service.  If they had been allowed to serve on for two years, they would have had increased pay and increased allowances and their pension and gratuity would have been considerably higher.  The Government, in my opinion, imposed on this relatively small number of officers a very great <Col N="877" /> hardship and a grave injustice.  In view of the fact that there is a small number and a small amount involved the Minister should have been able to tell us that it was his intention to pay these officers that gratuity and increased pension to which I submit they were entitled under the regulations which then obtained.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Army or anybody else that when a change of Government occurs, a grave alteration should be made in the decisions of the previous Administration.  That should be avoided.  The Government and the Minister were ill-advised to take that step.  These were all officers who were physically and mentally fit to serve for the further two years but the Minister's predecessor arbitrarily withdrew the right to serve for the additional two years and simply told them they had to go.  They suffered under a grievance and those who served the country so well should not be left to suffer under any such grievance.</P>
    <P>As I said, the number is getting smaller every year as far as the pensions are concerned.  No doubt the special allowance is increasing as the age of 70 is arrived at but when they come to 75, the roll call will be low. The Lord will have called upon a great number of them.  By watching the daily papers, we can see that the numbers who are dying are increasing daily, I regret to say.  There is no day on which you do not see the flag going up for some of the old members. However, as I say, I am not going to appeal any more, but as the Minister did say that he was examining this matter, I should like to know what headway he has made with his examination and what is the position now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the special allowances, I should like to compliment the Minister on the increased rates he has given during my short time here.  They have exceeded the special allowances given at any other time.  On behalf of the people who are getting the special allowances, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to draw attention and which the Minister may possibly be <Col N="878" /> able to remedy in some way or other. One of these is the delay in giving the special allowance.  I know of cases where the investigation has been going on for years.  They have been dealing with one particular case since I came into this House.  A decision has not yet been given.  It has not been turned down but it has not been given.  Something should be done to obviate these long delays.  One way would be to do as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, does, that is, to back pay the pension to the date of the application.  If something like that were done, it would be a help, or at least it would spur on the Department to carry out the investigations more quickly because they would know they were losing money.  It is not fair to hold up people for such a long time.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult because these people will come to me and ask: &ldquo;Have you heard anything since about the special allowance?&rdquo; It is rather embarrassing when one has to say no, that it is still being investigated. People's patience wears out and I feel they have a genuine grievance about the delay.  Once their former commanding officers receive the query from the Department, they sign it, give their report and send it away, so that there is no delay on the part of their colleagues.  From my own experience, limited as it is, I find they go to a lot of trouble trying to find out whether a person was a member in the vital three months period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take the Deputy up on that.  This delay is annoying to those people who have given valuable service to the cause.  I know it is difficult to investigate something that happened 40 years ago. Memories are inclined to become dim and not to be quite as clear as they would be about something that happened yesterday.  I feel that the examinations go too deeply, that you more or less want to have a cast-iron case and even then the Department might not be satisfied.  I would be grateful if something were done to speed up the examinations and pay the <Col N="879" /> amounts retrospectively to the date of application.</P>
      <P>A number of applications have been turned down because the medical report sent in with the application was not right.  I know of two cases where they were written off because the medical report was not right.  In one of those cases, the person was lying in hospital at the time, having suffered a heart attack.  I can tell you that it did not help his recovery to get a notice saying that his medical report was not sufficient to warrant a further investigation in regard to a special allowance.  I feel there is no need to go so thoroughly into the medical report at the start.  They are usually brought up to St. Bricin's and there are thorough and exhaustive tests.  It is only at that stage that a pension is granted.</P>
      <P>Those are the two principal grouses or complaints I hear.  There is one other which comes to mind.  Comparing the Minister's Department with other Departments, when an appeal is made on means I am never very happy about it.  I never feel that the case has been given an exhaustive test.  It may be that the Department are so thorough that mistakes are never made, but to go back to the Department of Social Welfare I always feel that in quite a number of cases you get something on appeal to that Department.</P>
      <P>I know a man whose appeal for a special allowance was turned down because he was £3 over the limit.  I felt I put up quite a good case for him. He is a farmer.  I brought in other factors, and I felt they would warrant bringing his means down, but when the return came back it was the same as before.  I should like to feel a bit happier about appeals on the ground of means.</P>
      <P>To recap, I should like to compliment the Minister on the increases he has given during his term of office.  I ask him to see if anything can be done about the delays in regard to special allowances, and not to go so thoroughly into the medical report at the start.  I should also like him to look into cases that are slightly over the means so that we could be confident that appeals are fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I always speak about these matters.  I suppose, being an old IRA man, I naturally have the old IRA in mind more than the regular Army.  There are other speakers who will speak about the viewpoint of the regular Army.  I always speak about the raw deal people got in the past and I intend to refer to it again without going into detail.</P>
      <P>I have here a letter I received from Sligo.  It is an example of the type of person I say got a raw deal.  The letter reads:</P>
      <P>Please excuse me for writing you this letter but as an old IRA man who has been badly treated I have read on several occasions where you championed the cause of the old IRA.  I have made big sacrifices to help the Republican cause since 1915.  I was in the Irish Volunteers in 1916.  We had a small company of about 40 members.  I was in jail in 1920 being in the dock with the late Brigadier Frank Carty, TD, and was also 12 months in internment camps including Castlebar Jail, Claremorris and Newbridge Camp. ...I would be grateful if you could let me know the best approach to make to the Minister to have my case reopened as I have received no pension so far.  I got a pre-truce medal.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of case I have complained about.  This man served during the Tan War and was in jail during the Tan War.  He was also in jail during the Civil War and he got nothing. He must have lost a tremendous amount.  If he was a young ambitious man he ruined his career. Young people now attend technical schools to prepare themselves for jobs for which they must have training. Some time ago many young men threw their future to the winds.  They attended parades.  They were in jail in the Tan War and they were in jail in the Civil War but they got nothing. They are the people I am always shouting about.  They are the people I say should have got some gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect that at this stage anything will be done but I want to draw attention to the fact that there are <Col N="881" /> thousands of people who got a raw deal.  They should be treated generously at this stage.  The special allowances should be eased a bit to include them. There should also be an old soldiers' home, or a ward in St. Bricin's or somewhere else, where an old IRA man could go when he reached a certain age or when he was beyond employment because of illness.  There are old IRA men in St. Kevin's and they die there. There are a number of them with a little bit of mental trouble in St. Brendan's.  If those men wanted to live the last few years of their lives in a hospital they should be able to do so as is the case in Britain but there is no recognition for them.</P>
    <P>There are no laurels to be won in a civil war.  It is hard to make a case for a pension for shooting your brother. Nevertheless, men who got a pension for the Tan War were also granted a pension for the Civil War.  In other words, whereas in one case it did not matter whom you fired at&mdash;whether it was the enemy or your brother&mdash;you got a pension, but if you were not what was called an active member in the Tan War, if you attended parades every day during the Tan War and stood waiting to be called on active service, you were told that you would not get a pension. In other words, you had to shoot somebody and we must all admit that you cannot go and shoot people on your own.  You have to be told to go to shoot someone.</P>
    <P>The officers got a pension if they had command of so many men.  In some cases, officers got pensions for doing nothing.  They got pensions for not encouraging the men to do something and the poor men who were waiting to be ordered out got nothing.  A man could have been active during the Tan War, on parade three nights a week, neglecting his business and his future, and get nothing.  He got nothing for the Civil War although he had been a member in the Tan War.  The other fellow who threw one bomb, perhaps, in the Tan War is regarded as having been active and gets recognition for service in the Civil War.</P>
    <P>Why was service in the Civil War recognised in respect of anyone?  If it <Col N="882" /> was recognised in some cases, why was not credit given in other cases?  A man could have been a member throughout the Tan War, and have fought throughout the Civil War, have suffered a long term of imprisonment, have been ruined in business, and would not get a penny.  That is the type of case referred to in the letter I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am not expecting much at this late stage.  The Minister admits that these people are dying off, that the service and disability pensions are diminishing. He says the special allowances are increasing.  They will diminish also at some stage.  The Minister ought to be more generous and ease the conditions for the special allowance. He should do something about these people who are in mental homes and institutions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the last speaker to appeals against decisions.  I am aware of cases where men applied in respect of a disability and were turned down and, on appeal, were turned down again.  The point is, they were turned down by the same doctors. I maintain that that is not right.  In a court of law an appeal is made to a different judge, not the judge who heard the case in the lower court.  I understand that where insurance companies are concerned, in the case of an appeal a different medical board hears the appeal.  It is not fair that in the case of applicants for disability pensions it should be the doctors who turned down the original application who should deal with the appeal.  How can a doctor who has turned down a case be expected to admit later on that he was wrong?  It is too much to ask of human nature.  There ought to be a different board for appeals.</P>
    <P>There are supposed to be 50,000 or 60,000 medal holders.  In the event of their making application for a special allowance their cases are re-examined. The mere possession of a medal will not be sufficient.  As years go by, there will be people applying for a special allowance.  Where will the proof be that their case is genuine? I have asked the Minister and will ask him again to examine all these cases now and, where he is satisfied with <Col N="883" /> the evidence, issue a certificate.  The person concerned should have the assurance that he will not be regarded at some future stage as not a genuine case.  As things stand, a fake can have a medal and prove membership. The only way a person can prove he is a genuine member is by the production of a certificate that he has been examined by a board.  Without a certificate, a genuine member feels that he may be regarded as a fake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing which strikes me about the debate on this Estimate each year.  We hear from successive Ministers about the dwindling number of applicants but we also hear from Deputies about the number of genuine cases they know in which pensions or special allowances are not being granted.  We have heard of such cases from Deputy Crinion of the Fianna Fáil Party, from Deputy Sherwin, an Independent, and we will hear of them from Deputies on this side of the House.  Deputy Crinion has gone so far as to tell the Minister that he knows one case with which he has been dealing for 12 months and a special allowance has not yet been granted.  Deputy Crinion is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, as is the Minister, and if he cannot get a special allowance within a year, the people in Opposition have not much chance of getting one before the poor unfortunate veteran passes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to try to explain what is the cause of the delay. Deputy Sherwin has pointed out that before a medal is granted full inquiries are made and there is a thorough examination of the facts and, if the authorities are satisfied, a service medal is granted.  At the time of the issue of that medal the recipient may not qualify for or may not wish to seek a special allowance but as time goes on and as physical disability sets in and he is no longer able to care for himself he decides to seek what he is duly and legally entitled to, a special allowance, and he finds that one of the conditions precedent for the allowance is another investigation as to whether he is entitled to the medal or otherwise.  As the Deputy has <Col N="884" /> pointed out, many certifying officers have passed on to their eternal reward and there is no person to confirm that the applicant gave active service or service which entitled him to a medal.</P>
    <P>I know of a case of P.J. McGlinchey of Moneelan Crossroads, Killygordon.  That man was granted a Black and Tan medal some years ago.  His service was certified by the late Commandant Eddie McBrearty, a man who did his part for his country, both in the National Army and pre-Truce. McBrearty passed on, unfortunately. McGlinchey found his health deteriorating and applied for a special allowance and after some considerable time, was told that not only was he not entitled to a special allowance but that his medal was being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>That was a case where there was no person left to re-certify the pre-Truce service.  His commanding officer had passed on.  Not only did he find himself without a special allowance, but he found himself without a medal. That is very unfair.</P>
    <P>There must be some reason why the Minister is suspicious of medal holders. There must have been a time when medals were dished out <i>ad lib</i>.  I should like to know when that time was.  It was always said that at one stage in a certain county the secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann had applications for medals certified in blank and that as you joined the cumann, you were handed out these certificates.  I do not know whether that is true or not but it is very suspicious when we now are re-investigating the eligibility or otherwise of applicants for these pre-Truce medals.</P>
    <P>Again, if a man is entitled to a medal and has received it according to the law of the country, surely there are only two other matters to be investigated: (1) his physical condition and (2) his means?  Most of these unfortunate people have been in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, national health assistance or some other help from the State.  Their means are known in advance in the majority of cases to the investigation officer.  In the minority, it should surely be possible to assess the means of unfortunate applicants <Col N="885" /> for a special allowance in a few weeks. It should not take very long to investigate their means.  These people should have priority over applicants for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  They are few in number. A special effort should be made to expedite the investigation of their means.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a condition precedent of their application that they must be physically unfit to earn a livelihood.  In most cases, it is a case of <i>res ipsa loquitur;</i> you have only to look at them and you know.  Generally their applications are accompanied by certificates from one or two doctors. These doctors know that their findings will be confirmed or affirmed by military medical specialists.  Surely it should not be months&mdash;aye, and even years&mdash;before these applicants are called before a board to confirm whether they are physically disabled or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I know of one case in which I was seeking a special allowance for a poor man in Kincasslagh.  He got an allowance of £80 after 12 months.  The notification came on the morning of his funeral.  Actually the cheque for the first portion of the allowance also came on the morning of his funeral. It was returned and the authorities would not even permit the funeral expenses to come out of it.  These are sad cases.  They are cases which should never occur.</P>
    <P>I know another case, a veteran of the Black and Tan war, a veteran of the Civil War, a veteran who was opposed to the National Army in the Civil War, a man who played an honourable part both before and after the Truce, a man called James Gallagher from Calhame.  That man was in receipt of an old age pension. He applied for, and obtained, a special allowance.  He was a bedridden cripple. After some years, it was discovered by the investigation officer that his wife was earning a few pounds a week knitting.  What was the result?  His special allowance was withdrawn.  That was bad enough, but the other day he received a civil bill from the Minister for Defence for a couple of hundred <Col N="886" /> pounds.  I warn the Minister that if he sends his bailiffs in to execute a decree against Jimmy Gallagher, they go in at their peril.  That is the thanks this poor man gets for the service he rendered to this State.</P>
    <P>Mark you, not only are the Government not satisfied with victimising Jimmy Gallagher by suing him for the return of his special allowance but by post yesterday he received a letter from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, informing him he was going to issue a civil bill for the return of the old age pension, and all because the wife of that unfortunate veteran was industrious enough to try to earn a few shillings for herself.  I would ask the Minister to look into that particular case and to issue instructions that the civil bill be withdrawn and not let it go through the circuit court.</P>
    <P>The Minister can keep in touch closely with the means of these unfortunate veterans, but I should like him to go a little further and keep in even even closer touch with them from another point of view.  Quite recently in Dungloe, two veterans of the Black and Tan war, one, a colonel in the National Army, Colonel Neil O'Donnell, and the other, Lieutenant Eddie Gallagher, both passed to their eternal reward.  No guard of honour of any description was supplied by the Defence Forces.  There was not even a Tricolour to wrap around their coffins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister or the Department for the absence of honours to these two soldiers, but I suggest that the Minister, through the FCA, who are in every parish in the country, should be informed when a veteran passes on, a veteran who is entitled to certain military honours.  It should be the duty of the FCA to ensure that these honours are rendered.  I only hope that as a result of what I have said now, this will never occur again. I do not care what side they took; so long as they are veterans of an Irish Defence Force, they are entitled to these honours.  I want to ensure that they receive them.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the number of pre-Truce IRA who took no side in the Civil War but who emigrated to the United States for reasons of their own.  Many of these were entitled to military service pensions. Because of lack of communicaation with the home country, it was only when it was too late to apply that they became aware of the benefits to which they were rightfully entitled.  I know one case, the case of a man named McDevitt from the Kilcar district, who had very honourable pre-Truce service and who emigrated to the United States.  I later met him in New Jersey and he was unaware of the fact that he was entitled to a pre-Truce pension until I explained it to him.  Then he was, unfortunately, too late to apply. There should be, if necessary, an amending Act to enable those people who were unaware of their rights to apply for their allowances and for at least a current pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you, there is a lot in what Deputy Sherwin says that pensions or special allowances should be payable <Col N="888" /> from the date of application.  If it takes a year or two to investigate an application for a special allowance, let it take that time, but when the award is made, let it be retrospective as is done in the matter of old age pensions and with applications under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is something the Minister should look into.  As I said earlier, the numbers of old IRA are dwindling fast. Let us at least give them comfort in their old age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll:</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be repeating much of what has been already said but I feel I am justified in appealing to the Minister to abolish the means test when dealing with pensions which are only the rightful rewards of service.  On the last occasion I spoke on this question I mentioned the case of a veteran of the Tan War, a medal and bar holder, who emigrated to the United States.  He became a member of General Eisenhower's staff and later was severely wounded.  He survived and got the maximum military disability pension.  He can now travel the world, follow the sun with his family, at the expense of the American Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were joining the Fianna or the Volunteers over 40 years ago, there was no means test.  The rich man's son, if he felt so inclined, and the poor man's son, when behind the gun, whether tall or small, rich or poor, were equal.  Only this afternoon I had a communication from the Minister's Department, a stereotyped form, in which they say they are not satisfied about two points in the application of a man now living in England. I would bring to the Minister's memory the Mass in the Church of the Holy Trinity on 8th December, 1961, when I had with me a former member of the Fianna, an applicant for a special allowance.  I had arranged for the former Adjutant-General of the Fianna and a former member of the Fianna Advisory Board, Mr. Joseph Reynolds, to explain orally to the Minister the case of the applicant, Mr. Joseph Doyle.  He had been not only a member of Fianna Éireann from the early years but particularly during the vital three months before 11th July, 1921.  That man is still alive <Col N="889" /> but he has still not got his special allowance.</P>
    <P>I thought the procedure of the FBI in the United States was wonderful, but I do not believe it can compare with the ability of the officials of the Department of Defence in this regard. I would urge the Minister to do everything possible to get rid of this horrible means test.  Surely he and every other Deputy cannot but regard it as unfair?  It is a stigma in that people who otherwise would not do so must apply for a pension or allowance, because the award of it, they feel, is the only true proof of service.  I am not personally concerned, thank God, with disability now but when I was, through a lung collapse, I put my trust in God and not in the Minister for Defence.  I thought the Minister, being himself an old IRA man, would not be influenced by the same considerations as influenced his predecessors.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to has already been dealt with by Deputy MacEoin.  I refer to the officers who got the option of accepting two years' pay at retirement.  One of those, a former member of Fianna Éireann, was struck down by cancer three months after he accepted the option of two years' pay.  His hospitalisation cost £250 and had he not accepted it, of course, he would have been hospitalised by the State. He would have been in the service, and would surely have received promotion to the rank of colonel.  His period under canvas during the Emergency would have been a factor in his application for hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>There is another case which may be a special one but which is worthy of investigation.  If the Minister cannot do it himself, he should revert to the old idea and possibly find some Old IRA officer who would be able to get the facts and put them before the Minister.  There cannot be so many left now.  We all agree on that.</P>
    <P>In differing from Deputy O'Donnell, I must say that I, as liaison officer, have got the greatest co-operation from the Army authorities in regard to firing parties, even when I rang as late <Col N="890" /> as 11.30 p.m.  It was my suggestion, certainly in Dublin, that we eliminate the firing parties that we used to have, in co-operation with the Board of Works, because on occasions at a military funeral, you had one man six feet tall, another 5 feet six inches and all ageing, and as the Minister said, they were not giving the impression to visitors that we would like to give.  It is more fitting that the present Army pay tribute to the old Army.  They do it very well.  My experience is that all the facilities were granted to me, flag, bugle and trumpet if required.  I say that so that it may not appear that I am always complaining.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the position and in those special cases, I do not believe that a man who must be aged about 60 now will go to all the trouble to get the £80 per year, if he is able to do without it.  Some may disagree with that view.  The cases in respect of which I have made application have been genuine cases and it makes me wonder how any Minister, any former old IRA man, can sit back quietly knowing these things are happening because in another 10 or 15 years, they must all be gone.  Perhaps, it will be just the same as with the Military Hospital Bureau.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister in regard to military service pensions, special allowances and all matters concerning remuneration for service, to let the applicant go to St. Bricin's and submit himself to any test but to leave out the means test.  We have had too much of that in this country.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán le rá agam ar an ábhar seo ach amháin an méid seo.  Ba mhaith liom go bhféadadh an tAire pinsean níos fearr a thabhairt do na daoine a throid ar son na tíre. Tuigim, fé mar adubhairt Teachtaí eile, ná fuil mórán de na daoine sin fágtha anois agus, ar an ábhar sin amháin, ba cheart dúinn méadú, más féidir, ar an bpinsean.  Rud deacair, contúirteach ab ea é an t-am sin dul amach ag troid ar son na tíre ní amháin i gcoinne saighdiúirí ach i gcoinne na bpóilíní chomh maith.  Ní féidir aon chomparáid a dhéanamh idir an t-am sin agus an troid a deineadh san gcogadh deiridh.  Bhí an <Col N="891" /> chuid seo den tír saor an uair sin.  Ní h-amhlaidh a bhí sa tsean am.  Tá a fhios agam gur thug na daoine a bhí san Arm and san FCA seirbhís an-mhaith le linn an chogaidh ach bhí tacaíocht na ndaoine leo.  Ní raibh sé sin le fáil fadó.</P>
      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire breis a thabairt dona daoine seo.  Bhéinn sásta cuid beag a thógaint ón méid atá ag dul don Airm agus é a roint ar na daoine seo.  Tuigeann gach éinne gur ins na scoileanna agus na coláistí a bhí cuid mhaith dhíobh agus gur fhág siad na ranganna agus gur imíodar amach ag troid.  Níor éirigh leo chomh maith ina dhiaidh sin.  Chailleadar mórán. Níorbh fhuirist dóibh airgead d'fháil. Anois, ós rud é go bhfuil clann aca agus iad gan mórán airgid, teastaíonn an t-airgead uatha.

Muna bhfuil na daoine san áit chun gárda mar is cóir do sholáthar, táim cinnte&mdash;agus do tharla sé go minic im chondae féin&mdash;go mbeadh an tArm agus an FCA lán-toilteanach cabhair a thabhairt.  Aontaíom leis an Teachta Ó Cearbhaill go bhfuil an tArm&mdash;go mór-mhór na daoine ar a bhfuil aithne agam&mdash;lan-tsásta gach cabhair a chur ar fáil i gcónaí chun gárda a sholáthar do shean-shaighdiúir a throid ar son a thíre.

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to say that the number is dwindling very much each year of those who <Col N="892" /> gave us the freedom we enjoy today. Remember, whether they were on the Republican side or the Free State side, I still never lost my respect for the young men and their officers who went out and led the fight from 1916 until 1921 to give us the freedom we enjoy to-day.  I meet them now even in their limited numbers.</P>
      <P>It is sad to think that regardless of what side they took, they are still hoping at this late stage that some Government will come to their rescue and take them out of the poverty in which they find themselves.  Some of these men were wounded and mained and have found it very difficult to eke out a living.</P>
      <P>I have in mind men such as Frank Brennan, Colga, Sligo, and Michael Cunningham, Cartron, Fivemilebourne. Though they gave active service, they have been refused a special allowance.  I have another man in mind who lives convenient to Sligo, a very active man on the Republican side.  He did his utmost, for many years past, to get a pension. The result has always been the same. He has been refused a pension.  He is now a worn-out man, hoping he will reach 70 as quickly as possible when at least he will get 32/6d.</P>
      <P>It is a sad thing to have to say about a man who took such an active part in the fight for the freedom of this country that he should be hoping at this stage to reach 70 years of age so that he might get 32/6d. because he has been disabled and is poor and unable to eke out a living on the farm. I can give the Minister that man's name.  He came to see me some eight or 12 months ago and I did my best for him.  I told him I did not care which Party he supported and that, as a Deputy, I should be only too glad to do anything I could for him.  He was terribly grateful for anything I had done but the reply was the same.  The man, who was bordering on 70 years of age, had to go home and hope he would reach that age as quickly as possible and get his pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case, more tragic than any of them, is that of a man who took a very active part and got all the recommendations that could be given from <Col N="893" /> his commanding officer.  He was fortunate enough to qualify for the Garda Síochána at the time of the formation of that force.  He came up here and, because he had a varicose vein, he was sent into hospital and told he would have to have an operation. I think he was sent from the Depot.  He entered hospital here in Dublin&mdash;I suppose the Garda hospital &mdash;but the operation was not a success. He was sent home an invalid for the remainder of his life.  That is another common type of case I meet with in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The man in question has been troubled with a stiff leg ever since the days when the Garda Síochána was formed in 1922.  He lives on a smallholding on the hills of County Leitrim. Some years ago, he made application for this allowance.  He became so disgusted with the replies he was receiving that he abandoned it completely. Then, as times were going hard with him, he thawed out a little and said he would have another try. He wrote to me and I recommended him.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this man.  He is Michael Kerrigan, of Calry, Keelougeeboy. That man became invalided while trying to play his part in giving us the freedom and comforts we enjoy today as Irish citizens.  There is also the case of Michael McGoldrick, Cloonaquinn, Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister that, whatever else may be done, more money should be allocated for pensions for those men.  I did not know that these unfortunate men who gave such service to this country were in such a plight at this stage and that their applications were being turned down, for what reason I do not know.  Their health is broken.  Their circumstances are bad.  While other Deputies were speaking, five or six names came to my mind offhand.  I suppose that if I went over some of my correspondence, I would find many more names to swell that list.</P>
    <P>People who were member of the old IRA should not have been disqualified simply because they had not three months' service in the latter part <Col N="894" /> of the Anglo-Irish war.  I think that was a very unfair clause to insert into the rules and regulations.  Many of those people could have found themselves suffering from ill-health.  Many of those people might have been very actively engaged otherwise and their names might not have been entered on the proper list at that time.  It can be very disappointing to them to be told that simply because their names were not recorded for the last three months of the Anglo-Irish war, their applications are disallowed and they can get no allowance.</P>
    <P>Those are cases that come to my mind.  The position is certainly very disappointing.  As I said before, were it not for those people, we should possibly have uniformed men with guns in their pockets keeping law and order, men who would possibly hustle us around, rather than the type of Garda who is present in our public gallery today.  Were it not for the sacrifice of the men on whose behalf I plead, and others like them, we should have to be very submissive and certainly we should not be able to go around with the same air of freedom as we enjoy today in Dáil Éireann and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have our own Garda force; we have our own Army; we have our own Parliament.  Everything we have is our own.  To whom is all that due? It is due to those men who fought and sent the British from this country after 700 years.  It was tried time and time again by men who were really good but it was never successful until the group of people who banded themselves together in our generation took up the fight for Irish freedom.  With very little to work on, no money, no arms only what were brought in in the dead of night and smuggled in in a big and a small way, these men achieved a success which so many generations had fought for.</P>
