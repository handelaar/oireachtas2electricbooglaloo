    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the date for negotiations for Ireland's application to join the EEC has yet been agreed upon; if he will assure the House that such negotiations will be conducted at political level; and if he is now in a position to give the names of the negotiating team.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach <Col N="2" /> whether he had any discussions with the British Government which would indicate the approximate date as to when their application for admission to the EEC would be acceded to; and whether he can now indicate when Ireland's application for admission will be processed and formal admission to the EEC approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether there were any further developments with regard to negotiations with the countries of the European Economic Community on Ireland's proposed entry into the Community since the Dáil rose for the Christmas recess; and, if so, what developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the statement made by General de Gaulle on 14th January regarding the desirability of Britain's seeking association with, rather than membership of, the European Economic Community, he will further <Col N="3" /> investigate the possibilities of Ireland's obtaining a treaty of association, should Britain make such application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what effect the statement of President de Gaulle on 14th January will have on Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the present development in the British EEC negotiations, he intends to pursue the Irish application for full membership; or whether any consideration has been given to the question of Ireland's applying for associate membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of recent developments in Britain's application to join the EEC, the Government will now consider maintaining military neutrality and not taking part in a European defence arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the critical situation which has arisen in the negotiations on Britain's application for membership of the European Economic Community.  The outcome is still in doubt.  There have been no developments with regard to Ireland's application during the Christmas recess and none may be expected until the outcome of the crisis in the negotiations with Britain is known.</P>
      <P>While it is to be hoped that the discussions to be resumed next week at Brussels will result in an agreement which will facilitate the continuation of the negotiations with Britain, and subsequently with this country, I do not consider that it would be in the national interest to make any further comment on the position at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach states that at this stage it would not be in the national interest to discuss this matter in detail, pending the resolution of the negotiations in contemplation for next <Col N="4" /> week at Brussels, will he undertake to provide an occasion to debate the matter adequately in Dáil Éireann, if and when the Brussels negotiations reach a definitive stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When a clear situation has emerged, it would certainly be my intention to make a statement of Government policy in regard to it and to give the House an opportunity of considering it.  We are, of course, examining all the various possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach answer the second part of Question No. 2: as to whether or not any future negotiations will be taken at political level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure I understand the Deputy.  If negotiations are resumed, they will be at Ministerial level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's numerous statements here in the House that the idea of associate membership was purely academic and would not arise and in view of the possibility now that the British negotiations may fail, does the Taoiseach intend to pursue Ireland's application for full membership which he made even prior to the British application for membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be undesirable, in my view, to make any announcement at this stage as to the courses of action which the Government might consider in the event of either the failure or indefinite suspension of the negotiations between Britain and the EEC nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say whether or not in his conversations with President de Gaulle some months ago the French President indicated if our application for full membership would be favourably received by the French Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I am at liberty to reveal what was said during that conversation.  The Deputy must be aware that subsequent to those conversations the representatives of the Six at Brussels, including the French representatives, accepted <Col N="5" /> our application, in principle, for negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to inform the public mind on this matter, would the Taoiseach say whether from the standpoint of the Government our application stands or falls with the British application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said it would be undesirable at this stage for me to attempt to forecast what our course of action might be in circumstances which may or may not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that in the event of the British application being rejected, we will not be put into a catastrophic death or glory struggle to get into the Common Market if the British are not there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured we will take the course which, in our view, is most likely to protect the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach what distinction does he make between the determination or indefinite suspension of the Brussels negotiations?  Are these not substantially the same thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Clearly there are at least two possibilities which could be mentioned&mdash; either a formal withdrawal of the British application or a formal rejection of it by the EEC; there could also be an indefinite suspension of action on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will agree with me that the worst of all public woes would be an indefinite suspension, with all its attendant uncertainties, not only in our neighbouring country but with repercussions upon us because of the uncertainty which would obtain as to whether there was to be at some future date a resumption of these negotiations and an entry into the Common Market, or whether alternative arrangements would be made and the determination made on that basis for future development in both the agricultural and industrial sphere?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <P>10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what measures, if any, were taken by the Government to aid those in distress owing to the recent bad weather conditions; and whether any measures of aid, whether by compensation or otherwise, will be provided for those who suffered losses through the bad weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports received by the Minister for Agriculture do not suggest that there have been serious losses of stock in any areas up to now.  If further reports indicate that such losses have in fact occurred, or if a continuation of the bad weather should increase the risk of losses, the Minister for Agriculture will introduce a scheme of interest-free loans for the purchase of replacements similar to that which was operated on occasions in the past.  The Ministers for Finance, Transport and Power, Local Government, and Defence will deal with aspects of the matter with which they are concerned in reply to various Questions appearing on the Order Paper today.</P>
      <P>Because I consider that the splendid efforts of responsible public officers and their staffs in keeping essential services provided during recent weeks has received inadequate recognition in the press, I am availing of this opportunity to express proper appreciation of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly wish to commend the efforts of the local authorities who were, naturally, the immediate organisers of the large-scale remedial measures necessary in the localities affected by the severe weather.  The reports which I have received indicate that they tackled their problems promptly and vigorously, used considerable initiative, and invoked the co-operation, which was readily forthcoming, of other organisations in a position to help, including the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the <Col N="7" /> Forestry Section, the Gardaí and Army and some voluntary organisations, clubs and individuals.</P>
    <P>As a result of their efforts it can be said that, while the prevailing conditions caused general discomfort and inconvenience, no section of the community was at any time in a position of grave distress, there was no shortage of essential supplies in any part of the country, health services were provided on a fairly satisfactory basis and, so far as can be ascertained, no person requiring urgent medical attention or medical supplies was unable to obtain them.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that snowfalls of the kind recently experienced occur very infrequently in this country. A number of suggestions which have been transmitted, as a result of this experience, by local authorities and other bodies have been noted for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider arising from the suggestion or proposal made in this House in 1957 and in 1958, in connection with hardship that is likely to arise as a result of weather conditions, that, in the national interest, it would have been far better to expend the £1 million spent on Baldonnel and on purchasing the Vampire jets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether I am correct or not but was the Taoiseach purporting to answer a number of questions together, or only No. 10?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not feel, in retrospect, that it was unfortunate that the Government themselves did not take some initiative to coordinate <Col N="8" /> the efforts of the various authorities who were left to grapple with these local problems, or some initiative on their part to offer to the local authorities and others concerned the collaboration of the Army to meet the emergencies that arose, on lines similar to those adopted in 1954 when there was co-ordination between the local authorities, the appropriate Departments of State and the Army, with immensely satisfactory results not only in the relief brought but in the assurance to people who were at that time suffering that no effort would be left unmade to bring them relief in the shortest possible time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question on the Order Paper addressed to the Minister for Defence dealing with that. No request was made to the Army which was not met and there was full and effective co-ordination between the various authorities concerned in this matter.  I would advise the Deputy not to believe all the scare stories that appeared in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not believe the scare stories.  I would further ask the Taoiseach: is it not desirable, when people are suffering, not only to bring them physical relief but the reassurance quickly that whatever relief is necessary will effectively be brought? It is true that nobody died, thanks be to God, but many people must have apprehended for hours or days that they were going to die and nobody seemed to have much care for them. Is there not some value in indicating at once that all the resources of the State will be deployed so that nobody will be left to die and that the people will be protected from greater hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all the people in the areas concerned fully appreciate the energetic and effective steps taken by the public authorities to assist them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not much consolation for the people to hear the Taoiseach thanking those people who used their initiative, the local authorities and such people.  The question asks what the Government did by way of help for these various people.</P>

    <P>Much publicity was given to the removal of two maternity cases in West Wicklow to Baltinglass Hospital. It must be made clear immediately that neither of these was an emergency case.  One woman was five months pregnant and the other was six months and they were removed to hospital because they lived in places in which the roads had not yet been opened up and consequently <Col N="11" /> they were afraid of being cut off from medical attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is urgently necessary, from the point of view of balance of payment considerations and the preservation of our net external assets, to determine if these capital movements are of an annual recurrent kind or if they represent purchases of land and property here which are not likely to appear indefinitely in the annual receipts and which are, therefore, concealing a deficit in the balance of payments and which, if they stopped, might present us with a very grave crisis in which we would be bereft of substantial assets which have already been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in assuming that the deficit in the balance of payments is becoming a matter for concern.  It is not a critical issue at the moment because there has been no loss of external reserves. So long as money is coming in here to set up industry, or for similar purposes, <Col N="16" /> it must come in eventually in the form of goods and will appear as such in the trade statistics.  To that extent this capital inflow is an explanation of the gap that appears on invisible trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose it is, in fact, coming in for the payment of land and is appearing as a credit balance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how it comes, capital can only come into the country in the form of goods or services. That is an elementary fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It only comes in in the form of money on deposit to the credit of holders in this country, and subsequently invested by us in external investment.  Our net external investment may remain stable, but that is not due to the influx of capital which is of a reproductive character in our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>If that is the case, are we not depending to a great extent for a solution of our balance of payments problem on emigrants' remittances, which amount to about £18 million, and which come in in the form of postal orders, money orders and cheques from Britain?  If that is looked upon as capital, as far as our balance of payments problem is concerned, it is utilised to help our position.  Surely the same position obtains with regard to the inflow of capital from foreign sources?  Is it not a fact that a great deal of this money that the Taoiseach describes as &ldquo;goods&rdquo; is money coming in and used for the purchase of Irish land and property?  Irish land is now going up in value because of this spare money coming from Germany and other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJOKeefe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has seen the report of the National BCG Committee that there was a discouraging overall decline in vaccinations against tuberculosis during 1961; and what steps it is proposed to take to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The number of BCG vaccinations carried out dropped from 71,733 in 1960 to 65,348 in 1961.  The figure for 1960, however, was the highest recorded since the inauguration of the scheme in 1948 and, in fact, the 1961 figure compares favourably with the number of vaccinations in 1957, 1958 and 1959, viz. 63,371, 57,415 and 65,582 respectively.</P>
      <P>I might mention that a satisfactory feature has been the steady increase each year in the number of children vaccinated in the first year of life. In 1957 the number was 11,619, in 1960 it was 20,196.  In 1961 it had increased further to 23,123, practically double the 1957 figure.</P>
      <P>The response to appeals to the public to avail themselves of the protection afforded by BCG vaccination depends on a number of factors not easy to influence by any special means. The need for sustained efforts on the part of the appropriate officers of health authorities in order to obtain maximum response is continuously impressed on those officers by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the number of applicants for the position of health inspector last advertised, (b) the number of applicants called for interview, and (c) the lowest standard of education of any of those called for interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the course of training in health inspection being currently organised under the auspices of my Department.</P>
      <P>There were 314 applications for admission to the course, on which there are only ten places.  I entrusted the selection of candidates to the Health Inspectors Training Board set up to organise and supervise the course.  They called for interview the 59 candidates who, <i>prima facie</i>, were the best qualified having regard to their educational attainments, as claimed in their applications.  No candidate was so called unless he or she had obtained honours in Leaving Certificate in at least one subject and, in addition, had passed in a wide range of other subjects, e.g. honours in one subject and passes in a minimum of seven or more other subjects, depending on what the subjects were, the range of subjects decreasing as the number of subjects in which honours were obtained increased. The claims of the candidates finally selected for training were, of course, verified, before the selections were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that candidates with two honours and passes in all other subjects were rejected and were not called for the interview with the other 59 whom I think the Minister mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it was decided that unless a candidate had honours in at least one subject, then he was ruled out.  The next thing was that a balance had to be instituted between candidates with more than one honours in subjects that were not strictly relevant to the course and in many instances where at least one <Col N="29" /> honours was offered and a wide range of passes in other subjects, including mathematics and physics, these and kindred subjects were given greater weight, I understand, than, say, English and geography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; the Minister does not seem to have got the point of the question.  I want to know the lowest standard.  Was anybody called who had only one honours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  If a person had one honours in mathematics or physics or quasi-scientific subjects that would be useful in the course, then he would be called in preference to a person who had say, two honours, in English and geography.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the provisions of Section 104 of the Health Act, 1947, as amended by Section 43 of the Health Act, 1953 which deal with the provision by health authorities of ambulances or other means of transport for the conveyance of patients.  The effect of these provisions is to leave the question of a charge for the transport of patients for medical or surgical treatment at clinics or hospitals to the <Col N="30" /> discretion of the health authority in each case.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps mention that persons physically capable of doing so are expected to avail of public transport in the circumstances mentioned in the question; and where their means permit, to do so at their own expense.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I understand that the cost of the patient transport provided by the Mayo County Council last year was almost £10,500 and that the amount they recovered in respect of this service was £16.</P>

      <P>The erection of new dispensaries at Killygordan, Manorcunningham and Convoy is a matter for the Donegal County Council as local health authority.  I understand that, while the Council have the sites for new dispensary premises at these centres, their construction will depend on the extent of the financial provision which the council are prepared to make, in the coming financial year, for the building of new dispensaries. This matter, I am informed, is at present being considered by the council.</P>

      <P>As regards share capital, the answer is in the affirmative.  As regards other capital, any concessions such as those mentioned in the question would be subject to examination by the Commission of the EEC in accordance with the provisions of Article 93 of the Rome Treaty with a view to determining whether it was compatible <Col N="31" /> with the Common Market.  Pending such examination, it is not possible to say whether such concessions would, in fact, be regarded as a State aid or, if so regarded, whether they would be permissible within the EEC.</P>

In the absence of any evidence to this effect, the periodical mentioned in the question has not been exempted from duty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will have a grant made available for drainage work on the Glencar river which flows from Glencar Lake to Shanvaus Cross, County Leitrim, and floods many acres of crop land and grazing land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to refer to two separate rivers, the Diffreen river which flows west into Glencar Lough, and the Shanvaus river which flows east into the Bonet river.</P>
      <P>In 1958, a rural improvements scheme for drainage and rock removal on a small section of the Shanvaus river was abandoned because of objections by landholders downstream.  A comprehensive scheme acceptable to all landholders would be outside the scope of the rural improvements scheme, but may be considered as part of an arterial drainage scheme for the Bonet river catchment, the survey of which is due to begin in the next year or so.</P>
      <P>There is no record of an application under the rural improvements scheme for drainage on the Diffreen river, and no report is available on its condition.  It is likely that effective drainage on this river is also outside the scope of the rural improvements scheme and should await consideration under the Arterial Drainage Act, as part of an intermediate scheme on the Drumcliff catchment.  There is, however, no prospect of such a scheme being proceeded with in the near future, and if formal application is made under the rural improvements scheme the case will be further investigated, to ascertain whether worthwhile improvements could, in fact, be effected under that scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to a proposal applied for under the rural improvements scheme on 18th March, 1961, for drainage in the townlands of Killery and Gortlownan from the Bonet river at Peter Flynn's land south-west to the county road at Frank Harte's land. As the applicants and the Deputy have already been informed, the proposal cannot be proceeded with as it would cause increased flooding downstream. The drainage of the Bonet River is outside the scope of the rural improvements scheme but will be considered in due course as part of an arterial drainage scheme for this catchment, the survey of which may be expected to begin in the course of the next year or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what precisely the Deputy has in mind. Freight rates are a matter for settlement between exporters and importers on the one hand and shipping companies on the other; they are not subject to official control nor in the nature of the trade is such control feasible. There are no restrictions on the employment of ships of any nationality between here and other countries.</P>
      <P>Vessels engaged in bulk trade are normally chartered for voyages or periods at competitive rates which vary with demand; at present these rates are very depressed.</P>
      <P>Freight rates in the regular liner services are generally based on classification systems but I understand that most of the regular traffics which pass in significant volume to and from Great Britain and the Continent are carried at exceptional rates negotiated directly between customers and shipping companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cross-Channel freight rates have, from time to time, been compared unfavourably with rates for similar goods on other routes.  Exact comparisons <Col N="40" /> of this kind are very difficult to make, however, because circumstances may differ very much.  It would be pointless, for instance, to compare the rate per ton for meat sent by ship loads from South America to Britain with rates charged for container loads on the cross-Channel services.</P>
    <P>Following the increase in cross-Channel freight rates last July the Irish and British Traffic Association, which represents the shipping companies, gave me an undertaking to give special consideration to particular traffics where it could be shown that the increase was detrimental to the interests of the trader.  I am informed that a number of firms have secured reduced rates as a result of this undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry into cross-Channel freight rates reported in 1959 that the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion that the general level of cross-Channel rates was high by comparison with the level of rates on other routes.  The Tribunal also reported that their examination did not suggest that the cross-Channel shipping companies were making excessive profits.  I have no reason to believe that there has been any significant change in that situation since then.  It is of interest in this connection that the Committee of Inquiry into the shipping services between Britain and the Six Counties set up by the British Minister of Transport has now reported that the freight services, which had been the subject of much public criticism, were in fact satisfactory and that the general level of rates was reasonable.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Chomhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The siting of life-saving facilities around our coast is determined by the volume of sea going traffic and the location of particular navigational dangers.  The existing stations tend to be concentrated on the south and east coasts where the traffic is dense and there are fewer stations on the west coast where the volume of shipping traffic is very light.  There is a coast life-saving station at Ballyglass, County Mayo, which is equipped with rocket line-throwing apparatus and cliff ladders.  I have no reason to believe that the establishment of additional coast life-saving stations on the Mayo or Sligo coasts would be warranted on the basis of the existing shipping traffic and the location of shipping hazards in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The official statistics relating to deaths from gas poisoning relate to the country as a whole.  I have been informed that the numbers of accidental deaths due to gas poisoning in the past five years in the area served by the Dublin Gas Company were: 1958, 9; 1959, 1; 1960, 6; 1961, 11; and 1962, 7.  These exclude cases of suicide or cases where an open verdict was returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the causes of these accidents, I am informed by the company that the evidence furnished to the coroner showed that in the great majority of these accidents the presence of gas was due to gas taps having been left on. In certain of these cases contributory causes such as fainting fits, heart failure or other medical conditions were established. In two cases the accident was <Col N="47" /> caused by gas mains having been broken due to abnormal subsidence of the ground.  In every case a test of the house installation, where a house is involved, is made after an accident and the reports are submitted to the coroner's court.</P>
    <P>Under the Gas Acts, the gas company are responsible at law for the safety of their installations.  I am informed by the company that changes in the method of manufacture recently adopted have led to a reduction in the carbon monoxide content of their gas and that the possibility of further improvement is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to infer that the Committee on Industrial Organisation <Col N="50" /> have indicated the probability of redundancy in the cotton, footwear, paper, and motor assembly industries to the extent which Question No. 56 implies.  The figures which the Deputy quotes represent the extent to which the Committee, on their present information, estimate that redundancy could arise if the counter measures they recommend were not taken in good time.  The Industrial Reorganisation Branch of my Department is working with the industries concerned to secure the carrying into effect of the various measures recommended to minimise disemployment.  The Government will continue to foster employment-giving projects by every means in their power, including the existing financial and other facilities which they provide to encourage industrial development, supplemented by the provisions of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1962 and the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill, 1962 which are at present before this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figures included in this question are the figures generally accepted by the trade union movement and other bodies as being the figures of probable redundancy?  If, as the Minister states in his reply, these figures are not correct, does he by inference suggest there will not be any redundancy in these industries on our becoming members of EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to take the latter inference; neither should more be taken out of the report than is intended.  I never suggested there will be no redundancy, but the total figures given by the Deputy are the figures the Committee on Industrial Organisation decided would be the number redundant, if adequate steps were not taken by the industries concerned to offset redundancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of existing <Col N="51" /> production, yes; but the Committee suggested it would be possible to increase overall production by about 40 per cent., in which event it would be possible to absorb all existing operatives in that industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which is a very long measure of great importance to the community, is, in the main, an urban Bill founded on the studies made here by Mr. Abrahams in his review of the Dublin problem.  The problem of Dublin-and to a lesser extent of Cork and Limerick&mdash;is one not general in the country as a whole. So far as the rural areas are concerned, the Bill might have dealt with the Dublin problem, the problem of the larger built-up area, and then we might have had something which would have been peculiar to rural areas.  As the Minister mentioned, town planning is old.  It is something that has come along over the years.  As a matter of fact, man has been dealing for years with his environment, his working conditions and his leisure.  In England, the United States, Canada and the industrial countries of Europe, the problem of town planning has grown because of increases in population in the urban areas and because industrialisation has brought a large number of people to those centres. That problem is peculiar, as I said, to the city areas and it is indeed very applicable to Dublin where there has grown up a large industrial complex in which a large number of the people reside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cities in other countries have been planned and replanned for various reasons: the plight of people because of congestion, bad housing, inadequate sanitation and other drawbacks. Modern planning stems from the social and economic revolution which took place in the 19th century.  In the industrial revolution of those times, poverty increased, old slums became worse and new slums were created.  In man's attempt to get away from those conditions, there was a movement to <Col N="56" /> the outskirts of the cities, and the built-up areas sprawled into the countryside.  The conditions which prevailed constantly needed revision in an effort to ensure some amelioration of the situation.</P>
    <P>In 1940 in Great Britain, an attempt was made by legislation to give privileges to private enterprise under which it was hoped that the central areas of some cities would be rebuilt.  I venture to suggest that the factors which have influenced planning abroad and the factors which should influence planning in this country are not the same. Smoke and grime from the coal pits and the transport of crude oil and squalor in many of the industrial cities in Britain and other industrial countries led to the town and regional planning movement in those areas. There was a movement to the garden cities, a movement which was understandable in these conditions.  When we come to examine this Bill in relation to conditions in this country, I think we will find that the reasons underlying it are, and should be, different from those underlying town planning abroad.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister said at the outset, is to repeal the existing legislation which governs town and country planning and substitute new legislation for it.  The Act of 1934 was never properly interpreted or administered, as evidenced by the fact that after 25 years or more of what one might call fruitless expenditure, no local authority has produced a planning scheme which has been acceptable to the Minister, to the public, or to the interested trades or professions.  Some years ago, a scheme was prepared by Dublin Corporation and put before the Minister but it will now be buried under this new legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the Bill appears to be to relieve the town planning authorities of the obligation to produce a planning scheme of the kind which it was contemplated they would produce under the 1934 Act. The change there is, I think, to the good.  A further good feature of this legislation is that a review of the stage of planning will take place at least every fifth year, and that there will be <Col N="57" /> power to alter, to add to or delete from the planning which has been adopted at that stage.</P>
    <P>This appears to be a more reasonable approach to the problem.  It is less rigid and more practicable, always provided, of course, that we do not make it too flexible and that there is not, for instance, too much reviewing within the five year period.  It is reasonable to assume that if a plan is produced, there will be a certain amount of rigidity and that the people working it can look forward to some reasonable term in which interpretation of the development permissible under this Bill will be open to them.</P>
    <P>A very noticeable feature of the Bill is the manner in which it is proposed to invest what I might call the bureaucrats with full and final power in relation to property and the property rights of persons affected by their decisions, without any real protection by way of appeal to an independent tribunal or an independent authority. In the 1934 Act which is being repealed, there were many provisions in respect of recourse to the courts, even if the appeals were only to the district courts.  There was also provision that orders made under the Act had to be laid by the Minister before the Oireachtas so that they could be reviewed.  There was also access to the courts in regard to any matter which a person thought affected his personal rights.  In this Bill it is not proposed that this safeguard should remain. Therefore, the Minister will be put in the position, after the passage of this Bill, of being the interpreter of statute law.  The courts are set up for the very purpose of interpreting the statute law as passed by the Oireachtas.  The usurpation of that function is something which this House should not lightly allow to go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>The limited protection afforded under the 1904 Acts will disappear if this Bill goes through without amendment and the only appeal then left is the appeal to the Minister for Local Government as provided in the various sections.  Such provision might be thought to be some safeguard but Section 80 prescribes the regulations that can be made for any matters of <Col N="58" /> procedure in relation to reference of appeals.  In reality, then, the merits of a case will be decided by the person who makes the report to the Minister and any idea of an impartial hearing being given to an appeal by the Minister in question is purely a legislative fiction at that stage.</P>
    <P>However, we will be returning to this matter on Committee Stage.  Indeed, this is a Committee Bill and one which will require very careful attention on Committee Stage to ensure that the sections as they are passed in fact carry what the House feels ought to be done in the nature of town planning while at the same time preserving the rights of individuals and of property.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the manner in which some local authorities have failed to operate the Town Planning Acts which have been in operation up to the present time, it is questionable whether they should now be invested with the sweeping powers which it is proposed to give them in this Bill, powers which will limit the use of lands and buildings which are private property.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the objects of planning and gave some instances of desirable developments.  As I have already mentioned, some of the things he mentioned are matters which from the earliest times have agitated the mind of man where man has sought to improve his environment.  There are various factors, some stronger than others, which have influenced man in regard to his environment, from, in the early days, military necessity, down to commercial activity.  There are living standards and the social type of environment and the recreational environment in relation to which man has sought to prepare regulations which would improve the standard of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into these various matters though it was remarked in regard to the planning of cities that Paris was very much improved by the dictatorship of the Napoleons which resulted in that city being laid out as it has been.  Again, the influence of Sir Patrick Abercrombie, which the Minister mentioned, <Col N="59" /> is very noticeable in regard to town planning, particularly with regard to developments in the period after the world war which lasted from 1939 to 1945.  His plan for the new London was placed on record at that time. His plan, which laid out London as a number of squares and having a green belt around about it, became a model for other places.  This type of town planning has grown in England, being implemented by various pieces of legislation which have been introduced there.</P>
    <P>In other countries, the plan has been to disperse the population to new or existing towns.  That is one of the essential differences between the legislation which has been invoked abroad and the legislation which would be necessary here.  If we exclude Dublin, we have not got any problem of that nature throughout the country.  There may be a minor problem in regard to Cork or Limerick but, in the main, so far as country towns and rural Ireland are concerned, we have not got any problem in regard to dispersing the population because, unfortunately, the population has been dispersed from the countryside and has been attracted to the large centres, particularly Dublin.</P>
    <P>The various problems involved in dealing with a large project, such as is represented by Dublin, in regard to the siting of schools, houses, public buildings, highways, are matters which must affect future development of cities.  The solution of these problems has been a feature of planning abroad and a matter to which Abrahams has given much thought in his study of the problem in so far as Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <P>The zoning of cities has had a considerable influence, not alone on the architecture of the cities but on the preservation of amenities.  It is a new movement and is still experimental.  In that respect we can profit by the mistakes which have been made abroad in regard to zoning, which can create problems of its own.</P>
    <P>There is a quotation I read in relation to the constant striving down the centuries by man to make the physical environment of the community as <Col N="60" /> noble as his ideal of human rights and dignity.  Sometimes his efforts in that respect are wrecked by his own greed and lust for power and, again, by someone else.  So, it is reasonable to ask at the outset in relation to this Bill if one of the most cogent reasons for the fact that the existing Acts have not proven workable has been the failure to have sufficient consultation with the various professional bodies representing those interested in such planning &mdash; architects and engineers, builders, those who represent the building trade, the property owners&mdash;and to inquire then whether equally so there has not been a lack of sufficient skilled staff to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to repeal the various Acts or portions of them.  One of the most serious of these repeals affects the portions of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  Under that Act, the local authorities made bye-laws under which they had to approve or disapprove of plans submitted by building owners within a period of one month.  Failing the approval being given, the applicant would obtain the approval by default. That is one democratic right which will go, under this Bill.  On reading the Bill, one might think there are sections in it which seem to go very close to being unconstitutional.  If that is so, if some of these provisions should be unconstitutional, it would lead to senseless and costly litigation.</P>
    <P>Building bye-laws under the Health Act of 1878 are to be replaced by central building regulations which will be made by the Minister.  At this stage it is obvious that unless, in the making of these regulations, there is close consultation with all the interested parties, there is a danger that there will be a further period of fruitless local administration and strife between the local authorities and the various professions and trades interested in town planning, building development and even the ordinary day-to-day building, the repair, enlargement or replacement of decayed or obsolete buildings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the system of compensation under the Bill, it is, to my mind, inadequate and we must seek to improve it.  Part VI of the Bill contains <Col N="61" /> these various provisions, and Section 66 provides that claims for payment of compensation in default of agreement will be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919.  The various provisions of that Act are dealt with&mdash;I do not intend to deal with them at this stage; it is something that can be dealt with on Committee Stage&mdash;and it is pertinent now to ask the Minister how many arbitrators he thinks it will be necessary to appoint to determine the various claims for compensation likely to arise under this Bill.  The Minister mentioned in his opening statement that he could give no figures in regard to the compensation which may fall to be paid.</P>
    <P>This question of cost will be one of the things which ought to give the Minister and the House some reason for pause.  I asked some people who were conversant with the problem in Dublin what figure of expenditure they might reasonably anticipate under the heading of compensation but I could not find anybody who could give me anything approximating to a firm estimate&mdash;whether it would be in the region of £10 million, £15 million or £20 million.  Perhaps the Minister and his advisers have a figure in mind, but we find ourselves facing such problems at a time when we must be very careful that the type of planning we envisage in this Bill will not subject local authorities to heavy expenditure unnecessarily.  Everybody agrees there are problems which must be dealt with and which will involve heavy expenditure on themselves but we must be careful in our estimates that we do not involve ourselves in something that will prove too great a burden on the people.</P>
    <P>Another problem in relation to compensation which will fall to be dealt with is the question of small parcels of property which may be taken compulsorily for the purposes of this Bill when it becomes law.  I can envisage that even in a rural area a planning authority may decide to take 12 or 14 acres from somebody who has a rather small holding.  We have heard already from various other sources of the problems which the <Col N="62" /> smallholders at the present time are facing.  The compensation to such people would certainly need to be much more than the mere market value of the land because taking even a little from somebody who has only a small amount can leave that person in uneconomic circumstances, something which is difficult to measure in so far as his future is concerned.  However, during Committee Stage we will seek from the Minister clarification of these points and amendments of them, where we consider these necessary.</P>
    <P>We are gravely opposed to Sections 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 because of the phrasing at the end.  Take, for example, subsection (2) of Section 31 where we have written into the legislation the words:</P>
    <P>... and any other material considerations...</P>
    <P>The local authority can decide under this section whether it is expedient to serve notice concerning the proper planning development of an area, the preservation and improvement of amenities and so on, and then comes the use of the words &ldquo;and any other material considerations&rdquo;.  The ordinary layman will have the utmost difficulty in endeavouring to interpret such a phrase.  Yet under this legislation there can be no recourse to judicial interpretation of it.  We can therefore see the wide powers that may be conferred on officials to include conditions other than those imposed when the person got permission to carry out a plan.  Such a person may find himself facing an official who says there were other material considerations. These words are included in all these sections and from our point of view they are most objectionable, considering that so far in this measure we have not secured the type of appeal competent to deal with that sort of interpretation.  It is the dangerous sort of incursion which the planning authority might make into the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>Here you have a planning authority being given the power to serve notice on the owner or occupier of property calling attention to a breach of conditions or failure to comply with a <Col N="63" /> permission.  The person who gets this notice from the planning authority may, if he does not agree to comply with it, appeal to the Minister.  If he does not decide to carry out the requirements contained in the notice, the planning authority can enter on that person's lands and take the necessary steps to demolish a building or make alterations.  Not alone may they do that but equally they are entitled to require the owner to pay the planning authority for the carrying out of these works.  That type of section is one we should not lightly include in legislation.  The rights of property in this country have always been regarded as almost sacred and while, indeed, the greater good at all times determines the right to interfere with the right to private property, at the same time we ought afford to such an owner the right of being protected by legal interpretation or judicial interpretation rather than ministerial interpretation of statute law, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The appeal to the Minister as it is at present in this Bill is merely an appeal from the planning authority to the planning approver.  The planning authority have already made the plan and under this, if at a later stage they do not like the type of development which has been carried out by a person, under permission from the planning authority, and the person questions this interpretation he may find himself confronted again with these words &ldquo;any other material consideration.&rdquo; When he appeals he is appealing from the person who has already approved of this.</P>
    <P>We agree, then, that the Town Planning Bill is necessary.  It is necessary because the previous legislation did not secure the objectives which it was felt it would secure.  We believe there are good features in this Bill. The adoption of a development plan lets people know in advance the type of development which is likely to take place in the area.  It gives them a general idea of what is in mind in regard to the development of their particular area and as such is some help to them in regard to the ideas they may have <Col N="64" /> about their own property.  The amenity area development is welcome and the provisions of Part IV, particularly that portion which deals with the developer who leaves property unfinished, and the provisions which the Minister envisages can be taken under this measure to deal with that problem, are matters which for a long time, it has been felt, should have been available to people who bought such property and then found that they had not got the type of development which originally they had been led to believe they would get.</P>
    <P>The question of attachment of ground rents which the Minister has mentioned is something which would need to be discussed again on Committee Stage because very often, as the Minister is aware, ground rents are sold before the developer has completed his work on the property.  The manner of attachment of ground rents which would secure the type of development which the Minister, and I am sure, the House, would have in mind is a matter that would require to be discussed fully in order to achieve the type of desirable improvement which is necessary.</P>
    <P>Another section which I might mention is that which deals with appeals to the Minister and the setting out of reasons, or the giving of reasons why development is allowed or is not allowed.  We will return to this on Committee Stage because equally in that there is the right of the local authority, or the planning authority, in this case, from whose decision an appeal may be taken and the Minister may allow it.  I think that equally the planning authority are entitled to hear from the Minister the reasons why he allowed something to happen which the planning authority, in the first instance, were not prepared to permit.</P>
    <P>There are, as I mentioned, undesirable features in this Bill.  The first of these is that in the formulation and adoption of the town planning, there is the loss of control by the Oireachtas or by the courts.  It is as far reaching in this outlook as the legislation it seeks to repeal.  The operation of the plan does not allow for the safeguards which should be inserted in so far as <Col N="65" /> the individual is concerned because the planning authority are being made both judge and jury and, as I already mentioned, the appeal to the Minister is only a legislative fiction in as much as it is from one official to another. Naturally, the local officials have to live in good standing with the officials of local government.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I think the type of appeal is not the kind which would give the necessary safeguards to the individual.  The system will not be effective.  If a local authority have to answer in court for their planning decisions they will naturally be much more careful because they would have to submit themselves to the ordinary process of cross-examination as against merely submitting a memorandum from the planning authority to the officers of the Minister's Department. The right to private property is something sacred and we ought to take every precaution to ensure that that right is preserved.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage, we shall have certain amendments to ensure that nothing will be done which would leave an individual with a sense of grievance, making this legislation obnoxious to a certain degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not the Deputy thinks it is impossible, we should certainly not go out of our way here to take away from individuals the right of appeal to the court. We should not lightly set up a type of bureaucracy to interpret the laws we make here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that it would be impossible to ensure that nobody would have a grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Grievances are understandable, but at the moment people have a normal manner of dealing with them.  Over the years the rights of both the public and individuals have been safeguarded by judicial process where the interpretation of the law is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> As the Minister said, this is a Committee Stage Bill.  The best work on it will be done when we come to discuss the sections.  We will move amendments we consider necessary and we hope these amendments will be met in the spirit in which they are put forward, namely, seeking to improve this particular piece of legislation and to ensure that it will be effective.  It is very important from the point of view of Dublin.  We do not want it to lie on the Statute Book unimplemented. Everybody hopes that it will lead to the proper development of the various centres throughout the country and that it will be possible, under it, at no great cost, to provide the amenities which will attract tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the points raised and resolve some of the doubts in our minds in regard to certain sections of this Bill.  We are totally opposed&mdash;I want to emphasise this again&mdash;to the type of legislation which interferes with the rights of individuals in relation to private property without their having resort to the judicial processes that have heretofore always been available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say a great deal on this Bill.  So far as we are concerned, it is sufficient to say that we approve of giving the Minister the Second Reading.  All of us are, I think, agreed that it is a good Bill.  It is long overdue.  The existing legislation is pretty useless.  It has, indeed, proved abortive.  We welcome the Minister's approach, especially when we remember the conferences he had convened throughout the country at which both public representatives and local officials were present.  The general view is&mdash;it is evident from some of Deputy Jones's remarks&mdash;that there is always a certain amount of suspicion in relation to measures dealing with planning and development.  The Minister at these conferences&mdash;I applaud him for having convened them&mdash;tried to make known to the public in general what his and the Government's ideas are in regard to the type of planning and development we should have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is necessity for a Bill which, <Col N="67" /> whilst flexible in relation to various sections of the community, will also be water-tight in its application.  Looking at the towns, villages and cities it is apparent immediately that there is need for proper planning and development. In many places there has been haphazard building.  Towns have grown ugly.  One of the most important works that had to be undertaken in recent times was the provision of houses.  I cannot see that in providing these houses towns and villages have been improved.  The character of some towns has been lost completely because of haphazard building.  Uninhabited and derelict buildings have not been removed, even though many of them should have been demolished immediately after the war.</P>
    <P>The present planning legislation can be driven through by any lawyer, by any local official, indeed, by any ordinary layman.  From that point of view it is imperative that we should have this Bill.  It is long overdue, but we must appreciate the difficulties there have been.  Officers in the Minister's Department have been preoccupied with other extremely important matters&mdash;housing in particular, and the thousand and one other matters for which the Minister has responsibility. He and various Ministers before him knew, broadly speaking, what changes were necessary in the 1934 and 1939 Acts but merely to know that is not sufficient to bring a Bill here to the Dáil.  The various small sections that might appear to be meaningless to the ordinary reader were absolutely necessary, I am sure, to provide that this Act now before us is capable of operation.</P>
    <P>I think Part I, which defines exempted development, is very desirable and, as far as I know from colleagues on local bodies, this will mean an easing of the work of local authorities, both officials and members.</P>
    <P>Part II, as far as we are concerned and I am sure as far as the House is concerned, is uncontroversial in that it appears to be somewhat of a repetition of similar provisions in the 1934 and 1939 Planning Acts.  Personally, <Col N="68" /> I welcome Part III.  I am not, and never shall be, an advocate of waving the big stick by the Minister for Local Government or any Minister or Government but it is absolutely necessary to have some sort of compulsion in regard to development and planning.</P>
    <P>This section provides that the local authority must make a development plan for their area within three years of the coming into operation of this measure.  Perhaps, three years is too short and personally while I should be in favour of this element of compulsion in respect of planning and development there might be a case for an extension of the period.  If there is a good planning and development Bill, I do not think it would be necessary to compel any local authority to adopt a plan for their functional area.  So far as I know the difficulty of local authorities since 1934 or 1939 is that the Acts themselves were defective and the authorities believed it was useless to engage in planning or development in accordance with those Acts.</P>
    <P>I note in the matter of the making of a development plan this is a reserved function and must be agreed by the local representatives and by the city or county manager.  That is desirable. It is absolutely necessary in local government, as we know it at present. I take exception to Part IV and to the general trend which seems to exist in local government of ignoring local representatives.  There has been that definite trend in recent years.  It is not that I distrust city or county managers or engineers or town clerks but I think we should stop and think and remember what local representatives are.  They are people of the area. They must have that qualification to be elected.  Because they put themselves forward as candidates for local bodies they must have a particular interest in their city, town or county. Too often they are criticised or abused by people who themselves have not the courage or sense of responsibility necessary to put themselves in the same position.  In many instances, they are the butts of all types of jokes. For that reason, I think the Minister in this Bill has an opportunity of <Col N="69" /> giving them their due in respect of planning and development, giving them recognition for the sacrifices they undoubtedly make year in, year out, as public representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be initiating a conflict between local representatives and the officials but the local officials in my home town, or in the Minister's home town, in Cork or Dublin or any place, in the majority of cases are not natives of the place. I shall not say they have no interest in the place.  They certainly have because I am sure, when they presented themselves to the Local Appointments Commission, that was a matter that was considered; but there is the possibility that the city or county manager or the engineer may make some change even within the plan that has been agreed on in the local authority which might offend the people in a town or city or any other locality.  Therefore, I sincerely suggest that the Minister would try to change the relevant section in Part IV so that local representatives would be able to carry out the various changes, if changes there are to be, in their own local authority.  They know the place and they may have a special regard for a particular building, street or locality.  Nobody need say: &ldquo;The county manager, if he is a good one, will consult the local representatives or have regard to the past or present character of the two.&rdquo;  That is not sufficient.  It may be an official who will quote Part IV or the relevant section of it and say: &ldquo;The Minister gave me this power and I am going to act according to what I think should be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that local officials charged with the implementation of this legislation will not act honourably in carrying out their duties in Part IV but many officials, while having an interest in the locality in which they work, if not the majority of them, may regard themselves as birds of passage merely awaiting promotion to some other post with bigger salary and responsibility.  But local public representatives are people who have been there for decades and decades and will be there for decades to <Col N="70" /> come.  Therefore, if changes are to be made in their town in accordance with the general plan adopted by them, they should have some function in it. I do not pretend to speak for all local authorities, parties or individuals but so far as I know, local authorities will not be keen to implement what otherwise seems to be a good piece of legislation unless they have some part in carrying out the plan adopted by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify this section and say that local authorities have that function in conjunction with the officials under Part IV.  On the other hand, if they have not, he should devise ways and means to ensure that they will have it.  That was the main contribution I wanted to make.  I read the Minister's Second Reading speech and to be quite honest, my Party waited to see if there would be a clarification of Part IV as to what, if any, functions the local public representatives have.  From our reading of his speech, we did not gather that the local representatives had any function in the carrying out of the plan adopted by them in Section 3.</P>
    <P>Part V seems to commend itself to me.  It provides that the local authority may declare areas of scenic beauty to be areas of special amenity in which they may strictly control any development. We should and must do that if we are to continue to place the importance we do on our tourist industry. The local authority should have that power to make&mdash;and it is possible&mdash;the country in which we live more beautiful and incidentally, from an economic point of view, to make it more attractive to our tourists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones spoke about Part VI&mdash; Compensation.  He had various views on that matter, with some of which I do not disagree.  However, I think these are matters which are better dealt with on Committee Stage.  When we come to Committee Stage, I trust that the attitude adopted by the Minister at the outset of this Bill will be continued up to the end.  I trust he will recognise&mdash;I say this with respect&mdash;that all wisdom is not vested in him or in the officials of his Department, or in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I trust he will listen to the <Col N="71" /> views expressed by members on the opposite side of the House.  In that way, we shall achieve in our discussion of this Bill a measure which we can all support and which will stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  If this Bill had been introduced some years ago, the ratepayers and the taxpayers would not now be faced with an expenditure of a huge amount of money to make proper traffic lanes, for example, through the city of Dublin.  The old Streets Commission did a very good job.  It is a pity they did not continue because, if they had, we would have a properly planned Dublin today.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been forced to do something to regulate planning throughout the country&mdash;in the city of Dublin, in the boroughs in the urban and in the county council areas. His approach to the Bill is:</P>
      <P>to set up a new and more flexible planning system to be operated by local authorities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I appreciate very much the word &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; there.  The Minister is very wise in stating that this can be reviewed every five years because as time changes, people will change and circumstances may alter to bring about change.</P>
      <P>The second object of the Bill is:</P>
      <P>to enable local authorities to facilitate industrial and commercial development and to secure the redevelopment of those parts of built-up areas which have become outmoded, uneconomic or congested;</P>
      <P>That is a very fair comment&mdash;&ldquo;out-moded, uneconomic or congested.&rdquo; There has been very little town planning in any part of rural Ireland and indeed in Dublin city, our capital city, for a long number of years, except in recent times.  Certain town planning had been going on even during the past 40 years but we were a long way behind in our work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third main object of the Bill is: to secure that the amenities of <Col N="72" /> town and country-side are preserved and improved;</P>
    <P>Those of us who go down the country cannot but notice that there are areas and towns which are a disgrace to our national territory.  A house is built here or there.  You find a narrow street, widening out to a broad street, and then a narrow street again.  It is just like an &ldquo;S&rdquo; hook in some parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones spoke about the rights of the people.  Nobody wants to interfere with the reasonable rights of any citizen.  However, if people are properly compensated, and if the proposed change is for the general good of the community, then surely it is desirable to make it?  It might be necessary, for instance, that a house or houses be replaced or built back, and so on.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have been hoping to widen Church Street for some years past but there are still a few objectors who are holding up the work.  They have their rights.  They went to the courts.  They took all the other steps open to them.  I hold that, provided their is reasonable compensation for being removed from a place or places, as the case may be, the State is acting justly and honourably in a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>While every individual has the right to object and to go to the courts&mdash;and do not take that right from him&mdash;in the meantime, with a view to speeding up certain town planning&mdash;let it be in the city of Dublin or in any borough &mdash;an arbitrary amount of compensation should be awarded to the individual involved.  Give him the opportunity to appeal to his own arbitrator and let the local authority arbitrator meet him at some future date but do not hold up a job that has to be done urgently.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example Church Street and North King Street.  The property has depreciated there and decay has set in over the past 20 to 30 years just because people know these places will be taken over when the street is widened.  I know business people in this area who cannot even get compensation and get out because their property has been devalued. <Col N="73" /> One of the objects of the Bill is to secure that the amenities of town and countryside are preserved and improved.  Another is to relate compensation to property owners to the restrictions imposed on them by individual planning decisions rather than to provisions in planning schemes and to end their liability for betterment charges.  The Bill is divided into eight parts and contains five Schedules.  The Minister has consulted the town planning officers in this country and in other countries and has had the experience of seeing how town planning operations have been carried out abroad.  He comes into this House now seeking the co-operation of every Deputy to try to make this Bill as flexible and as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out to Deputy Jones, who made a very fine contribution here, that you will never reach the stage when nobody will have a grievance.  The moment you go near anybody to acquire property he has a grievance.  Even if such people go to the courts they will come back with a grievance that the courts gave a wrong decision against them.  That is a position which must be faced as it has been faced for a long number of years in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The matter of compensation will be a big problem, especially when retrospection is involved, and deciding who is going to pay.  In regard to the old Town Planning Bill if the property had not been cleared, say, in the streets of Dublin inside five years the Minister or his Department could not give any compensation to the local authority in cases of that kind.  I would like to see that rectified.  Furthermore, if an area is to be taken over and if John Murphy decides to sell his house, he cannot sell it to anybody else but the local authority.  If the local authority decide to buy it from him they should be in a position to buy it in an amicable way and thus cut out compulsory acquisition.  It would eliminate some of the grievances and objections we come up against from time to time.</P>
    <P>While there is plenty of power under local government law to deal with unfinished estates it is here in the Bill <Col N="74" /> also and I am delighted to see that it is retrospective.  In a case where a person has developed an estate and goes into liquidation or bankruptcy, leaves the district and leaves the estate unfinished, somebody else will buy the ground rent.  There is a number of such estates in the city of Dublin and in the suburbs of the County of Dublin where this problem exists.  Many such places have been there for 10 or 12 years and have not been taken over yet by the local authority.  Those people are paying full rates and meeting other commitments and the only amenity they have is that the dust car goes around and collects the refuse from their bins.</P>
    <P>I spoke about this before and urged the Minister for Local Government to introduce legislation to empower the local authority to deal with this matter.  If a person bought these ground rents on an unfinished estate that person should be liable for developing it.  I have spent much time and received many deputations on this matter during my 19 years in public life.  After the war building started to go on very quickly.  The local authorities possibly had not enough officers to supervise these schemes to the extent to which they should have been supervised.  In the majority of these cases when complaints were made the answer was: &ldquo;I have sold the ground rent.  The place has gone into liquidation.&rdquo;  I am delighted to see the ground landlord being pinned. It is only right that an estate should be developed and that people who have bought property in the neighbourhood for £2,000 to £2,400 should not be at a disadvantage.  There are many cases where even if a person wanted to get out through economic circumstances he could not sell his house because the area is overgrown with weeds and left in an undeveloped state.  I am very happy to see that position will be rectified and will not be left entirely to the initiative of the residents to do whatever little they can do to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Many of the points I wish to raise can be discussed on the Committee Stage but, generally speaking, the Minister's approach to the Bill has been extremely good.  I am delighted he is meeting the city of Dublin.  We <Col N="75" /> had a long drawn-out discussion about the development of Portmarnock as a seaside resort.  Dublin Corporation had no authority to spend money outside their boundary.  That has been amended in this Bill and the Corporation now have power to develop Portmarnock for the benefit of the citizens.</P>
    <P>We have this problem of the green belt around Dublin.  The city is bursting at its seams.  Certain people have put up houses in the green-belt areas without permission.  We should go slowly in the matter of enforcing retrospective legislation.  If we were to adopt a general policy of knocking down property which had been erected without permission, every public representative would be subjected to considerable pressure.  But if a person built on property required by an urban authority, that would be a different matter.  The Minister and his Department had to take a stand on this matter of people building without permission, and they have done so.  Under the previous Bill these people could be brought to court and fined £5, but could not be forced to pull the building down.  That will be changed in future; but the Bill, I am afraid, will be a headache for public representatives.</P>
    <P>The zoning of land for particular purposes is a very good idea.  &ldquo;The securing of greater convenience of road users and pedestrians by the provision of parking facilities or road improvements or otherwise&rdquo; is a laudable attempt in the Bill to eliminate or reduce the number of fatal accidents on the roads.  The development and removal of obsolete areas; the preserving and improving of amenities in rural areas; the provision of new water supplies and sewerage services and the extension of existing supplies and services&mdash;all these things are to be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that on Committee Stage every Deputy will approach this Bill in the most objective fashion and that his criticism will be helpful.  This Bill meets a national need and provides us with an opportunity of doing something that should have been done years ago. The Minister and his Department have given us something to work upon and <Col N="76" /> improve.  The Minister's approach of asking for our suggestions was, I thought, a very good one.  We shall deal with the Bill in detail on the Committee Stage and try to improve it as best we can.  I do not like it said that this Bill will do certain things. It is long overdue and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When the principal speaker from this side of the House said he thought a great danger of this legislation was that it would not be implemented or would be very difficult to implement, I did not think that would be illustrated so speedily by a Deputy from the Government side of the House.  If Deputy Burke finds the green-belt around Dublin uncomfortable, that is the kind of thing we are talking about.  That is what the Bill is proposing to do in this country.</P>
      <P>I go back to what Deputy Jones said, that the only notable progress in town planning took place in the city of Paris under the Napoleons, that you want to have a dictatorship and not a democracy to get these things done. There is a great deal of truth in that. There is a great deal of talk about town planning here, but we must do a great deal of mind planning also. The mind planning must be done on many of our public representatives as well.  Anywhere in this country, when we stand and look around us, the need for this Bill is obvious.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement was lengthy.  It was excellent in its coverage, and I think it should be circulated very widely.  It admits what we all admit, that our activities in the matter of town planning up to this have been pious probes rather than good work. This is some step forward.  Planning is necessary in every area, in the rural areas as well as the urban areas.  However, I am more interested in the towns and larger centres of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This city&mdash;and I think it is news to Deputy Burke&mdash;was the place of one of the first planning attempts made in these islands.  It was a noble plan &mdash;planned for a patrician society, of course, a society that was the seat of government, the capital city.  These <Col N="77" /> graces are obvious even to those who walk blindly through the streets.  It seems a pity that many parts of the city&mdash;and particularly the old city&mdash; have now begun to run down.  Areas like Parnell Street and High Street, in particular, should be attended to in this generation.  That is the heart of the history of Dublin and evidence of decay is obvious there at the moment.</P>
    <P>With the exception of Limerick, no other Irish town was planned.  They just grew, uncontrolled in general, in a graceless manner.  They grew as their needs required them&mdash;hand-to-mouth needs, in fact.  We were almost fortunate in Ireland in escaping an industrial revolution.  Many of our Irish towns would be hideous to-day if that had come.  It should be possible at this stage to reshape many areas, and to do a bit of reshaping of the minds of the inhabitants as well.  We had an indication of the Minister's state of mind in his introductory speech, and I hope he will remember something that was said by some one, some weeks ago: it is more important amongst men that one should do something rather than be something.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has a chance to do something.  It will be very difficult, and he will find how difficult it will be from the many speeches he will hear while this legislation is before the House because public representatives, I regret to say, will not be entirely co-operative in this matter.  I think that intelligent development of the places we live in is an object of concern to all of us.  A town or city is a machine for living and it is necessary that that machine should be functional and suit the purposes for which it is intended. It should be suitable for the occupation of its inhabitants and it should suit the purposes of the part of the country in which it is situated.  Power should be provided to ensure that its future growth is guided in order that it will grow rationally and sensibly in relation to its demography and geography.</P>
    <P>Long-term economy must be practised in this regard.  Cheese-paring investment should not be permitted if greater investment would save money in the long run.  The familiar and traditional objective of town planning <Col N="78" /> controls is the prevention of unsightly construction and the prohibition of advertising hoardings in unsuitable places&mdash;unsuitable because they interfere with the scenic beauty.  As I say, that is traditional, but it is negative and much more is required.  Obsolete area boundaries may have to be rearranged if it would result in the unit being more competent as the machine where the community live.</P>
    <P>The growth of mechanical transport has spread the population more thinly and the periphery of some places is much less compact than it was when towns may have had defensive as well as living provisions in view.  That introduces many other problems of ribbon building and low density and it also provides very suitable opportunities for landscaping in and around human habitations.  Housing estates should no longer comprise a hideous area of geometrical concrete roads dotted with frightening regularity with concrete cubes called dwelling houses, the whole thing unrelieved by any variation or irregularity or landscaping of any kind.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that in the past few weeks an outsider had a comment to make in support of what I am now saying, that some of our housing developments are deplorably bad.  He meant that they are deplorably bad because we had an opportunity which we allowed to slip from us.  We had not the difficulties which had to be faced in the dreadfully industrialised areas in Great Britain.  We started virtually with a clean sheet and we have blotted it very quickly.  It is quite obvious to all of us that where trees grow in an area taken over for housing purposes they should be allowed to grow and the houses should be built around them.  I am tired talking about supply companies like the ESB which should not be allowed to infest areas with horrible poles and heavy equipment. They should be compelled to supply power underground, if necessary, or at least in a less obvious manner than they do at the moment.  There should certainly be variations in architecture. The monotony we see in some housing areas&mdash;not only working class areas but middle class areas&mdash;is depressing <Col N="79" /> and demoralising to look at. Roads and streets should finish at focal points.</P>
    <P>All these proposals should be co-operative as is the case in Norwich in England to which I have referred and it is just as possible, easy and cheap here.  I would beg the Minister not to listen to Deputy Burke who talked about narrow twisted streets. They are very important in some cases but the general ambition should be that we should seek to ensure that the places in which we work and live are efficient and that the machine we have runs well.  After that the graces can be attended to so that the place not only looks well but works well.  We always find that if a place looks well it is easier to work there.</P>
    <P>If we are sensible about this Bill it could be the death knell of the gerry-builder, the patcher and the bad planner.  These are details which will be controversial in Committee Stage. I have experience of the dangers of the great pressures exercised against town planning officials by builders in certain areas, the pressures that operate on public representatives, and I am not always sure that public representatives are even enlightened enough or strong enough to stand up to these pressures.  As Deputy Jones has said, he has only had experience of seeing how well this could be done when it was done under the Napoleons in Paris.  We have not any Napoleons in this country now. It is a democracy that we live in. They are going to be scarce.  So, all we can do is try to raise the standard of thinking by public men, that frequently they must support what appears to be a hard and inhuman decision in the interests of the whole.</P>
    <P>The kind of remarks I am making are, indeed, of a Second Reading nature but one of the weaknesses in the past legislation was that you could prevent a citizen from using his property in a certain way but you could not recompense him for the loss he sustained by your action.  This was an irritating and continuing injustice and I hope this Bill will somewhat liberally deal with that situation.  Of <Col N="80" /> course, there was very peculiar difficulty in the city of Cork, where I come from, that is, that the planning area was very much larger than the rating area and even if we were so minded as to purchase a man's property where we prohibited him from doing certain things, we could not usefully or easily do it because that property was generally property outside the area which was rated by us but if a property owner at any time is injured by a decision, that injury should be undone.  But, that is a detail for Committee.</P>
    <P>However, the principle should be that the proposals in the Bill are examined, that mind planning is as important as town planning.  The mental planning is an absolute prerequisite for getting your Bill to work well but, above all, it should be emphasised that the graces are just as important as the utilities and in that regard it should be an important thing that a town planning officer should have town planning qualifications.  He should be a highly trained man or else, if he is not, all that the Housmans and the Abercrombies have been saying for many years will be wasted, if he does not realise the direction in which they are looking and that he should seek to look with them.</P>
    <P>We have a very unusual opportunity in Ireland at the moment.  We have escaped the industrial revolution and all the horrors that followed it and we can do things here properly if everybody co-operates with the Minister and the Department but we want to make sure that we do them and that we do work this Bill as Deputy Jones was afraid we might not be able to do and we can then show those who come to visit us here that we are actually doing the kind of thing a civilised community should do but, much more important than impressing our visitors or tourists or anything like that, is that we should be able to show ourselves the kind of society we live in and take pride in it and in the manner in which we live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I also was impressed by Deputy Jones's submissions.  I believe the fears he expressed about the Bill will be met on Committee Stage. <Col N="81" /> Deputy Barry, however, went into greater detail in regard to town planning as it affects the citizen, the local representative, or the visitor.  The excuse was given by one speaker for the ribbon building that has been allowed in this country that possibly there were not enough officials, or something like that.  The Department of Local Government and Dublin Corporation have sent representatives to Vienna and other places to study town planning. I do not know whether it was money well spent or not because I think the knowledge that was gained was never implemented.</P>
      <P>Somebody is worried about the green belt around Dublin.  On the other hand, we have to listen to town planning officials who say that you cannot go up five storeys or six storeys, that the skyline will be affected, that it will offend the aesthetic taste of the individual.  In County Dublin, if we had not got so much space, what would we do? Would we go into the ground?  That is permissible.  We discovered that in Vienna.  We certainly could go up. They talk about the cost&mdash;it becomes greater and greater.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that I spoke in this House on this subject, I expressed the hope that the House would give the Minister more sweeping power.  We all recognise that our neighbours across the water tackled very adequately the situation that was forced on them.  They built a new town.  In our attempts, which are approved by local government officials and by the Minister's Department, we build, say, a place like Ballyfermot. Do we build schools at the same time? I am not referring to swimming pools now, but schools.  The people come in and the children have no school to go to in the area.  If the Minister wants additional power in this Bill, the House should give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We really should be ashamed of ourselves in this connection.  I travel a great deal through the country. What Deputy Barry says about unsightly advertising signs is true.  There is a stretching out of what were nice little towns.  I can say, after 40 years of experience, that these towns have <Col N="82" /> not been improved, any more than Dublin has been improved.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests that the amenities of an area should be restrained.  Are we attempting to do that when we are considering building houses on Howth Hill?  Howth Hill has a counterpart in Killiney, which is likened to the Bay of Naples.  Surely, such an attempt, by a speculator, with the approval of a town planner, is not justified?</P>
    <P>Delay in regard to matters connected with town planning is detrimental.  As Deputy Burke has stated, in the centre of my constituency, Crumlin, there is a newly-developed road.  A factory has been erected there.  The people cannot sleep.  Despite the fact that a deputation went to Dublin Corporation five years ago, Dublin Corporation say that they cannot do anything, that they have to wait until the county plan is passed.  That is another aspect.  The land in question was earmarked for the housing of the working classes and a grant was given by the corporation and, in some cases, a subsidy was paid by the Department.  To what avail?</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Jones said.  The Deputy must have spent a good deal of time in studying the finer points which, I am sure, will be dealt with.  I do hope that there will be every possible expedition in regard to the vital matter of town planning.  I sympathise with the Minister.  I feel sure he will be relieved when a local authority makes a negative decision so as to allow appeal to the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Army Pensions Acts: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of Dáil Éireann the Government should introduce legislation (1) to amend the Army Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 to 1949, and see that justice is done to legitimate claimants for Military Service Certificates, and (2) to amend the Army Pensions <Col N="83" /> Acts of 1923 to date so as to (a) extend the Disability Pensions Acts to those who suffered from disease attributable to service, (b) include the widows and dependent children of persons in receipt of disability pensions due to gunshot wounds or disease contracted on service, or attributable to service, and (c) amend the regulation governing the means test for special allowance.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy MacEoin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Christmas recess, I tried to show that there were very grave shortcomings in the various Military Service Pensions Acts and I pointed out that early in 1919, the then Minister for Defence accepted the whole Volunteer Force of the country, together with its allied organisations such as Cumann na mBan and Fianna Éireann, as the standing army and they were all on an active service footing.  I cited the relevant reference to that in the Dáil Official Report and I dealt with the question of disability pensions up to a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points I wanted to stress was that in the case of disability, whether from wound or disease, contracted on service, no matter when the person applied, his case should be examined and it is unreasonable and unjust to say that because a man did not apply before a certain date, he cannot be considered.  I submit that the greatest punishment that applicant can suffer or should suffer is that his pension should be paid only from the date of application.  Dear knows, that would be serious enough.  In view of our history, in view of the fact that there are several people in this country who were at one time behind us, or behind the present Government Party who were not in the House, because they did not accept the constitutional position established here and who did not apply but who are suffering disability, I think it is a very grave reflection on us that we should tell them: &ldquo;Because you did not apply in time, your case cannot now be considered because the Minister has no statutory authority to make such a provision.&rdquo; I do not think the Dáil ever visualised <Col N="84" /> that situation and I submit it should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The second point I tried to establish &mdash;I am summarising&mdash;was that where the widow of an officer, NCO or man finds herself without any means of sustenance&mdash;or whether she has or not&mdash;once her husband dies, the disability pension dies with him unless it is established beyond yea or nay that his death was due to his disability.  I am satisfied that there was never any intention on the part of the Oireachtas to create that situation; the intention was that the widow would receive the pension payable under the circumstances &mdash;the same circumstances as those under which a person died with a full certificate of death due to disability whether contracted from wounds or disease.</P>
    <P>I assert that where the wound pension was granted, there should be no question whatever about it.  The pension should carry on.  I am struck by a number of cases, particularly by a case, and this hurts me very much, of an officer who had at least 14 bullet wounds in him.  He became mental and was in hospital.  After a long time, he was granted the disability pension and his wife's pension was also allotted.  He suffered from what I am perfectly satisfied was a blood clot, became unconscious and was moved from the mental hospital to a surgical hospital where they did not know anything of his history.  The death certificate says he died from diabetes.  That man never regained consciousness from the time he left the mental hospital until he died in the county hospital. It is clear, in my opinion, that his death was due to his disability but the certificate says a different thing and the Minister therefore says that in these circumstances the widow is not entitled to a continuation of the pension.</P>
    <P>That is only one of several such cases.  The Minister knows of other cases in Galway and elsewhere where the same circumstances apply.  I feel that in all these cases the pension should carry on to the widow.  There is another case in Athlone but I do not think it is much use citing all those cases, since the Minister knows them as well as I do.  The only case the Minister <Col N="85" /> can make is that there is no statutory power vested in him to continue the pensions.  He does, however, agree it is very hard to see a man who lived to 60 or 70 years dying from a disability so incurred, but I think he is forgetting that for a great number of years, that man was not able to make provision for his widow or anybody else because he was suffering from disability all that time.</P>
    <P>The next portion of my motion is in regard to special allowances and the granting of medals.  I submit that in every case where a person applies under the Military Service Pensions Acts, and where evidence was given of both his membership and his service, there should be no question whatever about granting a medal because the officers were available to give evidence and if such a man had not been a member of the Volunteers, the fact would have been clearly established before the Military Pensions Board. Perhaps the sources which suggested he was never a member were not really reliable.  Anyhow, where they have said he was a member and did not contradict him, then automatically&mdash; and I have argued this here before&mdash; the medal should be issued.</P>
    <P>I had a case today from the Mid-lands&mdash;not in my own area&mdash;in which an applicant for a medal says he applied for a military service pension, that he was on the Executive side, that his officers joined the Defence Forces, the National Army, and they refused to certify him because of prejudice, that they were Fine Gael, and so on, and he makes the case that political action denied him what he was entitled to.  That apparently is accepted.  There is another case in which a man applied for a military service certificate and was refused.  He applied again under the 1949 Act and his case was heard in 1954 or 1955.  He was rejected again but the medal was issued to him the following week.  He was told when he applied for a special allowance that his medal had not been duly awarded. It is very difficult to know how that comes about but it has a disturbing effect on people generally.  When I say &ldquo;people,&rdquo; I mean all of my comrades <Col N="86" /> of former days, whether they were for me or against me.  I am forgetting all that now and I am trying to get fair play and justice for all of them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the means test for a special allowance, I hold that at least it should be the equivalent of that for the old age pension.  That is not asking too much.  Let us get this fact clear.  Under the Old Age Pensions Act, a pension officer reports that the applicant's means is above such a figure and notwithstanding that the pension committee grants the pension. The pension officer appeals and an appeals officer in the Department of Social Welfare examines the case anew.  I would say without fear of contradiction that in 50 per cent. of the cases, if not more, the deciding officer overrides the decision of the pension officer.</P>
    <P>For the special allowance, however, once the pension officer reports that a person's means are £X, then that becomes the same as the law of the Medes and Persians and there is no power in the Department of Defence to override it.  They must take it that that is the assessment made by the pension officer and they have no power unless there is an appeal and evidence put in which is again referred to the pension officer or some other inspector for further inquiry into that person's means.  Therefore, the minimum that I am asking is that where an assessment of means takes place, it should not be on a worse basis than that in respect of the applicant for an old age pension.  Surely to goodness that is not going too far?  I think it is reasonable and that everybody will admit it is a fair calculation.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am forcing this is that I know of cases similar to the one in which a person fell out with the pension officer and ordered him about the place.  In that case, the officer estimated the means as £20 from four acres of the worst land in Ireland. What I would feel like doing is to ask the pension officer to spend 12 months on that land himself and if he could get £20 out of it in any way, I would give him a medal.  I admit that the applicant was wrong in the first <Col N="87" /> instance in his attitude to the pension officer, and I hold no brief for him, but at the same time the calculation goes beyond all reason.  In another case, a person is calculated as having a room set in Athlone and, therefore, he has £1 per week out of that, as if there were no other costs in the house to be taken into account, rent, rates and so on.  These tests would not apply for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>I am arguing that the whole matter should be re-examined and that the Minister should have statutory power to delegate authority to an official to operate the special allowances on the same basis as the non-contributory old age pensions code, or otherwise that for the purpose of the special allowance, the adjudicating officer for old age pensions be the adjudicator on the main question of means for the special allowance.  Perhaps that would be only an administrative matter but I feel it would be taking it away to another Department.</P>
    <P>I feel that even in the short time at my disposal, I should go back again to the Military Service Pensions Act. Under the Military Service Pensions Act from 1922 to 1949, there was no definition whatever of active service. The definition of active service was left to the arbitrary decision of the board for the time being.  Under the 1924 Pensions Act, there were grave complaints about the definition of active service but there was the additional condition that you had to have service in the Defence Forces. Under the 1934 Act, there was no definition of active service and the Oireachtas was right not to define it because they were accepting the point of view that the Volunteers and associated forces were the standing army of the country in its difficult times and all that had to be established was that they had full-time membership and gave considerable time to the work they had done.</P>
    <P>Active service was laid down then by the boards and one chairman and one board would do one thing and another chairman and another board would do something else.  The net <Col N="88" /> result was that people got certificates under one board which they would not have got under another board.  I feel, and I am not advocating that active service should be a condition, that if we must have it a condition, if the Government assert that view and reject mine, that there should be active service, it should be operated on the definition that everybody would know what he has to establish.  For that purpose, I include not only the Volunteers who were actually on the ground, but railway workers, drivers, guards, porters and so on, who carried despatches and did all types of work for the Army at the time.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the definition of active service should be something like this first, engaging in any armed attacks; secondly, cutting, mining, or obstructing roads or railways; thirdly, cutting telegraph lines, or other means of communication; seizure of mails; carrying of despatches; guarding parties of the forces; carrying out armed patrols; having care or custody of the transport of arms and ammunition.  Without fear of contradiction, I assert that the man who stored the material that I captured at Ballymahon, or anywhere else in attacks on barracks, and who kept it safely in his own home, under his own control, went through as tough a time, if not a tougher time, than the fellows out in the field; he knew what the consequences would be if a raid took place on his house.  But he is just brushed aside.  What did he do? And what he did is considered of no merit.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the conveyance of the material from Ballinalee to Ballymahon, dumping it outside Ballymahon, handing it over to a farmer there the day before.  Surely that was as much active service as was the service of those who took part in the attack on the barracks.  There is no question of doubt about it.  But, again, it is &ldquo;What did he do?  He only carried the stuff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Forcibly seizing arms, munitions, materials, and so forth covers raiding for the raw material&mdash;the gunpowder, explosives, caps, and whatnot; to my <Col N="89" /> own knowledge, men engaged in these activities travelled long distances.</P>
    <P>Transporting armed parties of the forces; having the custody of prisoners, or suspected persons; attending in their training camps; attending council meetings, and battalion, or higher, formations; catering; providing accommodation and laundry and other essential services for members of the forces. That latter relates more, of course, to Cumann na mBan in a certain sense. The truth is that there are men who did all these things.  A good cook was a very useful adjunct indeed. Rendering first aid to members of the forces during operations and nursing sick or wounded members; if all these things were laid down applicants would know what they had to establish.  At the moment they did not know.  There is only one thing a former applicant did know, and he hoped to God that he knew someone who would help.</P>
    <P>It is that that has begotten all the controversy.  Indeed it looks now as if it would have been better never to have passed the Pensions Acts at all. There would not be so much jealousy and hard feeling amongst former comrades.  It was the granting of pensions to certain people and the refusal of pensions to certain others that generated much of the later hostility between former members of that gallant body that served the country so well.  These men handed over government in 1918 to the Government then established, before freedom was fully secured and, except for a few small instances they have obeyed from that day to this the elected Government of the country.  We can be proud of that record when we see what is happening in other countries where revolutionary effort is taking place. We are aware of all the turmoil and upset.  Were it not for the grace of God, perhaps that would have been our position too.</P>
    <P>I wish I were able to make a much better case because a much better case can be made.  Unfortunately, my physical condition at the moment does not allow me to make the case I should like to make.  The facts are as I have stated and I appeal to all members of this House to accept this <Col N="90" /> motion and to establish, even at this late hour, one or more boards to examine into and determine all the applicants over again.  There are not many left.  In particular, I ask this House to ensure that where disability has been established the pension carries on to the widow.  I think that is a very small plea.  With regard to the assessment of means, the adjudicating officer should have the same power as the appeals officer has in the case of the old age pension.  I know there are many here who believe the Act should be amended.  I appeal to both sides of the House to support this motion.</P>

      <P>What is embraced in the motion here does not altogether satisfy me, or others, for that matter. Deputy MacEoin asked that justice be done to legitimate claimants for pensions. He referred to certain people who should have been considered for pensions.  He specified certain classes. I am not so much concerned with extending the scope of the Pensions Acts in order to grant more pensions. I would be satisfied with a gratuity. Deputy MacEoin's suggestion would involve the examination of witnesses, and all that sort of thing.  I am not so sure that there would not be a good deal of fixing done by pals to prove that somebody kept a gun or did not keep a gun.  I believe it would be impossible at this stage to prove the truth of a great many claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My solution to the problem is that all who can prove that they served and that they were entitled to a service medal should receive a gratuity, provided they can prove they were members of the forces for the three months before the Truce.  They should be given a gratuity with additions for each year of service they can prove.  That would be an easier way out.  It is <Col N="91" /> much easier to prove that a man was a member of the forces than to prove that he did this or that because most of the people who could prove it are probably dead and in any case there would be, as I said, too much &ldquo;fixing&rdquo;.  But if we are agreed that all those who could satisfy the Pension Board that they were members for three months before the Truce should receive a gratuity on that account and additions for each year of service there would be no difficulty.</P>
    <P>This raises the whole question of medals.  It has been said that some people have medals and have no right to them.  That is so because it was not too difficult to get a medal and people were prepared to vouch for something that was not true or that they had just guessed.  That raises the issue again because at some stage those medal-holders, when they apply for a special allowance, will have to submit to further examination.  That will be difficult.  Some men may not apply for the next ten years.  Some of the Fianna who are quite young may not apply for another ten or fifteen years. Who will be alive then to prove or disprove their claim?  I argued this before: every medal holder should have a certificate of service.  Medals are handed out and that is all.  Anyone could wear a medal and if challenged, could say he had just as much right to it as Deputy MacEoin.  Every medal holder should get a certificate to say that he had a right to that medal.</P>
    <P>In many cases people with medals who apply for special allowances are turned down.  Why let this go on? Why will it be better to prove it in years to come?  Why not have it proved or disproved now?  Why not examine every case now and satisfy yourself as to who is and who is not entitled to allowances?  Why wait ten or 15 years to do it?  Those who are entitled to medals should be given a certificate so that at any stage in the future that certificate is there as evidence that they are entitled to a special allowance without having to undergo any further examination.  Every person who has a medal and is entitled to it should receive a gratuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> It is well known that because of the Civil War justice was not done to the Old IRA.  The public at large were soured because of what happened in that Civil War.  They want to wash their hands of us.  If there had been no Civil War we should have had a grateful country anxious to be generous and in the case of those who could prove membership the country would have been generous.  That Civil War spoiled everything.  Whatever chance those who supported the Treaty had, whatever justice they had a chance of getting, injustice was done to the other side.  If they got nothing else those who supported the Treaty got jobs in the Army or Civil Service because their people controlled the State at its foundation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>A good proportion. Where they did not get pensions they got other opportunities while only a small proportion of those on the other side, because they were the losers, got the same opportunities.  The majority of those on the other side got nothing in proportion to what those who supported the Treaty got.  I am not raising the question of who got this or that; I am summing up the situation as it was because I was in it and I know what I am talking about.  I asked a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Government about it and he said: &ldquo;Sure, most of the boys got jobs; they did all right afterwards.&rdquo;  He meant that a small proportion got jobs.  Those who became politicians or Ministers were probably quite satisfied. They got something out of it. They had the glory of being in public life and being Ministers but a large percentage of the rank and file got nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who can prove on re-examination that they are entitled to medals should get a gratuity.  There are no laurels for the Civil War.  It was most unfortunate and like Deputy MacEoin, I want to forget it but at the same time I want justice for those who suffered in it.  A great many stood against the Treaty.  Fifteen thousand were known to have been in jail and that is indisputable but they got nothing even though they can prove they were <Col N="93" /> genuine members of the forces in the Tan War and the Civil War and had spent long terms in jail.  The people responsible for that were the leaders who led them into the War and should have done them justice afterwards. Those who supported the Treaty at least got a fair crack of the whip from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large proportion as compared with the other side.  The other side got nothing and I think the time has come when they should have got some measure of justice.  It does not matter that it is 40 years later.  Memories are short and even history is short if it comes to that.  I ask for a re-examination of all those with medals.  It is an insult to jibe and say some of these people are &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  That is as much as to say the genuine men are &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;. How can the genuine man prove now whether he is entitled to his medal or not?  I want justice for them.  Whether they were right or wrong they believed they were right.  If anybody is responsible it is the leaders.  The leaders did all right.  At least they were in public life and got something out of it.  I feel a little bitter about this because I was one of those on the other side and I know what I am talking about. I know how they feel today.  I have never left their councils.  Those who served but were supposed not to have been on active service have a medal and those who served and were supposed to be on active service had a medal with bar.  Those without the bar feel they are insulted because whenever there is a parade they are distinguished.  People looking on and seeing them are liable to say: &ldquo;Those fellows did nothing.  They have no bars.&rdquo;  That is what the world is being told by giving the bar.  There should be no bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy MacEoin went far enough with regard to disability. I have some experience of what is and what is not attributable to service as regards disease.   The Pensions Board in many cases said in effect: &ldquo;Oh, that was not attributable to service.  It was aggravated by <Col N="94" /> service but not attributable to service.&rdquo; Deputy MacEoin's motion makes no reference to those whose cases have been aggravated by service.  That means they would rule them out.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it would be very difficult to make a case for a pension in respect of injury attributable to service.  If it were easy to make that case, I imagine it would have been made long ago.  A lot of cases could be made in relation to injuries aggravated by service.  Many people who had an injury aggravated by service actually claimed it was attributable to service.  Do not forget that.  However, the Board have the last word.  They can say what they like.  They can say that it was not attributable to service but that it was aggravated by service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, unless Deputy MacEoin inserts the words &ldquo;aggravated by service&rdquo; in his motion he is playing into the hands of the Pensions Board. They can agree in one case out of 100 but they will not accept the other 99 cases.  It is a weakness in this motion that &ldquo;aggravated by&rdquo; or &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; can be disputed.  I do not want to argue that today; I have reasons for not wanting to argue it.</P>
    <P>If your two arms were shot off during the Tan War they would accept that because they can see you have no arms.  However, if your arms disappeared a few months after the Tan War they would say it was only aggravated by service.  You have to have the injury at the right time.  That is the way they argue some of the pensions cases.  They say that the injury was aggravated by but not attributable to service.  The Motion is weak there.  The Deputy must bring in the words &ldquo;aggravated by service&rdquo; because they would be the very people making the claim.  There would be few other cases.  I do not want to say any more except to come back again to the question of special allowances.</P>
    <P>The sum required each year for special allowances is lessening and it will continue to lessen.  I suppose that, ten years from now, there will be few, if any, of us left.  The State can afford to be a bit generous.  Having been so damned mean in the past, the State can at least afford to be a little generous in the future.  I agree that <Col N="95" /> something should be done about the means test.  I will go along with Deputy MacEoin all the way but my point is that the motion should go further because as it is worded, it lets the Minister out.  It means&mdash;even if he accepts it&mdash;that another couple of hundred might get a miserable pension because they can prove their point but what about the thousands who have got so little?  If the Deputy retains the word &ldquo;attributable to service&rdquo; it will apply maybe only to the very odd person.</P>
    <P>Let us be all-embracing on this.  Let us do a good deed for once.  It is now 40 years after the event.  In ten years' time, none of us will be left. Remember, the present Government did not do justice in this connection. They took advantage of the fact that time lapsed between the Civil War and the time they came into power.  I am asking them to treat fairly the men who gave service and whom, whether they like it or not, they walked into in the Civil War.  Let them treat them generously now, before all this business comes to a climax&mdash;and that will not be too long.</P>

      <P>The people engaged in the fight for freedom here would not thank me or anyone else if we tried to start up a feeling of bitterness in this country again.  I feel, with the two previous speakers, that this country has not given the recognition they deserve to the people who made Irish freedom possible, even talking about pensions.  I do not think it is realised that five-sixths of the pensions being paid amount to less than £25 per year per person and some go as low as £10 a year.  That bears out what Deputy Sherwin was saying a few minutes ago when he rightly described the treatment by the various Governments in <Col N="96" /> this country of these people in question as &ldquo;damned mean&rdquo;.  I think that was the understatement of the year to consider that the treatment was &ldquo;damned mean&rdquo;.  There is a much stronger expression which could be used but it would not be Parliamentary.</P>
      <P>Even those who consider themselves lucky enough to get a pension, with the small pensions they are getting, are better off than a big number of people who applied for pensions and who did not even have the opportunity of appearing before a Board. Again, this is something which does not appear to be generally known. However, it is true that very many people, many of the old soldiers, have not had an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been automatically disqualified, as Deputy MacEoin says.  There seems to be some mystery about the way some people were called before the Boards. A lot of them received replies something like this: &ldquo;You are a person to whom the Act does not apply&rdquo;. Actually, the people who got such a reply were condemned behind closed doors.  They were not given an opportunity of making their own case. Those people had applied and had produced what they considered to be the necessary evidence to prove that they were involved in the fight for freedom and were, therefore, entitled to be considered.</P>
      <P>I do not want to raise old bitternesses. However, it is a fact that some of those people even took a case to court and when the decision was given in their favour this House passed a measure which debarred them from having their case further considered. I do not think that was the way in which Old IRA men should be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate in this House before the Christmas Recess, I mentioned a matter which I discussed with the Minister.  I had some correspondence with him about it.  It concerned an application for medals by two ladies who served in Cumann na mBan.  I <Col N="97" /> pointed out that an officer of the Meath company was hauled out of the Pensions Branch when he was attempting to make representations.  In a letter to me, the Minister pointed out that the facts I gave him were not correct. I wish to reiterate here that the facts I gave him were correct, that the information he gave me in his letter was not correct, that he was misinformed and that somebody in his Department &mdash;and I regret very much having to make this statement in the House&mdash;not alone seemed to dislike that officer who was only doing his duty but went further and, apparently, because of the fact that the representations were made by that officer, debarred the two ladies from getting the medal and said they had not got the correct evidence.</P>
    <P>The matter was raised again and on the second occasion the Department came across with a chestnut.  They said the company to which these people claimed to belong did not exist, that there was no evidence that it existed during the period for which it was necessary to prove its existence, that there was no roll and for that reason it would not be possible to give medals. The extraordinary thing was that the same Department issued to other officers of that company of Cumann na mBan from that roll medals and certificates on a previous occasion.  If it was in existence then it must be in existence still and that is why I say somebody is deliberately venting his spleen against members of the company for the simple reason that he dislikes the person who made representations.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to go into this matter very fully.  It is a shocking state of affairs that something like that should be allowed to occur.  I understand the matter has been taken up with the Minister by the company concerned.  I know the Minister has no hand, act or part in this and I want to make it clear that I am not casting any reflections whatever on the Minister for whom I have a very high regard.  However, I would ask him to have this matter fully investigated because this sort of thing is adding insult to injury.  There is very high feeling among the people <Col N="98" /> who are associated with those ladies because of the treatment they have received.</P>
    <P>The question of the special allowance and the means test has been raised.  I agree entirely with Deputy MacEoin.  I do not see any reason why there should not be some appeal against the decision of the investigating officer who is in the same position as the investigating officer in the Department of Social Welfare.  In very many cases a recommendation has been made by the old age pension committee in favour of the applicant and the investigating officer for the Department of Social Welfare will appeal against it and go before a deciding officer who eventually, in very many cases, gives the decision in favour of the applicant. I do not see why the same thing should not apply here.</P>
    <P>The Minister might pass the word along to his investigating officers that they are not expected to know everything about the person who makes the application.  It is not necessary&mdash;and it used to be a music hall joke some years ago but it has gone far beyond a joke now &mdash; to find out if there are hens around the place and if there are any eggs.  Nor is it their responsibility to go out to the garden to find out if the old person who has made the application has been able to plant a few potatoes or a few heads of cabbage and try to put a value on them.  I do not believe that is their job and it would be just as well if they did not go too finely into these matters.  After all, if people did not require the assistance they would not be applying for a special allowance.</P>
    <P>There are two others matters to which I should like to refer briefly.  One is the case of a person who because of the lapse of time is now debarred from making application; the application form should have been sent in within a certain period.  Everybody here is aware of the type of people who do not want something for nothing.  As long as they are able to carry on and as long as they feel they can exist without State aid of any kind they do not make application to the State.  It is only when they suffer ill health or reach old age and find they cannot carry on without a little assistance that they apply.  It is <Col N="99" /> just too bad when those people apply and discover they are debarred because they did not apply many years ago. There is still the odd person or, if I may use the expression diehard, who up to very recently was not prepared to recognise the fact that time was moving on and that there was not a fight for freedom going on still in this country.  Some of those people because they were holding out on those grounds did not apply for a pension of any kind.  It is too bad that, when they apply now, they are debarred because of the lapse of time.</P>
    <P>There is the other question of certification. All of us realise that when so many of the old IRA men are dying off, the more of them that pass on the fewer people there are to certify for applicants who remain.  As a result, when people apply for a special allowance or medal, they may have grave difficulty in finding some of their old officers to certify for them.  The stage has been reached where the Department and the Minister will have to look at the situation to see if there is not a case for relaxation in the certification of applicants.  It will be extremely difficult to get enough people to satisfy the Department inside the next couple of years.  There is, of course, the question of people who apply and who have been certified by perfectly responsible officers of a company.  Occasionally, for one reason or another, somebody else is asked and either cannot remember them&mdash;small blame to them if they cannot remember after a period of 40 years &mdash;or they say they were not members of that company.  When that happens the Department's attitude has been: when in doubt turn down.  I do not think that is right.  It would be much better for the Department to accept the word of a couple of people rather than say that the doubtful ones must be against the person who has fought and that, therefore, the person must not be a member of a particular company.</P>
    <P>I wish again to ask the Minister to reinvestigate the case of the two ladies from Athboy.  There is very high feeling against the Department among the officers and members of the company who operated in that area because <Col N="100" /> they feel that what the Department is doing is saying they are not truthful people, that they are not people of integrity, that, in fact, they are telling lies.  It is unfair that people who have been recognised as being in the fight for freedom, as being responsible officers during that period, having taken a manly part in that fight, should for some reason I cannot explain be looked upon as people whose word cannot be believed.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy MacEoin is genuinely sympathetic to the Old IRA and believes they should be treated in a proper manner.  If anybody told me in 1922 that I would be standing here tonight discussing a Pensions Bill after 40 years, I would doubt the man's sanity.</P>
      <P>Let us examine this motion.  It calls for the introduction of legislation to do certain things but I do not think any legislation is needed to do all that it calls for. Under the existing Acts, I think the Minister has full power to deal with any legitimate claimants and to deal with those who suffered from disease attributable to service.  I may be wrong in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin did not deal with widows and orphans.  There is nothing in this motion about active service, yet he devoted most of his speech to active service.  He stated it was because of a promise he made to me some years ago that he brought in this Bill.  He said he promised at that time to define active service.  On 16th November, 1955, I had a motion down asking that the application for pensions should also cover applications for medals.  Deputy MacEoin at that time accepted the motion and agreed to put it before the then Government. From November, 1955, until December, 1956, nothing was done about it. On 6th December, 1956, I asked the Minister what was being done about it and he promised we would have a Bill before the Christmas.  That Bill did not materialise.  It was only when there was a change of Government in 1957 that the then Minister fulfilled the Deputy's undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin said he promised to go into the question of active service. <Col N="101" /> I do not remember that.  There was nothing in my motion about it. He talked of its being put before the people in that general election.  I have no recollection of its ever being made an issue of by any Party.  I do not think it would be opposed by any Party.</P>

I shall deal with manifestos before I am finished.  In his answer to me on that occasion Deputy MacEoin was very wary about amending the Act.  If he does not believe me, I would ask him to look up the debate for that occasion.  It is in columns 861-864 of Volume 153 of the Official Report for 16th November, 1955.  He will see his answer there. However, I am not arguing on that; I am concerned with the motion before us.  If I thought for an instant that this motion was going to help the IRA in any way, I would ask the Minister to accept it.  I do not know what the Minister is going to do with the motion.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy said he was wise in not doing so.  The <Col N="102" /> Deputy went further and gave his own definition of active service.  He gave us a long list of people who, in his opinion, were all on active service&mdash; people who carried arms, people who hid ammunition and people who did a whole lot of other things.  The only people he did not mention were the people who kept the men on the run and in my opinion they were the most deserving.</P>

      <P>I took note of it.  The Deputy did not.  Let us be sensible.  If the Minister accepts that motion and if it goes from this House that all these people are eligible for pensions, where are you going to start?  Let us stop playacting with the IRA.  We have been at it too long.  Let us be realistic about the whole thing.  I want to help the IRA.  I am one of them myself.  I want to help my comrades but I do not want playacting and I do not want it to go from this House that we are going to give pensions to men who carried arms or hid ammunition or kept people on the run.  If we are going to say these things constituted active service, what about the people who have already got small pensions? Are you going to set up a board to go back 40 years and investigate what happened?  Do not take it I am opposing anything that will help the IRA, but I do not want to be party to saying we are going to do something we have not the power to do and that would be completely impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, if I thought this motion would be of any benefit, I would ask the Minister to accept it.  However, I do not think it would.  I believe it will only succeed in fooling another batch of people and in raising false hopes in cases where nothing can be done. Therefore, the Minister would be very foolish in accepting such a motion at this time.  Anything this motion asks can already be done under the existing Acts.  By accepting the motion we would be only raising false hopes. <Col N="103" /> People would read something into it and say to themselves: &ldquo;We will all get pensions and gratuities,&rdquo; while there is no intention of providing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker said he was &ldquo;one of them&rdquo;.  Perhaps he was one of the lucky ones.  I would ask the Minister to accept what is in this motion.  When Deputy MacEoin or Liam Mellows was trying to form the Fianna, there was no means test. You were not asked how much you had a week or how much your mother had.  The last time we discussed this, I appealed to the Minister that when it was a question of services rendered, whatever was being given, whether a gratuity as Deputy Sherwin suggested or some other gesture, should be at least free from a means test.  Whether or not a person is in a good financial position at the moment does not take away from his contribution 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy MacEoin's lectures when he was Minister for Defence and, indeed, I was impressed in Jury's Hotel when he said he was certainly going to right a wrong.  I am not now sure whether that wrong has been righted.  In the past, the definition of active service has been far too rigid.  I told the Minister that when an applicant was accepted into the American Army, once he passed his medical test, his beneficiaries were guaranteed a certain amount of money in the event of his death.  I think the sum was 10,000 dollars.  He was on active service from the time he joined up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that of that wonderful party, Óglaigh na hÉireann, founded by Liam Mellows, only about 30 are in receipt of pensions for Fianna service.  On the last occasion we discussed this matter, I listened to one of the speakers from the other side of the House saying how much Fianna Fáil had done for the Old IRA.  On the question of special allowances, the Minister and his Department are aware of an applicant who is not able to walk, never mind to work, who condemned himself by a small figure of speech in <Col N="104" /> his application, although he had Fianna service.  I myself have certified the date of his Fianna service but there is still the departmental factor suggested by Deputy Tully that if there is any doubt at all, it goes against the applicant.</P>
    <P>The definition of active service has been very rigid.  There is one case I know of where those on the left-hand side of a fork road were granted pensions by virtue of their participation in active combat because the lorries went there, but those to the right of the fork road were not.</P>
    <P>I sincerely believed that the Minister was anxious even at this late stage to make some gesture.  I suggest to him that there would not be one objection to it in this House on the line of Deputy Sherwin's suggestion.  Even if it were only £10 a year or 4/- a week, the Exchequer would not be terribly upset.  We know that in another ten or 15 years there will not be many who will be able to enjoy the special allowance.</P>
    <P>It is, I admit, too much to expect the Minister to reopen all the claims but there are some outstanding claims, particularly disability claims, that were not made at the right time.  Where would you get a panel of doctors to agree that a person's condition was due to something that happened 40 years ago?  I got TB and had my lung collapsed.  How could I prove that that happened because I was in an internment camp or on hunger strike a number of years ago?  It would be ridiculous, but nevertheless it was a fairly good assumption that it was attributable to my experiences in that period.  I did not apply so the Minister can get that out of his head.  I was thankful that I got my health back. There are many others about whom the Minister might take a sympathetic point of view.</P>
    <P>I referred to the point made that members of the companies, whether the Fianna, the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, would not ask for verification, even if they were to get it.  I would ask the Minister to abolish the means test in relation to special allowances and pensions because they were won by effort and consequently those people should not be so treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If anything is being done under this Bill, I think it should be done for the widows with young children of those who have qualified for pensions and have since died.  Only a week ago, I heard of a sad experience of a man who gave good service and who qualified for a pension after a long term of applying and going through the usual channels, and within six months of getting the pension, he died, leaving five very young children.  That is only one instance.  I would certainly appeal to the Minister to do something if he possibly can for that type of isolated case.</P>
      <P>There is another group of people who, as the previous speaker said, are given an allowance on the strength of their circumstances at home.  That is terribly wrong.  I know of one case in Drumshambo of a man who was beaten and battered by the Tans and he qualified for the paltry sum of £11 because his family got on well and his circumstances at home were good. That unfortunate man cannot feel very proud of the treatment that has been meted out to him in giving him £11. That represents a very small weekly sum.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has a heavy task in meeting all the demands made upon him but it has come to my knowledge since I became a Deputy that a number of people who spent night and day carrying very important despatches are living in dire need. That work was just as important at the time as being in an actual engagement. They gave of themselves and lost their health as a result.  They became dissatisfied about the necessity to have a medal.  They ceased to have any interest in the matter.  I would appeal to the Minister to give every consideration to such cases and there are many of them.  Money given to these people would not be money badly spent.  These people did not undertake the service they gave for the sake of what they would get out of it.  They did it for their country.  They did not visualise a pension or anything else. They gave their service to the cause. The number of these cases is diminishing and money spent on those who remain would be money well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving the special allowances aside, on the pensions, both disability and service, I do not think I could come to any other conclusion from the speeches I have heard than that there is a very small number of cases in the minds of the Deputies.  That in itself indicates that, on the whole, quite a good job has been done in catering for the old Volunteers.</P>
      <P>The first part of Deputy MacEoin's motion suggests that the Military Service Pensions Acts should be amended so that justice be done to legitimate claimants for Military Service Certificates. He bases that suggestion on another&mdash;that the absence of a definition of active service in the Acts of 1924 and 1934 had the effect of depriving applicants under these Acts of justice.</P>
      <P>I think it can be presumed that when the 1924 and 1934 Acts were being prepared, the Governments&mdash;both Governments&mdash;they were Governments representing the two major political schools of opinion&mdash;were conscious of the fact that because of the varying types of service rendered during the 1916 to 1923 period, it would be difficult to give a definition of active service which would cover every possible case equitably.  It can equally be presumed, however, that the Governments of the time had in mind a distinction between simple membership, which it was not intended to cover, and the type of service which ordinarily, having regard to the nature of the struggle and the circumstances of the period, would be regarded as continuous active service.  Therefore, under both Acts, it was left to an independent authority to determine whether the service claimed by the applicant should be regarded as continuous active service.  Every person who did not succeed or who had not applied under either of these Acts was given a further opportunity to put his case again under the 1949 Act.  Thus, every person who believed that he was eligible for a certificate of military service or a service certificate was given the fullest opportunity of establishing his entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> No doubt, in some cases, people failed to get certificates to which they felt they were entitled and, no doubt also, there were cases where people are regarded as having got certificates to which they were not entitled.  It may be taken as inevitable that both sorts of cases should crop up in legislation of this kind, no matter what method of investigation might have been applied and no matter what standard of service was laid down.  In matters of this sort, there are always borderline cases and, no doubt, many of the 2,000 cases that succeeded under the 1949 Act could very properly be placed in that category.</P>
    <P>I know that when Deputy MacEoin was Minister for Defence, he made public his view that the Military Service Pensions legislation should be reviewed, that he did have prepared in the Department a definition incorporating his views as to what should constitute active service and that he also had prepared a draft scheme for the setting up of a number of local or regional boards to investigate appeals under amending legislation which he contemplated.  But, since he has suggested that the Government of which he was a member accorded approval for what he had in mind and since he has described the succeeding Government and Ministers for Defence as having repudiated undertakings given by their predecessors, I must say that I can find no record in my Department that approval of Deputy MacEoin's proposals was at any time given by his Government or that the idea of the setting up of local boards to reexamine claims for military service pensions ever got beyond the paper stage or that a committee had been set up in the Department to carry out any such plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin did put his proposals before his Government but they were never approved.  In fact, that Government seem to have been very conscious of the difficulties which would be presented by any such review and on several occasions they postponed consideration of the proposals. The records of the Department show that no such plan was approved by the <Col N="108" /> previous Government and, therefore, there could not have been repudiation on the part of their successor, as alleged by Deputy MacEoin.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a further reopening of military service pensions claims at this late stage would be justified or would, in its results, serve any useful purpose and I was interested to note that at least two speakers have endorsed that viewpoint.  That is not in any way to disparage the service given by those who did not succeed in getting pensions and recognition of their service is given by the scheme of special allowances which takes account of membership or ordinary service where the member needs financial assistance for reasons of age or ill-health. In fact, more than 11,000 such allowances have already been awarded.</P>

It is interesting to note&mdash;and I would call the attention of Deputies generally to it, particularly those who seem to lambast Fianna Fáil more than any other group in Dáil Éireann in relation to alleged neglect of the Old IRA&mdash;that there have been increases on four occasions in military service pensions and it is interesting to note the years in which they occurred&mdash;1953, 1959, 1960 and 1962.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke and other Deputies who have spoken have expressed the opinion that this Bill was very necessary.  I agree with them completely that the amendment of existing legislation on this matter had become absolutely necessary.  It gave inadequate powers to the local bodies concerned and inadequate protection to the man in the street.  It has resulted, in my opinion, in otherwise responsible bodies such as Cork Corporation carrying out acts which were illegal, under the semblance of doing them under the Act.  The very fact that the amendment of existing legislation was so necessary makes this Bill one of the most dangerous attempts to pass a measure of this sort through the House for a long time and I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;and if he fails to listen to me, I would appeal to the House&mdash;not to let the Bill pass in its present form.</P>
      <P>It is an oppressive measure in its present form.  It is one of the most determined attempts I have seen to take from the Legislature its powers, to take from local bodies their powers and, in the last analysis, to take from the ordinary private citizen his right, and to gather all these rights into the hands of one man, that is, into the hands of the Minister for Local Government. In my opinion, this is a new despotism at its zenith, tantamount almost to indecency.  The bureaucrat has full and final power as to a man's fundamental rights.  Anybody who looks at Section 3 will realise how wide a net has been cast in this Bill. There you read that development means &ldquo;the carrying out of any works on land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> Parliament here is asked to hand over these wide powers to the Minister, not of course in so many words.  That is the sad injustice and the misleading nature of the whole thing.  It can very easily mislead this House.  The right to make a planning scheme is not in the hands of city or county managers.  It is one of the reserved functions of the elected representatives, but when the elected representatives have gone to all the trouble to do all the things necessary in preparing a draft of a proposed development plan, we find tucked away cosily in Section 22 (3) :</P>
    <P>The Minister may require the planning authority to vary the development plan in respect of matters and in a manner specified by him and thereupon it shall be the duty of the authority to comply with the requisition.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Deputies on the other side who are members of local bodies realise what they are being asked to do.  I do not know if Deputy Burke, who is a member of a local authority and who made gurgling sounds of delight at this magnificent legislation, realises what he is doing.  If Deputy Burke wants to pass this Bill as it is, he wants to pass Section 22 (3) which empowers somebody sitting over there as Minister for Local Government advised by his officials, to do what he likes about local planning.  I appeal to the ordinary Deputies behind the Minister to bring to the attention of the Minister, either inside or outside the House, the fact that we the elected Deputies of Dáil Éireann do still occasionally think of our constituents in between elections.</P>
    <P>The old Act was limited enough. Now this Bill is the most audacious attempt I have yet seen to invade, not alone the rights of the individual but of Deputies and of elected local representatives. Possibly it is not without some significance that the Preamble to the Bill has a sort of half-apologetic strain.  It says:</P>
    <P>An Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas.</P>
    <P>When a Preamble to an Act has to go <Col N="111" /> to the trouble of explaining it is for the common good, it is plain to me, and it should be plain to most Deputies, that the Act is not exactly as pleasant as it might be.  In addition to the provisions of Sections 3 and 23, to which I have already referred, there are other sections which go much too far&mdash;Sections 31, 32 and 33 are in similar strain.</P>
    <P>They are broad; they look all right at first glance, but then they give the local authorities, which are subservient to the Minister, much too wide powers. The section I find most completely divorced from reality is Section 19 which, in effect, says the local authority shall prepare a plan within three years. If the House passes that section, it will be engaging in a piece of stupidity only equalled by the Transport Act, which enjoined on CIE, irrespective of the circumstances or the consequences, to do certain things by 1964. How can this House, with any sense of reality, say to a local authority: &ldquo;Look, no matter what happens, you will have a plan ready by three years and even if it is not necessary to have a plan, you must have a plan because we say you must, and it does not matter how many more officials you have to employ to prepare it.&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister should ask the House to deal with the matter in that way and set an arbitrary period in which some authority shall prepare a plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that authorities such as Dublin Corporation, or indeed Cork Corporation, for many years have been intending to prepare a plan.  He knows how far they got and the difficulties which they encountered when they got going in their attempt to plan.  Above all, I would ask this House&mdash;I do not ask the Minister because I do not believe he would be ready to bring in an amendment of his own&mdash;but I ask the ordinary man in the street who sits in the back benches of the Government Party to remember that once a plan is made by a local authority, as ordered by the Minister, if the Minister so directs, that plan governs the use of all private property in the area in question.  I ask them to realise the importance and significance of that.  Under these <Col N="112" /> circumstances, whilst like Deputy Burke, Deputy Barry and other Deputies who spoke, I agree with the necessity for the Bill, and welcome some aspects of it, I still think there are other aspects which are absolutely obnoxious and very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the manner in which the Minister had prepared the ground for this Bill.  He congratulated the Minister for sending around a number of lecturers to address members of local authorities.  I do not know anything about the sincerity or the qualifications of the lecturers&mdash;I was at one of the lectures and it was most interesting&mdash;but this is a precedent which I for one deprecate very much. I think it was a deliberate effort to soften the ground for the Minister.  It was, in essence, a propaganda effort by the Minister to prepare the ground in this House for an easy passage for the Bill.  These lectures were given at public expense and I do not think the Minister is entitled to use public money for propaganda purposes for passing through this House a measure which is highly controversial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also referred to the fact, when dealing with Part IV, that the matters referred to in Sections 24 to 41, were taken outside the ambit of the elected representative.  He mentioned that he felt that the average public representative should have the greatest confidence in his county and city manager and his county and city engineer.  I do not agree with that.  I think the public representative in the ordinary scheme of things is the natural enemy of the public servant and if it is ever otherwise, it will be a very bad thing for the ordinary man in the street who is governed by the public representative and the public servant. It is important that we should have that balance between the two sections of the legislature.  For that reason, I object very much to the suggestion that this House, both on its own behalf and on behalf of local bodies, should virtually vest in the Minister the power to do anything he likes in relation to the matters I have raised, namely, the carrying out of any works on land or the making of any material change in the use of some kind of structure on the land.</P>

      <P>It is high time that a Bill of this nature was brought in and made law.  Apart from what we have seen driving through the country and through Dublin and the suburbs or in any city or townland, one hears plenty of criticism from people who like to see well-ordered development, well-designed buildings and good planning.  What has happened in the past gives us no cause to be proud of the efforts that were made.  Adequate planning and development is a great necessity and the Minister in introducing this Bill is doing what should have been done, in my estimation, many years ago.  The 1934 Town and Country Planning Act endeavoured to do something but for one reason or another, whilst it had some good points, it never really suited the occasion.  Consequently we have this Bill now.</P>
      <P>Driving along our main roads and streets, what are we presented with? On the main roads, we have filling stations which are gradually cluttering up every corner and every vista.  We have trees and hedges impeding our views and access to the seaside and lakes in fishing areas is impeded by farmers who refuse to let people cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not high time the people were given an opportunity of seeing the beauty of this country?  Is it not high time we got rid of those hedges which block our views?  Is it not high time we got rid of a lot of the unsightly buildings in our towns and cities?  Is it not high time we opened up our thoroughfares, not from the point of view of permitting greater speed&mdash; although there may be a case for that &mdash;but from the point of view of showing order and planning?  This Bill sets out to cover every phase of planning, so far as I can see.  I know that we as representatives of the people, when we give powers of this nature to a Minister, have to be very careful that there is some limiting factor and that the rights of the people are respected and preserved.  There are occasions, however, when the action or inaction of one man may stop or delay orderly planning that will be beneficial to the whole community, and under these circumstances, and where measures are <Col N="114" /> provided for adequate compensation, such action as this is justified.</P>
    <P>This Bill covers a multitude of items. It covers the development and preservation of our seaside.  I see, also, that it provides for the prosecution, if necessary, of people who deposit litter after their Sunday picnic.  This is necessary, in my opinion.  There are regulations already, but it is high time there was something more than regulations.</P>
    <P>There are certain things in this Bill against which one would like to guard, things in relation to which one would like to know exactly what the mind of the Minister is.  The Bill provides in certain cases for the acquisition of land by local authorities.  One would like to guard against what has happened in England.  Local authorities there compulsorily acquired lands for development. Now the lands are being offered to private enterprise builders for private development and the original owners, who could have disposed of them in the same fashion, in the first instance, are naturally aggrieved.  I trust nothing like that will be allowed to happen here.</P>
    <P>The control of transmission lines is highly necessary.  We have the ESB and the Post Office slinging wires all over the country, until the whole place is festooned with wires.  Again, here in this capital city, the roads and streets are covered with all kinds of standards. There is no attempt at proper planning. There is no attempt at aesthetics from the point of view of design or anything else.  There is a veritable multiplicity of variety in lamp brackets.  If this Bill will empower local authorities to control this kind of thing, then I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Approaching Dublin through the suburbs can be quite a horrible experience, but it is not Dublin alone. The same thing occurs in every city, town and village in the country.  There should be some local body to control these matters.  Someone said the Minister had an ulterior motive in making an effort to ascertain the views of local authorities and to explain to them what it was intended to do in this Bill.  It was hinted that the Minister was trying to sell the people short by sending out these propaganda <Col N="115" /> merchants on his own behalf.  I think that is a very unfair misconstruction of a genuine effort by the Minister to inform people properly in advance.</P>
    <P>I approve of the time limit where plans and schemes are concerned.  I think three years is a reasonable period. Once the local authorities have the powers, it will be up to them to prepare their plans.  A stop will have to be put to all lop-sided development. Proper provision will have to be made for residential areas, industrial areas, parks, playing pitches and recreation grounds.  There will have to be a proper road and street design.  There is very little, from the point of view of design, of which we can be proud, with one or two exceptions.  Is it not high time we took some pride in our cities and towns, and our country generally, and ensured that development takes place along proper lines?  I have heard objections voiced by people living in residential areas because of the establishment of a factory in the area, a noisy factory or one from which noxious smells emanate.  It is high time we had legislation to correct that sort of thing.  People who go to live in a residential area are entitled to enjoy the amenities of the area.</P>
    <P>Is it not time, too, to open up our town centres?  Town centres can be very beautiful.  At the moment they are horrible.  Street planning is nonexistent. There is no variety in housing. Very often one gets the impression that only the skimpiest plan was drawn and the materials thrown together.  Is it not time we introduced some orderliness and beauty into our town planning?  Our housing estates leave much to be desired from the point of view of planning.  Housing seems to be governed more by grant qualification than anything else.  There is a monotonous regularity about our housing estates.  One gets tired of the unending repetition.  Is it not time some effort was made at improved architectural design and variety?  Is it too much to ask the House to approve provisions aimed at improving the present position?  I do not think it is.  It should be possible to create something that will enhance the beauty <Col N="116" /> of our country and remove something of the drabness out of life generally.</P>
    <P>This Bill covers a wide field.  It is a progressive step to bring within its scope the former building bye-laws of local authorities.  It is high time that was done.  We have no standard form of planning bye-laws.  They change from county to county.  It is time to provide ourselves with a proper standard to which we can conform and adhere, plan and build.  This is vital and I welcome the measures being taken as it were out of the hands of the local authorities and put into the hands of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The powers given to the Minister in this Bill to acquire buildings that block thoroughfares and impede ordinary development are one of the best things in it.  In Dublin the ordinary development of the city centre is on many occasions impeded. A Dublin Deputy, Deputy Burke, instanced the case in Dublin where a ruined estate continued for years because somebody would not sell or dispose of his premises and there was no machinery by which he could be made to do so.  We had to put up with that state of affairs despite the ardent wishes and need of the corporation to do something.  It is high time legislation was brought in to see that a person owning property is adequately compensated and that progress is not retarded.  This Bill will facilitate progressive development, well-designed architecturally.  Haphazard building of a block here and there in a street without any great regard to intervening property heretofore tended to spoil rather than improve the city's appearance.  This Bill will empower the Minister to see that planning is done for the proper ordinary development of a street so that it will add to the city's beauty. It is right and proper that the Minister should be given those powers.</P>
    <P>One would like, if possible, to depend entirely on the good sense of people but knowing that people are as they are this legislation is necessary. If an opportunity arises through planning or otherwise for somebody to sit <Col N="117" /> back and hold a town to ransom, as it were, he will do it.  This arises on many occasions out of planning by county councils.  It is time that type of exploitation was stopped and discouraged. If it is not done, the Minister is empowered to deal with the matter through the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the plan itself&mdash; I should like the Minister to note this &mdash;might tend to give rise to certain abuses.  Planning around any town, village or city involves values.  A certain farmer who has land in or near the town may be very anxious to have it incorporated either for industrial use or use of some other kind and feels that in this way its value will be enhanced.  When the control of development in enforced and when there is restriction on darting out into the countryside here and there, this will result in the amount of land available for development, as it were, being reduced.  That can have a dangerous side and I should like the Minister, when replying, to say how he proposes to stop that kind of abuse.  I need hardly say that people owning land near cities and towns will be watching this Bill very carefully from the point of view of compensation in the first place if the land is ripe for development and its inclusion or exclusion in the town plan would have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that needs to be carefully watched and noted.  A Deputy mentioned that in regard to private unfinished estates he would like to see some form of legislation to charge on the ground in some compulsory fashion the cost of finishing-off the estate.  I do not go along with that suggestion. Where a private householder has bought his house and owns the fee simple in the site and development is not complete in that road, as a heavy ratepayer, it is the responsibility of the local authority to look after it.  Where the developer may be brought back, that is another matter, but to attach the liability to the site alone is, I would say, dangerous.  It tends to become a form of retrospective legislation from which God protect us.  I should never like to be associated with that type of legislation.  Vigilance of local authorities <Col N="118" /> in seeing that when planning approval is given for this type of work, the provision of bonds or securities for the adequate development of sites or, indeed, complete prohibition of any building until the main development works are done would be far more desirable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I must compliment the Minister on the numerous exhaustive inquiries and investigations he has made into what has happened in other countries and on examining their Bills for shortcomings and on introducing this Bill that has regard to almost all sections of our people with a view to creating an overall plan within the country.  It leaves us some hope for the future to know that the Minister has these powers and will use them to ensure orderly planned development of the country.  I do not envy the Minister his job in presenting such a complex Bill in many ways.  It tends to extend or expand control over the people. People who would be really affected by this are people who in the normal way do not make any effort to be good citizens.  They are people who, for one reason or another, in their own narrow, selfish way will not co-operate.  I do not blame people for trying to get the most out of a particular piece of land but I do object to holding a town or a people to ransom knowing that there is a circumstance prevailing under which they must ultimately get what they are asking for.  For these, I would pass the power over to an arbitrary body to decide on compensation. However, I should like the Minister to make provision for some saver of some description there by way of appeal or otherwise, should there be any aggrieved parties.</P>
    <P>Along our long and beautiful coastline, you come across wide areas of beaches to which it is impossible at the moment to gain access.  Alternatively, one has to pay a small fee to the landowner before getting permission to cross.  I welcome the provision whereby this position will be cured and our beaches will be opened up and made available to all of our people.  I welcome the fact that this charge for using a path across somebody's land will be set aside or, alternatively, that <Col N="119" /> a proper path will be provided by the local authority.  That is something which should have been done long ago.</P>
    <P>One could discuss this Bill forever and still find things in it to comment upon, things to laud and even things slightly to amend.  However, from whatever part of the country you may come, or wherever you may live, you will find something in this Bill to agree with.</P>
    <P>The proper planning of roads tends to provide greater safety for road users. Slums in our towns and cities are becoming a danger in many ways and they are a blot on many beautiful towns.  It is high time power were given to have them pulled down.  Nobody wants to pull down anything that is beautiful.  Rather, this Bill sets out to preserve that which is worth preserving, that which has an historical value, that which is artistic.  Every aspect which comes within the orbit of planning, preservation or development in the country would appear to be catered for in this Bill.  For these reasons, I compliment the Minister on going into the matter so thoroughly and so carefully.</P>
    <P>The preservation of national monuments, ruins of old abbeys, round towers and other buildings, and the opening up of many of these so that visitors from overseas can see and appreciate the glories and cultural attainments we as a nation achieved a thousand years ago, is a step to be welcomed. To let these treasures fall away into decay and ruin and lost forever to the nation would be criminal.</P>
    <P>From whatever aspect you may look at it, the Bill provides for the preservation of that which needs to be preserved, for the erection of structures which it is high time were erected and for a planned orderly scheme of development for town and country.  I compliment the Minister and commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Deputy Gallagher seems very pleased with this Bill.  He mentioned that he would like provision to be made for an appeal on behalf of aggrieved persons or bodies.  He did not specify what type of appeal he would like and it is <Col N="120" /> a matter to which I should now like to address myself.</P>
      <P>Under one of the earlier Town Planning Acts&mdash;the 1934 Act&mdash;the method laid down for appeal was somewhat as follows: a plan was submitted to the Minister.  It was published and laid before each house of the Oireachtas for any objections either House might like to make.  Finally, under Section 34 of the Act, any aggrieved person or persons might appeal to the High Court.  The method adopted under the present Bill is markedly different.  Now, a plan must be prepared within three years.  It is a flexible, reviewable type of plan but it does not need ministerial sanction and, as far as I can gather, the officials in the Customs House may directly participate in its preparation.  However, once in existence, all private property in the area to which it applies is governed by its provisions.  In turn, these provisions are governed by regulations laid down by the Minister and which will apply to all development of land and retention of all unauthorised structures. The Minister himself may, as regards any appeal, go to the High Court on a question of law but here, as far as I can see, there is no appeal for any aggrieved citizen to any court of law.</P>
      <P>What has happened between 1934 and 1962?  Have the property owners of this country become less important? Have the rights of the average citizen become of lesser significance in the eyes of the Government?  Why were citizens in 1934 whose property was impinged upon given the right of appeal in the High Court and why is that right being taken from them now? Any appeal that exists now is entirely to a Minister.  Bureaucratic control has replaced the judiciary and, speaking as a democrat in this Assembly which has all the trappings still of democracy, that I deplore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second aspect of this Bill to which I wish to refer is the question of punishment under Sections 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36.  Section 31, for example, deals with the development of land.  Section 32 deals with the retention of structures which have been conditionally authorised but the <Col N="121" /> conditions have not in the view of the local authority been fulfilled.  Section 33 deals with the retention of structures unauthorised.  Section 35 deals with the departure from the terms of the planning authority in respect of any development; and Section 36 deals with the removal or alteration of a structure as decided by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>In any contravention of these sections of the Bill, when it is enacted, the authority may enter the property owner's land and may alter or abolish the property in question.  Furthermore, the authority may bill the owner for the costs of this alteration or abolition and here is the crucial point: there is no court appeal.  The planning authority may enter that property under the very specious phraseology: &ldquo;any other material consideration&rdquo;.  Again, when we look back to the 1934 Act, we find there was some protection for the individual. Under the 1934 Act, there was provision for appeal to the district court under Section 52.  What has happened to democracy?  What has happened to the rights of individuals, to the rights of property owners, between 1934 and the present day? In that time we have had plenty of experience of democratic survival on the Continent of Europe but apparently the lesson has not been learned here.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention one other point on which I may, perhaps, be open to more criticism and which is, perhaps, a more debatable question.  It is the question of advertising.  There seems to be a kind of witch hunt mentality operating in this country as regards advertising and it is couched in the expression &ldquo;bill posting&rdquo;.  I appreciate that bill posting and daubing across roads and across streets can be objectionable but surely we all recognise there is a form of advertising which is not so grossly objectionable as that? Anybody reading this Bill would glean from it that all forms of advertising are reprehensible.</P>
    <P>This Bill even goes so far as to pick out advertising as one form of activity which will not receive any compensation. Under Section 24 the Bill states that the retention of unauthorised structures after the appointed day shall <Col N="122" /> be an offence unless permission has been obtained under Section 27.  Seemingly, it is an offence even when a case is under appeal which may go on for years&mdash;as will likely happen by virtue of the fact that a huge number of cases will be under appeal and not alone professional advertisers but business people in general may be subjected to much annoyance by the rather extreme attitude which the Minister and his Department seem to take towards advertising activities.</P>
    <P>I have also gathered from this Bill that no compensation is provided either for advertisers or landowners where a sign is posted and ordered for removal. A small landowner may be getting a small ground rent for some advertisement and, if I am interpreting this Bill properly, if he is compelled to remove this poster or signpost he will receive no compensation for the few pounds a year he was receiving from some advertising company for allowing them the use of his field or ditch.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the Bill in general, it presents, if I may describe it as such, a sort of global approach to town planning. Yet when you come to read it and examine this country in relation to it, it seems to me that town planning as we understand it is in the first instance necessary for places like Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and other bigger centres.  The Minister would have produced a more acceptable and better type of Bill had he proceeded in the first instance by dealing with the larger sections of population, where there is a case to be made for more elaborate town planning than in the smaller towns and villages.  Not alone would it be the more prudent approach, but in that way, the Minister and his officials would get experience step by step. Furthermore, it would be more in keeping with our financial position.  This measure will entail considerable financial expenditure.  The Minister, however, has chosen the opposite course. He has chosen at one fell blow to introduce a measure of town and country planning, covering every centre of population from 1,000 up and setting up an inordinately large number of local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>All town planning Bills&mdash;and this <Col N="123" /> Bill is no exception &mdash; seem to have been fair imitations of similar Bills in Great Britain.  Yet there is very little parallel between Great Britain and here.  In one country you have a large number of people in a relatively small island, where there is considerable overcrowding and a large measure of industrial disease problems.  In this country conditions are entirely different. The only places where we have any parellel conditions with those of Great Britain are the larger centres of population.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill has a dictatorial flavour which I completely deprecate. It was said here to-day that dictators make the best planners.  Certainly, I suppose, they make the most effective planners.  One may ask oneself do planners become dictators.  I think the answer would be that the tendency is definitely so.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishes a kind of political bureaucratic autocracy, by virtue of the fact that the judiciary are being largely by-passed in favour of the Minister, who is now to be the judge and jury.  It cannot be denied that such a Bill will arouse in the public mind suspicions that it is a measure which lends itself beautifully to political patronage.  I contend that in this Bill the rights of private property, which all should be concerned to preserve as sacrosanct as possible, are being seriously impaired.  I contend that bureaucratic control under this Bill will tend to replace the rule of law.  This Bill might be described as constituting, in conjunction with the County Management Act, the Magna Carta of the Custom House.</P>
    <P>We are told that the making of a plan is a function reserved to public representatives; but anybody who has served on a public authority knows how relatively ineffectual public representatives are.  The authority will, in practice, be the county manager and his assistants, working in close conjunction with the higher officials in the Custom House.  There will be numerous appeals under this Bill when it comes into operation.  These appeals presumably will be heard by tribunals established under the control of the Minister.  There will, of necessity, be <Col N="124" /> a relatively large expansion in the number of civil servants to handle such a large number of appeals.  The Minister mentioned there was a large amount of work in Dublin alone with the introduction of planning legislation there.  When the entire country is brought under this Bill and when each planning authority is compelled to prepare a plan, how can any Minister pretend he is able to give personal attention to the numerous appeals which will be forwarded to his Department?</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, had this Bill been introduced in more piecemeal fashion, it might have been possible, or relatively more easy, to deal with appeals.  I admit the Minister said that in the actual operation of the Bill, he would tend, where necessary, to proceed in stages.  Why take powers before you need them? Would it be beyond a parliamentary draftsman to prepare a Bill dealing with the larger centres of population and make that Bill applicable later to smaller centres, as and when the occasion arose?</P>
    <P>One of the gravest difficulties I see in this Bill is that every minor official up and down the country will become a small tinpot town planner in his own fashion.  Every objection to any reconstruction work which a property owner may undertake will initially arise from a minor official.  Once that chain of operation comes into being, it is almost impossible to stop it.  Even with the best intentions in the world, no single Minister could get through all the reading that would necessarily arise with an avalanche of complaints. Of necessity, the Minister will have his attention drawn to the more difficult and complicated cases.  Naturally, his attention will be drawn to cases where large financial concerns are implicated.  But will his attention be drawn to the small individual, the old person living in a small shop, whose vital interests&mdash;to them just as vital as those of the more wealthy individual&mdash;are impaired by impending legislation?</P>
    <P>Can you imagine how much sympathy a young civil servant, who is carried away by enthusiasm for a plan, <Col N="125" /> would have for some poor old woman selling sweets down a side street?  She will be brushed aside, while the large and powerful concern will be able to secure the necessary advice and support and fight their case.  Under the Bill, framed as it is, allowing all appeals to rest with the Minister and by-passing, as it will, the courts of the country, I think the interests of the small person, the small individual will suffer.  In conclusion, I think this is a wrong Bill, introduced at the wrong time, in the wrong country and in the wrong circumstances.</P>

      <P>When we look back and see when the last Town Planning Bill was introduced&mdash;this is an amendment of the 1934 and 1939 Acts&mdash;we find that a lot of water has gone under the bridges since that time and there have been a number of changes in the world.  We have seen in the past what bad planning has done.  Some of the old towns have narrow, winding streets. In this day and age, when we have an idea of what we want, and with the world getting smaller so that we can see what people are doing in other countries, one would imagine that it is high time we had a new Town Planning Bill.</P>
      <P>The value of good planning has been seen to a great extent in Australia. When they were planning a new capital in Canberra, they held a competition and asked the architects of the world to give them the best possible design for a city.  From that competition, they got a design for an extremely nice city, a city which is the pride of Australia and the showpiece of the world.  We cannot do that.  We have to plan from the existing situation but we have seen in that new city how good planning works.  We have also seen it in England in the new industrial towns which have been set up.  We must be careful of industries being set up near residential areas.  Very often industries are set up where they can get a site, irrespective of whether it is near a built-up or residential area, and it may in time annoy the residents of the area.  It is time for us to look around and plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> I am pleased to see that the Minister is demanding that the local authorities should make out a plan in three years. That will give us an aim or a goal and we can then go on.  The Minister very wisely explained at the start of the Bill that it is a flexible Bill because, as time goes on and changes occur, the planning authorities or the local authorities will be able to adapt themselves. This Bill will be flexible and adaptable to what may happen.  That is something new because we hear about most Bills that they are too rigid and lay down the law either on one side or the other.  Here the Minister is being big enough to be prepared to look to the future and provide for changes that may come about.</P>
    <P>I see that the local authorities actually have leave, if necessary, to build factory buildings.  I often feel that when a town is looking for a factory&mdash;and really crying for a factory &mdash;when you look into it, you rarely see anything that will entice a person there.  We may take it that every town in Ireland is looking for a factory or two.  Factory owners have all Ireland to look at and they have to look at every site.  One thing that would entice a concern to a town is the possibility of leasing a factory in it.  It costs quite an amount of money to put up a factory and a firm might not like to be stationed in one place.  They might like to go nearer to a port as time goes on. If they could lease a building, that would be an enticement and would save some financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>We have seen the results in Shannon where factory buildings have been put up.  They are all occupied.  Some of them have changed hands in the two years but they are all still occupied and expanding.  On my visit there last May, I was certainly impressed by the buildings there.  In Kilcullen, in Kildare, a Press conference was held and a factory building was offered.  They offered to provide a fair-sized site as well.  In the following weeks, they had quite a number of inquiries and they are still getting inquiries.  I grant you that nothing has been definitely decided but they are at least getting inquiries.  Many towns are getting no inquiries.</P>
    <P>It is a very big step forward to <Col N="127" /> allow a local authority to build a factory building to entice industrialists. Under the Bill the local authority would have power to develop a site for houses.  I know of one case where a town lost a factory because there was not a developed site available for the housing of workers.  The industrialist who was interested in establishing the industry surveyed the proposed site and inquired as to where the factory personnel and the skilled men whom they would bring with them would live.  On being told they would have to build houses and provide the amenities he lost interest.  Most foreign industrialists have been accustomed to having all the services laid on.  If that were done here it would be of great assistance in the establishment of industries and the provision of amenities. Proper planning is absolutely essential.  No one likes to live right beside a factory.  The value of houses near the airport has diminished as a result of the nuisance caused by the noise of aircraft.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the local authority will be given three years in which to plan for the future.  When the plans are prepared they will be exhibited to the public.  The elected representatives and the people themselves can put forward their views.  They will be able to point to defects in the plans and to suggest improvements.  That will go a long way in helping to produce the best possible plans.</P>
    <P>The needs of the pedestrian must be taken into account.  There are many instances of bad paths in towns, particularly in residential areas.  A good feature of the new, well planned, built-up areas is the provision of good walks with grass margins and possibly trees. It is as a result of such development that some towns are securing high marks in the tidy towns competition.</P>
    <P>I notice that advertisement structures and advertisements will be controlled. In Italy there are large-scale advertisements over miles of main road.  The same thing could happen here.  In the last few years such structures have been erected on our main roads.  Most of the advertisements are not too well designed.  In some cases they are <Col N="128" /> allowed to become dilapidated.  Such structures create a bad impression and it is only right that power should be taken to control them.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the powers being taken in regard to the creation of public rights of way.  It is important that where there are beauty spots, lakes, rivers, seashore, there should be access to them.  For instance, in County Meath there is a coast line of about five or six miles but there are only one or two points of access to it. It would be of great public benefit if there were at least access at every mile. Traffic jams are created at times because there are not more exits from the strand.  I commend the Minister for his foresight in making provision in the Bill in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that some lovely views of scenery are blocked by buildings.  I am glad that areas of special amenity are to be specially dealt with.  Such amenities are a very important tourist attraction and should be preserved.  I know of one case where such amenities were destroyed as the result of the building of houses on a certain site, which was the only reasonable site available.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill in regard to parks.  In some towns the children have no suitable playgrounds and it is difficult to keep them off the street.  I am glad that local authorities are being encouraged to provide parks and playgrounds.  I know from my travels abroad that in other countries playgrounds are provided with suitable slides and other equipment for children.  In such parks, the children are safe from traffic danger.  This is only keeping in line with other countries.</P>
    <P>Most European towns have been planned with a view to the future and there is no reason why we should not do likewise.  I have often admired the good wide main roads in Europe, often provided with paths for pedestrians. In Denmark, they had even provided a track for cyclists.  The Minister might consider that in the light of the present Bill.  There could be a separate track on the side of the main <Col N="129" /> road for cyclists.  If such a track were provided, it would enable them to cycle safely.  Frequently after accidents, people say they were blinded by oncoming lights and did not see the cyclist.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the public lighting of the seashore, river banks and other places of beauty.  This will give engineers and architects scope to put their ideas into practice and think for the future.  It is also a good thing that the plans will be on view to the public.  In this way, we shall get an exchange of ideas and develop the best possible plans.  For those reasons, I particularly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt after such a long period, it is necessary to bring town and country planning up to date and from that point of view, this Bill, or at least I should say, some Bill, is necessary.  That does not mean that this Bill is either necessary or acceptable. It gives very wide powers to the local authorities in conjunction with the Minister.  I use that phrase deliberately because if the Minister takes a certain line of policy and the officers of the local authority take the same line, then all appeals fail and they become an arbitrary power.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law, every piece of property in the State is governed by it.  If we get cohesion and collusion, to use possibly unpopular words, or the same point of view from the Minister as the officials of the local authorities, then the rights of the individual have gone and with them one of the bulwarks of democracy because the rights of the individual in relation to property are one of the cornerstones of the building we call democracy.  Therefore I believe this Bill goes too far, and, that in its machinery for appeal and in its manner of doing a job, it exceeds requirements so far as this type of country is concerned, and at the same time it places power in the hands of one section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not true that those senior, or even junior, officials of the local authorities must work in conjunction with their counterparts in the Department of Local Government?  Is it <Col N="130" /> not true that the normal county manager is in consultation in the Custom House at least once a fortnight and, as it is true that he could not possibly carry on his duties and that life would become unbearable if he did not go with the stream, then it is similarly true that you will get cohesion of views which will mean that the blank wall will face anybody who finds himself on the wrong side of the fence in relation to this planning legislation.</P>
    <P>The difference between the existing situation that I see, as apart from the question of a plan to be created, and the future situation is that there was a flaw in the planning legislation up to the present.  I remember a company in which I was involved and which was building a weighbridge.  Having proceeded with the weighbridge and having made application, we got a prohibition notice.  Then we received a notice telling us that for every day we continued to build the weighbridge, we would be fined £5 but we were advised by our engineer that there was a flaw in the Act and to carry on. Happily, the Minister&mdash;on the other side of the House: I give him full credit for it&mdash;granted the appeal and we did not have to go any further. The situation was that there was a flaw in the Bill and all we would have suffered if the Minister had not granted the appeal would have been that if a road ever went through the weighbridge, we would receive no compensation.  That was made quite clear.</P>
    <P>Now the situation will be quite different and we may find that even in respect of unauthorised structures before the passing of the Bill, there can be a demolition order or a removal order by the local authority. Yet, I am the first to admit that there is a necessity for some planning organisation.  The plan that was emphasised in the previous legislation was passed only in Dublin and, of course, because of the legal clause in the previous Act and the rulings of court, the position was that even that plan had not the full force of law. Perhaps it was rather wise that they did not make plans in the other cities <Col N="131" /> and towns.  Is it not terribly arbitrary if, as is suggested in the explanatory memorandum and the Bill itself, local authorities were to decide that, on the north side of a town, they were to have all the industrial development and all the residential development on the south side because that is what is required.  The man who owns land on the north side has the value of it changed by a stroke of the pen and at the same time, you have people with new opportunities who had not got them before.</P>
    <P>Dublin did not grow that way and Dublin is one of the finest cities in the world.  People are not so stupid and if you leave out this question of the difference between getting a horse and cart and a modern lorry&mdash;to use one illustration&mdash;up the streets of a town, the people did not make mistakes in the past.  Unless the purpose of this Bill in relation, perhaps, to street planning or the siting of industries is to look forward to the day when lorries, maybe, are as big as the <i>Queen Mary</i>, and so on, I do not think it will serve a great purpose.</P>
    <P>It is quite incorrect that an industrialist coming here, who might decide that a very valuable site would be the one he would choose, would be told by the planning authority, in effect: &ldquo;No.  You must not go on that side of the town.  You must go on the other side of the town.&rdquo;  That position should not exist.  That does not mean that I want to see building directly in front of a row of residential houses already existing which would obviously depreciate the value of those houses.  However, there is a way this problem could have been attacked. There could have been specific provision for the lowering of values and specific provision for the siting of things that might lower these values or create objections near to residential areas or, indeed, the siting of one factory which might have an objectionable odour or a great amount of smoke next to a food factory, and so on.</P>
    <P>That is not the way this Bill has attacked the problem but rather on the basis that the local authority shall make the plan, produce it and put it <Col N="132" /> there for the public to look at, who will never have time to look at it because it will be a foot thick for each county or area.  Having done that, you will take it or leave it and that is all there is to it.  I regard that as far too arbitrary.</P>
    <P>If I wanted to make a direct and general statement I would say that all this is synonymous with the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the way they do things.  If they were over here and if either the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party were over there, neither of those two Parties would produce this Bill.  I say that, just from knowing the men in each Party.  I know that is as clear as clear can be. That is what would happen.  That is the difference people often seek to find. That is one of the basic differences between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I had a look at the 1934 Act.  The position in relation to the 1934 Act was that when a plan was produced it was laid here on the Table of the House and the House had an opportunity to seek its annulment.  If the House decided by virtue of its majority that such was annulled that was that.  That did not relate to the individual; it related to a majority in a democracy.  Even if, perhaps, a minority could not get a plan annulled here it could make its protest publicly. It would come from people from whom you would expect it&mdash;the Opposition, who were interested and involved in these things as members of local authorities as well as being Members of Dáil Éireann.  If they did not, and it went through its number of days, Section 31 of the 1934 Act provided that any person whose property would be affected could, within one month after the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of his intentions, appeal to the High Court for the annulment of the order.  Here again we have the protection of the individual which in this Bill only, as I again repeat, requires the cohesion and the same point of view of the officers of the local authorities and the Minister and the Custom House and it is gone.  The 1934 Act gave that provision, gave that safeguard.</P>
    <P>The position now is that there is absolute prohibition on the carrying <Col N="133" /> out of any development in this country except in accordance with the plan. Permission must be got for any of this development.  If it is contrary to the plan that must be produced by every local authority within three years it will not get that permission.  The Minister's general approach, naturally, must be, if he is carrying out the policy, to instruct his officers that they must throw out the appeal in a certain set of circumstances.  The Parliamentary draftsman has seen to it that the flaw I outlined in the previous Act will be sealed up.  No longer will it be possible anywhere for a man to say: &ldquo;Here is my land.  I want to develop it in a certain way.  That way is not obnoxious.  It is unlikely that I will be sued in common law by my neighbours. If I develop in that way then, later on, if a road goes through it, I may not receive compensation but at least I can do what I now propose.&rdquo; Now, he cannot do it if he does not win his appeal which is most unlikely. If, in the first instance, it is not granted then his unfortunate situation is that the officers of the local authority can enter upon his lands, can demolish any structure he has put thereon, can charge him with the cost of it and, if they cannot get the money from him, they can make an instalment order.  That is a complete analogy with Section 31 of the Local Government Act, 1931, which sought to do the same thing if a landlord did not repair a house for a tenant.  That has never been implemented and in my view so long as democracy exists in this State this will not happen either.</P>
    <P>In Section 26 of the Bill, there is another situation where all-enveloping power is sought by the Minister and his Department.  Land beside land to be developed may fall within the ambit of this measure.  A direction may be given that such shall or shall not be done to achieve conformity.  I feel that there you can get a complete conflict of ideas and plans for development between the owner of the land who is, of course, always subject to commercial and financial considerations, and the local authority.  I have in mind the man in a town who, <Col N="134" /> perhaps, might decide that on one site he would place a restaurant and, next to it, a bar, if he has a bar licence.  If the local authority did not like the lines on which he was progressing, if they felt his two buildings were not in conformity, they could inform him, in effect: &ldquo;No.  If you put a restaurant there it must be such and such a size. If you put a restaurant there which is three stories high the bar must also be three stories high.&rdquo;  That conflicts with everything the man hoped would be his opportunity.  It conflicts with the freedom that we have.</P>
    <P>I am the first to admit we do not want to see buildings that are distasteful to the eye, buildings that are not in&mdash;and I deliberately use the same word&mdash;conformity with the rest of the street.  A little bit of individuality is probably the opposite to Georgian architecture which we have heard so much about but it can very often be extremely nice.  I would be very doubtful, where an individual wanted to be out of line if he would get the sort of approach he should get from the engineers in the Department of Local Government.  He might want to be different.  He might want to be one up on his neighbours.  I have never met anybody in Local Government who would perhaps sympathise with that commercial instinct.</P>
    <P>Section 33 takes in all unauthorised structures before the Bill is enacted.  I know of one such unauthorised structure. I do not know how long ago it was built but there is an Order under the Town and Country Planning Act&mdash; I presume of 1934 or the previous Act&mdash;to have it removed.  The man involved is a decent man who runs a public house in the town of Drogheda. He has no capital to build a new public house.  The situation is that if the planning authority decide that that is a dangerous corner, it can demolish the public house.  I do not know what happens then; I have tried to puzzle it out under this Bill but I do not think it should arise because I can mention twice as dangerous a corner which was created in the construction of a new road by the county council engineers, not threequarters of a mile away.  I was in a car belonging to one <Col N="135" /> of them the other day and we both agreed it was an extremely dangerous corner.  I do not know what the situation is in relation to the house there but it shows that county council planning is not always perfect.  We have a good county council but we have not always produced the perfect situation. All those errors can be removed at the expense of the individual and the individual must fall before them.</P>
    <P>In relation to power, the Bill is an omnibus Bill.  It takes in everything. When you consider Sections 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36, you find that all these sections have the phrase &ldquo;any other material considerations&rdquo;.  Those are the empowering sections, the sections under which orders are made and under which compulsion is used.  I am a member of Drogheda Corporation, a member of Louth County Council and a member of the Dáil.  When the Government put through this measure I shall not have time to go through it nor will any other individual and even if I did, I would not have time to advert to all the material considerations which might result from an order under this Bill which might interfere with the rights of the individual.  Once it is there and has been viewed by the public and representations made, it is law and there you are.</P>
    <P>The question of advertising is one on which there can be very mixed views. There was a cartoon in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of November 17th, 1961, which showed a beach; the view of the front of the beach was blocked off by advertisements along the road and the caption is: &ldquo;Will it come to this?&rdquo; It is quite clear there must be regulation on advertising but if an advertisement is not obnoxious, immoral or in any way undesirable and if it does not interfere with a particular scenic view, an accepted view of great beauty, then the individual who owns the land should have the right to lease a site to company officials who want to erect an advertisement, gain the profit thereon from his property, and the company should have the right to expend their money and to gain their profit from the increase in trade.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that is extraordinary but I do not think so. <Col N="136" /> Deputy Crinion mentioned seeing advertisements on the hoardings in Italy.  I went through Italy, too, and saw very beautiful advertising hoardings. They advertised Chianti wine and Compori and Strega liqueurs, which were all very cheap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not worry me at all.  Looking out across the beach, I did not see them in places where there were scenic views, in places where they were obnoxious.  I do not think that the area between Dunleer and Drogheda is a scenic place.  I live half way between the two towns and I have six or seven fields in which I do not intend to sell advertising space to anybody but I defend my right to sell it.  I could sell six spaces where all the view you would obscure would be 50 yards of grass or of wheat.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Why should my rights as an individual be interfered with?  Why should the rights of every owner of land in the country be interfered with?  If you go along a certain road in my county, you can see the Mourne mountains, the Cooley mountains and Dundalk Bay and if somebody wants to erect a huge hoarding to block out that view there is no provision in that regard in the Bill.  If I want to put up a hoarding against a background of grass in my own field, advertising my own public house across the hill, I can be stopped.  The Minister for Transport and Power contends it is horrible, it is outrageous.  I do not see anything wrong with it.</P>

      <P>If we are going to stop signposting along roads in every place where it does not affect driving or road safety, then the reasons why signs shall be so prohibited should be specified in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;continuous signposting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right&mdash;why continuous signposting should be so prohibited. What is wrong with taking the advantage we have of the people who come to us from the North of Ireland?  The Larne-Stranraer ferry is a most popular way for tourists to travel.  They drive down along the road we have just been talking about. Would it not be great if, when they have crossed the Border, they saw advertisements for the products we produce here&mdash;advertisements that do not interfere with scenic views but are merely examples of commercialism, the thing that gives us our bread and butter, and an odd steak maybe? That is the way I feel about it.  Everybody has a right to a certain view, and the Minister for Transport and Power and Deputy Corish are entitled to their views.  But so long as the signs are not obnoxious and do not affect any scenic attractions, which are the property of everybody, and so long as they are permitted by the landowners, why not?  I want to see all the products we make here advertised.  I want to see Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann's new vegetables advertised.  I want to see the new &ldquo;Harp&rdquo; lager advertised. Even if local authorities were to specify that they could give priority to signs advertising our own products, there would be something in that.  But under this Bill the local authority&mdash;in practice, the county manager &mdash; can prohibit all signs and I regard that as quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion also mentioned Australia and said that when they wanted to re-design Canberra, they got in several experts, who did the job in a global fashion.  It is a grand situation when you have only 10,000,000 people in a place like Australia.  But even with our 2,250,000 people, it is not a proposition.  Whatever are the strictures in this Bill &mdash; it is a Bill composed <Col N="138" /> of strictures alone &mdash; you will never afford to move back the houses where the streets are too narrow.  It is right that we should not continue to build extremely narrow streets and obstruct the passage of traffic, but you will never afford to change Ireland the way you want to do it.</P>
    <P>If you are going to take away the rights of individuals, you are in grave danger&mdash;and I say this without referring to any personalities&mdash;of creating a society of demi-gods: local authority officials, Department of Local Government officials and the Minister.  All we want in that situation is a close little get-together and we are all in their power.  Personally, I do not want to see the Irish people in anybody's power, whether in or out of Government. It is from the Irish people we derive this power.  We are their servants, not their masters.  We should take that as a rule of thumb in the matter of government.  While we can all have our strong views&mdash;the Minister for Transport and Power has expressed his &mdash; at the same time, unless we are sure we have a majority, we should not inflict them.</P>
    <P>My last word is that I hope on Committee Stage we will see many amendments accepted by the Minister so as to bring a little democracy, a little flavour of man's right to live in his own property as he wishes, into this Bill.  Then we may have something worthwhile.  As it stands, it is gravely in need of serious amendment; and I hope that will come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's most comprehensive survey and explanation of the provisions of the Bill leaves little to be said.  Much of the comment made in the House will, therefore, refer to the form which a particular plan should take and might be more properly addressed to the particular planning authority.  Comment, however, must be made.  It will be the duty of public representatives to exercise the vigilance to which the Minister refers, because vigilance will be necessary if a town plan is to be realistic and long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain developments which might seem ideal to a planning authority could, on more mature consideration, <Col N="139" /> prove unsuited to the needs of the people.  There are at the moment in Dublin city old parishes which are being denuded of their populations because of the inroads being made by industry.  There must be incorporated into any plan for Dublin city provision for the erection of municipal flats in two very old Dublin city parishes, City Quay and Westland Row.  Nothing else will satisfy public opinion in these areas and nothing else will do justice to the avowed desire of the corporation to provide a decent dwelling for every citizen.</P>
    <P>Planning in Dublin Corporation has been and is a continuous process.  The appalling legacy of bad and insufficient housing we inherited necessitated continual planning, because some order had to be brought into the business of demolition, reconditioning and building, if the city were not to degenerate into a hopeless jumble of flats and houses erected at random.</P>
    <P>If planning is to remain a continuous process, any Act which makes planning obligatory upon a municipal authority must give the authority some power to alter a submitted plan in order to meet changing circumstances.  For that reason, the sections which demand periodic reappraisal of original plans must be welcomed.  The previous Act appears to have been too rigid and too uncompromising in its demands.</P>
    <P>In the period of change and development through which the country is passing, rigidity makes only for frustration and impatience with a law which refuses to recognise a fresh need.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the significance of planning in relation to our efforts to promote and expand industry.  It would be well to remember that if these efforts continue to prove successful, then in addition to an expanding industry, we will have an increase in population.  Such an increase is bound to cause a continuance of our housing problem. Therefore, anxious as any planning authority may be to play its part in developing industry, care must be taken to ensure that housing needs do not conflict with those of industry.  It might be better to move industry to <Col N="140" /> the city's outskirts rather than the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister's expressed disapproval of huge advertisement hoardings along new frontages is welcomed.  Too often these hoardings cause most irritating obstruction of what was intended to be a broad, sweeping view of a stretch of countryside gracefully developed. Occasionally, they are erected in such a way that they obstruct the visitor's view of a new and impressive example of modern Irish architecture&mdash;perhaps a school or a church.  If the people who are responsible for these road advertisements lack good taste, then there is no alternative but to prohibit the erection of such advertisements except on selected sites.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the conservation of amenities.  Surely one of Dublin city's greatest amenities is the grand wide boulevard of O'Connell Street.  It is something in which Dubliners particularly, and every Irishman in general, can take pride, and it would be a pity to see it degenerate into a series of slot-machine shops, bellowing forth the loudest and noisiest of the latest pop tunes.  Anything less dignified and less gracious it would be difficult to imagine.  I submit that no one has any desire to interfere with the legitimate pastimes of the people, nor to tamper with the rights and liberties of the individual, but no one will thank us if we allow our greatest thoroughfare to develop into a succession of &ldquo;honky-tonk&rdquo; gambling saloons and amusement centres.</P>
    <P>It is an irritating experience for one who holds any affection for his capital city to take a walk along O'Connell Street and be greeted by these noisy, ugly products of the 20th century.  It may be said that these places are the inevitable product of an age in which people are enjoying more and more leisure and, therefore, more and more time for pleasure.  Whatever may be said, and whatever may be the arguments for and against the existence of these pleasure palaces, certainly there can be no justification for allowing them to spring up <i>ad lib.</i> in our city centre.  I submit that unless some effort is made to curb this undesirable <Col N="141" /> development, then O'Connell Street will lose its attraction for ourselves and for our visitors, and if O'Connell Street loses its attraction, then the charm and dignity and order which our architects and our builders are endeavouring to bring to our city will be lost.</P>
    <P>We cannot evict the owners of the existing saloons but we can discourage the trend and see to it that no more of these places are allowed to open in O'Connell Street.  There are other parts of the city more suitable for this form of business, if we must have it at all.</P>

      <P>We have come a long way from the bad old days when Dublin was notorious for its slums. Thanks to our efforts, and the efforts of our predecessors over the past 40 years, those slums have almost completely disappeared.  It would be a tragedy if we were now to exchange the slum of the old days for a modern one.  So it will be, unless we take steps to demonstrate our consciousness of beauty and our detestation of ugliness.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Corish has already said, we in the Labour Party welcome the Bill because we believe it is long past the time when amending legislation to the 1939 Act should be introduced.  We do not agree with everything the Bill contains.  As a matter of fact, we disagree with the way in which many of the sections are put.  I would not go so far as Deputy Donegan went, and say they are deliberately trying to prevent the citizen from exercising his right to do what he wants with his own property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things in the Bill to <Col N="142" /> which we object is the fact that while the local authority is mentioned on numerous occasions and the right of the local authority to do certain things, in fact, the Bill means the county manager.  Very few functions are reserved to the members of the local authority themselves.  For that reason, we feel that while the managers may be people who have the interests of the area they govern&mdash;and &ldquo;govern&rdquo; is the right word&mdash;at heart, nevertheless, we do not think they have the local knowledge, in many cases, which is necessary in order to put the point of view of the local people of what is required.  That is where I agree with Deputy Donegan.  I think the interests of the local people must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Advertising hoardings were mentioned by practically every Deputy who spoke.  I have mixed views about them.  I remember an incident where a rather poor person had a small portion of land adjoining a main road. He had a house and he had erected a rather ugly-looking shed.  He was offered quite a considerable sum by an advertising agency if he would allow them to put up what I thought was a very artistic poster between the shed and the road.  The local authority said it would disfigure the area and he was refused permission.  In fact, nothing could be more disfiguring than the old shed.  I would not like to see it on any main road.  In his wisdom, or otherwise the county manager decided that it would be wrong to put a poster on a hoarding between the shed and the road and the result is that we still have an uninterrupted view of the old shed which, I assure the House, is not improving with age.</P>
    <P>I know that quite a number of hoardings have been erected throughout the country which are objectionable. They are not obscene or anything like that, but they impede the view of the area, or the scenery of which there should be an uninterrupted view.  At the same time, certain types of hoardings have been erected in certain areas which could, in fact, improve the area, provided they are kept in good order and not allowed to <Col N="143" /> become tattered and remain in a tattered and rustry condition for years. As Deputy Donegan said, they may be covering up, perhaps, a field of bad wheat or something like that.  In my opinion, if advertising signs are properly designed, there is nothing wrong in putting them up.  I still think it depends on the individual case and I believe the right to decide whether or not they can be erected might possibly rest with somebody who would know the area well and would know whether or not it would interfere with the amenities.</P>
    <P>When we talk about hoardings, particularly advertisement hoardings, we should go a little further and inquire about the poles and wires which the ESB and the Post Office are erecting all over the place.  Surely nobody in this House or outside will deny that there is more disfigurement of amenities by such poles and wires than there is by advertisement hoardings?  At present the Post Office appear to be making an effort to lay some of their cables underground.  When that is done, I hope the old poles and wires will be taken down.  That will get rid of some of the disfigurement.  I do not know if anyone here has ever gone along the seashore and has gone out to sea to view the land from there.  The one thing that strikes one is the ugliness of the array, or disarray, of poles and wires which seem to be spread all over the place.  When we speak about preventing the disfigurement of areas and the protection of scenic beauty, we should remember that more than advertising hoardings are involved.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the right to zone areas and to decide whether or not the local authority has the right to say that only buildings of a certain type will be put in one area and buildings of a different type in another.  I am not too sure that that is what is meant.  I understood it was a recommendation rather than an actual decision that is contained in the Bill.  However, I am sure that will be explained later on.  Deputies who spoke here this evening seemed to think that we should have everything planned and that we should get away from the <Col N="144" /> traditional type of building and should adopt more modern styles.  A few Deputies who have recently visited Brasilia will remember that the planning there is of the most modern, but I do not think that any of us would like to see Dublin city developed on the same lines.  The attempt which has been made in Brasilia to be ultramodern has defeated itself.  Of course, as Deputy Cummins said, O'Connell Street is a lovely street and anything that disfigures it should be condemned but there are lovely streets, lovely villages and lovely towns in this country.  We must be practical and remember that while O'Connell Street is supposed to be the widest street in Europe, there are very many lovely towns in this country that have streets that are not O'Connell Streets, that are, in fact, so narrow that it is impossible for two vehicles to pass each other.  In such cases one of two things must be done.  If possible, the street must be widened, or alternatively, the street will almost certainly be by-passed eventually.  We must face up to that.  Under existing legislation, there is very little provision for that situation.  It is past time when the necessary powers should be taken to ensure that such cases can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>With reference to the legislation as it stands at present, particularly the 1939 Act, those of us who are members of a local authority are aware that the legislation is mainly carried out on pure bluff, that if the public knew exactly what the local authority was entitled or not entitled to do under the Act, there would be very little action taken against the people who are doing things which the local authority say they cannot do under the law.  I am aware that there was a provision made to cover the position where the local authority decided by resolution that there should be planning for a certain area.  I have in mind a particular area where such planning was prepared for and quite a considerable amount of money spent in having a plan drawn up.  When the plan was examined, the engineer for the area estimated the cost at approximately £20 million.  This was some years ago before costs went up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I hope when this Bill becomes law and it is mandatory on local authorities to prepare plans that we will not have any £20 million plans being prepared by people such as those who prepared the plans for Brasilia, people who have no idea of costs, who merely want to show what they would like to do if they had not to foot the bill.  There is grave danger that something like that may occur.  I would ask that that aspect be given grave consideration and that when we say a plan must be prepared within three years, it will not be a case of putting the pistol to the head of a local authority who then must hire somebody.  The architects with the ability to prepare plans such as I imagine are required here are not so numerous that a local authority could rush out and get one tomorrow who would be prepared to go right into the job.  We could finish up with some more of these £20 million or £40 million schemes which would make the entire Bill unworkable.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to ribbon building.  I know the Department are completely against the type of ribbon building which we have had but can one blame local authorities if they are inclined to carry out ribbon building when the only hope they have of doing a job any way reasonably is by building along existing roads?  If the question of adding new roads to a building scheme arises, the cost of the scheme and of the houses being built is increased considerably.  For that reason, there will have to be a new approach by the Department, and I hope it can be adopted under this Bill, when it comes to the question of development in an area where extended new roads are required.</P>
    <P>A number of Dublin Deputies this evening referred to building in Dublin but I did not hear anybody referring to something which has occurred in Dublin where schemes have been started and roads have been run a certain distance and, at a later stage, somebody decides to develop the scheme further and finds that not only will he have to make a road into the scheme which he is developing but will also have to re-make a road which was only half-made by someone else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> There is one case which I understand is under consideration at the present time where a contractor is being asked to take down a corner which is not on the property he is developing, in order to make the road safe.  The corner is on a portion of road supposed to have been already developed many years ago by a predecessor of his.  These are matters which should be covered in a Bill of this kind.  Provision should be made to ensure that anything that is done is done properly. The local authority and the people who are going to live in the houses should have the fullest possible coverage from the Legislature so that they will not have their eyes wiped by some smart Aleck who decides to take the easy way out by gerrybuilding. Somebody suggested that we will probably see the end of gerrybuilding when this Bill is passed.  I think we are a long way from seeing the end of the type of building the smart Aleck gets away with.</P>
    <P>The question of planning and developing areas has been referred to mainly as affecting the cities and some towns but, in fact, rural Ireland must also be considered in relation to development.  A number of rural areas at present, because of industries and other reasons, have recently increased their populations and as a result require many extra houses.  Some local authorities have begun making provision for an increased number of houses in country villages.  Two or three problems immediately arise. One is the question of acquiring the land.  The second is the question of dealing with the roads to get into the new buildings before they are completed and then there is the question of public lighting.  All those things should be very fully covered in a Bill of this sort.</P>
    <P>Certain public lighting has been carried out in villages throughout the country over the years.  At every estimate meeting of a local authority we find somebody has suggested that all the villages in the county should be lighted and the county engineer usually submits an estimate of the cost and, as the estimates go along, and as the <Col N="147" /> people who want to keep the rates as low as possible take off a farthing here and a penny there, we eventually find that the couple of pence extra required for public lighting is deleted.  Year after year it comes up and year after year it goes out.  Occasionally, as a big concession for some reason or other, a half-penny or a farthing will be included in the estimate to have extra public lighting in one of the villages where someone has already been killed. I think the onus is on the Department to ensure that extra houses are built and that if an area becomes a built-up area the Department should insist that there is proper public lighting.</P>
    <P>Last year or the year before, a revised public lighting system was suggested by the Department of Local Government and that recommendation was sent to all local authorities.  No doubt if the lighting, as laid down in this recommendation, were carried out we would have a wonderful lighting system, almost as good as they have in Brasilia but the trouble is that if the local authorities were unable to find the few extra pence required or were not prepared to find them in order to have the existing type of lighting installed in the country villages where it was required, it was surely nonsense to suggest that they be asked to replace all the lighting in the area with a system costing about ten times as much.</P>
    <P>This is something that has been glossed over in this Bill.  It should be dealt with very fully and local authorities should be forced to provide proper lighting in all built-up areas under their jurisdiction.  It is all right to say that amenities which are mentioned here are desirable but unless it is mandatory and unless local authorities must do these things they are not prepared in many cases to provide any amenities at all.  It is all right for nonmembers of local authorities to say here that the amenities should be provided but it is another thing to be a member of a local authority and try to get the money provided for an amenity. Therefore, I believe the Department must do much more than simply say that the planning authorities would be empowered to do certain things.  Finding <Col N="148" /> the money to pay for what they may do is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion referred to rights of way.  So did one or two others.  I think this must be considered not alone by the Minister but by a number of other Ministers.  For years past, rights of way were required in certain places and by general usage the width of a cart has been the maximum width of most of them.  It is now found with modern machinery, particularly harvest machinery, that it is almost impossible to get in and out of some farms because the existing right of way has an entrance of a certain width.  I have in mind a recent case where a farmer in getting a combine into a farm which was passing through portion of a lane owned by somebody else had to take down a pier of a gate.  He harvested his crop but when he was finished not only did the other farmer insist on having the pier rebuilt exactly as it was but also on getting fairly heavy damages for disturbance of the pier. He took advantage of the man trying to harvest his crop.  Since I came to this House this is the first Bill in which I found any reference to rights of way and I think that it should set a lead and if a right of way is laid down it should be wide enough to allow modern machinery to go in and out and should not just be wide enough to take merely a donkey and cart which would be all right many years ago.</P>
    <P>There is another case in which possibly the Department could help and that is where entrances to seaside places are concerned.  We have a number of seaside resorts in my constituency and, unfortunately, the entrances to most of them are not what they should be.  As a local authority, we have some difficulty because when we wanted to acquire one of those entrances, which is normally accepted as being a public entrance, the persons who owned the adjoining land claimed they were paying rates on that entrance and would not allow the county council to spend money on improving it, making it possible for people to go in and out.  This is something I think the local authority should be empowered to do under the new Bill and I hope it is included.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> This has been described as a Committee Stage Bill and I believe that is a true description of it but I hope there will be a number of amendments introduced to improve it. Unlike some speakers, I hope the Minister himself, after listening to the suggestions offered, will amend the Bill.  It is very easy for a Minister to delete or improve a section, compared to having it done by somebody on the opposite side.</P>
    <P>Let me refer again to the question of who has the right to make decisions in those cases.  The Bill says &ldquo;the local authority&rdquo;: surely, the fact that it is not the local authority but the manager who makes the decision should be clearly set out?  I believe the right should lie with the local representatives.  I am aware that some managers are a long way ahead of many elected representatives as regards doing progressive things but still I believe when the local authority is empowered to do something, that should mean the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, when the local authority or the county manager refuse permission to somebody to do something and an appeal is laid before the Minister, I believe the matter is dealt with very fairly.  I was rather surprised to hear somebody say tonight that if the manager makes a decision, the Minister will make the same decision.  Under existing legislation, such as it is, in 99 cases out of 100, appeals to the Minister have been successful if the case is in any way reasonable at all.</P>
    <P>Petrol pumps were mentioned and whether or not there should be some way of trying to control them.  It is rather unfortunate that in the area around the city, we have petrol pumps every 50 yards of the road.  In country districts, particularly villages, people who have sought permission to erect petrol pumps in perfectly safe places have been refused.  This is one instance in which the Minister might be a little more lenient when appeals come before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had some experience of town planning, there is <Col N="150" /> little doubt in my mind as to the necessity for a change, for revised legislation.  Whether or not the Bill now before the House is likely to make the most adequate provision in the most reasonable way is something which deserves very careful and very painstaking consideration.  We cannot forget that the Bill asks that a plan be made before the end of three years. Once that plan is made, every piece of private property in the area concerned is governed by its provisions.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks considerably extended powers for planning authorities and for the Minister.  In view of our experience in the Dublin area in recent years, I believe additional powers are needed.  Because this Bill seeks such extended powers for the Minister, it is a dangerous Bill.  Every possible safeguard should be written into it, consistent, of course, with securing orderly and necessary planning.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that expensive road improvements could not be vitiated by allowing ribbon development along main roads, and so on. He referred specifically to petrol stations.  What happened on the Naas Road?  Applications for petrol stations on the Naas road were invariably turned down by the Dublin planning authority.  When they were sent to the Department by way of appeal, invariably they were allowed.  The decision of the planning authority was reversed.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we propose to give very much increased powers to the Minister. That gives an opening to a Minister to use that power for Party political purposes.  It may be that appeals in the future will be so numerous that the Minister could not possibly deal with them but there will always be that number in which he may personally be interested or in which some influence will be brought to bear upon him.  I refer to the petrol companies because I feel that strong influences have been brought to bear and have succeeded and that unfair advantage may be given to people in such positions over those in very much weaker positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much in this Bill to commend it.  Local authorities need extra <Col N="151" /> power.  In Dublin, I am glad to say, we have very experienced planning officials.  They are men of integrity, men with a national outlook, men who are prepared to bend over backwards, I would say, to accommodate any worthwhile development.  It has always angered me when an appeal went to the Minister and, without giving any reason whatever, the decision of the local planning authority was reversed.  Their decision had been arrived at with knowledge of all the local circumstances.  One of the changes that should be made in the present legislation is that if we insist that the Minister has the final say, we should make sure that when the Minister gives his verdict, he will give his reasons for it.  There should also be a limitation on the time taken to give the verdict.  Developers, builders, are very often held up unnecessarily by delays of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>I should like now to pass on to community planning generally.  We have had a lot of difficulty in Dublin in this connection, for various reasons. One thing I have seen developing, because of lack of power with local authorities, is that a very sizeable community is built up and then it becomes extremely obvious that no sites are available for churches, schools, health centres, libraries and recreation.  I agree with Deputy Tully in quite a few things he said here tonight.  Local authorities should have not only the right to provide these amenities but an obligation to provide them.  Planning of that sort should not be allowed to develop.  Any county should disown it.</P>
    <P>This difficulty arises much more frequently in Dublin.  We have had much more experience of it than country Deputies are likely to meet with for a very long time.  However, all over the place we have had this sort of thing.  Children of very tender age have to travel long distances to schools. Mothers with schoolgoing children have to bring them long distances&mdash; and, where they have no help in the home, at inconvenient hours&mdash;to health centres or dispensaries of one sort or another.  There should be a <Col N="152" /> centre in each community in which all these essential services are provided.</P>
    <P>We have haphazard community development all over the place.  Again, very big numbers of people have been moved from the centre of the city to the fringe, some miles out, with no local opportunities for employment of any description.  Not only should sites be reserved for churches, schools, health centres, and so on, but there should be, in an area where there are a lot of working-class people, sites for industry.  Local authorities should have a very definite interest and take a very active part in the provision of employment opportunities, in the establishment of industries, in the provision of sites for industries and in the invitation of industrialists to come along to the local authority who should then be able to produce a plan and say: &ldquo;We have sites here with all the services laid on, electricity, water and so on.&rdquo;  We should be able to give industrialists a complete picture of the possibilities in any given area. This is something we have not been doing.  One of the things that militates against that effort is discrimination in regard to grants but that is a matter I may not go into on the measure before us now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of estates generally the powers given up to the present have been insufficient. In County Dublin there are unfinished estates and we seem to have totally inadequate power to make the developer complete the work he originally agreed to carry out.  In many cases people have bought their houses in a hurry.  They are often inexperienced people, people who are about to get married, who just want a house at any price and will take practically the first house that is offered. If they know and like the area they will not consider all the snags that may arise afterwards and they will not have regard to the fact that there is no power available to them to get reasonable surroundings and reasonable amenities adjacent to their house afterwards.</P>
    <P>As I understand Section 35 of the Bill, it gives such power and I should like to be assured by the Minister that <Col N="153" /> this power has retrospective application, which is not clear to me from reading the Bill.  Furthermore, the developer is not the only person who should be tied down in this Bill.  The obligations of the local authorities should be clearly stated.  In many cases local authorities have been unreasonable with developers.  This works both ways.  When an estate is being developed it should not only be possible but it should be obligatory for a local authority to take that estate in charge road by road.  That has not been done in the past and I have known up to 12 years to elapse before people were given the normal services they were entitled to expect because the estate had not been taken in charge.  From the developer's point of view perhaps he on many occasions had a new estate fully developed and prepared for takeover but it would not be taken over because he could not hand over the total estate.  There should be a clear indication as to the obligations of both sides and this should apply not only to roads and houses but to open spaces.</P>
    <P>It should also be clearly stated what should be the open space a local authority is entitled to require a developer to provide.  This has been described from time to time as a lung. It is very difficult for a member of a local authority to understand what exactly is a lung.  Is an open space all the space that is not built on or is it the space that can provide recreation ground?  Does it include roads?  I never could get any sort of clear indication of what &ldquo;open space&rdquo; meant.</P>
    <P>Another drawback affecting this type of community development is that the people are not consulted sufficiently. Therefore, they have no interest and do not help to bring the community into being.  There is no encouragement for local development associations and no sense of belonging to the new community. Before there is any definite planning decision with regard to new areas every effort should be made to consult the people, to tell them about the planning arrangements the local authority has in mind and get their opinion and their suggestions.  It is <Col N="154" /> only in this way you will get the co-operation that is absolutely essential if newly developed areas are to be respected and if the people are to feel they are members of that community. We should be anxious to form something along the lines of the old villages where there was almost complete social integration and where individuality and privacy were preserved while at the same time the people felt this was their area and that they had a hand in the planning of it.  At present the estate is just dumped there and people get the impression that this is something that has been foisted upon them.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a special region as far as planning is concerned and this Bill has very little concern with most other parts of the country.  The Minister and the officers of his Department who have prepared this Bill are fortunate in having considerable experience available to them from the much more advanced planning in other countries.  If there is one thing more than another that has called for planning it is the motor car.  It seems to be the motor car that has given rise to so many difficulties in other countries.  In New York, for instance, there is one car for every three people.  We can imagine what this country would be like if the same ratio obtained here, and I believe we are advancing very rapidly to that point.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment to-day, Deputy M. J. O'Higgins gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 12 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice I would raise the subject matter of this question on the Adjournment.  The question I put to the Taoiseach was to ask him if he had received any representations urging that action be taken by the Government to relieve the hardship caused in many areas in Wicklow by the recent severe weather; what reply was sent by him to such representations; <Col N="155" /> and what action was taken by him in the matter.  The reply I got from the Taoiseach today was as follows:</P>
      <P>I received a communication from the Deputy.  As the text of his letter had appeared in the daily newspapers of the same date, I did not consider it necessary to forward it to the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House, and of the Taoiseach in particular, to the fact that I asked him three specific questions: (1) whether or not he had received representations; (2) what reply he had made to those representations and (3) what steps he had taken in the matter?  The Taoiseach's reply to that was to acknowledge that representations were received.  He gave no reply, good, bad or indifferent, to the question as to what reply was sent by him to such representations.  Of course, the reason the Taoiseach gave no reply to that part of my query was that he did not bother to send any reply to the representations made to him.</P>
      <P>The third part of the query was to ask him what steps or what action was taken by him in the matter.  The Taoiseach also avoided reply to that part of the query.  Again, I suggest the reason he avoided replying to that part of the question was that no steps whatever were taken by him and by the Government in the matter.  The Taoiseach was brassy enough to say in reply that he did not even bother sending on the communication, that he did not deem it necessary to send it on to the Minister concerned.  Quite apart from any question of courtesy or lack of courtesy involved in the Taoiseach's attitude in this matter, I feel I am justified in raising this, in view of the deplorable inaction of the Government in relation to the situation which arose in my constituency and in other constituencies due to the recent very severe weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the Taoiseach likes to admit it or not, I have no doubt that there are supporters of his own Party in County Wicklow who will assure him of the fact that for the first <Col N="156" /> few weeks since the beginning of this month, there has been a situation of very definite emergency approaching crisis proportions, and in some cases approaching near disaster proportions, in large areas of County Wicklow. There has been tremendous work done in that county by local authority officials, by the workers of the local authority, by voluntary organisations, by local clergy, by local Gardaí, by individual members of the local council, including members of the Taoiseach's own Party, who recognised that a very serious situation had arisen.  There has been magnificent work done by a private concern&mdash;I think it is no harm to mention it and pay tribute to it&mdash;the <i>Independent</i> newspaper group and in particular the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;who shouldered the responsibility which should have been shouldered by the Taoiseach and the Government in this matter.</P>

      <P>It may be a matter for jocose remarks, sneering jibes or laughter from members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but Deputy Paudge Brennan is not going to thank his colleagues who laugh at the people of Wicklow.  I can assure them of that.  I give Deputy Paudge Brennan every credit as a man who did his part, who went around the constituency and who knows the difficulties encountered there.  There were <Col N="157" /> other members of his Party who did likewise.  I made it my business as soon as it was possible to gain access to some portions of the constituency to convey my own congratulations to a member of Deputy Paudge Brennan's Party and the Taoiseach's Party for the work he was doing in a particular area.  My complaint is not against Deputy Paudge Brennan or any other member of the local council in Wicklow, all of whom did their part and more than their part.  My complaint is that they were let down by the Government.</P>
      <P>This was a situation which, as I say, was approaching near-crisis proportions. In those circumstances, surely the people were entitled to look to the Government for some leadership, for some activity, for some assistance? What leadership did they get from the Government?  What assistance did they get from the Government?  What sort of activity did they get from the Government or any member of the Government?  I&mdash;and I am sure my colleagues in the constituency were in the same position&mdash;was inundated with telephone calls, letters and requests to try and get something done. In face of those requests I first communicated with the Minister for Transport and Power by telegram and urged on him, as I thought he would be the Minister concerned with the problem, which at this stage was principally a problem of transport, that the Government should organise an air-lift for the relief of the isolated areas.  At least the Minister for Transport and Power had the courtesy to send an immediate reply.  On 3rd January I received a telegram from him in which he states: &ldquo;Have referred your telegram about relief of snowbound areas in County Wicklow to Minister for Local Government who is the Minister concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is unnecessary to remark as an aside at this stage that I have not heard from the Minister for Local Government with regard to the representations which were passed on to him by the Minister for Transport and Power.  I felt it was not good enough that one Minister should be in the position of passing on representations <Col N="158" /> like that to another Minister on the basis that he was not the Minister concerned but that another Minister was. It was in those circumstances, and having regard to the stories which I had heard and which I had no reason to disbelieve because they came from men on the spot, that I wrote on 3rd January to the Taoiseach.  In the course of the letter, I mentioned to him the appeal I had made to the Minister for Transport and Power and the fact that he passed it to the Minister for Local Government who was, apparently, the Minister concerned.  I said to the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the situation is one which requires the coordinated efforts of a number of State Departments.  I, therefore, now appeal directly to you as head of the Government to ensure that immediate and effective action is taken to relieve the great hardship in many areas in Wicklow caused by the severe weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Reports which I have received from the Valleymount-Ballyknockan area show that the situation there is appalling and I believe the same is true of a number of other areas.</P>
    <P>I then drew the attention of the Taoiseach to specific cases of sufferers from diabetes in the area who were running short of the insulin with which it was necessary they should be treated.  That had a sequel in that, with the assistance of a member of the Taoiseach's Party, a priest crossed the reservoir at Poulaphouca and brought the necessary supplies.  That was done without any help from the Government, as, indeed, were the efforts made by all the local people.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is permitted, and I do not want to go into any great detail, but in order to try to convince the Taoiseach that the inaction of his Government in this matter was, as I have said, truly deplorable, I want to refer briefly to the reports of the situation which appeared in the local paper, <i>The Wicklow People.</i> I have no doubt that Deputy Brennan and others who are familiar with that publication will agree with me that it is entirely independent, fair minded and objective in its reports.  It is completely without <Col N="159" /> political ties or political bias in its reports.  It is not endeavouring to make political capital for one side or the other and it has not done so in any of its reports which I want to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Its leading article in the issue of 19th January opens with the words:</P>
    <P>The people of the south-east of Ireland have, in the past three weeks, experienced one of the most severe periods of wintry weather in living memory.  Heavy snowfalls have caused great hardships, inconvenience and expense.  Freezing temperatures persist, delaying the removal of hardships in isolated districts and the restoration of travelling conditions to normal.</P>
    <P>That is a comment from the local paper in case the Taoiseach thinks anything I am saying is in any way exaggerated.  Indeed, there is no need to exaggerate because the situation was extremely bad and extremely grave.  It was the mercy of Providence, and thanks to the work of the organisations I have mentioned and the volunteers who went in from outside to help, that the situation was not far worse.  It was no thanks to the Government.</P>
    <P>In the previous issue of <i>The Wicklow People</i> reports and comments from the various members of the local authority and others were given with regard to the dimensions of the gravity of the situation which had arisen.  It was stated that:</P>
    <P>The hardships endured during the period of isolation are regarded as the greatest ever imposed on the people of the affected areas through weather conditions.</P>
    <P>One member of the local authority is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The amount of damage and loss to livestock still had not been assessed, but it was expected to be considerable.  There had been an acute shortage of milk earlier in the week.  This was relieved by farmers who were able to get into the village with milk and divide it among inhabitants in cans.  Main roads are <Col N="160" /> now passable but generally speaking just for one-way traffic.</P>
    <P>However, by-roads were in a terrible condition and they would be &ldquo;digging till February&rdquo; before they were cleared.</P>
    <P>Another member of the local authority, a supporter of the Taoiseach's Party, referring to his area, said:</P>
    <P>The people here have had it so bad in the last two weeks that they now realise that Rome wasn't built in a day.  Many roads are still isolated but the people are prepared to wait for the County Council to clear them.  They appreciate the great work which is continuing.</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying:</P>
    <P>I guarantee that there will still be traces of the snow in this district in June.</P>
    <P>There are other comments on the same lines.  There is a comment that in Baltinglass about two dozen families had not been heard of for, I think, a week or so.  Only to-day I was informed of a family at present living in Dublin but who originated near Knockanarrigan in Wicklow who went on a visit there on New Year's Day and had to stay for three weeks because they could not get out.  These are not exaggerated reports.</P>

      <P>The people were fortunate that this occurred immediately after Christmas when comparatively large supplies of food and fuel were in stock.  If it had occurred at any other time, the disaster would certainly have been a very grave one.  I feel there is a responsibility on the Government in cases such as this to show some action <Col N="162" /> and leadership.  The Government have failed, and failed deplorably, in that and it is only because of the public opinion and the public criticism of their actions that we heard today from the Minister for Transport and Power that they have at last come to a decision to purchase helicopters and provide a helicopter service which we hope will be used effectively if these conditions return in other years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first in this House to applaud Deputy O'Higgins for the action he took in sending a telegram to the Minister for Transport and Power and a letter to the Taoiseach if he had not gone the step further and tried to gain political kudos out of it by sending both the letter and the telegram to the Press. As the Taoiseach said today, it would appear as if the letter was first sent to the Press before it was decided to send it to the Taoiseach.  If that is the only way in which Deputy O'Higgins can hope to get votes in Wicklow, I am sorry for him.</P>
      <P>We in County Wicklow have come to regard the type of storm we have experienced as something that happens occasionally.  As a matter of fact, every year in my village we have snowstorms but we do not get anything like the storms they get in the northern part of the county.  We have come to expect these things and the people in the areas referred to by Deputy O'Higgins are accustomed to these conditions.  Only yesterday I was speaking to a man from Hollywood who told me that every farmer in that locality expects a snowstorm after Christmas that can last for two or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were similar storms in 1933 and 1947 and I doubt if you would get out of a group of five people in Wicklow any two to agree as to which of the three storms was the worst.  They still talk about the 1933 and the 1947 storms.  We are a neighbourly people and we do not stand idly by and allow our neighbours to die.  In this instance what happened is that the county council, of which I am a member, was on the job right from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and by Thursday most of the villages <Col N="163" /> in the county were open.  Mine was one of the last to be opened.  That was on Thursday.  There were a few smaller hamlets such as Ballyknockan, Lacken, Manorkilbride, Knockananna, and a few others that had not been reached by that time.  By Saturday they were opened and I spoke by telephone to a man who was marooned in Lacken on Sunday.  He was in Blessington and spoke to me from there and it had been opened by Sunday.</P>
    <P>A wonderful job was done in that crisis by the Wicklow County Council and they are the only body that was capable of doing it.  Who else could do it ?  Who knew the roads better than the local engineers?</P>
    <P>I want, here in this House, to pay a very special tribute to our county manager who gave the green light to the county engineer to employ whatever machinery he could get and I want to pay tribute to the engineer and his assistants and all the workers who did everything possible, who worked around the clock.  The only way in which you could bring relief to the people of the area was to open the roadways.  That was done within a week.  I do not know what the Government could have done about it. The Taoiseach can answer for the Government and for himself in this case but I know that he could not have melted the snow by waving a magic wand.</P>

      <P>There has been a period of very difficult weather, severe cold accompanied by heavy falls of snow, which was bound to produce inconvenience and discomfort in the areas affected.  There is nothing any of us can do about the weather, but the suggestion that there was any failure to take action by the authorities <Col N="164" /> concerned in County Wicklow or elsewhere is just nonsense.  As soon as it was evident that the fall of snow was going to be unusually severe and the effects were likely to persist, contact was made with all the public authorities concerned, national and local, and I was satisfied on the first day that every possible activity that could have been put in train had already started and, inded, all the evidence is that a thoroughly good job was done.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the activities of a particular newspaper in this regard.  I content myself with reading this extract from a report from one of the senior officials of the Wicklow County Council:</P>
      <P>It is also regrettable that one or two newspapers in their reports had exaggerated the actual position and gave the impression that grave hardship and distress existed in parts of the county and that nothing was being done about the matter by the public authorities.  They also failed to give anything like an adequate or true picture of the measures taken by the County Council through its Members, its Engineering Staff and Workmen to open up within a few days almost all the roads in the county which had been blocked to such a great depth by heavy snow drifts.  After all over 500 miles of roads were cleared in five days.  It is to say the least scarcely giving an objective picture of the situation when reports are given of villages being reached by newspaper correspondents but there is scarcely a mention of the public authority which provided the staff, the men and the machinery which enabled these persons to carry out their tours of inspection without great risk or hardship.  It was neither fair to the local authority nor to the relatives of persons in the affected areas that reports should be published which, in the absence of a balanced attitude on the part of those in control of vital operations and on the part of the community generally, could lead to an atmosphere of distrust and even panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said this afternoon in reply to a <Col N="165" /> Parliamentary Question that so far, as a result of all this bad weather, and notwithstanding the discomfort and inconvenience which was caused, no section of the community was at any time in a position of grave distress. There was no shortage of essential supplies in any part of the country. Health services were provided on a fairly satisfactory basis and so far as can be ascertained no person requiring urgent medical attention or medical supplies was unable to obtain them. That satisfactory outcome of this situation was due to the trojan work done by the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a foolish suggestion today about employing the Army.  What could the Army do? There was no scarcity of manpower in Wicklow or anywhere else for the work that was required.  The clearing of <Col N="166" /> snow off the roads is a matter for machines.  The Wicklow County Council had over 40 machines in operation within a very short time, some from their own resources, some hired from private firms, some borrowed from the Forestry Division, and they used these machines by day and by night to achieve that remarkable result of clearing the snow from 500 miles of road within five days.</P>
    <P>The hard weather is not over yet. There may be, perhaps, a repetition of that experience and all I can hope is that we will get, and I am sure we will, the same drive and enthusiastic response from these public officials in the future as we got on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd January, 1963.</P>

      <P>Information is not available which co-relates the number of applications for the registration of trade marks which are accepted, refused, withdrawn or abandoned in any one period with the number of applications <Col N="52" /> received in the same period. Neither is information available as to the number of applications refused or withdrawn or not pursued by the applicant in the years prior to the year ended 31st March, 1959.  To extract such particulars for the periods requested by the Deputy would involve considerable expenditure of staff time.</P>
      <P>Particulars can, however, be given as to the number of applications for the registration of trade marks received and accepted in each of the financial years 1952-53 to 1961-62, inclusive, and the number of applications which were refused, withdrawn or not pursued by the applicants in each of the financial years 1958-59 to 1961-62.
