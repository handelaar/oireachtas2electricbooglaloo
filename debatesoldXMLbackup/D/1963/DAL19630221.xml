    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for the failure of its policies as confirmed by the terms of its own White Paper.&mdash;Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said most of what I wanted to say in regard to this White Paper yesterday evening.  Apart from general criticism of the Government and their policy, of the Government's actions leading up to the issue of this White Paper, I think it is right to criticise the White Paper specifically because of the complete absence of any reference to the desirability of savings or any effort by the Government as represented in this White Paper to foster a savings campaign.  The Government <Col N="196" /> are open to criticism and must be criticised because as recently as two months ago, in December, 1962, the picture being painted by the Government in this House in discussing the Government's policy on the Adjournment Debate was that everything in the garden was lovely.  They are open to criticism for the manner in which this White Paper has been presented and for the confusion, anxiety and upset which has been caused by their manner of presenting it and, in particular, for the confusion which has been caused by the systematic back-pedalling of the Taoiseach and his Ministers since the White Paper was issued.</P>
      <P>I referred yesterday, as did Deputy Dillon, to the speech which the Taoiseach made in December, 1962, in reply to the Adjournment Debate before Christmas.  I do not want to weary the House with repetition of the quotations I gave yesterday but it is significant that, in relation to the speech which the Taoiseach made here yesterday, what the Fianna Fáil newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i> picked out to set in headlines this morning are these words of the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>It is the considered view of the Government that the welfare of the wage earners, their jobs, security and living standards are threatened by the gap which emerged in 1962 between incomes and output.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says now that is the considered view of the Government. As recently as two months ago, he was dealing with the position of wage earners in his speech in reply on the Adjournment Debate and in column 1472, Volume 198 of the Official Report of 13th December last he had this to say:</P>
      <P>In relation to this problem of employment and unemployment at this time, the main matters that are giving the Government concern are these two.  First to meet the housing needs of those whom we want to attract back from England to employment here and to meet the housing needs arising from industrial expansion in particular towns....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture being painted by the Taoiseach only two months ago was <Col N="197" /> that the Government's policy was of such a nature, the Government's achievements were of such dimensions, that they could talk of attracting back here workers from England.  That was in 1962 and he told us yesterday that it is the considered view of the Government that the welfare of the wage earners, their jobs, security and living standards are threatened by the gap which developed in 1962.  Surely the Taoiseach and his Government must have entirely misread the situation when they were talking in the last month of the year 1962 if the picture they were able to paint to the House at that time was the rosy one of everything in the garden being lovely, of the trade gap being a matter of no great concern, of workers being attracted back here from England. Just two months later, in February, 1963, they issue a White Paper and make it quite clear initially that it is intended that there shall be a wage-freeze policy.  If the Minister and the Minister for Transport and Power have back-pedalled from that point of view since, it is quite clear from the terms of the White Paper that there are to be no increases in pay or salaries for State employees and that, so far as arbitration awards are concerned, they are to be put in cold storage.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands intervened yesterday to point out that there was no mention of a pay pause in this White Paper.  That is one of the elements of confusion being created by the Government.  I asked them yesterday, and I ask them again today: do they intend this as a pay pause or not?  Do they intend to freeze wages or not? We have still to get an answer to that question from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to a particular difficulty which is being created for one section of our people by Government policy in this matter. That section comprises the health inspectors of our local authorities.  I want to raise this matter in the face of the very point expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands when he said that there <Col N="198" /> is no question of a pay pause involved in this White Paper.  It seems to me that this is a matter of justice which should be dealt with by the Government. The most convenient way of bringing the matter to the attention of the Government and the Minister for Finance, who is present in the House, is to place on the records of this House a letter which appeared in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> from the branch secretary of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>
    <P>This is the letter:</P>
    <P>This Union has just had a practical demonstration of the Government's intentions in issuing their White Paper.  It is clear that it is intended to put an immediate stop on all wage and salary increases including increases already negotiated and settled under the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As part of the eighth round for Local Government employees, the Labour Court recommended, in August, 1962, an increase for Health Inspectors employed by the Dublin Health Authority.  The recommendation was accepted by both sides but the Government have refused sanction to the Dublin Health Authority to pay the increase.</P>
    <P>The Government took six months to &ldquo;consider&rdquo; the matter sufficiently long to bring it within the scope of the &ldquo;Pay Pause&rdquo;.  Then, with remarkable speed following the introduction of the wage and salary standstill, the Government have intimated that the terms of the White Paper precluded their allowing the Dublin Health Authority to pay the increase.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions our officers were promised by the Minister for Health that the Government decision would be conveyed to us within a week.  On each occasion we were met with devious and evasive tactics.</P>
    <P>This entire incident is not only of concern to the Trade Union Movement but to all sections of the community <Col N="199" /> which have direct dealings with the Government.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Pay Pause&rdquo; has not been introduced to prevent a ninth round of wage and salary increases but to prevent any increase to the employed section of the community for any reason whatsoever.  The Government have not told the people the truth and in fact their methods in whitewashing the &ldquo;Pay Pause&rdquo; before the public are on a par with their tactics in meeting our representation on behalf of the Dublin Health Inspectors.</P>
    <P>That letter is signed by James Tinker, branch secretary.  I want to bring that case of the Dublin health inspectors to the attention of the Government.  This is a case where pay increases were recommended by the Labour Court, accepted by both sides and should have been granted by the Government but the delay in doing that was apparently as long as six months.  That was a delay on the part of the Government and now, when this White Paper is issued, they are told that they come within its terms, and accordingly the pay increases will not be allowed.  I do not see how, in the face of that, Government speakers can stand over the proposition propounded by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands that there is no mention of a pay pause in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Mention was made yesterday of the situation which developed here in 1956 and the measures taken by the Government at that time.  The Taoiseach yesterday had the gall to refer to irresponsibility in connection with the Fine Gael Party.  I think it is fair to ask Deputies opposite what help, or assistance, or understanding they gave to the Government in 1956 when this country, through no fault of the then Government, met an economic blizzard and had to take certain actions to save our national solvency.  What understanding did they get from the Fianna Fáil Party, then in Opposition?  What degree of responsibility was shown by Fianna Fáil as an Opposition Party in those days?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> I have here one of the propaganda sheets issued by Fianna Fáil during that time.  It is entitled <i>Gléas</i> which, I understand, could be roughly translated as &ldquo;Ammunition&rdquo;.  It contained the ammunition issued to the boys to be used around the country in their public speeches.  This is the kind of headings it contains: &ldquo;No end to high prices&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doing nothing every day&rdquo;, &ldquo;Building trade faces disaster&rdquo;, &ldquo;More workers lose jobs in slump&rdquo;, &ldquo;6,000 less at work on the roads&rdquo;. This is the kind of assistance that Fianna Fáil were giving to the Government at that time.  There was a crisis and this was the kind of understanding and encouragement that was given to Deputy Costello's Government which had the courage to face it.</P>
    <P>The matter was discussed in the Dáil and on 13th March, 1956, the present Taoiseach spoke on what was the official attitude of Fianna Fáil as given in the Dáil, not in <i>Gléas</i>.  He said with regard to this matter: &ldquo;They are to be criticised because the measures they have taken are ineffective and inadequate.&rdquo;  In other words, the official Fianna Fáil attitude at that time was that if Fianna Fáil were there, further measures would be taken &mdash;that the measures taken by the inter-Party Government were ineffective and inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was on 13th March, 1956.  The Taoiseach came back with the assistance of <i>Gléas,</i> comfortably ensconced on the seat beside him, and on 14th May, 1957, we got the truth of the matter as proved by experience.  The Taoiseach then went on record in this House, at column 1151 of the Official Report for that date with regard to the measures the inter-Party Government had taken to deal with the situation in 1956.  He was able to say this then:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think they were dealing <Col N="201" /> with it the right way but we certainly recognised their obligation to do something about it and as a result of the measures they took that balance of payments problem was solved for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have it on record from the Taoiseach that despite his claim, that what the Government then did was inadequate and ineffective, the steps did settle the balance of payments problem so that his Government were able to take over with that problem settled.  What has happened since to allow the present situation to develop?  The Fianna Fáil Party have been in government ever since.  In 1962, they were painting this rosy picture of their achievements: everything was fine, there was no great worry or concern with regard to the balance of payments, but now, two months later, we have the old wage-freeze mentality of Fianna Fáil coming out in this White Paper.  Let us put niceties aside: this is a wage freeze policy, and I think everyone sitting behind the Fianna Fáil Ministers knows it.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have tabled a motion for discussion, as have other Parties in the House.  I do not want to delay the House any longer but, like the Leader of this Party, I want to make it quite clear that we regard these motions as a vote of censure on the Government.  We ask the Government to do the greatest service they can to the people of the country&mdash;to get out and let the people judge on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's motion, which comes first on the Order Paper, should, I suppose, be dealt with first.  It condemns the Government for the failure of their policies as confirmed by the terms of the White Paper.  In a pep speech during the week at Malahide, Deputy Dillon said that an adverse trade balance which amounted to £100 million, and which was the highest in history, had resulted from the policy of this Government.  He said there were 70,000 unemployed and that in six years, emigration had amounted to <Col N="202" /> 300,000.  In a short space of time, it would be difficult to imagine a more competent politician to misrepresent and mis-state the facts, but of course he was talking to an audience who were not interested in facts.  They were interested only in what could be said to denigrate the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon had thought over what this Government had done in these respects, and if he had been as fair to us as the present Taoiseach was to the last Coalition Government, as quoted by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, he would have painted a very different picture.  We, on our side, in talking of the achievements of the previous Government, were always overgenerous, unlike Deputy Dillon who issues this kind of statement at Malahide.</P>
      <P>First of all, on the side of national production, in the six years we have been in office now, the national production has increased by 2.6 per cent. per annum and that includes the two very bad years at the beginning of our term of office, 1957 and 1958, when we had to try to reverse the downward trend created by the Coalition Government.  In the three years 1954 to 1956, the increase in national production averaged 0.6 per cent., a very big difference from 2.6 per cent.  If we leave out 1957 and 1958, and take the period from the issuing of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, we could show an average increase over the past four years of about 5 per cent. which in fact is eight times better than the Coalition Government were able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the export side, a very important item in the economic programme of any Irish Government, we find that, in 1953, the year before the Coalition Government, exports stood at £114.1 million.  I think any neutral person here will admit that during those years &mdash;back in 1952 and 1953&mdash;the main part of the policy of the Fine Gael Party was that we should export more, particularly agricultural produce, to the British market.  However, just to give a start to this question of exports to the British market, the figure for 1953 was £114.1 million.  In 1956, it <Col N="203" /> was £108.1 million.  That gives the record of that Government, of a Government in which Deputy Dillon played a very big part&mdash;Deputy Dillon who criticised this Government for the failure of their economic policy.  The average figure for exports during these three years, 1954 to 1956, was £111.4 million.  During the past four years, the figure has been £159 million and last year&mdash;perhaps some Deputy may draw attention to it&mdash;it was lower than in 1961, but the three years 1960, 1961 and 1962 should be taken together because there was a remarkable holdup of cattle exports in 1960 which went out in 1961 and as a result the exports in 1962 were a bit lower than 1961.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke of the employment side and I should like to point out that in the second last quarter of 1962, we have had the highest ever employment level in industry.  The employment in transportable goods industries amounted to over 171,000, which was 25,000 more than in the last quarter of the Coalition Government.  There has been, as every Deputy will be aware, a decrease in agricultural employment in this country for many years.  In fact it goes back for a century if we want to go back that far.  That, in recent years, has been due principally to consolidation.  People cannot live nowadays unless they have a wage or a salary and it is no longer possible for people to live in the country without work.  The result is that they have cleared off the land unless fully employed.</P>
    <P>Taking that for granted, it would be no harm to give the total employment on the land, in industry and so on, and in all other forms of employment. In early 1954, it was 1,185,000 and in early 1957, it was 1,136,000. During the three years the country was under the Coalition Government, our employment went down by 49,000, a very big decrease over three years. From 1958 to 1961&mdash;we will have no later figures until the Budget&mdash;it went down by 3,000.  It went down by 49,000 during their three years and went down by 3,000 for the first four <Col N="204" /> years we were in office, but I am quite certain that figure has been reversed.</P>
    <P>We hear a good lot of talk about agriculture.  I have often thought if we could get the opinions of other people about agriculture, it would be very useful in deciding what the various Governments have done so far as agriculture is concerned.  One very good guiding principle, however, is bank credit, because everybody will admit the banks do not give out money unless they have confidence in the people to whom they are giving it and confidence in the use to which the money is being put.  If you take it on that basis, bank credit to agriculture stood at £17.2 million in April, 1957, when the change of Government took place.  In April, 1962, five years later, it stood at £34.7 million&mdash;twice as much.  The banks, at any rate, have twice as much confidence in agriculture now as they had when the Coalition Government were leaving office. As far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation are concerned, their credit has increased from £2½ million to £4 million.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments was a principal point made by Deputy Dillon when speaking over the weekend.  A more sensitive politician than Deputy Dillon would remain silent on the balance of payments, but sensitivity is not one of his outstanding virtues.  If you take the invisible items which must be taken into account, as well as trade returns, you get the figures published each year by the Statistics Office&mdash;the balance of international payments.  For the three years the Coalition Government were in office, there was an accumulated loss of £55.4 million on the international balance of payments. For the first five years Fianna Fáil were there, we just broke even.  There was no loss at all.  The estimate for 1962, which has not yet been officially calculated, looks to be about £15,000,000.  Therefore, taking our six years, we have gone down £15,000,000 compared with the £55,000,000 for the three years of the Coalition Government. Our external bank balances are increasing at the same time.  So long as they go on increasing, even <Col N="205" /> though the international trade balance goes down, there is no immediate cause for worry, provided, of course, we take timely precautions as set out in the White Paper.  I should like to emphasise that a Government should take timely precautions.  Our efforts in that respect by the issue of the White Paper and what the results are will prove whether we are right as compared with the action taken by the Coalition in 1956, action which was taken far too late and which brought very great suffering to our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says that our external credits are due to our selling land to foreigners.  He appeared to argue that the greater part of the £100 million he talked about was due to this immigration of people here to buy land. As far as Departments can assess this figure, it is something under £1 million, not £100 million.  Of course, that is in line with Deputy Dillon's exaggeration in most things.  He goes on to refer to current unemployment at 70,000.  That, of course, has been inflated by the very bad weather conditions.  As we all know, most of those engaged in building and construction work have been laid off for the past four or five weeks and the number of unemployed has been inflated as a result of their being laid off.</P>
    <P>In mid-December, 1956, under the Coalition Government, unemployment totalled 73,000.  In mid-December, 1962, before the bad spell, the figure totalled 49,000&mdash;a very big improvement indeed.  When we took office in March, 1957, unemployment was 85,800.  It has never reached that figure since in our six years of office, and probably never will unless a Government of the type installed here in 1954 should come back.  At that time, in March, 1957, it was 10.8 per cent of the insured population&mdash;also a record figure which has never been reached since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that emigration for the past five or six years was 300,000.  When a question is asked here about emigration figures, the answer officially always is that emigration figures cannot be given except after a census has been taken.  But the <Col N="206" /> figures that are given&mdash;and the figures Deputy Dillon is relying on&mdash;are the figures of the net movement of passengers, both by sea and air, outwards and inwards.  If the number going out in a year is higher than those coming in, the excess out is taken as the figure for emigration.  Whether it is absolutely correct or not, we take it as being at least fair enough to compare one period with another.</P>
    <P>The figure mentioned by Deputy Dillon, 300,000, would mean that emigration in the past six years was 50,000 per annum.  During the three years the Coalition were in office, the figure was 130,000, which is 43,000 per annum.  That is a bit better than the 50,000 during our six years.  Here the figure is 230,000, not 300,000.  Deputy Dillon is a little bit nearer than usual in this case, but nevertheless there is an error of 70,000 in his figures.  In all fairness, however, I think we should not be saddled with the year 1957. During the first three months of that year, there was abnormal emigration, and we could not be expected to stop emigration during our first few years of office.  If 1957 is left out, it gives a better picture from our point of view than what I have given.</P>
    <P>In last year, 1962, emigration was down to 20,800.  The natural increase in the population is estimated at 26,000.  Therefore, we have actually reached the point where our population is beginning to increase.  That is a very satisfactory position to have reached after so many years of adverse emigration figures.</P>
    <P>That performance of Fine Gael between 1954 and 1956 in reaching records in emigration, unemployment and adverse trade balance and reaching the lower limits in exports and national production was referred to during the week by Deputy MacEoin as &ldquo;the wise economic policy of Fine Gael&rdquo;.  It was the accumulation of all these adverse economic factors which compelled the Coalition Government to introduce measures to save the economy in 1956.  Principally, of course, these consisted of putting on very severe tariffs which created great hardship for many people, not only <Col N="207" /> consumers but also manufacturers and others.  In 1956, the Fine Gael members of the Government had realised for the first time, as far as I can see, that production must keep up with earnings or there would be trouble. Fine Gael and Labour up to 1956 believed that it was money that mattered and not production.  So long as they could have money to throw around, everything was fine and they went on merrily while the loose money lasted.  Then disaster came to them.</P>
    <P>Having realised that very important fact in the economic situation, and realised it at such expense to the country, in suffering and otherwise, they ought to be able to see that the same principle holds now as held then. In fact, judging from the speeches of the Labour Party, they do not seem to have realised that fact even yet because they go on talking about the measures taken by the Government as being unnecessary and saying that the free policy of increased earnings and so on should be allowed to continue. I think we must accept the fact that if incomes increase, there is more spending power and if the output of goods and services has not increased, then one or two things must happen.  Either prices go up or imports go up, or perhaps both happen and very often, it is both.  In this last year or two that we are dealing with now, both imports and prices have gone up and it is because of these indices, among others, that the Government issued the White Paper.</P>
    <P>If prices go up, first of all, the increased income to the people who got it is not a real increase.  They have more money but it takes more money to buy the goods they were buying before.  There may be a slight margin of benefit but it is only slight and if wages or salaries or dividends, all these ways in which money can be given out, keep pace with production, there is no increase in prices and the increases people get are real increases. On the other hand, if imports go up, there is the danger of an increase in our adverse trade balance and that also leads to trouble.</P>
    <P>If prices go up, those on fixed <Col N="208" /> incomes suffer and those on low incomes, whether employed or not, are also bound to suffer more severely than those who are better off.  Higher prices and higher earnings will make competition for our producers more difficult and especially so for those who are in the export business and, as we all realise, we are coming up against most intense competition in the export market.  We want to build up our exports but we must be in a position to compete in order to build these markets.  If export becomes impossible, trouble commences.  It was one of the big troubles in 1956. If the balance of payments goes wrong, unemployment is on the increase and there is restriction of credit and general economic depression as we had in 1956. It is to avoid all these things that the White Paper was issued.</P>
    <P>We issued the White Paper as a warning to the country that we should watch our step.  It sought to impress on the people the incontrovertible fact that earnings can only move with increased production if we are to maintain a sound economy and if we are to create conditions necessary for an increase in real earnings.  Anybody reading the White Paper must see that that is the whole object of it.  How Deputy O'Higgins can talk about back-pedalling is beyond me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper is there to point out the one incontrovertible <Col N="209" /> fact that unless output keeps pace with earnings, there will be trouble. That is the whole gist of it and nobody can either back-pedal or fore-pedal on it.  Why not deal with facts?  Would Fine Gael not face the truth and drop the misrepresentation on which they have lived for the past 20 or 30 years?</P>
      <P>We had these desirable conditions here at the end of 1960.  We had the biggest increase in earnings during the four years prior to that even known in this country and it was a real increase because the cost of living had not gone up.  It remained stable and when a man got a 10/- increase, it was a real one and he had money to spend over and above what he had before.  But when increases in earnings go above output, prices go up and the 10/- a man gets as an increase is perhaps worth about 5/- and he is not much better off as a result.</P>
      <P>For the last two of those four years, national production had been increasing at a very satisfactory rate. Some Deputies talk about taking away something from the workers.  We are not taking anything away.  We are giving a warning of the position: Try to increase production until we reach the level of earnings and then we are in a position to say: &ldquo;Now, go ahead. An increase can then be given which will be a real increase and of which every halfpenny will be available to buy extra goods, extra services or whatever the person concerned may desire.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only restrictive measure in the White Paper is that in regard to those employed by Government Departments or by State companies.  We have said that we are directing the people in charge there not to give increases where they might have the effect of sparking off another round of wage increases or where it might be against the national interest.  It has always been the practice for the Government not to be the first to give an increase in wages.  Take a place like the Board of Works, for instance.  When carpenters in the building trade get an increase, carpenters working in the Board of Works get the same increase. That is the principle as applied in all Government Departments, that they <Col N="210" /> follow whatever increases may be given, but they do not start the increases in such cases.  We are only following what has been the practice for many years&mdash;for all time perhaps&mdash; in this country.</P>
    <P>I should mention another point raised by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, that is, that there are certain increases being considered for many months back, some by arbitration and some by the Labour Court.  These will have to be considered as a separate category because it would be unfair if the charge could be made against a Government Department that they were so slow in considering these particular increases that they now fall into what they refer to as the wage pause category. That would be unfair.  These have to be considered on their merits and should not be included with those seeking an increase at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins also referred to health inspectors.  That is a different case.  It will be decided on its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do speak with one voice.  The Minister and his experts speak with one voice.  I should say also that a number of groups in the Civil Service are still awaiting their <Col N="211" /> eighth round wage increase.  Due to various causes, not my fault, not anybody's fault&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wherever the arbitration has been given, we immediately sanction it.  This eighth round wage increase is a thing apart from this altogether. These cases will be decided on their merits.</P>
      <P>We pointed out the ill effects; we cannot give an order; it is not within our power to do so.  We pointed out the ill effects of increasing earnings before output is increased also.  We expect that the employers and employees, too, will take note of that fact and that neither the employee will press nor the employer agree to give increases until our economy has increased to the level where real increases can be given.</P>
      <P>It is no sacrifice to ask people to remain as they are until an increase can be afforded.  We can talk of this matter with assurance, if you like.  No Government has ever made such conditions possible, as we did, to give as big a real increase in earnings as has been given over the past few years.  No Party can criticise this Government as being against increased wages.  What we are against is any action that may interfere with the economy of this country.  What we are in favour of is the building up of that economy properly by increased output, so that real increases can be given in earnings. After all, every Government, I am sure, has the same policy, that is, to increase the standard of living of the people.  The aim of any Government is to improve the conditions of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back to the White Paper&mdash;it points out very forcibly the relationship that should be maintained between wages and output.  It winds up by asking State companies not to grant any increases in wages or salaries (1) if such action might start a general demand for increases all round, or (2) if it should be against the national interest. The principal attack on this White Paper by the Labour Party is <Col N="212" /> that we have informed the public what we believe to be the position.  That is all we have done.  The Labour Party do not tell us what we should have done.  We can infer from their speeches that they would prefer we had buried our heads in the sand and waited for the 1956 catastrophe to come on top of us.  We are convinced that if the warning is heeded, we can bring production up to earnings and this would pave the way for another increase in earnings.  If we ignore the signs of danger, we are convinced that we should be running into disaster, and we know what disaster means.  I have outlined it before.  It takes two or three years to reach the bottom of the pit and come up again to the level we find ourselves at present.  We would lose two or three years in our national programme. At the end of that time, when we would have learned our lesson, we would begin to advance again.  It is better that we should not run the risk of that type of economic disaster.</P>
    <P>The point is that the Labour Party have made no suggestion.  The only thing we can infer is that they have ignored this matter.  They have contented themselves with attacking the Government on what they referred to in some speeches as the pay-pause and in other speeches as a wage-freeze.  I suppose that if an economic crisis did come, as there is a danger, and we had done nothing about it, they would be content to blame the Government. That does not save the country.  That sort of political manoeuvring may seem good tactics to the Labour Party, but it is the people with low incomes and those whose employment is not too secure who are sure to suffer.  The well-off people will be all right.  They will not go hungry.  In giving this warning to the country, we cannot be accused of having the well-off people in mind.  They will not suffer.  Whatever depths to which the economy may descend, the well-off people will have enough to live on.</P>
    <P>Whether we should have consulted the Trade Union Congress is a matter of opinion.  Some people may hold that opinion and some people may hold the opinion that it was unnecessary.  There <Col N="213" /> is no reason why we should.  People do not consult us on pronouncements on the national policy, although we are very much concerned with national policy in this country.  I do not expect them to consult us.  It is a matter of opinion whom we should consult or whom we should not.  We certainly have no wish to ignore the Trade Union Congress.  We did state in our White Paper that the Government would be anxious to consult them and also the employers with regard to the future as soon as the White Paper had been studied.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, of course, have very adroitly avoided giving a considered opinion on the White Paper.  This White Paper was awkward for Fine Gael at the time.  Of course, Fine Gael always make up their mind after finding out how many votes will be on this side and that, but they could not make up their minds this time on which side the most votes were and they got round it by saying: &ldquo;We condemn the Government because this is necessary and we will not be asked to make up our minds on whether we agree with the White Paper or not&rdquo;.  They will make up their minds eventually, and if they do, it will be on an opportunist judgment of the situation, as they have always done.  Whether they will adopt the practice they sometimes do of abstaining from voting on the White Paper, I do not know, or whether some of them will go for it and some against it according to the complexion of their constituencies, I do not know.  We are not going to get an honest opinion from the Fine Gael Party.  It does not concern them and never did concern them; what they are concerned with is votes, and then they will cast their votes accordingly.</P>
    <P>The only sensible opinion is from Deputy McQuillan.  He wants the Government to resign.  Let us hear what the others think.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;I have not discussed this with the Government&mdash;we are quite prepared to go to the country on the issues that have been raised here.  First of all, if the country is sensible and mindful of 1956, we will not be in any doubt about the result. But if the country is not sensible <Col N="214" /> then we are prepared to take the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that by the time this debate is finished, the White Paper will have disappeared because the most obvious conclusion from the various speeches that have been made is that there is a tactical withdrawal from the terms of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to leave the matter at that stage because this White Paper was issued for a specific purpose. The message conveyed in the last paragraph of the White Paper is clearly stated.  It says that conciliation and arbitration procedures should be not applied, if necessary until it can be done without damage to the national economic interest.  A day or two after the White Paper was published&mdash;indeed almost immediately because of the reaction&mdash;the Taoiseach published a statement saying it was not proposed to impose a wage restraint or a wage-freeze. The only test of any policy is to judge on the results.</P>
      <P>The trade unions and State servants and others affected by this White Paper will be pardoned if they express grave concern at its publication when they look at what occurred on previous occasions.  I need not refer to the fact that in 1952 the then Minister for Finance postponed the Civil Service arbitration and conciliation award for months and did not allow that award to take effect until the following year. There are at the present time at least three categories of State or semi-State servants who have not been granted the eighth round.  One of these categories has already been referred to here this morning, and they have not merely not been granted the eighth round but they were jumped in the seventh round and did not get it.  The seventh round was avoided and subsequently last year when they negotiated with the various health authorities, the Labour Court made an award and that award was to grant certain salary scales to health inspectors of the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That award has not, so far, been implemented by the Minister for Health.  I gather from what the Minister for Finance has said here today  <Col N="215" /> that it is proposed to pay it.  In the case of health inspecors, most of them have received no increase since 1958.  A few got the 1958 increase in 1959, but there has been nothing since then for any of them.  There was a direct refusal by the present Minister for Health to sanction a Labour Court award to grant an increase applicable to some people who have received no increase since 1958 and all of whom did not get the seventh round award at all.</P>
    <P>There is the case of the other weakest section in the Civil Service&mdash; the clerk-typists&mdash;who have not got the increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to mention that now.  It is before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mention it. There is the case of Radio Éireann and TV journalists who have an application before the Authority.  If the White Paper means anything, the clear directive in the last sentence&mdash; or couple of sentences&mdash;is that these awards are not to be paid.  Undoubtedly the Taoiseach's statement and the statement made here by the Minister for Finance this morning appear to modify the impression created by the last sentences of paragraph 21, but it brings me to the point: why was the White Paper issued without consultation with the parties directly concerned?  I do not say, and I do not think that anyone could insist, that a Government are obliged to accede to any side in industrial matters or to accept the views expressed by them.  I believe that the developments that occurred here last year were of the most significant kind, developments which offered prospects of economic stability and of improved industrial relations, but that whole atmosphere has been jeopardised and upset by the fact that the Government proceeded to issue this White Paper without consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report was given in the newspapers on 12th July last about a meeting which was held on the 11th between representatives of the employers and representatives of the <Col N="216" /> trade unions.  As a result of that joint employer-labour conference an agreed statement was published and a special committee was established.  It was agreed by that special committee that it was desirable that efforts should be made to establish a more rational and better informed basis for wage discussions and negotiations at whatever level they normally took place. The special committee believed that a rational approach to problems and industrial relations necessitated consideration of all matters related to the national economy, the competitive position of industry generally and the impact of external development.  It was suggested that provision be made for a national employer-labour conference each year for the purpose of considering the national economic situation, and those factors in the situation which were of importance to employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>Now, this decision to publish the White Paper is impractical for a variety of reasons.  We have seen that a similar scheme or system was impractical in Britain.  It is not for me to express views on either politics or economics in another country.  It is sometimes difficult enough to understand politics in our own.  But the position is that this attempted wage pause or wage freeze cannot be operated in a democracy and the objection to the publication of the White Paper is that it seeks to dictate to and dominate only those categories who are employed either directly or indirectly by the State.  It cannot be made effective on private employers or those employed in private industry or ordinary occupations where the State is not concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we accept the view that wholesale wage and salary increases unrelated to the rise in the cost of living would jeopardise the economy but the remedy is not available, for instance, in a standstill or so-called wage pause.  In the White Paper, all the accent is on wages and salaries and none on profits or other factors which affect the economy.  One of the advantages the Government had since 1957 is the fact that import prices were falling and fell for a considerable <Col N="217" /> period.  There has been a slight rise in recent times.</P>
    <P>In 1956, the then Government had to deal with the problem caused by external economic factors, by the rise in prices due to the Suez aftermath and the increase in the cost of petroleum and other commodities directly concerned with the Suez situation. The import price for February, 1957 was 111; it dropped to 104 and subsequently rose to 106 in 1960. During that period, while the import price level dropped, there was a substantial rise in the cost of living and wage and salary adjustments, for which the Minister took credit here this morning, were made.  The import price figure in 1957 was 111.9 and it dropped in 1959 to 104.7 while during that period the cost of living increased. Today the cost of living is 22 points higher than it was in 1957.  It increased each year, with the possible exception of a temporary easement in 1960, and if the various categories of workers and wage earners sought increases, it was to compensate for the rise in the price of essential commodities.  There was a rise in the price of food, a rise in the price of everything people had to buy, increased bus and train fares, increased health charges.  But what about those categories in the community&mdash;and those are the categories I believe who are worst affected and most seriously jeopardised by the rise in the cost of living&mdash;the fixed income categories, the pensioners, particularly those living on fixed pensions either from accumulated past savings or those living on incomes from accumulated savings on investments?  Some of those categories received a small increase, those pensioners directly paid by the State, but many of them received on increase and had to bear the increase in the cost of living without any compensatory advantage.</P>
    <P>Now, one of the advantages of the joint Employer-Labour Conference was the fact that it discussed not merely wages and salaries but, in addition, the big economic questions confronting the country.  One of the matters that was the subject of consultation at these discussions was not merely, as I say, wages and <Col N="218" /> salaries but the problem of redundancy, the problem of retraining workers, the problem of re-adaptation which would occur in the event of this country becoming a member of EEC. I want to express the view that because of the great deal of talk and discussion that went on about the possibility of membership of the EEC, a great number of people may have been misled into the belief that we would have an easy passage, once we got into that organisation.  That prospect no longer exists but whether we get into the organisation or not, the prospect before this country is one of keen competition as time goes on.  Whether the trade talks conducted under EFTA involve a rapid lowering of tariffs or whether ultimately there are joint negotiations between EFTA and the EEC, no matter what the consequences, the competition facing this country will be keen, and will test our economic resources and our industrial and agricultural resources to the utmost.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that these negotiations were being conducted, we refrained&mdash;I believe, rightly&mdash;from any unnecessary criticism of the Government in the conduct of these negotiations, in fact to such an extent that some people expressed the view that we were not discharging our functions or our responsibilities as an Opposition. I think we were right in the national interest to do that.  I believe there is great interest in our attitude in that matter and in the attitude of Fianna Fáil when we were facing problems in 1956, created by external factors.  So far as this White Paper is concerned, this is an internal matter.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot be blamed, and it is not right to blame them, for the breakdown of the Brussels negotiations. Undoubtedly, the breakdown of the Brussels negotiations has caused effects that nobody knows here.  That applies not merely to this country but to other countries.  In the White Paper, the situation is entirely different. It is a domestic matter and one over which we have control.  Some people say the White Paper is biased.  Why is the impression being created that the White Paper is biased?  One of the dramatic facts that is available from <Col N="219" /> examination of the published statistics is the growth in purchasing.  There is no analysis of the growth in hire-purchase, which has been quite dramatic.</P>
    <P>If we look at Table IX of the January <i>Quarterly Bulletin</i> of the Central Bank of Ireland, we see that for hire-purchase in December, 1956, the figure was £9.9 million.  It had grown in September, 1962, to £31.8 million.  A very substantial amount was financed by external capital.  In 1956, the external capital figure was £4 million and it had grown in September, 1962, to £11.9 million.  One of the factors that affect our economy is the growth of hire-purchase.  Some of it may be for capital goods; some of it undoubtedly is for machinery and equipment, but a great deal of it is for knick-knacks.  A great deal of it is unnecessary but it is easy to obtain these goods because facilities are made available to a considerable extent by external finance companies.  There is not a single word in the White Paper analysing the causes of that or interpreting the factor involved in it, the extent to which, on the one hand, it may represent capital goods, and, on the other, unnecessary purchases and the creation of unnecessary debt, imposing a burden not merely on a great number of families but on the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is no reference, or only scant reference, in the White Paper to the substantial increase in industrial profits.  I do not claim that industrial profits or company profits are as big a factor as, say, the total effect of wages and salaries but they are a very significant factor. The important fact is that between 1958 and 1961, industrial profits increased very substantially.  If you look at Table A.1 on National Income and Expenditure, you will see there is an increase from 1958 of £39.1 million to £61 million, that is, including the corporate profits before tax.  If, on the other hand, the figures for total profits of industrial undertakings are examined, it will be seen that there was an even more dramatic growth in the amounts paid.  What is more remarkable <Col N="220" /> still is that, between 1953 and 1960, the total profits were distributed so that there was no ploughing back, or the amount ploughed back was negligible, in order to re-equip and re-vitalise industry for the tasks ahead.</P>
    <P>This morning, the Minister for Finance expressed satisfaction, as we all can, with the growth in industrial exports and the increase in industrial production, and he naturally claimed credit for Fianna Fáil.  I want to quote an impartial observer, an outsider who is not concerned with internal politics here, Professor Carter, the Jevons Professor of Political Economy in Belfast who said in regard to industrial exports that the biggest single factor in the growth of our industrial exports was the tax relief introduced in 1956, the tax remission on exports. The fact is that the Government, realising the advantages of that, extended it still further, and Professor Carter described it as the biggest single factor in the growth of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>That poses a question whether what has been done up to the present is adequate to meet the needs of the future.  Are the tax concessions adequate?  The problems to be faced are urgent and need attention.  If we are to surmount these difficulties, it will require a crash programme.  That programme can only be implemented in a modern democracy with not merely the agreement of all sections in industry, employers and labour but the full co-operation of all sections. The defect of this White Paper is that it has jeopardised and interfered with the co-operative spirit that was evident when the joint conference was held last July.</P>
    <P>This challenge must be met on a national basis in which all sections play a part and where one section will complement the action of another.  The united effort will require not merely the co-operation of all sections of the people but the inspiration of better leadership and direction.  I suppose this is one of the duties which Ministers cannot escape, although reading the newspapers recently, one gets the impression that this Government go to a great many functions and dinners <Col N="221" /> to make speeches.  One of the things that irritate people concerned in industry are pompous platitudes.  The amount of pompous talk from Ministers lecturing people on what should be done has an irritating effect on people who are engaged directly in consultation and directly in industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>I remember many years ago when problems arose between the trade unions and employers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I as Minister for Industry and Commerce sat around a table in Government Buildings with, on one day or a series of days, the representatives of the employers and, on other days, with representatives of the trade unions. During those discussions, the problems and difficulties and the aims of Government policy were explained to both parties in industry.  Co-operation was sought on the basis of free consultation and discussion openly entered into between all sections, on the understanding that these discussions in no way limited the right of action or the right of decision which was available to either side if they failed to reach agreement between themselves.</P>
    <P>This White Paper was published without consultation.  Nobody suggests that the Government should not decide, as they have the absolute prerogative as a Government to decide, public and national policy, but at least the parties directly concerned should have been consulted in advance and an indication given to them that it was proposed to publish this White Paper.  The reaction to this White Paper is an indication of very bad public relations.  Indeed except on a very few occasions Government statements have not been issued on a Sunday.  On this occasion the Taoiseach had to issue an explanation or a modification, whatever description is appropriate, of the White Paper on Sunday because of the reaction of the Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone who has had experience of trade unions or the employers would suggest that they are anything but reasonable.  Undoubtedly at times and in particular <Col N="222" /> industries, certain individual unions or individual members or employers, or maybe a specific body, may appear unreasonable or intransigent but by and large the vast bulk of trade unions and the vast bulk of employers are reasonable and responsible and have shown their capacity to face in a reasonable and responsible manner the problems which concern the country.  In 1957, when the difficulties which had flowed from the aftermath of the crisis were explained to the trade unions they voluntarily negotiated with the representatives of the employers a 10/- ceiling and that was agreed as the operative wage round at that time. If reasonable people are approached in a reasonable fashion, they will respond.</P>
    <P>No matter what developments emerge finally from the trade discussions, we will, as I have said, be faced with keen and effective competition. Is it not obvious then that it is in the national interest that the co-operation and combination of employers, workers and all sections of industry should be secured in a great partnership embracing not merely Government but all sections of the community and people in an effort to make industry effective, competitive and to bring it to the highest pitch of efficiency?  Such co-operation is essential, particularly with the proposed rhythm of tariff reduction in the EEC or EFTA facing this country.  What I cannot understand is why the parties affected by the White Paper were not consulted prior to its being published.  The fact that they were not consulted has caused the publication of two statements by the Taoiseach, this debate and a statement by the Minister for Finance that some categories of public servants will have a rate paid to them which was denied to them up to the present.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience of anyone who has been in Government that the Department of Finance has certain well-defined responsibilities.  I do not want to criticise the Department in the exercise of its functions and responsibilities. It would be correct to say that many of the higher officials, both past and present, are dedicated officials <Col N="223" /> and public servants.  One of the duties of the Department of Finance is to bring before the Minister for Finance the possible consequences and trends of economic policy.  That is done in a regular weekly report to the Minister and he, in turn, brings these facts before the Government, particularly if the situation becomes sufficiently serious to warrant Government attention.</P>
    <P>I believe that on certain occasions since the war, and I can point to three specific occasions, the Department have misinterpreted the indices and suggested actions and succeeded in securing Government approval for actions, the consequences of which were worse than the problems which it was sought to solve.  In 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government brought in a supplementary Budget.  That caused a general election, and the defeat of the Government. Subsequent to that general election, there was a change of Government and a period of sustained economic growth. In 1952, the Fianna Fáil Government introduced a Budget making a drastic reduction in food subsidies and within two years, there was again a change of Government.  I want to say that on both these occasions it was a Fianna Fáil Government that was concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1956, we introduced remedial measures to meet the problems arising from the Suez crisis.  I want to say, in retrospect, I believe that on that occasion we went too far and too fast. For those reasons, I believe that we should proceed with the greatest possible caution and examine with the greatest care the full circumstances and implications of this White Paper.  A wage-freeze is no remedy for the problems which affect this country.  It may be said that in a certain position unnecessary increases in wages or salaries would jeopardise the economy of the country, but if we are to get sustained economic growth and expansion, we have not merely to expand the trading agreements which we have and to secure new trade agreements with Britain and the other continental countries with which we have such agreements on a bilateral basis or a multilateral basis but, in addition, we <Col N="224" /> have to secure the willing co-operation and assistance of all sections of the community, on the understanding that all will be asked to make the same sacrifices in order to achieve expanded earnings in which all will share equally.</P>
    <P>There has been unnecessary delay in implementing awards to the weaker sections of the public service, a delay which is tantamount to a refusal.  A delay of two or three years in implementing an award is tantamount to a refusal and that delay has been applied to some sections.  If an award is postponed unnecessarily, or the negotiations are unduly protracted or if, during negotiations the threat is held out that a wage-freeze is imminent or that one rule will be applied to State employees and another to private employers, then it is obvious that we cannot get the co-operation, or initiative, or drive or the combined enthusiasm which is essential for economic progress, expanded exports and a general improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>One of the significant facts of the present time, despite the claims of the Government, is that there has been a substantial and sustained increase in the cost of living since 1957.  Despite the advantages of lower import prices and stable economic conditions in Britain and Europe generally, there are fewer people in employment and, up to the present time, 300,000 people have emigrated.  Surely there is something wrong with an economic policy that promises 100,000 new jobs and that results in less employment at the present time than there was in 1956?</P>
    <P>I believe that the atmosphere of the Employer-Labour Conference was most promising, as far as the national economy was concerned.  It offered a prospect of sustained economic growth, a co-operation in regard to wages and salaries which is of vital concern and a hope of creating in a specific way a partnership of all concerned.  It offered to the country the benefits of the experience of those engaged in industry and those in the trade union movement who have experience in these matters, with the object, not merely of promoting the <Col N="225" /> benefit of their own members, but also of promoting and expanding the economy of the country in order to provide better living standards for everybody.</P>
    <P>This White Paper has been greatly modified because of the reaction of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the debate here.  It was published without adequate consideration of the consequences.  That is now obvious from the statements made by the Taoiseach and from his intervention in the debate.  The speeches made yesterday by the Taoiseach and today by the Minister for Finance indicate that the Government have now withdrawn considerably from the line taken in it.  Remember people can only judge on results, and experience indicates that if this Government could do it, they would prevent or interfere with the conciliation and arbitration machinery which, I am glad to say, the inter-Party Government introduced and made effective.</P>
    <P>It is because of previous experience that many sections in the Civil Service, the Garda, the teachers and very many in semi-State organisations, are worried because they feel that any reversion to that old mentality, that old policy, would not merely be detrimental to their interests but to the economy as a whole.  It is for that reason we oppose this White Paper.  We believe it will be ineffective because it does not take into consideration a variety of factors, not least the very substantial increase in the cost of living in the past five or six years.  We oppose the White Paper because it makes no effective analysis of company profits and the extent to which company profits have or have not been ploughed back for re-equipment and for the revitalising of industry to meet the challenge of competition in the future. The fact that we need to modernise, to become more efficient, has been adverted to only in a very passing way in the White Paper and this creates the impression that it has not given full consideration to the consequences involved for certain aspects of the economy.  It is for that reason that we oppose it.  We believe that if it <Col N="226" /> is implemented, the people will react in the only way they can react, the only way in which on three previous occasions they did react&mdash;by making their feelings known through the ballot boxes.</P>

      <P>The White Paper is a very clear analysis of today's realities in regard to incomes and output.  It does not pretend to do anything more or less than that, but I feel that most of the misconceptions and misinterpretations that have arisen since its publication arose initially when what could have been a fruitful discussion went completely off the rails through a misinterpretation of the White Paper, a completely twisted interpretation of what was in fact a very realistic analysis, in the form of the statement from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions published in the newspapers on the day following the issue of the White Paper.  I feel it was published with some haste and without proper consideration and indeed the, in many ways, constructive statement issued by the Congress yesterday will bear out the truth of what I have said.  I quote some excerpts from the joint statement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions:</P>
      <P>Congress is opposed to compulsory wage restraint or interference in free negotiations between trade unions and employers.  In particular, it opposes any attempt to use the power of the State to restrict.</P>
      <P>I agree with that.  That is a statement of principle with which anyone on this side of the House would be in complete accord.  There is no question of restriction of wages, no question of a standstill wages order, of interference in wage negotiations, in this document, <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in that statement rushed in without any consideration whatever of the very realistic analysis contained in the document.  They presumed in their statement that the intention of the White Paper was to restrict wages in a compulsory fashion.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach had to make a Government statement the following day to correct a fantastic misinterpretation of a very sober and sensible document.  He emphasised the fact that there was no standstill on wages.  That was very necessary in view of the fantastic misinterpretation of the facts, a hasty misinterpretation, a rushing-in without due consideration, by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and by reason of that misinterpretation, the Taoiseach had to come out specifically and immediately and place emphasis on the fact that no standstill on wages was envisaged.  That still remains the position. There is no attempt in this document and no proposed attempt by the Government in any way whatever to impose any wage standstill or freeze.

This idea that a particular section of the community is being victimised by this White Paper is completely outrageous.</P>
      <P>The full title of this White Paper is <i>Closing the Gap&mdash;Incomes and Output.</i> Incomes include wages, salaries, distributed profits, dividends &mdash; in fact, everything that comes in to a person in the way of personal earnings.  This document deals with incomes.  The word &ldquo;profits&rdquo; is referred to at various stages of the document.  The whole purpose of the White Paper is to present a realistic analysis of incomes, including profits, and to ask people to restrain income demands. This restraint applies to wages, salaries, profits, dividends&mdash;everything that can be categorised as income.  That, again, I hope, removes another misconception. I do not want to bore the House by going into the various portions of the White Paper where profits are specifically referred to as a factor that must be taken into consideration in any restraint the community must voluntarily enter into.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals compulsorily to restrain anyone. This is a sober analysis of the fact, which cannot be controverted, that productivity is being outstripped by income increases.  By income increases, I mean incomes in the total sense.  That fact was high-lighted by the statistical returns for the quarter ending last September.  Deputy O'Higgins asked why this was not referred to during the Adjournment Debate before Christmas. These statistics came to hand only comparatively recently.  What they revealed was the emergence of a very real gap between earnings and <Col N="229" /> productivity.  By the end of September last year, that gap was of the order of a 12 per cent increase in earnings as against a 1.5 per cent increase in productivity. That fact cannot be controverted.</P>

      <P>The emergence of this pattern clearly called for a Government attitude.  The Government in any democratic country are charged with a certain responsibility.  They are the ultimate regulator in regard to our economy.  The Government must take a stand and have a clear duty to do so on certain occasions.  This occasion was the revelation of this gap emerging between productivity and earnings. The Government decided to set out in this dispassionate fashion the facts of life in regard to our economy and as regards this emerging pattern. That is all the White Paper seeks to do.  There is no recommendation in regard to compulsion, no recommendation in regard to compulsory Government action.  There is no Government proposal to enforce any compulsory <Col N="230" /> regulation.  The White Paper merely sets out this fact and appeals to all people &mdash; wage-earners, salary-earners and dividend-holders &mdash; to exercise restraint in respect of incomes for the time being, having regard to this emerging pattern.  That is all it does. It is the clear duty of any Government to take that sort of action appropriately and in time.</P>
      <P>I do not like to engage in hoary political disputations, but 1957 is not so long away.  There you had a classical example of a Government that waited too long and took action too late.  We do not want to be put into the position of coming along in nine months or 12 months and having to take the sort of drastic action an incompetent Government had to take in the autumn of 1956.  It was quite evident to that Government that an undesirable pattern was emerging in regard to the economy.  It had emerged some 12 months before they took any positive action.  Right through 1955, it was quite evident that the balance of payments position&mdash;the ultimate indicator as to how the economy is going&mdash;was getting into a state of disorder.  Eventually, in late 1955 and early 1956, the magnitude of the disorder was quite apparent to the extent that there was a deficit of £35.5 million.</P>
      <P>No action was taken.  The Government dithered and frittered away the months.  They made no appeals or exhortations to the people such as those contained in the White Paper. Instead, they continued on in a euphoria of their own creation.  Eventually, they did take action but they took it at a stage when only drastic action could be taken and only disastrous results could come from it.  That is exactly what happened.  Instead of appealing to people at an early stage to retrain incomes, instead of making a sane exhortation to them, they followed a policy of drift which eventually resulted in drastic action being forced upon them.  Under the compulsion of that drastic action, they introduced the levies and the restrictionist policy of clamping down on credit which caused massive unemployment in late 1956 and early 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want a repetition of that. <Col N="231" /> We cannot afford in this country to have a repetition of it.  We cannot afford a slowing down of the engine of the national economy any more.  We have it going and we want to keep it going.  The way to do that is to make people aware of the position in good time and to exhort them to restraint in income increases in their various fields. That is the purpose of the White Paper. We do not intend to follow any policy of drift.  We have taken this action even before the final balance of payments figure is available to us.  It is quite obvious however there will be a deficit, probably in the region of £12 million, in respect of last year.  That is apparent in mid-February of the following year. It was quite apparent to the Government of the day in January or February of 1956 that an enormous balance of payments deficit was emerging from the previous year but no action was taken and no exhortations made.  That is one of the facts of life in regard to how a Government operates or does not operate.</P>
    <P>You have in this White Paper an example of a Government making exhortations, of a Government placing the facts of economic life before the people, so that a policy of restraint can be established by them in their various fields.  We did not get that example of leadership in 1956.  They gambled on there being no repetition of the £35.5 million deficit.  When they saw that gamble was not coming off and that another deficit was emerging for 1956, they took the panic action which caused the massive unemployment in early 1957.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and ourselves have this much in common.  We have always been concerned with providing full employment and seeking to adopt the plans and proposals necessary to secure it.  The Labour Party do not want a repetition of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fundamental objective is now agreed everywhere to be the provision of full employment. That should be the goal of our economic policy.  We feel&mdash;and it should be emphasised here&mdash;that if the sort of trend displayed in the last quarter of last year, the trend of incomes outstripping productivity, continues, the only people who will suffer are the working people themselves.  As was said here last night by the Minister for Justice, other people can cushion themselves.  The industrialists and employers can defend themselves. Most of these people have ways and means of cushioning themselves against inflation.  The first people who will suffer from inflation&mdash;that is the name for incomes outstripping productivity&mdash;are, first, the wage-earners who will be disemployed by reason of their goods being costed out of markets, and, secondly, people with old age pensions, widows' pensions and small allowances who will find their small incomes considerably depreciated in value.  These are the people who will <Col N="233" /> suffer if the sort of trend displayed last year is allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>We do not intend to allow that to happen and we appeal for the co-operation of all people in our society in examining the situation and exercising voluntary restraint in regard to demands which they may feel legitimate. That is all that is sought in the White Paper.  Some people outside the House have come to a realisation of that far ahead of any such realisation being made apparent by a large number of people in this House.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in its statement published yesterday quite visibly and definitely withdrew from its rather extreme attitude on the opening day.</P>
      <P>I think the most helpful analysis in this whole matter came from a very prominent trade unionist in a speech he made over the week-end.  I quote from what Mr. Fitzpatrick, former past president of the Congress of Trade Unions said in Tralee on Saturday and I would ask the people on the other side to take his phraseology as exactly emphasising the message of this White Paper.  He said that Congress&mdash;mark you, he is not speaking for himself&mdash; had conceded that the Government's White Paper on Incomes and Output was intended more as a warning signal than a stop sign.  That exactly sums up in a very sensible and practical way what I have been saying for the past quarter of an hour.</P>

      <P>That emphasises a fact that can be brought into this debate because the Fine Gael motion widens the terms of it, that is, the question of the overall state of the economy.  This White Paper must be fitted into the total overall Government plan for the future of the economy.  Since the initiation of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in 1958, and I would call it a plan for economic expansion because that is a fashionable word in labour circles and that is what it is, it has exceeded expectations in regard to its success.  It has resulted in a steady rise in employment and a spectacular rise in respect of exports and a rise in national income that more than doubled the original target.  There has been a rise in national income of five per cent. per year over the past three years, as against the target of two per cent. per annum in the <i>programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  A further detailed plan for economic expansion is in course of preparation and will be published before the end of this year, designed to ensure that the total national income by 1970 will come up to £1,000 million.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins knows that over the years since we came into office, economic expansion has risen; in fact, a one per cent annual increase in national income which was one of the lowest in Western Europe during the last Coalition period has now increased to a five per cent annual rise in national income, which is one of the highest increase rates in Western Europe.  I do not have to elaborate on the various matters discussed this morning by the Minister for Finance.  I shall mention one which is very dear to Deputy Dillon's heart &mdash;this question of exports.  You had a situation in the last two years of the Coalition Government where exports were falling.  In 1955, you had exports in the region of £110 million.  In 1956, they fell to £108 million.  Exports now stand at £186 million.  Exports, which were falling during the last period of the Coalition Government, have risen to £186 million&mdash;a record increase in money terms, in volume terms and in percentage terms.  In 1957, as a result of the disastrous economic policies followed at the time, policies resulting in unemployed on the breadlines in January, 1957, the people scuttled out of this country.  They scuttled out when they saw the breadlines in the early part of the year.</P>
      <P>The figures last year on the net inward-outward passage on movement by sea and air was 20,000 people as against 60,000 in 1957.</P>

      <P>These are facts which cannot be controverted.  The figure of 60,000 is the highest ever recorded and we are going to pin you with that responsibility.  We came in in March, 1957, and we were not going to stop them scuttling overnight.  The figure last year, taken on the same basis as <Col N="238" /> the 1957 figure, was 20,000 people.  In case anybody thinks there is something invalid about this assessment of emigration on the net inward-outward movement by air and sea, it is on the same basis as the 1957 figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But what has happened.  Throughout the debate, the factor of wages seemed to dominate. I would refer Deputies to Paragraph 13 of the White Paper which deals with the very important problem of making management efficient, of having better labour-management relations, better communications between the shop floor and management. Indeed, it emphasises that:</P>
      <P>Acceleration of the rate of increase in productivity requires the urgent attention of management and staffs.  In a country facing evergrowing competition and seeking new export outlets, there is an urgent need for increased consultation and collaboration between employers and workers with a view to securing a steady growth of productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are making available inducements and assistance to enable management and employers to re-equip their factory premises, to reorganise their factory operations and to re-adapt their methods of working. That again is a matter that needs to be emphasised and, indeed, has been emphasised since the publication of the White Paper.  The White Paper <Col N="239" /> deals with more than wages; it deals with the importance of improving management efficiency.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of misinterpretation has been this allegation that any incomes policy proposed by the Government would be pursued in some way without consultation with the interests concerned and in some arbitrary fashion.  That is a misconception. I have only to turn to Paragraph 19 in which it is emphasised that:</P>
    <P>This White Paper is being issued because the solution of the problem of securing a closer correspondence between increases in incomes and output is now a matter of urgent national importance.  The Government propose to invite the National Employer/Labour Conference as representing organisations of employers and labour, to discuss a method by which an objective assessment of the economic position and potentialities may be made from time to time with the object of assisting those who have responsibilities in settling wage and salary rates in private employment in establishing a more orderly relationship between income increases and the growth of national production.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis is on consultation with the National Employer/Labour Conference, the bringing together of management and labour to work out the criteria on which income increases may be made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the White Paper is to draw attention to the necessity for a national incomes policy.  The important thing is to emphasise the problems and this is the essence of leadership.  We must not allow things to drift.  We must inject into the public consciousness the notion that here is a problem that must be met.  That is the essence of leadership. We have produced this White Paper in order to bring the mind of the public to bear on the problem of this dangerous trend&mdash;this gap between incomes and productivity.  We feel the public and the interests concerned will see, and have seen, that this trend could be serious and might be dangerous and that now is the time to <Col N="240" /> take stock of ourselves.  I am quite certain, despite the attitude in this House, that the National Employer/ Labour Conference discussions will be resumed.  Sensible people will see that it is necessary to have resumption of the talks and to keep this Conference moving on the rails in discussing this very important matter.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing on which there is general agreement&mdash;Deputy Dillon stated it over the week-end and it was stated by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on various occasions&mdash;it is the importance of evolving a national incomes policy after full consultation and after reaching agreement on the statistical criteria on which incomes can be increased in relation to productivity.  That would be done by way of co-operation on the part of all the interests so as to hammer out a national incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Incomes and productivity should move step by step together.  That is the wish of everybody here.  What the Government are doing is drawing attention to it in this White Paper and stating, as I have just quoted, that they proposed to invite the National Employer/Labour Conference to bring its mind to bear specifically on this problem and to evolve, after full consultation, a form of incomes policy. If this White Paper and if this debate &mdash;even though it may have gone off the rails at times&mdash;does that, or brings about a situation where that can be achieved, it will all have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The essential argument that the Government have put forward has not been gainsaid in this debate.  I repeat what the past-President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said, that the White Paper is a warning signal and not a stop sign.  People outside this House, who count on both sides in industry, will see it in that light, as a warning signal and not as a stop sign.  If seen in that light I am quite certain that the people who count in trade unions and in management will sit around a table and co-operate with the National Employer/Labour Conference and see to it that we do evolve a national incomes policy which will prevent the need for a Government to issue any warning signals or stop signs, <Col N="241" /> an incomes policy that will move forward automatically in accordance with rising productivity &mdash; an &ldquo;incomes&rdquo; policy &mdash; including profits, dividends and wages which will move upwards and remove the need for any Government issuing White Papers in regard to such signals or warning signs.  I feel that this will emerge as a result of the public interest arising out of this White Paper.  This is a very fundamental problem in our economy. If we can tackle this problem, then we can go ahead in regard to building our economy here and improving our export position.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a politician and having listened to a fellow politician in a position which can only be described as a back-to-the-wall situation, I cannot help feeling admiration for the skill, exercise and political tactics of the Parliamentary Secretary. It is a good thing when a politician faced with a desperate situation can put a face on it.  But I think we should try to draw the line at a misrepresentation of what I honestly believe to be the position as set out in the White Paper.  He tries to give a fundamental misrepresentation of what is in the White Paper.  I want to move the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental misrepresentation to which I referred is this one concerned in paragraph 21. I do not believe there can be any doubt about the implications of that paragraph.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to try to create the impression that this was merely a sort of a-b-c chosen in simple economics for the benefit of the public.  I do not think anybody could take that statement of the position and leave it at that.  It is very much more than that and I do not really think the Parliamentary Secretary does not agree with me.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 21, they conclude:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the considerations referred to in the White Paper, the Government deem it necessary that Departments and State-sponsored <Col N="242" /> organisations should not accede for the present to any claims for increases in wages and salaries or for changes in conditions of work, having the same effect, which would arouse similar expectations in other employments.</P>
    <P>In the Parliamentary Secretary's hearing last night&mdash;I think he was here&mdash; the Taoiseach asserted that now we will not start a ninth round wage increase within the Government services and we will not permit statutory bodies to increase wages and salaries. I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary can assert with any honesty that that does not amount to a wages standstill order, a salary standstill order.  The fact is, whatever gloss they are trying to put on it now, that if this paper, had simply contained the warning or the red light type of warning to the public generally and the trade union movement in particular, the trade union movement would not, I think, have missed the point.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary should base his case, particularly in the light of the future and the very grave conditions his Government are facing in the future, should they survive this motion, on abuse of the trade union movement by his suggestion that they are predominantly a bunch of hysterics, which is implicitly to suggest that any statements made, following the decision, made in this White Paper, were hysterical in tone.</P>
    <P>It was obviously a decision of a majority in the TUC and if it was a decision of the majority, it was a considered decision by a body which has been praised by people from both sides here in very fulsome terms as a consistent body, consisting of people over-responsible or over-conscious of their responsibility to the community.  Consequently, I think it does a very grave disservice to the Taoiseach's efforts to try to improve the position created by the Paper by this implicit wages standstill and salary standstill order.</P>
    <P>It is no good taking individual members; every individual member and every group has a right to his personal opinions.  We must take the group opinion, and the group opinion was a <Col N="243" /> very downright condemnation of this White Paper and that group decision was in accordance with&mdash;this is the strange part of this whole White Paper &mdash;a decision taken in July last at their annual conference in which they said they would resist any attempts to fix wages or salaries with all the powers at their disposal.</P>
    <P>As I say, the strange thing is that the Government should have taken this step without consultation.  I do not see why they should shy away from prior consultation.  There is no reason in the world to accept an advice given at a consultation but I think there is a fairly generally accepted practice in Government Departments of consulting everybody on matters of importance to the individuals concerned, listening to their advice and then taking it or leaving it, just as it suits.  Is the Parlia mentary Secretary conscious that the Government's responsibility is to lead? To that effect, they have taken a decision one way or the other.  That is an admirable thing, but at the same time the decision should have been one which had taken into consideration all the factors which afterwards might colour the decision or which might be of importance in swaying the decision one way or the other.</P>
    <P>So much might have prevented the very drastic reaction which has ensued from a not notably radical trade union movement.  Our own trade union movement here, is, if anything, a conservative organisation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the reaction has been so brisk and so spontaneous does seem to me to lead to the conclusion that the handling of the matter by the Government has been particularly ill-advised. I think that condemning and accusing these people of being extravagant on top is not going to help this situation at all.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary attempted to create the impression that this was a broad ultimatum.  He did not use the word &ldquo;ultimatum&rdquo; but a much softer word.  The public generally in connection with all incomes, profits, dividends, salaries and <Col N="244" /> so on know quite well that we have this decision that State servants and servants of State-sponsored bodies must recognise that they will not get any increase in their wages and salaries for an unspecified time.  There is great difficulty with regard to the person who is faced with the need for an increase in salary and who is faced with this restriction on his demand.  As far as he is concerned, he does not get money when he needs it and consequently it is a wage and salary standstill to him.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has attempted to create the impression that this covers everything.  Of course, it does not.  Of course, the Government have said there should be profit restraint, dividend restraint, but they have also said that they can do nothing about it.  They cannot take any effective steps.  That is in complete contrast to their relations with semi-State bodies where they can take effective steps.  They have told these groups involved that they may not have an increase, no matter how valid their demand may be.  On the other hand, they have said to the profit and dividend people: &ldquo;We hope you will not increase your dividends and profits but we can take no steps to stop you if you wish to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Wage and salary increases are being restricted but it is presumed that the Government within nine, 11 or 12 months will be through their present crisis and they will then be able to loosen their purse strings and with economic expansion, possibly after an election, there will be a time when profits and dividends can be declared and can run to any level and the people will have forgotten that this profit restriction was simply not operative because it will be taken in the context of a general easing of economic tension.  So the position is clearly that it is aimed at a specific group within the society.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had a certain amount of pseudo-indignation at the suggestion that this was directed at a class.  Now &ldquo;class&rdquo; has several meanings.  There is a section which is affected and a section which is not going to be affected and I do not think <Col N="245" /> there is any gainsaying that.  I think that point has been established and the Government will yield to nobody in their regard for the wage and salary workers in general, and all workers in particular.  That may be so, but the position here is that there is this specific direction to the mass of the people that no matter what their case is, they will not get an increase in their salaries or their wages.  This brings me to another point.  Nobody going to arbitration, nobody going to a trade union and nobody going to the Labour Court says: &ldquo;We want an increase for practical purposes; we want an increase simply because profit is increasing.&rdquo;  The general thing is to go and say it is because of hardship or an increase in the cost of living or an increasing deterioration.</P>
    <P>We all know the various Encyclicals there are about the necessity for a good employer to pay a just wage and yet the Government have taken a decision here that they will not pay a just wage.  They have given their reasons.  They say they are not going to pay wage increases to their salaried workers for an unspecified period.  I think that is a very serious decision which the Government say they are taking in the national interest.  It is also the decision of a Government which can at the same time claim, as the Parliamentary Secretary has attempted to claim, to be prosperous so far as economic expansion is concerned. I consider that is one of the weaknesses of the points the Parliamentary Secretary has tried to bring out.  On the other hand, he says emigration has fallen, employment has risen, the real value of income has gone up, total exports have soared to an unprecedented figure.  With all of those things, it would seem to me that he is trying to make a case that the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been a success.  In fact he says it was a success.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach put it in a different way.  He said: &ldquo;The Opposition are complaining not because of our failure but because of our success.  They are annoyed because of our success.&rdquo;  It is incredible that this runs through the speeches made by members of the <Col N="246" /> Government.  The Minister for Finance &mdash;usually a well-balanced man&mdash;followed much the same line in his speech when he said that things were never better, or certainly were not as bad as in 1956 and 1957.  That is the old comparison which has gone on from 1932 as can be seen by reading through the Dáil Debates.  The main thing is that there is this attempt to say this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been a success and at the same time, they tell the victim&mdash; presumably that is all you can call the consumer, the salary worker&mdash; that though this has been a great success&mdash;it was announced in 1958 and 1959&mdash;&ldquo;we cannot pay you a just wage.&rdquo;  Surely that is much more like the proclamation or declaration of a bankrupt concern which is going downhill, of a concern which cannot make both ends meet, which cannot meet its just commitments?  Surely that progress in economic expansion should mean that the Government were going to pay a just wage.  According to this White Paper, they are not going to pay a just wage.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot pay it, despite the fact that they are trying to claim that the <i>Progress of Economic Expansion</i> announced with such great excitement and enthusiasm by the Government has been a success.  It reminds me of the old enthusiastic surgeon who carried out an operation and said the operation was a great success, but the patient died.  As far as the public are concerned, that is what has happened, because surely success must be judged in figures of re-employment, and above everything, the standard of living.  I can see difficulties for the Government but surely the position now is that we have come to the end of this debate that has gone on at least since 1932 in which successive Ministers have made speeches, very like that of the Taoiseach last night, and the net result to the public has not changed appreciably.</P>
    <P>One of the minor political enigmas of politics in Ireland was from 1932 to 1959, whether the Taoiseach was a person of tremendous ability, skill and enterprise who was to some extent frustrated by the inhibitions of the <Col N="247" /> older politicians around him.  Most of us wondered what would be the position when this man was on his own, when he was really given a chance. Would he be an outstanding success. We now know it was only a fiction that the people who many of us thought were in his way obstructing the evolution of a dynamic mind and in the way of a strong enterprising forward-looking person who could create a socially just and prosperous society.  This just did not exist.  Since taking over complete control of the country, he has simply shown he has not got the qualities which many people including myself believed he had, the qualities which would allow him to do away with the old inhibitions that many of our Governments and Ministers for Industry and Commerce in particular have had over the years and, as the present President once said, if we do not succeed within the system, we will change it and decide on a completely different one.  Many people believed that Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach would have done that.  However, it is quite clear now that he has many serious defects.</P>
    <P>One of his most serious defects is this inability to accept the fact that he can make mistakes, that he is not infallible.  I have only had a relatively short experience of ten years or so of listening to the Taoiseach speaking but I have read many of the debates going back since the beginning of the Dáil, certainly since 1932, and one of the things that has been most consistent in the Taoiseach has been his absolute self-assurance.  In spite of all the facts to the contrary in a situation he is quite happy that what he said was right and what he is now saying will prove to be right.  We know the fiasco of the Common Market has disclosed him to have been wrong on many occasions.  His assessment of a position, his analysis and conclusions about a situation, again and again, have proved to be completely wrong and obviously derived from his own wishful thinking or imagination. This is now on record and I do not intend to go back over it but he has <Col N="248" /> been proved to be completely wrong on many occasions.</P>
    <P>The most dangerous aspect of this Government's existence is the fact that this man who is so completely unsettled and unreliable in his powers of analysis of a situation and in drawing conclusions from that analysis, is in control of the country at a particularly difficult time.  All the speakers who have said the situation is serious are completely right.  I do not think we have been in such a serious position since the 30's.  It is even more serious than 1956 and 1957, the reason being, of course, the imminence of a continual deterioration of the situation which appertains in Britain at the moment.  This is the factor which will colour events here, no matter what any Government do, growing unemployment no matter what Government are in power.  Even if a Labour Government are returned in Britain, I believe the situation must get worse before it gets better.</P>
    <P>Because of that, this Government or any Government in power have particularly difficult problems to deal with and in that situation, what is needed more than anything else is a man who is prepared to sit down, look at the position as it is, not imagine the situation as he would like it to be, not a person who is on record as having promised he would do certain things and failed to do them but a person who will say: &ldquo;This is an emergency situation where there is likely to be growing unemployment here as a result of the pressure against emigration in Britain.&rdquo;  This is a situation which requires emergency measures and quite clearly, there are no emergency solutions in this White Paper.</P>
    <P>As Deputy John A. Costello said, there are 20 paragraphs devoted to economic baby talk and then there are two paragraphs relating to labour-employer discussions and a reference to the standstill on wages and salaries. That does not provide us with the solution for the grave problems which are facing the Government at the moment.  The truth is that the Government are not frightened enough of the situation.  They are not sufficiently <Col N="249" /> frightened of the implications of the reduction of tariffs which ultimately is inevitable, the increasing competition from very powerful outside industrial forces, the inevitability of many of our industries going to the wall.  It is unimportant now that they are weak and undermechanised.  The reality is that they will not be able to stand up to the competition that is coming and that means growing unemployment.</P>
    <P>These are matters which the Taoiseach is refusing to face.  His refusal to face them today is a consistent part of his character.  When the adjournment debate was on last December&mdash; Deputy O'Higgins referred to it this morning&mdash;the Taoiseach made a number of statements.  At column 1470 of the Official Report of the 13th December, 1962, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the situation that exists today and that which existed in 1956 when Deputy Dillon was controlling the affairs of the nation.  The situation today does not require the emergency measures which had then to be resorted to, with serious consequences in that year, in order to prevent the total collapse of the economy.</P>
    <P>Again, in the same column:</P>
    <P>A multitude of devices have been brought into operation in order to stimulate exports and they are working well and satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>That is clearly not a warning.  It is not a red light or an amber light; it is the green light all the time.  According to him, everything is all right.  Again he says: &ldquo;On the contrary, the indications are that the outlook for the future is quite good, that the falling off in exports is not necessarily a cause for anxiety.&rdquo;  Then there is his statement referred to by Deputy Dillon that the various danger signals then appearing were not a matter of great concern.  He advises Deputy Dillon to exert himself a little more in reading the documentation made available to him, including the Central Bank report. I wonder if the Taoiseach read the Central Bank report.  If he did, he did not see the warnings that things were in a serious condition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> Page 15 of that report states:</P>
    <P>State expenditure, borrowing and annual debt-service charges are thus increasing much more rapidly than national output.</P>
    <P>And again:</P>
    <P>Much of the public capital programme is still of a social nature, and some of the remainder is economically productive in a long term sense only.</P>
    <P>Further on, it is stated:</P>
    <P>On an international comparison of cost per unit of output we have not improved our competitive position since 1950.</P>
    <P>On Page 11 the report states:</P>
    <P>It is now widely recognised that the recent increase in incomes considerably exceeds the increase in output.  This involves increased costs of production, with a loss in competitive power both in the home market and in markets abroad, higher consumers' prices and, probably, increased imports of finished goods and domestic consumption of home produced goods &mdash; many of which contain a proportion of imported materials&mdash;with a further widening of the external trade gap and a deterioration in the current balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I will not weary the House by repeating many of these quotations but I will say that there were quotations in the Central Bank report which did not rationalise the reasons given by the Taoiseach for recommending the reading of it by Deputy Dillon.  On Page 16, it says:</P>
    <P>The present is a very critical time for Irish industrial development. Salary and wage earners have fared well over recent years, and the time has come for a pause, at least until national output has expanded sufficiently to enable further increases in incomes to be negotiated without risk to continued economic progress.</P>
    <P>Nobody has more contempt for the ideology of the Central Bank than I have, but here in this House, it is never questioned.  Leaving that aside, here is an authority in which there is a volume of simply worded warnings of the necessity for the restraint now <Col N="251" /> advocated by the Minister for Finance and a suggestion that this pay pause which is now included in the White Paper should be introduced.  At the time of the Central Bank report, when the Taoiseach was asking Deputy Dillon to read it, it is quite obvious that he had not bothered to study it himself.  At that time, he was talking about the economic situation not being of any great concern.</P>
    <P>Surely that is an example of the Taoiseach's complete refusal to accept the fact that the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been a failure?  It has not been the success which the Parliamentary Secretary to-day suggested it has been.  When the Taoiseach brazened it out here in the face of the Opposition criticism and said that there was no need to worry, he did so in the full knowledge that the authority on which he places so much reliance had warned the country some months before the December debate.  What has happened between December and mid-February to create the necessity for the restrictive measures now being introduced by the Department of Finance?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has attempted to justify this discrimination against the salaried worker and wage-earner in their own interests.  He says that if they use this restraint, their output will increase and that he will be in a position to reward them for their increased efforts.  I do not know of any justification for this thesis at all.  It strikes me as being very like this frightening preoccupation with slogans which has characterised so many doctrinaire conservative Governments. In the early days, the key to prosperity was free trade.  In the 30's, it was protection and in the 60's, we get back to free trade.  We have mention of EFTA, and GATT and the EEC. We are told that they are all going to be the key to our success and that all we have to do is to increase production. There is nothing wrong in saying that we must increase production but it is the way that they set about increasing production that is wrong and that is the basic fallacy of the whole case put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> There is a suggestion that there be consultation between the workers and the employers to get wage restraint. That is not going to solve the problem of the Governments, either in Great Britain or here.  The Taoiseach said last night: &ldquo;Do not make the same mistake twice&rdquo;.  Why does he, having accepted that simple truth, go on to make the same mistake as Selwyn Lloyd made in Britain which got him the sack and brought his country to the verge of a very serious economic recession?  Surely one can learn from other people's failures and mistakes. This wages pause did not work in Britain and it will quite certainly not work here.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the suggestion that the wages pause is the important consideration. There are many economists who are prepared to say that the wage content is not an important part of the approach to increasing productivity, and I think that is simple enough for anybody to see.  The wage-freeze is directed against this one section, the wage and salary earners, as opposed to the profit and the dividend owner.  In that way, it is clear it is sectional in its direction.  This is, of course, on all fours with consistent Government policy over recent years and I think the facts will show that there is a tendency to protect the wealthy minority in this country as against the welfare of the masses.  I do not care what you examine, what State institutions you study, you will find proof of the fact that there are two nations here.</P>
    <P>I think that is a good phrase to describe the position.  There are two nations here, the privileged minority and the underprivileged, the masses. This is actively shown in virtually every Department of State.  You have it in education, where our secondary schools and universities are virtually closed to the majority of our youngsters, no matter what talent they possess, simply because they have not got the money. In the Department of Health, you have the position that there is discrimination against the masses under our health services.  The wealthy have first-class services because they can pay.  I am amazed when I hear people here talking about our Christian society.</P>
    <Col N="253" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about my own general experience.  The same discrimination applies to old people.  A society which treats its old people with a miserable 37/6 a week obviously is a society that discriminates against the masses of old people.  As I say, there is that underprivileged majority.  The Minister for Justice adequately illustrated the distinction when he gave tremendous increases to the judiciary for reasons which nobody knows. Surely that was an example of privilege. We have the situation where the majority of the people out of work are poor people, people with very little or no education simply because they could not afford it.  The majority of our emigrants are people who are unskilled workers of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of society it has taken us 40 years to build.  I do not think it is anything to be proud of.  In fact we should be thoroughly ashamed of it.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Declan Costello recently saying that we had such a lot to contribute to Europe. I do not think we have anything to contribute to Europe.  Look at our taxation system.  Taxation of incomes, affecting the workers generally, has gone up from £4 million in 1933-34 to £34 million.  Taxation on expenditure here has gone up from £61 million to £89 million; taxation by way of social insurance has gone up from £5 million to £10 million, just double; while taxation on capital went up from £2,803,000 to £2,870,000, a negligible increase.  On the masses of the people, the burden of taxation has been increasing all the time.  We have one of the highest rates of indirect taxation in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I believe that the complaint about the question of output is not against the worker at all.  The worker to-day has nothing to do with it.  I do not think he has any control over it at all, because of the alteration in the whole pattern in industry these days.  The old days of the craftsman&mdash;the wheelwright, the blacksmith, the wood, stone or iron worker&mdash;are all gone.  We are now in <Col N="254" /> an age of mechanisation and the worker can work only as fast as the machine lets him.  The result is that the essence, the key to increased productivity, lies with the machines, not with the men, and the machines are provided by the management.  Therefore, unless management provide machines for the men, they can work until they are black in the face, until they collapse from apoplexy, but they will not increase production one iota.</P>
    <P>There is a machine for making cigarettes which, say, turns out 1,000 per minute.  It will not produce 1,001 no matter how hard it is worked.  A bottle machine which turns out 100 a minute will not turn out one more, no matter how hard you work it.  The same applies to all the forms of machinery which now are part of our industrial structure.  In agriculture, it is quite clear that the man who formerly had the pick and the shovel, or the pick and spade, now has the colossal bulldozer which will give him so much production.  Give him another, and no matter how hard he competes with the optimum, he cannot improve on it.</P>
    <P>It is this failure on the part of the Government to realise these facts that is responsible for the essential weakness in their whole case.  It is the most frightening manifestation of their misunderstanding of the problems before them and of the methods by which these problems can be solved. It is stupid to think that the Garda, the transport workers, the road workers, the old age pensioners, can increase production, no matter what they do.  They are completely dependent on the industrial worker.  They become the victims of the failure of the industrial worker to increase production, and the industrial worker is the victim of the manager who refuses to put his profits back into industry in order to bring us to a position where we could compete successfully on world markets.</P>
    <P>Our basic failure here has been our complete dependence on private enterprise capitalism.  When I have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what he proposes to do about redundancy, apparently nobody is doing anything as far as he can say. <Col N="255" /> We have seen thousands of rural workers leaving year in, year out, but nobody has made any attempt to rehabilitate them in any kind of remunerative work.  Most of them have had to emigrate.  Certainly not many of them have been absorbed into our industrial effort.  A very high percentage of our industrial workers in fact have themselves had to get out.</P>
    <P>When we ask the Minister what he proposes to do about impending redundancy, he says he cannot interfere, that it is a matter for management, a matter for these industries themselves.  He says that this is not a dictatorial society or there is some other attempted sneer of that kind. Meanwhile, this <i>laissez-faire</i> type of doctrinaire conservative approach to economic problems and employment problems is being particularly hurtful to many people.  You have this pleasant minority who have all these privileges of best education, best care in time of age and so on.  You have created that minority.  You have created this system in which that minority derives a very good living indeed, but you have done it at a tremendous cost in human suffering and hardship for the great mass of the people.</P>
    <P>Very good; both sides of the House share responsibility for that over the past 40 years.  It must be clear, therefore, to both sides that where you have been unable to find jobs for 1,000,000 people, where you cannot educate or look after your people properly in health, sickness and old age, you must accept that this type of economy in which you believe has been a failure.  It is you who believe in it, it is you who believe it can work; and it is you who have failed to make it work in respect of a very significant minority of our people. Surely it is about time you accepted that and took the decision that we will, in fact, care for the mass of the people, even if it does damage the interests of a minority within the country?</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands said, the workers are being exhorted and encouraged to increase production.  It <Col N="256" /> is like asking a man to lift himself up by his own bootstraps.  He cannot do it.  If you give him a spade and there is a bulldozer available, how can he compete?  That is a fair comparison between Irish industry and continental industry.  I am amazed at the tolerance over the years of the trade union movement of this position, where they have condoned the continuation of private enterprise capitalism, which has, first of all, denied so many of our people the right to work here at home, the right to a proper standard of living here at home and the right to security of employment at reasonable wages.</P>
    <P>This is a point I should like to deal with.  It seems to me we have attempted to create the position of making industry competitive with industry on the continent at the workers' expense.  We have tried to be a little Japan here in the Atlantic. I do not know whether they exploit their workers in Japan.  One does not know how much is propaganda or truth, but it is said that they exploit these people and give them bad wages. If our experience of Japanese employment in Shannon is anything to go by, it is probably true.  It seems to me we are trying to do much the same thing here.</P>
    <P>The last issue of <i>Trade Union Information</i> contains a comparison of labour costs in manufacturing industry in 1961.  Seven countries were covered: Sweden, West Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, Britain and Ireland.  In respect of a male worker, the best is Sweden.  The figure is 8/10 per hour; the worst is Ireland, at 4/6 an hour.  In respect of fringe benefits and indirect wages, the best is Sweden again at 1/7 per hour and the worst Ireland at 7d. per hour.  The total is 10/5 per hour in respect of Sweden and 5/- in respect of Ireland.  That is the difference between Irish labour costs and Swedish costs.</P>
    <P>When we come to female labour, the position is even worse.  Sweden is again the best at 6/1 per hour and Ireland the worst at 2/7 per hour.  In respect of fringe benefits, Sweden is 1/1 per hour and Ireland 4d. per hour. Clearly, what we are doing, or what <Col N="257" /> we have been trying to do, is to create an impression of efficiency in industry by grossly underpaying our workers.  If they worked in any of these other countries, they would be getting very much more than they get here.  Britain is the next to us.  She is slightly better.</P>
    <P>We have the position here where workers who are working at the lowest rate in Europe are told: &ldquo;You must continue to work at the lowest rates in Europe.&rdquo; It cannot be said on those figures that one of the problems in keeping down prices is the cost of labour.  Those figures completely refute it.  From the figures for direct and indirect wages, can we say we pay our workers a just wage, in spite of all our cant about our belief in Papal Encyclicals and all the rest?  We do not pay a just wage, but we are not going to continue to pay even that unjust wage.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to Deputy Costello last night that there was no question of reducing the standard of living.  Of course there is.  Since there will be no control over profits and rising prices&mdash; and prices will continue to rise&mdash;if wages are fixed, the standard of living will be reduced in that way.  Even though we are grossly underpaying our workers, we will not even continue that rate of payment.  This is all in order to bolster up the grossly inefficient mechanism of private enterprise capitalism which has so outrageously failed the country over the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Another factor of labour employment in Ireland is the insurance or welfare benefits of one kind or another paid here and paid on the continent. Again, the Christian way of life.  On the continent the expenditure by employer and employee on social security contributions varies from 20 to 30 per cent.; in Ireland, the figure is six per cent.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that productivity here is not related to the private enterprise dominated industries in the country.  We are not talking about the semi-State concerns, which are mostly public utilities and which have nothing to do with productivity.  The field of productivity&mdash;the profit-creating <Col N="258" /> industry&mdash;was allocated nearly exclusively to this type of private enterprise concern.  Whatever productivity we have here is the productivity created by private enterprise capitalism.</P>
    <P>Of a total of 18 countries in an estimate of the gross national product per head of the population at the end of 1961, according to PIX world currency reports, Ireland came seventeenth. America was first with £1,040 per head of the population.  Ireland had £248 and Italy £246.  It is quite clear that we have not at all used labour and capital in order to maximise the potential of productivity in the country.  In productivity, Ireland ranks at half that of the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, West Germany and Denmark and less than two-thirds that of the Netherlands and Norway.</P>
    <P>In addition to these facts, a very interesting survey was carried by Dr. Nevin on comparative prices here and in Britain, the nearest country with which comparisons could be made, with all the weaknesses of such investigations. But Dr. Nevin showed that if distribution margins in Ireland were, in fact, lower than in the United Kingdom, this would imply that producers prices may be on average some ten per cent.  above the United Kingdom equivalents.  He then mentions that further adjustments could be made for quality and I do not know anything more than he appears to do about that. This is one other overhead which we carry in order to maintain this incubus of private enterprise capitalism in Ireland. We have the lowest wage rates in Europe: our gross national product is one of the lowest in the world and, in addition, prices to the unfortunate consumer are something&mdash;it states eight to ten per cent., but I understand it is in the region of 12 per cent.&mdash; higher than comparable prices in Britain. Clearly, if the Government were really concerned for the mass of the people, the workers generally, there is one simple way in which they could reduce the cost of living considerably.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very concerned the other day because we were described as an under-developed country. Now it is changed to the euphemism that we are a country in the course of economic development.  As the Minister <Col N="259" /> for Industry and Commerce rightly said, that means nothing at all but I think the original description of under-developed country is clearly a perfectly valid one as regards Ireland.  All this highlights the idiocy of the suggestion that we might go into the European Community as full members.  If we were members now of EEC, this is one device which we would not be allowed to operate.  We would not be allowed to restrict wages or social services in this way or to maintain them at the present level.  All of these would have to be evened up.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of an undeveloped country, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was not true because we have this very sound infra-structure of education, roads, transport, shipping and so on.  That is quite true.  These are State or semi-State concerns.  People profess to believe in private enterprise capitalism but when they are in trouble, they produce the State concerns &mdash; and rightly&mdash;in order to bolster up any case they may have to show that we are in fact moderately prosperous.  On the one hand, we have tariff protection and restrictive trade practices, on the other, and the producer has a society in which he can take any profits he wants to take.  There is no profit restriction.  Because they believe in this, they would not extend the idea of public ownership to the major producing industries, profit creating industries, with the result that it is left in the hands of grossly incompetent and grossly inefficient people who continue under each Government to betray the fundamental interests of the country.</P>
    <P>We have the position in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is able to say: &ldquo;Look at the success of our State companies.  Look at the magnificent job Aer Lingus does, or Irish Shipping or Irish Steel Holdings or Bord na Móna or the ESB or even CIE,&rdquo; even though I have criticised CIE myself very often.  Basically, he is able to point to these and say they are moderately well-run and that some are extremely efficient.  While he does that, he will not extend the principle and <Col N="260" /> say: &ldquo;Because they have been so successful and because the others have failed so badly, we must in the public interest&rdquo;&mdash;if they are interested in the public &mdash;&ldquo;extend this principle of public ownership to the greater part of industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even where it is extended in the case of the Irish Sugar Company in going into food processing&mdash;this is the first intelligent development that has ever happened, in my belief, in this sector of industrial development &mdash; the industry has been denied the right to compete with private enterprise because of the fraudulent claim that they believe in free competition.</P>

      <P>The sugar company has to go into the highly competitive export market and sink or swim there. How can the Taoiseach pretend he is concerned about the mass of the people when every conceivable aspect of social and economic policy over the years of his control of this economy has been directed towards the aggrandisement of an already wealthy minority at the expense of the great mass of the people?  Here we have a justifiable claim about State and semi-State companies, and what happens? These are the very companies which, as Deputy J. A. Costello said yesterday, are the first to suffer for their own success and for other people's failure.  Why should they be forced to restrict wages or salaries or incomes because the other gangsters&mdash;I believe that is not an over-statement because they are exploiting the community which protects them and allows them the tariff barriers and so on&mdash;are inefficient and have to charge an extra 10 or 12 per cent. to the consumers? If the British could come in here and flood the market with consumer products, we could buy them for 10 or 12 per cent. less, if it were not for these industries which we protect. Instead of appreciating this protection by the consumers, they proceed to exploit the consumers by charging any price they want to charge&mdash;think of a number and double it.</P>

      <P>We are not restricted for time.  If there is undue restriction, the Government must take the consequences. I was not a party to fixing a restriction on the time for discussion. I believe that an incontrovertible case can be made for showing that the culprits are not as suggested by the Government, that is the salary or wage-earners either in State employment or semi-State employment or in industrial employment.  The workers who are particularly unfortunate are those in State or semi-State organisations. We have to bow in acknowledgment of their wonderful achievements and great success in the complicated undertakings which they were responsible for carrying out, for the community, over the years, and our reward to them is to say: &ldquo;Whatever may be negotiated outside, you will be the first to be victimised because of the failure of the Government's policy.&rdquo;  They should not be victimised in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is quite useless asking the industrial worker to increase production merely by restricting his wages.  If anything, there is a very good case for showing that restricted wages will restrict production.  As somebody has said, this fear of insecurity is there and it will lead to a slowing down of production.  This, then, is likely to have a completely contrary effect.  I do not know what action the Government propose to <Col N="263" /> take&mdash;that is their business entirely&mdash; but I honestly believe that the situation is even more serious than in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>One can talk about Suez or Korea as being incidents which complicated the situation for a Government but these changes are taking place all the time and they must be regarded as part of the occupational risks of politicians or societies absorbed with the problems of the economy at the time. If you were a Korean or an Egyptian, you could say that during the wars or the troubles it became very difficult, but I do not think you can use an incident in other countries to justify a failure in your own country.  It is confused reasoning.  It is simply irrational and it does lead to unreliability which is most dangerous. At this particular time, a pattern of circumstances has arisen in Great Britain which altogether alters the predicament of the Government as never before.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government were extremely competent, because of our economic dependence for 30 years on Britain, because of the serious recession there, because of the clear inability of the Government to deal with that, the problem here is going to need very skilful handling.  I do not think the Government are showing any likelihood of meeting their requirements in that regard.  The Minister for Finance criticised the Opposition for not making suggestions. I want to suggest to the Government that they must recognise the fact that private capital has failed to invest in Ireland to the extent that it should have.  If anybody looks at our external assets&mdash;I do not know what they are at present but I remember the Taoiseach saying that in the 1930s, they were £300 million and now they may be £400 million&mdash;he will see that they are going up all the time.  That money should have been invested here, but that is water under the bridge.</P>
    <P>However, we must recognise that there is not sufficient capital invested in Irish industry.  We have to fall back on the public in order to find capital. <Col N="264" /> A lot of work has yet to be done &mdash;school buildings, primary and secondary and, I believe, even universities; houses have to be built by the thousand; trunk and side roads have to be built all over the country; harbours have to be constructed; forestry development has to be undertaken as well as the development in rural Ireland of the co-operative movement upon which General Costello's excellent food processing schemes can be based.  There is great scope for developing these enterprises, some of them productive and some unproductive, but all of them will create jobs for people.  For that reason they must be considered now rather than in time of real crisis which may be next autumn or winter when it will be too late to draw up these schemes because they are complicated. They could not be done overnight as they may take nine months or a year to complete.</P>
    <P>The Government should announce such a plan without delay in order to still the real fears which exist among many workers that their jobs are in grave danger, as they are.  All the CIO reports point to the same thing.  I suppose they are sample reports of some of our most efficient industries and they point to grave defects in industry.  Facing open competition, there must be redundancy.  That is the report of the Government's commission and that is why workers are beginning to be disturbed.  They are facing continuing growing unemployment but without ready access to Britain as in the past.  I believe the trade union movement should act rapidly and firmly and I hope they will insist on some action being taken in regard to social benefits.</P>
    <P>The Government should announce an increase in unemployment benefits in order to try to cushion the unfortunate people who are now unemployed and who are facing problems they did not face before when in a time of reasonable affluence they may have entered into hire-purchase agreements which now they cannot meet from their unemployment benefit.  The Government should also take steps in regard to the redundancy plans and the <Col N="265" /> retraining plans about which they have spoken for nearly one and a half years but which they have not yet produced.</P>
    <P>There were six CIO reports all about industry but none exclusively about the workers.  A retraining, regrouping and re-employment plan should be announced without delay so that the worker, again, may know there is likely to be some security for him should he co-operate in working himself out of a job, which is the present proposition of reorganisation of industry. That is what it amounts to.  The trade union movement should insist on at least these three basic requirements.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, with all the deference in the world, to the trade union movement that they do not wait until the situation, as bad as it is now, has become as serious as it is from the unemployment point of view in the North of Ireland.  I would further suggest to them, with deference, that they do not take the line that they have taken in the North of Ireland of marching the unfortunate unemployed up the hill to Stormont and back down again from Stormont, because it is completely ineffective, as it has shown itself to be.  It does not cost Brookeborough a thought and will not cost the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, a thought if they indulge in the same type of practice here.</P>
    <P>The protest should take the form of a graded, growing form of industrial protest.  I would make the industrialists pay for the protest by, not using strike action, but using a gradually extending work to rule plan throughout industry, using the most vulnerable industries, which would, while incommoding the Government, not damage the rights or the interests of the workers or of the consumers, such as newspapers or some of this type of industry, where a protest could be made doing the least possible damage to the welfare of the worker and the welfare of the consumer but at the same time bringing real pressure to bear on the Taoiseach at this time rather than waiting until they have <Col N="266" /> 100,000 or 120,000 hungry unemployed behind them.  They carry very little weight.  It is the worker in his job who can put pressure on a Government of this kind and I hope the Trade Union Congress will see that that pressure is brought to bear.</P>

I should like to say that I have been here since 10.50 a.m. and would have been here earlier but for the fact that I was helping three families to avoid being evicted tomorrow by the Corporation.  That is my usual work every morning.  Deputy Barron, who does similar work every morning, knows where I was this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am supporting the Government because not to do so would be cowardly.  It would be an easy way out for me not to vote at all but I have never chosen the coward's way out. I am voting for the Government on this occasion just as I voted for the Government 15 months ago.  I did so on the conviction that they and they alone should form a Government, as any simpleton should realise simply <Col N="268" /> by counting heads.  The total Opposition, if you like to include myself, would be 73 against 70 and that 73 would be made up of four Parties and seven Independents.  How could they be expected to vote on every issue put forward by a Coalition Government or how could they all be present here on all occasions to vote in a Division when, in fact, there is no control over Independents who can come and go if they like?  I voted in the way I did because of my conviction that only Deputy Lemass could form a Government and I defy anyone to dispute that.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be able to say that, at least, I am a party to having a Government functioning in this country for the past 15 months.  Whether I stand over all the things they have done is another thing.  I decided to support the Government because I considered it was not in the interests of the country to have a sudden costly election which would bring about, possibly, the same results.  I did the only practical thing and I make no apology to anyone for it.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, again I have decided to support the Government because I am satisfied that the Opposition are merely opposing the Government because that is their function.  As Deputy Dillon said yesterday, that is the function of the Opposition, to oppose the Government whether the Government are right or wrong.</P>

      <P>As I see it, if the <Col N="269" /> unions tomorrow want to have a ninth round, they can have it and if they want to have strike action to get it, they can have strike action.  I am not aware of there being anything to prevent them from demanding a ninth round, nor am I aware of there being anything to prevent strike action.  All that I am aware of is that the Government are trying to control events that would appear to be getting out of hand because of international economic conditions and it is their duty to try to control events in the interests of the whole people.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the Government simply put it to the people.  It has been suggested that if before the first great war England had told Germany straight that she would fight, Germany would never have started the war.  In the same way, the Government are trying to make the people aware of the critical position facing the country. They may be, if you like, trying to stop the ninth round.  My own opinion is that if the unions started tomorrow looking for a ninth round, and took strike action to achieve it, there is nothing to stop them doing so; and, then, the Government would have to rescind their decision, if they have made a decision, in regard to State bodies.  These bodies would have to follow suit, and the Government would have to rescind any decision therefore. The initiative still lies with the unions, if they want to start a ninth round.</P>
      <P>The Government are simply trying to control events, as pointed out by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He painted a dark picture, a dark picture facing this country due to economic conditions in Europe and especially in Britain. He pointed out the many dangers that may lie ahead.  The Government are only taking some action to control events so as to meet that sort of situation.  But the initiative lies with the unions, if they like to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only too well aware that the Government deserve criticism to some extent from this point of view: they gave it to the Coalition Government in 1957.  That was referred to yesterday by Deputy J. A. Costello, a man of whom I have a very high opinion; he <Col N="270" /> referred to 1957, and said: &ldquo;You would like our help now, but you did not give it to us in 1957&rdquo;, as much as to say &ldquo;Now that we have the ball, we will let you have it.&rdquo;  It seems to me that it is in some sort of spirit of revenge for 1957 that this sort of alarm is being created now.  I think it is a false alarm.  I have no hesitation in supporting the Government because I am not thereby supporting any action that prevents the unions taking the initiative, as I said, to-morrow morning, if they like; and, if they do take action, I believe the Government will withdraw immediately any ban there is on State bodies, and let them follow suit.</P>
    <P>The Government are merely trying to control the situation.  We are not blind.  We do not have to be economists. I am not an economist.  I hope I have &ldquo;savvy&rdquo;, if that means commonsense; I have experience and I can decide for myself.  I do not have to get any hints from the Central Bank, or anyone else.  I can read of the serious situation in Northern Ireland, the serious situation in Britain.  I have read of Britain's defeat in regard to her effort to enter the Common Market and her efforts now to create some sort of front, which will certainly be no alternative solution as compared with full membership of the Common Market.  I am satisfied things will be blue in Britain.  We will be hit just as much.  I am satisfied the Government are doing their duty, and doing no more.</P>
    <P>Outside of this House, I have no employment at all so you can describe me as an unemployed man in the Dáil. A gentleman has means and property, and I have none.  I am the son of a labourer.  My father drove a horse and cart in Dublin city for 40 years.  I still live in the same house he lived in, in the same neighbourhood, among the same people, and I certainly would not be a party to preventing the labouring man from getting a fair crack of the whip.  That is why I have no hesitation in supporting the Government. I feel it is just a sort of understanding that the Opposition must all the time oppose.</P>

      <P>In the five-year period referred to in the Question, no customs duties were chargeable on imported footwear up to the 10th August, 1961.  Since that date duty is charged on imported footwear at the rate of 75 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, full rate, and 50 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> preferential rate, confined to goods of the United Kingdom and Canadian origin in each case.  In accordance with a general licence, which is effective whilst the restrictions on the importation of footwear under the Control of Imports Acts are in force, footwear may be imported without payment of the duties specified above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some difficulty from time to time in filling vacancies in house posts in local authority hospitals.  I cannot, however, accept the suggestion that the level of remuneration, which was substantially increased with effect from 1st April, 1961, is responsible for this.  Factors which may induce young doctors to seek employment elsewhere than in those hospitals are the fairly common desire among young graduates who have recently completed a long and <Col N="277" /> arduous course in our medical schools, to find an entirely new change of scene, to see other countries and to seek what they may regard as different experience elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that a further increase of remuneration at this stage would have the effect suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to learn that last year I introduced a scheme under which advanced medical students were employed in their vacation periods in local authority hospitals.  This scheme was not, of course, an attempt to replace or dilute house staffs in the hospitals, but was designed to attract the students to take up intern or house posts in those hospitals after graduation, and to give them useful experience during their university course.  The scheme was satisfactory&mdash;forty-six students were employed&mdash;and I propose to repeat it this year and subsequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that I have made it clear before that these regulations will be kept constantly under review.  As to the schedules to the regulations, which in effect set out the area of application of the &ldquo;built-up area speed limit&rdquo; of 30 miles per hour and the &ldquo;special speed limit&rdquo; of 40 miles per hour, these were based on recommendations made by local technical committees who reported to me through the local authorities.  I have asked the local authorities to have the working of these speed limits in their areas kept under annual review by the local technical committees, and it would be desirable if any representations of a local nature were made to these committees in the first instance; that arrangement worked very well in the past.  While I would like to give the speed limits a reasonable period to operate before making changes, I do not anticipate that there will be any delay in making changes if the need for them arises.</P>
      <P>Of course, anybody having representations of a more general nature to make is free to make them to me, and they will have my full consideration.</P>

Moreover, as land settlement activities embrace widely-varying qualities of land&mdash;ranging from undeveloped bog through inferior grazing and right up to prime arable&mdash;I feel that any attempt to express the outcome of land division generally in terms of expenditure per acre would prove quite unrealistic.  I would suggest that a more acceptable assessment of the financial implications of land settlement may be reflected in the provision and equipment of a standard holding for a migrant.  Perhaps, therefore, it would meet the Deputy's purposes to know that, for the financial year 1961-62, the approximate average cost, including administrative expenses, of creating such a holding&mdash;for that year, 39 acres &mdash;was £5,400 of which £1,150 is subsequently recovered.</P>

    <P>National schools are not State schools.  They are under deed of trust owned by local parties and managed by the duly appointed delegate of the communities which they serve.  The <Col N="293" /> principle of local rights and responsibility in the operation of these schools is inherent in this system.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the system of providing finance for maintenance and heating and cleaning of national schools is 60 years old and in view of the fact that Dublin workers are now paying income tax at very high rates under PAYE, would he modernise it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>All electricity consumed in Dún Cathal Brugha is supplied by Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failures in the electricity supply to NCOs' and Men's quarters are due to overloading of the system which is <Col N="299" /> designed for lighting only.  The charge for occupation of such quarters is 5/-per quarters per week, inclusive of furniture, light and water.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are in progress with Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais with a view to the occupants of the quarters becoming direct customers of An Bord.  It is contemplated that when this happens the occupants will be able to use the various electrical appliances mentioned by the Deputy. I am endeavouring to have the negotiations with An Bord completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Work in connection with the provision of electricity meters at the quarters commenced on 19th July, 1962.  The work, which was being done by civilian employees of An Cór Innealtóirí at an estimated cost of £772 (labour, £343; materials £429) had to be stopped on 1st August, 1962 because of the impossibility of getting electricians through the Employment Exchange.  At that time 96 meters had been provided, leaving a balance of 4 to be installed.</P>
    <P>The installation of the meters is only a small portion of the work. Segregation of the wiring and connection of the meters, which must also be done, constitute the greatest portion of it.</P>
    <P>In view of the shortage of civilian electricians arrangements are being made to have the work completed by Army electricians from military posts outside Dublin.  I cannot say at this stage when the work will be completed nor, pending its completion, when the meters will be in operation.</P>

    <Title>Government White Paper on Incomes and Output: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for the failure of its policies as confirmed by the terms of its own White Paper.  &mdash;Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take only a few minutes longer.  In my opinion, if the Government were defeated and there were an election and if, as a result, a Coalition Government were returned, they would have to do exactly the same thing the Government are now doing, but the great difference would be that whereas the present Government are composed of one Party and can decide without consulting others, a Coalition Government faced with such circumstances would find it very difficult to make a decision because in all such things, they would have to consult groups or individuals who want to play to the gallery and it would not, therefore, be in the interests of the country that there should be an election or change of Government at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fact of which the Opposition are very well aware.  I do not think anyone in the House seriously wants a change of Government.  That being the case, and the Opposition admitting in their own cute way that the Government are doing the right thing, Opposition Deputies should not vote against the Government because they will be voting against the Government on an issue which they hope they will <Col N="305" /> not win.  It amounts to that.  In my opinion, the Government's action here will go a long way to preserve the measure of employment that exists, to preserve the <i>status quo,</i> whereas if things get out of hand, there will be, as Dr. Browne pointed out, wholesale unemployment here.  The people who will get the worst of that are those on social benefits, those with small incomes.  They would be the worst hit by an increase in the cost of living. They would be the losers.</P>
    <P>I hold it is best that things should remain as they are.  It is best that the Government be given this chance of trying to control a very ugly situation. Let me say at once that I do not accept that this action of the Government stops the trade unions from demanding any increase they feel is necessary, but I would ask the Government to try to ensure that there is no increase in prices while they are trying to prevent any further increase in wages.  I expected an increase in prices after the eighth round and I would expect an increase after the ninth, 10th or any future rounds.  That is to be expected, but we already have had the effects of the eighth round increase.  All I am asking is that the Taoiseach should do something to ensure there are no further increases in prices.</P>
    <P>With that I shall resume my seat and go in and vote for the Government.  I shall make no apologies for it because if other Deputies had a sense of the rights of the matter, they would do the same thing and not be playing up this situation of crisis which they know damn well the Government are trying to beat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the interesting features of this debate has been the situation in which Fine Gael have found themselves.  For various tactical reasons I need not go into, the only possible line of approach here for Fine Gael was in the form of the motion they put down, that is, to attack the Government's general economic policy and allege that the White Paper was a panic measure which had to be issued because of the Government's mismanagement.  The significant thing <Col N="306" /> about this debate has been that the Leader of the Opposition made only what I think could fairly be described as a passing reference to the Government's economic policy and certainly did not mount any large-scale attack. The Leader of the Labour Party did make a reasoned case for the point of view he was putting forward, but he omitted a number of factors and, I think, misunderstood and misrepresented certain others.</P>
      <P>The factors that must be taken into account in any consideration of wage increases are what has happened in this country in the past in regard to wage increases and what has happened in regard to the failure of a Government at any particular time to deal with the situation where you had wages and prices chasing each other and productivity not catching up with them.  The important thing is that under this Government there have been two rounds of wage increases which represented a real increase in wages as distinct from catching up on the cost of living.  The sixth and seventh rounds were the only ones which represented a genuine advance in the standard of living of the workers.  The very interesting thing about them is that they caused virtually no increase in the cost of living.  The reason that happened was that they were within the increase in productivity of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>That is something I believe the workers have understood and appreciated. They know, as we know, that it is much better to maintain your present rate of wages and have a stable economic situation than to get a nominal increase in wages.  When I say &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, I mean those which, in effect, may disimprove their position. As we all know, the real sufferers in this type of situation are the people on fixed incomes, particularly pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government on this occasion have taken action to inform the public of the dangers which might arise.  They have taken action in time.  We have an example from the not so distant past of the failure of a Government to take action in time, allowing the situation to drift and then being <Col N="307" /> forced to take measures they did not want to take, which while remedying the financial situation, caused, at the same time, grave hardship and suffering to many thousands of our people.  This Government are determined, in so far as they can, to avoid that situation.  They are taking action now.  Deputy Sherwin said there was no crisis.  So also, I think, did Deputy Mullen and a number of other Deputies.  They are perfectly right.  There is no crisis.  The Government are taking action in time to prevent a crisis.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party referred to the &ldquo;mere 3,000 words&rdquo; of the White Paper and said it seemed very little in which to deal with such a major aspect of public policy.  I would suggest to him it is a good thing that we should keep official documents brief, provided they are clear. This White Paper was brief, but it was clear.  The trouble seems to me to have been that a number of people rushed into print in regard to it without understanding what was involved or, perhaps, without even having read it but relying on newspaper versions of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said we had documents one, two, three and four.  Other Deputies suggested the same thing&mdash; that the Taoiseach and the Ministers who have spoken have been back-pedalling or altering the meaning of the White Paper.  I have listened to most of this debate and I have not heard anybody specify in what way any of the speeches they referred to have altered in any way the meaning of the White Paper, which seems to me to be perfectly clearly worded. Nothing has been said that is not said in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy J. A. Costello, referred to the desirability of a national wages policy &mdash;something we all agree with.  But what exactly does a national wages policy mean?  Does it not mean you work out some formula whereby increases in wages and salaries will be related to the condition of the economy?  I would presume that, subject <Col N="308" /> to certain exceptions, it would in the main be related to an increase in productivity.  In any event, a national wages policy certainly visualises an agreed formula whereby increases will be fixed.</P>
    <P>If you have that, you then have to consider another point made by Deputy Costello in regard to civil servants.  He talked about the introduction of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  He said what was proposed in the White Paper was an interference with or a suspension of that machinery.  If you have an agreed wages policy, the formula involved must surely visualise that in certain circumstances, if the economy is not doing very well, there will be no increases in wages when looked for? That would certainly involve some kind of interference with the conciliation and arbitration machinery. Otherwise, there is no point in talking about a wages policy.  You are back to where you started with a free-for-all, which is admitted by all sides not to be in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience&mdash; and this has been confirmed by Deputy Mullen in his speech here&mdash;that in recent months a number of trade union officials have been pressed by some of their members to put forward claims for increases in wages.  These trade union officials have persuaded their members not to put these claims forward.  I suggest that was done because these officials knew it was not in the interest of their members that they should push wages too high&mdash;far ahead of productivity.  They knew that in the long run their members would lose if that were done.  That is all the Government are telling us in this White Paper.  They are trying to put across to the people that if you push too far and too fast with wages, it is the wage-earner who will lose more than anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had wild statements which implied that a standstill order was being brought in. In actual fact, what the White Paper does is to set out certain reasons which nobody has tried to controvert except, perhaps, Deputy Corish who did make certain observations on the economic arguments involved, but apart from him, I do not think anybody else did so.  It sets out those arguments to show why wages should not be ahead of productivity and, as a logical conclusion, it says that the Government are not going to take the lead in starting a new round of wage increases which would lead people in other employment to feel justified in claiming wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of it is such that it does not preclude, for instance, people who have not yet got the benefit of the eighth round from having their wages adjusted, nor people who in the interval find they are doing more difficult or more onerous kinds of work from being compensated for it. I should like to ask the Leader of the Labour Party when replying, to answer <Col N="310" /> this question: would he say, yes or no, are the Labour Party in favour of another round of wage increases at this time?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's main objection to the White Paper, I think, was that it proposed to hold wages steady but not profits.  That is a very attractive argument which appeals to one's sense of justice and fair play but let us examine it a little further.  Is not the position as regards industrial profits&mdash; which is what we are discussing here, I think&mdash;in this country such that every business has found that its margin of profit per unit has had to be cut down because of increasing competition and that, in fact, increases in profits may be achieved virtually only by increases in efficiency and productivity?  If that is so, I suggest the economic system itself provides the same check on profits as it sought to apply to wages.</P>
    <P>The Government have been accused of singling out the public service to hold down wages.  What would be the position if the Government did not do that and another round of wage increases started?  Would we not have Deputies and many others accusing the Government of failing to do their duty because they were giving the lead in starting another round of wage increases which would do the workers harm?  The Government have also been accused of failing to consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before issuing the White Paper.  If they had done so, we should have been told here that the Government were failing to govern and trying to saddle other parties with their own responsibilities.  The Government have carried out their responsibilities and I do not think it would be fair to the ICTU or anybody else for the Government to say: &ldquo;We have consulted this person or that person.&rdquo;  This is a decision the Government must make and stand over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made the kind of speech I thought Deputy Dillon would make.  He attacked the Government's general economic policy.  I want to join issue with him on one or two points, one being his reference to the cost of living as having increased sharply over the past six years.  If you <Col N="311" /> examine the figures, you find that the increase, in the main, occurred only in the past 12 or 18 months.  Prior to that, there was virtually no change in the cost of living.  That is of great significance because there had been two wage rounds which did not cause an increase in the cost of living. Obviously, those two wage rounds were worth more to the workers and salary earners than any other wage rounds we have had.  That is the situation Fianna Fáil want to see. Fianna Fáil want to see the economy expanding and the wage and salary earners sharing in the increased benefit to the economy.  Nobody was more pleased than Fianna Fáil to see the workers getting these increases without damage to the economy, in which case they did a real benefit.  We want to see that continue and that is why this White Paper has been issued, to ensure that in future the workers will be able to get these genuine increases and not nominal increases which do more harm than good to the workers themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said there were more people in employment in 1956 than now.  I think he meant 1955 because former members of the Coalition Government always like to pick 1955 as their reference year for reasons which they have never explained.  I think we need no explanation: the reason is pretty obvious.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in dealing with this question.  If you are to relate wages to productivity, how do we deal with people whose productivity cannot be measured?  And there are many people like that.</P>

      <P>I suggest that one reasonable way would be to relate wages to the overall average increase of productivity in the economy as a <Col N="312" /> whole.  This can be done and everybody can benefit from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, I fear, is completely out of date as regards the basis on which wage increases have been sought.  He said that increases were sought on the basis of an increase in the cost of living or deterioration in the condition of workers.  In fact, the grounds for application for wage increases for the past three rounds have been that the workers were entitled to an increase in the standard of living, that the economy as a whole had improved and they were entitled to share in that.  Perfectly legitimate grounds, but the grounds were not that the cost of living had increased or that there had been a deterioration in the conditions of the workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also tried to argue that the Government had been talking about the tremendous success of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> but that this White Paper gave the lie to that claim.  It seems to me that he missed the whole point.  It is because of the very success of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that we have been able to have these genuine increases in real wages in recent years.  It is because we want to be sure that that continues, because we are confident that the economy, properly handled, will continue to expand and the workers will be entitled to share in the increase, and it is because we want to ensure that they will get that benefit, that we are endeavouring to point out to the public, to the workers, and the country as a whole, the danger of pushing too fast and that in the long run, the workers can get a lot more by having steady wages with steady prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, of course, as was to be expected, also offered us socialism as the panacea for all our ills.  So far as this debate is concerned, I should like to point out that socialist countries have had this problem with which we are dealing in the White Paper as well as capitalist countries. It is an economic problem and has nothing to do with the political or social position in the country.  It is a plain elementary economic fact that you have to work for what you get <Col N="313" /> and if you take more than you actually earn, you can end up in bankruptcy. It is as simple as that.</P>

That is largely true but I will say that there are still large sectors of our economy in which increases in productivity could be got solely by the efforts of the workers. However, I am taking, by and large&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing with an economic fact.  If management is not doing its duty in increasing earnings, that is one point.  You cannot deal with that by increasing the workers' wages.  For that reason, I am suggesting that even if it is true that increases in productivity depend to a large extent on management, that point is not relevant to this discussion because, as I say, you cannot remedy that point by increasing wages.  As I see it, this situation is one which calls for a certain amount of discipline on the part of our people.  We know that we will have to increase our industrial exports or we will get nowhere.  We can increase them only if we are competitive. What is required is a sense of discipline and of teamwork, not only on the part of the workers and the management, but on the part of politicians.  The country's interests require us to exercise a certain amount of discipline and restraint and if we do this, the whole country stands to benefit and if not, the whole country, but particularly the workers, stand to lose.</P>

      <P>As I said before to-day, I have never been accused of being other than brief.

From 10.30 a.m. to-day, I waited until just before Questions, when Deputy Sherwin was talking and it was evident I could not get in until after Questions.  Then I left the House &mdash;the only time I left the House.

However, I have ben informed that the health inspectors of the Dublin Health Authority, of which I am a member, were notified this morning that the increase was granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking at it in a different way because it took away the main opposition I had to the Government.  I read this morning in the <i>Irish Times</i> that &ldquo;Lemass&rdquo; offers to meet employers and unions on wages and will discuss any practical alternative to the White Paper.  I would not say that I have sufficient analytical powers to know what is a practical alternative but I will astonish the House when I say that the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave this morning and made yesterday by Deputy Corish appeals to me, that is, a conference of employers and employees, such as was so successful over 20 years ago when the Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce and which negotiated the first agreed increase during the war years.  Great hardship was prevented to the building community in Dublin by the setting up of the Dublin Area Joint Council, of which I was a member representing employers.  The sooner a commission is set up to deal with wages, the better, if it is not that Dublin Area Joint Council, a similar council to it. The first opportunity I get, whether by motion or otherwise, I will put forward the suggestion that the ninth round be immediately entertained.</P>
      <P>I have not been impressed by all the statistics that have been adduced. It must be understood that the amount of money the Government have expended in grants for the erection of factories would in some degree offset the figures we heard so much about yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne used the word &ldquo;incentive&rdquo;. I do not think that word is agreeable to the representatives of the trade unions, unless there is a change of policy.  Deputy Dr. Browne gave figures in regard to wages.  May I suggest to Deputy Dr. Browne that 36 years ago in Dublin a craftsman had <Col N="318" /> less than 80/- a week and if he were staying in digs, he would pay from 27/- to 30/-, that is, more than one-third of his wages.  In the States at the same time, a man in the same craft would be earning 77 dollars a week and would be paying less than one-sixth on his digs.  These comparisons are odious.  When coming into this House, I often say: &ldquo;Will I say a few prayers that I will not hear too much about 1956 and 1957?&rdquo; I mention that because a Deputy today very sensibly said that we should forget the mistakes of others and proceed.  In 1847, there was a Famine in this country.  I never hear anyone saying anything about that.  The amount of time wasted in this House in attributing blame and seeking plaudits amazes me.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, speaking in the wonderful way that he has, with beautiful oratory, gesticulations, finger-pointing, paid such wonderful tributes to Labour and to the representatives of Congress that I believe that if the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave this morning is implemented, the ills of the Government and of the working classes will be taken care of impartially.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court have done a great deal of good.  I am accepting the fact that decisions taken by the Labour Court or in course of being made are not in any way affected by paragraph 21 of the White Paper.  I accept the view expressed in the <i>Irish Times</i> leader that the Taoiseach is not using the axe.  Maybe he has dropped the axe and does not believe it is a good thing.  I do not know.  If there were any suggestion of a wage-freeze or a standstill order and if it meant an election to-morrow, as stated by Deputy Dunne yesterday, I would vote against it.</P>
    <P>The only speaker to-day who said he did not like to delve into political discussion was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and he was the only one who seemed to bring out that antagonism that should never exist in here.  Even if I only went to Synge Street, I still believe that my interpretation of paragraph 21 was correct and, if it was correct, I would have undoubtedly to oppose the <Col N="319" /> people who were inaugurating it, irrespective of consequences.</P>
    <P>I believe that the sooner the Government subsidise to the extent of £1 million or £2 million&mdash;I do not mind what it is&mdash;the agricultural labourers, the sooner we will curtail emigration.  If it is decided to build a church in some townland, a Dublin firm or a Cork firm or a Limerick firm go to area and must pay the standard rate of wages.  What is the agricultural labourer getting?</P>

      <P>I have listened for the past two days to the members on the Front Bench of the Government trying to defend this White Paper.  I have listened to them perform oratorical gymnastics of all kinds in order to explain away this kind of document which is nothing more or less than a positive proposition to bring about a standstill order in wages and salaries. It is, in my opinion, one of the most despicable anti-workingclass pieces of legislation ever to come into this House.  We could well understand a standstill order during an emergency when every section of the community would be obliged to accept certain disciplines, but that this kind of thing should be attempted in peacetime is completely unjustifiable.  It is no wonder that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions reacted so violently against this proposition.  To suggest that it is anything other than a standstill on wages and salaries is to try to cod the people.  The worker who interprets this document knows it is nothing less than a standstill order on his wages, and the worker who interprets it as anything less than that is a fool; and the trade union leader who asserts it is not a standstill on wages and salaries is, in my opinion, a fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant feature of this biased document is that the workers are being blamed for and saddled with the responsibility of the present predicament <Col N="320" /> in which the Government find themselves.  The Government seek to place the blame for our present economic difficulties at the feet of the workers of this country.  They allege they are not producing enough.  They allege wages have outstripped production and, because of that, the economy is in a state of imbalance.  At the same time, profits may go unbridled and there is no attempt of any kind to restrict prices.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication, to me at any rate, that one section of the community is being asked to make the supreme sacrifice.  The pause is being enforced on workers and salary earners: &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;, the Government are, in fact, saying to these categories of workers.  When a Government take up that kind of attitude, and even give a hint of an intention to impose a wages pause, that is a signal, a clear indication, to the Labour Court&mdash;not merely to employers and State and semi-State bodies, but to the Labour Court&mdash;to resist pay claims, irrespective of however just and legitimate those claims may be.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has got its instructions from the Taoiseach and, irrespective of however just and legitimate the claims coming before the Labour Court may be on behalf of these categories of workers, the answer will be a persistent and determined &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It would be a pity, it would be a great tragedy, if the Labour Court, which is supposed to be a fair and impartial tribunal for deciding wage claims and bringing harmony and co-operation into the industrial field, should be used as a mere tool by any political Party.  If the workers of this country lose confidence in and respect for the Labour Court, and if the attitude of that court is to acquiesce in the dictates of any Government, then I suggest the outcome will be the law of the jungle; strikes will be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>The claims of many categories of workers, including those in State and semi-State bodies, are at present before the Labour Court for consideration.  I was pleased to hear the announcement by the Minister for Finance that the <Col N="321" /> award in relation to health inspectors was being conceded.  That is welcome news.  This category of workers, at any rate, has not been caught up in the mesh of this wage-freeze.</P>

It is loathsome to hear a member of our own House proclaim we all got here by deceiving the people and that we all known that is the only method of approaching the Irish electorate.</P>
      <P>I think it is revolting to hear a Deputy claim to come in here and flagrantly betray the confidences of friends whom he meets in the corridors and whom, he alleges, speak to him. I do not believe a word of his reported consversation; but, even if it were true, it is degrading that we should sit and rejoice at the betrayal of every decent standard associated with our public life by a buffoon, who is not ashamed to drag the reputation of Oireachtas Éireann through the mud for the edification of every scandalmonger in the world who wants to deride us.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  I withdraw the word: an utterly irresponsible person, who would scandalize and slander our institutions for the edification of sensationalists who rejoice to hear ill of them.  It is bad enough to <Col N="322" /> read that kind of slime in the publications of our traditional enemies without having it smathered all over us by our colleagues.  To me, perhaps the most revolting aspect of that transaction was that the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party seemed to rejoice in the performance.  They ought to hang their heads for shame at their own reaction, and they ought to hang their heads for shame for the support on which they depend for their survival.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Colley in this debate, and I hope I do not compromise his public image if I say that I find it hard to believe that his contributions are not made in sincerity and with the best information at his disposal.  I believe Deputy Colley is persuaded that there has been no dramatic rise in the cost of living in this country, but he is sufficiently astute in such matters to appreciate the significance of the actual increase from 135 to 157 that has taken place in the cost of living of our people in the past five years.</P>
      <P>Now, it is illusory to assume that that has no significance in the lives of ordinary people, whether they live on the land or whether they are wage earners.  It certainly has, and it certainly does create very material difficulties for people with large families, living on modest incomes.  I think it is improvident, to say the least of it, for a responsible and careful Deputy, such as I take Deputy Colley to be, to suffer himself to be persuaded that the known facts are not true.</P>

I am bound to say also I appreciate, from the source from which it came, the fact that Deputy Colley, on examining the arguments put forward, said he was obliged to confess that the argument from the <Col N="323" /> Opposition that this White Paper's fundamental defect was that it made no adequate proposal for equality of sacrifice was an argument he found hard to answer.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for Deputy Booth to pontificate from his seat on what is and what is not true. The evidence of what we have heard throughout the country is that that is what the people feel and I think the people are right in that.  I want to remind the House that not only does that defect in these proposals render these proposals bad but it has done an irremediable injury to the spirit of co-operation that was growing and that ought to exist in the presence of a national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once that damage is done, it is extremely difficult to repair it.  Confidence is an elusive thing.  It does not matter whether it is confidence in the currency or confidence in a national effort.  It is one of those things most easily shaken but desperately difficult to restore.  If the people once get it into their heads that this is a tentative return to the wage-freezing policy of 1947, we are faced with a protracted industrial war and I warn this House <Col N="324" /> that that would be a disaster for the social and economic life of this country.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that I am an employer of labour and have been all my life.  I dealt with trade unions in my personal capacity and as a Minister of State and I have stated quite openly and frankly what my experience of them has been, tough as it is their duty to be in the defence of their members' interests, but, whether as a Minister or as an employer, I found the trade unions reasonable, honourable and responsible.  That is not to say that there is no employer or no trade unionist in this country who does not from time to time kick over the traces and go cracked.  You will find them on the right and you will find them on the left.  However, in the main, we are entitled to claim not only for the edification of our own people but of the world that there is no country in the world today with a more responsible trade union organisation and unless we are able to say that, we can throw our hats at any prospect of foreign investment in Irish industry.  I say that as an employer of 40 years' experience and as a politician of 30 years' standing and I would not hesitate to say it abroad to people who asked my opinion as to what the prospects were in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us not act in this House in a way calculated to encourage the extremists who want to shake that tradition, who want to say to a responsible trade union movement: &ldquo;You are not tough enough.&rdquo;  Let us not create a situation by anything we do in this House which puts the responsible trade union leaders in the position that if they do not promote industrial strife, they lose the confidence of their members.  Let us rather say that responsible trade union leadership in this country can get results not only from employers but from the Government and from the Oireachtas and the only thing that will consolidate resistance is irresponsibility either on the employers' side or on the trade unions' side.  What we are doing with this kind of codology is putting up a challenge to the trade union movement which need never have been made <Col N="325" /> and manoeuvring them into the position of either declaring war <i>á</i><i>l'outrance</i> or of being derided by the troublemakers on their left, as some of us have troublemakers on our right, who say: &ldquo;Unless you fight and fight and fight, you are letting down our side.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the real evil at the root of this White Paper.  What a different situation we would have here to-day if employers and the trade unions had been called in and the Taoiseach had put his cards on the table or even sent for me as Leader of my Party and the Leader of the Labour Party and said: &ldquo;There is my problem.  I am giving you the information.  If you do not want to express a view or if you are not prepared to help, there will be no hard feelings.  We shall debate it in the Dáil.&rdquo;  If we had sent for the trade unions and said: &ldquo;Here is a problem: increased consumption out of proportion to our available resources,&rdquo; I would imagine the trade unions would say, as I would say: &ldquo;If you say we are in a crisis, if increased consumption is the problem, must we not look at every aspect of consumption?  Must we not look at wages, salaries, profits, dividends, bank credit, hire purchase, each and every source of excessive consumption so that if we are to go to the people to ask them to exercise restraint in wage negotiations, we can say to them that we are going to ask for the same restraint from the bankers, from powerful and wealthy corporations. We are going to ask for the same restraint from those who want to engage in hire-purchase contracts by anticipating their own incomes.  We are going to ask for the same restraint from anybody who contemplates unnecessary borrowing from banks.  We are going to say to the banks they can provide abundant credit for productive enterprises of any kind but that they should consider well any proposal for borrowing which involves consumption for consumption's sake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How different the atmosphere of this House would be today if that had been the approach.  Some people say: &ldquo;Why did you not all recognise that without being told?&rdquo; I shall tell you: because in last December we were, as we <Col N="326" /> thought, on the threshold of vital negotiations in Brussels and in those circumstances, all of us were holding our fire, trying to put the best face on everything without for a moment seeking to deceive objective external observers but not over-painting any economic problems that we felt were abroad.  Therefore, I very tentatively directed the attention of the Government to the fact that there was appearing in the first nine months of the year a very serious trade gap, that external assets and joint stock banks did not seem to be moving in the same direction, that unemployment seemed to be rising, that there were certain economic indicators appearing which I thought gave rise to anxiety, and here is what the Taoiseach said in public in reply to the debate at column 1469, Volume 198, of the Official Report of 13th December, 1962:</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed concern about the adverse trade balance.  He talked about the gap that exists between the value of our visible imports and the value of our invisible exports.  It is true that the over-all picture at the end of this year, when it will be possible to determine it in February or March next year, will probably show some deficit on our external payments but, in so far as that deficit has not involved, as the Deputy found out, any diminution of our external reserves, it is not a matter of great concern.  Our economy is in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>That is the last official declaration we have had from the head of the Government as to what the situation is.</P>
    <P>The next we have is the White Paper. That is the conduct of a panicstricken man and the reason he is in a panic is that his own Government are divided. He has led them solidly in the directition of EEC.  That has blown up under his feet and some of his own colleagues are now saying: &ldquo;Yah, I told you so.&rdquo;  His reaction to that situation is that he is now going to act the strong man, the bull in the china shop.  The danger of acting the strong man, of throwing your weight about, of being the bull in the china shop is that it <Col N="327" /> can have just the same reaction inside our own society as it has had on the continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the breakdown of the Brussels negotiations the bull in the china shop tactics have shaken the confidence of the nations of Europe in the ability of the members of EEC to integrate the performance of one nation with another without federation.  That is the great injury.  It is not the postponement of the entry of Great Britain, of Ireland or Denmark or any of the other countries.  The great injury is the shaking of the confidence of the smaller nations in the whole possibility of a group of nations coming together without federation and working together in the common interest.  The little countries are beginning to ask if it was all an illusion.  The danger here is that this bull in the china shop attitude will call up the 1947 ghosts of a wage freeze.  That is what it is doing.</P>
    <P>You may tell them that this is not what the Government mean.  In all conscience I cannot tell them that.  I honestly believe that if Fianna Fáil had a Parliamentary majority in this House that is what we would have got. I believe that is what the Taoiseach believes in.  I believe he thinks that, if he had the power to do it, that is the way to run the country and he shares that illusion with another man in Europe who thinks he is great but whose greatest illusion is that belief, because he is great about the proximate things but is neglecting the things that really matter.</P>
    <P>What matter in Ireland is that we should all agree that our society is too small to contain two nations.  I intervened here today to claim the right of Deputy Dr. Browne to speak for an hour and a half.  We are almost unique in Dáil Éireann of all the nations in the world in having protected the right of unlimited debate although we may be sometimes tempted to throw away a great right like that in vengeance against somebody whose sentiments we abhor.  I defended Dr. Browne's right to speech here although I loathe what he had to say and I loathe his whole devious attitude and <Col N="328" /> his devious attempt to prove that in this, our country, we segregrate the rich from the poor.  I loathe the whole purpose of his argument that Deputies on all sides of this House are traitors to the fundamental tenets of the Christian faith that he and we share. If he believes that is a feature of our society today I want to tell him that we do not believe it.</P>
    <P>I hope our motion passes because if it does the Government must go. Our object in putting down the motion was to put out the Government because we believe that to be the only effective solution to the situation into which they have led us.  If our motion does not pass we will vote for the Labour motion or any other motion that will put the Government out. That is our purpose and that is the right solution to the present situation. Let there be no illusion about that. Some people have said that we did not concentrate sufficiently on the White Paper but that is only a very small portion of the darkness into which Fianna Fáil led us from the day they announced that they claimed the right to go it alone.</P>
    <P>People tell us that we should not dwell on the past.  We cannot forget the past and we should not forget the past.  We have learned lessons from our experiences of the past.  I would agree that we should try to forgive the past but this is not the first time that Fianna Fáil have gone it alone. They went it alone into a civil war; they went it alone into an economic war and now they want to go it alone into a war of industrial disputes.  We did not go with them in the last two wars and we will not go with them in this one.  The first two wars into which Fianna Fáil went alone did damage to this country from which it has not yet recovered.</P>
    <P>We have papered up the cracks of the civil war and we have tried to exchange mutual forgiveness for it.  I recognise that some people still feel that there may be nothing to forgive on either side but I am glad that we have tried to exchange mutual forgiveness. However, I think it is very hard to forgive the more recent outrage, the economic war.  Let us not forget that <Col N="329" /> there are people poor in this country who never knew poverty before because of that economic war.  Do not let us go into a third war designed to split our people into new fragments. We do not intend to do that and we intend to take the proper Parliamentary steps open to us to prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>If the only way to do that is to bring about the downfall of the Government and to have a general election, then that must be done.  What politician likes a general election?  It is hard, arduous, tedious, an immense strain on every one of us.  Nobody likes a general election.  Nobody likes the hustings; nobody likes the tremendous strain and anxiety of the fight. But it is one thing not to like it and another thing to be afraid.  No man can be brave until he has first been afraid.  No one will accuse Deputy Sherwin of an excess of courage, whatever about the preliminary qualification. I do not want a general election.  Nobody wants it but I am prepared for it if it is the only way to get Fianna Fáil out of office.  It is the only constitutional way at our disposal to shift them and to give our people a chance to substitute a different Government.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Taoiseach to define what the White Paper means. We have had a surfeit of definitions since it was published, not including the Sunday definition unprecedented in this country's history.  But does anyone yet know what the Taoiseach and his colleagues really want?  I do not, but I have a shrewd suspicion of what they would like to have.</P>
    <P>I know, as Deputy John A. Costello so eloquently pointed out yesterday, the perennial danger to Governments who get advice from impeccable sources, from economists who think they know it all.  My God, have we not had enough experience in this country of the bureaucrats who despise our feeble efforts and long for the chance to come down into the arena to show us how it all should be done but who, having come down from their ivory tower, are torn to pieces and scattered to the four winds because <Col N="330" /> they did not even know the first elements of politics&mdash;people who left their scientific libraries and laboratories believing they knew all the answers but completely unconscious of the two-thirds of every iceberg that floats below the tide.</P>
    <P>We are the people chosen by the electorate of this country to run this country and it is here from time to time that we put into practice the right advice, the practical advice, the advice calculated to get the best results without the danger of getting confusion and chaos.  It is only when we lose our heads and our confidence that we come in here, tripping, with White Papers written in the ivory towers.  It is only when we lose our heads that we suffer these documents to create a situation calculated to shatter the foundations on which a stable society stands, and that is the consideration that ought to actuate us here, so that no matter how much we differ about minor events, about the fundamentals, Deputy Dr. Browne notwithstanding, we are all agreed.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that while we are engaged in this campaign of promoting domestic chaos, the nations of Europe are gathering together in consultation to meet the consequences of the European Economic Community collapse.  I refer to the EFTA conference, and I see Finland, who is not a member, represented there by its observers.  There is only one country in Europe which is not represented at such consultations and that is Ireland.  We are here considering how best to tear asunder the fabric of our society so that when the time comes to take our place in the competitive world of tomorrow we will be all at sixes and sevens, bemused by mutual distrust, getting ready to hate one another at a time when we should be bound together in mutual trust in the common cause of our common country.</P>
    <P>There is none in this country&mdash;and I am as old a practitioner as any of them&mdash;who would be less anxious for a general election, and if I thought exhortation would achieve our purpose I would be happy to see it done in that <Col N="331" /> manner, but because I am convinced that the only means of getting us on to the right road now is a change of Government, I shall vote for our motion and I shall vote for the Labour Party motion and for any other motion that will bring down Fianna Fáil and give our people the right at the hustings to choose a new Government who will concentrate on the task of uniting our people for the good of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach came into this discussion yesterday in the characteristic role of a knight of old, sword flashing, denouncing all and sundry who did not happen to see the merits of his White Paper.  The Fine Gael amendment to it was characterrised by him as dishonest.  We were told the Labour Party amendment would not achieve either of the two objectives which the motion sought to achieve&mdash;to preserve the normal negotiating machinery and to preserve co-operation and harmony in industrial matters.  It is typical of the Taoiseach, I suppose, that the only motion he would be pleased with would be one that he wrote himself, and I should imagine that unless the House were prepared to pass a motion saying that the Dáil approved of everything the Taoiseach ever did or will do hereafter, any other motion would be received with suspicion by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, whether he likes it or not, has come to the stage where he must realise he has got a simple passion which takes the form of believing that everything he thinks is right and everything he does is right.  He comes into the House this week, as he did last week, as he did last year and every year during the past 30 years, telling us this is the obvious course to take and that if we question that we do so because we do not understand, that we must leave these matters of higher economics to the Taoiseach and to Deputy Martin Corry and that between the two of them, from opposite directions, we are bound to get the progress which will take us to unprecedented wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not vote for this White Paper <Col N="332" /> because I do not believe in what the Taoiseach says and because I do not believe there is any set of circumstances which would justify the introduction of the White Paper at this time.  I can see no set of circumstances indicated by any Minister to suggest that this was justified.  It is only a few weeks ago since we had the Tánaiste at a dinner, which I do not begrudge him, getting into the poetic vein of which he was master in yester years and saying that in a very short time he would be leaving the chilly climate of the Celtic twilight and entering into the sunny fields of Europe where he would be installed in all his glory. There was not a worry on the Tánaiste that night or manifest in the speeches of other Government supporters.</P>
    <P>But all of a sudden, overnight, we get this White Paper without anybody saying it was on the way or that discussions were taking place or that there were any circumstances to justify it.  I would have thought that up to a week ago the Government's case was: &ldquo;We are doing things excellently; progress is continuing and all the economic indications are favourable to continued progress.&rdquo;  Did somebody overnight descend on the Government and give them this wage freeze idea so that a White Paper on a pay pause became necessary?  Look at the situation.  This day week we had Trade Union Congress and the employers' organisations all preparing for continued consultations to examine the basic and complex problems which affect industrial relations, production and, of course, future productivity.  All that situation has now being swept aside and the Government, by this White Paper, have substituted total chaos and criticism for what last week was a peaceful and relatively halcyon scene in so far as industrial co-operation is concerned.</P>
    <P>My main charge against the Government is that they have, without any economic justification whatever, acted inaptly, acted unfairly and that they have created anxiety and unnecessary worry at a time when keenness, co-operation and collaboration had much to commend them.  The Government have changed a peaceful scene to a scene in which strife is now holding <Col N="333" /> the upper hand and in which all the evidences are that the situation may get worse unless the Government are big enough now to recognise that they have acted unwisely, that they have acted on advice which was not basically correct and unless they have the wisdom to correct the course of action on which, from the White Paper, they appear to have embarked.  I see nothing in the present situation which demands such heavyweight and panicky action by the Government.</P>
    <P>Neither the White Paper itself, nor last Sunday's special <i>pronunciamento</i> by the Taoiseach, nor his speech yesterday has in any way explained the necessity for issuing a White Paper in these panicky terms.  Of course, the White Paper itself is manifestly unfair. It is an unbalanced White Paper in that it is deliberately biased against the worker.  It is not a White Paper which is the product of surveying a scene, watching the points in conflict, setting down the case for and against and forming, as far as you an do so, an impartial, honest, independent opinion.</P>
    <P>There is practically no reference to profits in the White Paper and practically no reference to prices.  The whole emphasis is against the ordinary working people.  I have come to the conclusion that this was not an ordinary White Paper.  This White Paper was ordered by the Government.  It was written to specifications provided by the Government.  It had to be in accordance with the instructions which the Government gave for its preparation. In other words, I believe this White Paper was cooked to serve the palate of the Government.  That is why we have a White Paper that has pleased nobody except the Government, and it pleased them only because they probably feel that it is better in a storm of this kind to stand together rather than to try to withstand adversities in single file.</P>
    <P>No attempt whatever has been made in the White Paper to examine the background of the wage increases in recent years.  The main object appeared to be to get out a White Paper whatever you do and to get all the statistics you can lay hold of to show that in recent <Col N="334" /> years the workers have got a certain increase in wages and that they must get no more and that steps will be taken to ensure that they do not.  No attempt has been made to examine the background of the wage and salary increases which took place in 1961 and 1962.</P>
    <P>This ought to be put on record in this House in the interests of the trade unions.  In 1956 and 1957, the unions, bearing in mind the economic circumstances of the time, even though the food subsidies had been cut in the 1957 Budget, nevertheless contented themselves to accept a wage increase of 10/-per week.  In 1959, the unions sought to close the gap which was opening and broadening between wages and prices on the 1939 level.  It was not until 1960 that the trade unions were able to recover for their members the prewar purchasing power of their wages. That fact was admitted not only by members of the Government but in joint memoranda issued by the Trade Union Congress and the Employers' Federation.  At all events, there can be no question that reference to the statistics and publications of the period will show that it was only in 1960 that the purchasing power of the workers' wages had been recovered.</P>
    <P>In 1961, the trade unions sought increases in real wage standards. Against what did they seek this? Against the fact that since 1958 the gross national product had increased by 16 per cent, exports had risen by one-third in the two previous years and company profits had increased by over 50 per cent.  Was it unreasonable in these circumstances that the unions should seek an increase in real wages? The result of the negotiations&mdash;what has come to be described as the eighth round wage increase&mdash;was to give the unions an increase of approximately eight per cent in real wages.  But when you remember the fact that the gross national product had increased by 16 per cent, that exports had gone up by one-third and company profits by over 50 per cent, nobody will say that the increase secured by the workers was in any way unreasonable or was an unfair burden on the nation's resources, particularly when <Col N="335" /> it is remembered that from 1939 until 1960, there was a gap to the disadvantage of the workers as far as wage rates were concerned.</P>
    <P>Was there anything special in wage rates going up in Ireland under the eighth round of wage increases in 1961 and 1962?  Wages had risen in Britain during the same period.  Wages had risen in the Six Counties during the same period.  Wages had risen in every one of the OEEC countries during the same period What had taken place in Ireland had taken place in many other countries and there was, in fact, no phenomenon as far as wage increases were concerned in Ireland during that period.  In other words, we moved as Europe had moved, as Britain had moved, as the Six Counties had moved.  In many cases, we moved with less speed than a number of these other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred this evening to the increase in the cost of living. He thought that the workers had caused that.  But what are the facts? The facts show that the increase in prices between August, 1961, and November, 1962&mdash;without going back to an earlier period&mdash;was four and a half per cent.  Only half of that was due to wage increases.  The other half was due to the action of the Government, particularly in respect of the increases imposed in the 1962 Budget on tobacco, beer, spirits and other commodities.  Even if you assume that prices increased here, as they did, by four and a half per cent between August, 1961, and November, 1962, the fact remains that prices increased also during that period in Britain, in the Six Counties and in Europe. Again, we are merely in step with the rest of the world&mdash;the part of the world with which we have the closest association.  We had no means of insulating ourselves against what was happening in these other countries.</P>
    <P>Where is the justification, therefore, for this pay pause White Paper to be found?  Is it to be found in imports, in exports or in our balance of trade? Let us see whether it can be found in any of these cases?  In 1962, the export of our manufactured goods increased by five per cent.  Our <Col N="336" /> imports in the same year increased by less than five per cent. and the imports for 1962 were less than for any year since 1957.  Although they increased by less than five per cent. half of that increase was in respect of capital goods such as machinery.</P>
    <P>Look at the other exports in 1962. It is true that there was a fall in cattle exports and wheat exports but the cattle population is still here and available for export this year or at some later date.  If you take imports, on the one hand, and exports, on the other, and balance the two, having regard to our invisible exports in the form of tourist traffic, dividends on foreign investments, emigrants' remittances and items of that kind, you find, according to the Central Bank, that our total deficit on our foreign account last year was only £12 million. Although the deficit appeared to be £100 million, without taking into consideration our invisible exports, when you examine the matter in detail, the position is that the deficit is only £12 million.  We find also that the banks' net external assets last year rose by £12 million so that, in fact, judged through the banks, there was no loss of foreign earnings and no loss of external assets.  In fact, the net foreign assets of the banks today are £27 million higher than they were in 1960.</P>
    <P>Do these figures provide any justification for a wage pause?  In the face of these facts and others, most of which have not been mentioned in the White Paper, is there any justification for imposing the wage pause when in fact we should be congratulating ourselves on the stability achieved and providing for its continuance by means of co-operation and understanding with all the elements involved?  Instead, the White Paper comes like a bolt from the blue.</P>
    <P>Although the Tánaiste has made two speeches since the issue of the White Paper, nobody has yet made any effort to say why it was not possible to consult the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about what was intended. Congress did not expect their agreement to be sought.  They did not expect the Government to say: &ldquo;We shall do nothing without your agreement&rdquo;. Congress would have been satisfied if <Col N="337" /> the Government had told them what the problem was and said they would like to discuss it with them, and said : &ldquo;We know you are doing this sort of thing every day of the week; we know you have wide, long and deep experience. We know you have a point of view to put which cannot be put by the Government without that specialised knowledge which trade unions have.&rdquo; There was no reason why the Government should not have said : &ldquo;Let us have a one-day or a two-day session and tell us what you think should be done.  Let us discuss all this, distil all this and see if we can get something in the long run which will meet the situation for all of us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Never in the past two days nor since the issue of the White Paper have we been given any satisfactory reason why Congress should not be consulted.  It would be clear to anybody with any savvy that the first thing that should have been done was to consult Congress and the employers' organisations and to gather and distil their views, even if in the long run the Government had to take a decision on their own without the other two bodies.  A vital mistake was made in saying: &ldquo;We do not want Congress; we do not want the employers' organisation.  We shall go ahead and have a death-or-glory ride now and a wage pause.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a mistake.  Congress had a point of view and they should have been allowed to make it.  No harm could have been done even if the Government disagreed with every view expressed.  There is something to be said for consulting people, especially if you want them to travel some portion of the road with you under conditions which will have to be shared.  The mistake the Government made was to rush into this thing at the last minute with a complete change in the attitude that everything in the garden was lovely and to confront the country with their White Paper, without a single economic index to support it and to give the country a panicky, heavyweight wage pause which has no counterpart in any other democracy in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Would it have caused any great assault on the economic fabric of the <Col N="338" /> State if the White Paper were delayed for a few days while important bodies were consulted?  I do not think it would.  Nobody on the Government side thought it would but, of course, the mistake has been made now and whether &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; is right or wrong, everybody has to say that &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; was right. We are given no reason but &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; does everything right and there has to be a gang-up in support of a line of policy which I think was a most mischievous line for the Government to pursue.</P>
    <P>I believe that, properly put to the Congress and the employers' organisation and when it is shown that this was not aimed at the workers alone, co-operation might have been got in the special circumstances confronting us in view of the debacle which has been reached in EEC circles in Europe. There was some reason for the Government putting their cards clearly on the table.  The Government are not an injured innocent in this matter.  The country still remembers the war-time wage-freeze and what was threatened in 1947, another wage-freeze.  The country knows also that in the Department of Industry and Commerce there is a Bill, drafted by the Taoiseach, purporting to freeze wages and to make it an offence punishable by very heavy fines if wage increases were granted, once the Bill had been passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If you have to your credit&mdash;or discredit, as I prefer to term it&mdash;a war-time wage-freeze, a threat of a 1947 wage-freeze and a Bill drafted by no less a person than the Taoiseach himself, with that record, I should think ordinary prudence and sagacity would suggest that you would go to these outside organisations and say: &ldquo;Forget about the past.  These things happen in certain circumstances and the Irish people are frequently forgiving and quite willing to let bygones be bygones. Here is the new situation and here is what we are thinking of doing about it. Here is the problem that has to be faced.&rdquo;  You could then put it to Congress and to the employers' organisations that something should be done to meet the situation the Government had in mind.  If they disagreed, the Government were still free to go <Col N="339" /> any way they liked but the Government put themselves in the wrong by refusing to consult with anybody except the outdated economists who give us figures of that kind.  If this country were to rely on the prophecies made by economists over the past 30 years, they would be an outlawed occupation, so many of the prophecies have been unfulfilled.</P>
    <P>I believe from my discussions with the Congress that it wanted to help, and I believe that the Congress still want to help in any action where they can be convinced that the need for a prudent approach to the wages issue is something that begets their understanding and support.  After all, the Congress are on record as saying in their statement :</P>
    <P>We are in favour of an expanding economy since only by this means can workers' living standards be raised.  Because this is our objective we are naturally in favour of increased production and raising productivity which in fact, go hand in hand, but since it is accepted that increasing the level of productivity is a management responsibility workers cannot be criticised if the rise in productivity lags as it did last year. While management, in general, can be criticised for its lack of initiative particularly in respect of export markets it must be recognised that in the conditions of our economy a real drive towards economic development must come from the Government by the planned use of all our resources.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Congress which I do not think is out of step with any of the views expressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I think the Congress are right in their declaration, that the main responsibility for ensuring progress and development in the industrial and agricultural field lies on the Government. But I believe, notwithstanding all the goodwill that the Government can mobilise from their own resources, they are entitled to expect and to receive on an agreed policy the co-operation and understanding of other vast and valuable agencies which have a contribution <Col N="340" /> to make.  The Government should get their goodwill by approaching them and not by merely handing out to them a decision and saying: &ldquo;That is what we are going to do; you can take it or leave it, whichever you like.&rdquo; The expansion of production and productivity leading to full employment and rising living standards can be got in the circumstances here and that will come all the quicker, the more those who are responsible for the physical operation of it, whether on the factory floor, at the directors' table, or in the trade union organisations which cater for those in between, are consulted and given their share of the responsibility to make their contribution.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their issued statement make this comment:</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognises the importance of the need to obtain full employment with rising standards by achieving the highest possible rate of economic expansion with reasonable price stability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>with reasonable price stability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and without too seriously upsetting the equilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Surely there is evidence of a desire to co-operate and surely this goodwill and enthusiasm are not to be blunted or spurned merely because the Government want to appear as the omnipotent controller of national affairs?  I believe that the co-operation of the Congress can be got and that others can be found as well to co-operate on an agreed policy which will give results, which will raise living standards and open up a better and fuller life for our people.</P>
    <P>I would make this suggestion to the Taoiseach, I think he should pull out his White Paper entirely.  We have had two days' discussion on it and there has been no justification whatever for issuing it.  The country is not as bad as they make out it is.  He should pull out the White Paper and see the Congress and the employers' organisation and get a conference on that basis.  You cannot operate this paper by Government action alone.  I <Col N="341" /> strongly advise him to seek the round table instead of the jackboot as the best method of settling this whole problem.</P>

      <P>It is not possible, of course, to say, before actual production commences, that any industrial project is certain to reach fruition.  Of the projects before my Department and the Industrial Development Authority at present, it seems likely that some 30 industrial projects, with an estimated total employment potential ranging from 1,500 initially to 3,700 at the full development stage, will go into production this year.  The corresponding figures, at the present time, for 1964 are 15 projects with an estimated total employment potential of 2,000 to 6,500.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Question relates to dwelling for those eligible for housing under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>
      <P>(i)  It is a function of each housing authority to prepare building proposals from time to time to meet the needs of persons eligible for local authority housing.  A statement of such needs is not usually furnished to my Department unless in conjunction with specific housing proposals.</P>
      <P>The latest information available in my Department in regard to each of the cities is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Dublin:</i> According to the latest figures available there are slightly over 4,000 families on the Dublin Corporation's effective waiting list for rehousing, of which the Corporation anticipates that, having regard to such factors as the increasing rate of annual completion of new houses and decreases in the annual vacancy rate, 3,000 will be rehoused in the next two and a half years.</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Cork:</i> There were 1,106 eligible applicants on hands on 1st June, 1962.</P>
      <P>(c)  <i>Galway:</i> The most recent survey of unfit housing disclosed 162 unfit dwellings of which 84 were incapable of economic repair.  40 of the 84 dwellings were occupied by families of 1 or 2 persons.</P>
      <P>(d)  <i>Limerick:</i> In April, 1962 there were 1,175 applicants listed by the Corporation.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(ii)  No estimate of the ultimate cost of the further local authority dwellings to be provided in these cities has been drawn up.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Local Government the number of miles of trunk roads at present requiring to be reconstructed in order to make such roads suitable for modern traffic roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The mileage of main roads which require to be improved to comply with the appropriate engineering standards of construction is about 7,950.  Work on the improvement of main roads has been going on for many years and is continuing at an increasing pace with the aid of fullcost grants from the Road Fund.  At any time there are many such schemes, large or small, in progress all over the country, including schemes on major traffic routes.  At the same time many more schemes, some of them extensions of works already approved, other new projects, are before the Department, or the subject of correspondence or consultation with local authorities.  The cost of construction works on the major traffic routes varies very widely and depends on a number of factors including the value of property which must be acquired and the standard of construction appropriate.  For example, a dual-carriageway may be necessary on a particular route in the vicinity of a city where land and other property is expensive, while a single carriageway may be adequate on a section of the same road in a rural area where acquisition also is much cheaper.  Clearly there will be a marked difference between construction costs on the two sections.  Considerations such as the nature of the terrain (including the volume of earthworks), the condition of the existing road and the necessity for special works such as bridge works in some cases further complicate matters so that any figure which might be given as the average cost of major trunk road construction would be so subject to qualifications that it would be useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible, therefore, to answer Question No. 43 or the first part of Question No. 42 directly and at the same time with a fair degree of <Col N="303" /> accuracy.  If the Deputies would specify any particular area, or better still any particular roads, or sections of road, in which they are interested it should be possible to let them have fuller information on those points.</P>
    <P>No statistics are available in the Department to show separately the labour content of major trunk road improvement works.  The percentage of total expenditure by county councils on road works represented by the amount paid in wages to road workers is estimated at approximately 46 per cent.  The figures do not include the labour content of materials supplied or of works done by contract.  The wages content of any road work will vary according to the type of work involved and the location of the work.  Observation has shown that in general road improvement works involving widening or realignment such as major road improvement schemes have a higher labour content than works carried out on existing surfaces.</P>
