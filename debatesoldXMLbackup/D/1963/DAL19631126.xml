    <Title>Death of the President of the United States of America, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with very deep regret that I rise to move the adjournment of the Dáil as a mark of respect and of sympathy with the American people on the tragic death of their President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</P>
      <P>We had the privilege, during the year, of welcoming the late President Kennedy to Ireland.  The scenes of jubilation which marked that historic occasion, and which are still vivid in all our minds, testified to the extraordinary feelings of our people for him.  Here in this Chamber we were privileged to hear him address a joint meeting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The battle-flag of Meagher's Irish Brigade, which he presented to the people of Ireland on that historic day, hangs in an honoured place in Leinster House.  We shall think of him, and of the honour which he showed us by his presence amongst us, on every occasion that we look on it.</P>
      <P>President Kennedy was a world statesman who, even in the three short years in which he held his high office, exerted a profound influence on the course of world history.  The hopes of men and women of all the free nations had become centred in him.  The loss which mankind has suffered through his untimely death is still incalculable: few men in high political office ever possessed greater potentiality for the future of the world.  When we, and the rest of the world, recover from the shock of what today appears to be an unrelieved tragedy for mankind, we will surely realise that, although President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead, his spirit will remain to animate and inspire those who cherish his ideals and who are prepared to work as he did for their attainment.  For such was the extraordinary nature of this great and good man that no one can dare prophesy that his influence on the course of human affairs will be less in the future than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we mourn a world statesman and a great democratic leader, we remember also the man as we knew him&mdash;his relaxed and confident personality, his broad humanity and cheerful disposition, his clear mind and gift <Col N="3" /> of striking expression, and all the ingredients of his very likeable personality. It was these human qualities which so endeared him to all the Irish people during his visit amongst us.  We were proud of his Irish origins, and of the honour which he brought to our race.  With pride shall we ever record his heroism in battle, his courage in the face of injury and illness, his complete dedication to the ideal of liberty for all men and all races, his confidence and resolution in carrying out the awful and burdensome duties of his great office, his religious faith, his family life, his high standards of personal behaviour.  We each of us have a deep sense of personal loss, and in every Irish church and home the prayers of our people are being offered for his eternal salvation, as they would be for a close and dear relative.</P>
    <P>Our hearts go out to his stricken widow and family.  To them we offer our most profound sympathy.  We hope that somehow they will find in time the fortitude to bear their heavy cross.</P>
    <P>To the Government and the people of the United States we tender our deep regret for the tragedy that has befallen them, and our assurance that, in common with all the peoples of the earth, we share their sense of great loss.  We have lowered our flags in honour of their dead leader, and, with the men and women of his own nation, we Irish pay our respectful tribute to his memory.</P>
    <P>I ask you, Sir, on behalf of all members of Dáil Éireann, to convey these sentiments of ours to the Government of the United States and to the widow of the late President John Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I move:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann extend to the people of the United States of America its deep sympathy on the tragic death of President Kennedy, and, as a tribute of respect to his memory, that the House do now adjourn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not many months ago, we were all united to bid him welcome and offer him the highest honours that <Col N="4" /> were ours to bestow.  We meet today to express our grief at the passing of this great American, the President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  We meet to express our sincere sympathy with his widow, his bereaved family, and the President and people of the United States, in their tragic loss.</P>
      <P>The universality of the world's mourning eloquently testifies to the greatness of the man, whose untimely death has cast a pall of gloom over us all.  Our grief here in Ireland is mingled with pride in the knowledge that through the veins of the leader of the free world flowed the blood of Fitzgeralds and Kennedys.</P>
      <P>Americans will look back upon his memory with proud hearts in the knowledge that, when the burden of leadership of the free world came upon them, they had a man who abundantly met the highest standards required by this incomparable responsibility, and the Irish people everywhere will thank God that it was this fine flowering of our people's worldwide diaspora which provided the man to fill the first place in the unconquerable ranks of freedom.</P>
      <P>The death of President Kennedy robs the free world of a great leader, but he has left us the inspiration of a life dedicated to and lost in the great cause of peace and freedom, which will yet triumph as a result of his work. What was said a hundred years ago on the battlefield of Gettysburg by another great American President, who gave his life in the service of freedom, can be relevantly repeated now for all men everywhere to note and long remember:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which he who fought here has thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that from this honoured dead we take increased devotion to that Cause for which he gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that this man shall not have died in vain and that Government of the people, by the <Col N="5" /> people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to express our grief and our shock on the death of President Kennedy.  Our immediate sympathy goes to his courageous widow who had to suffer the agony of seeing her husband die at the hands of an assassin.  Especially does our sympathy go to his children whom he loved so much and to whom he devoted as much time as his official duties permitted.</P>
      <P>We send our sympathy to the Kennedy family, many of whom, like the late President Kennedy, have devoted their lives to the public service. It is with deep sincerity we pray that God may console and comfort them in their tragic loss.</P>
      <P>Because John Fitzgerald Kennedy was of Irish stock, we had a particular affection for him.  It was with admiration and now with emotion that we remember the words he uttered when he arrived in this country: &ldquo;I am coming home&rdquo;.  In these simple words he proclaimed to us and he proclaimed to the world pride in his Irish ancestry and expressed the feeling that there undoubtedly is in the hearts and minds of Irish men and women throughout the world towards their motherland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, if he were of other than Irish origin, we could not have withheld our admiration from him because he was indeed a great President.  He was a great President because he pursued his policy based on truth and justice.  In a world torn between two ideologies, he showed by his courage, by his strength of character and by his tolerance that war was not inevitable but that the resources of mankind could be utilised to ensure that this world would be a better place in which to live.  He believed that all men were born equal but he was a great President because he tried to ensure in his time that men and women, irrespective of creed or colour, in the United States of America or throughout the world should indeed have equal rights and equal opportunities.  His lesson on the brotherhood of men and his <Col N="6" /> tolerance could well be imitated by the world.</P>
    <P>His memory will live in the hearts of all Irish men and women, no matter where they may be.  We who were especially privileged to sit in these benches and to listen to him on 28th June last will be inspired and encouraged by his words, as men of goodwill everywhere must be, in striving to ensure that his dream of the free world will indeed be a reality.</P>
    <P>When he became President of the United States of America, John Fitzgerald Kennedy surrendered a life of ease, of comfort and of privacy.  He surrendered the normal family life that is enjoyed by most men.  He sacrificed that life so that he might serve not alone his country but the world and he continued in that sacrifice until he made the supreme sacrifice on Friday last.</P>
    <P>We trust and we pray that the good works of John Fitzgerald Kennedy here on this earth will be rewarded in the next.</P>

      <P>It is almost beyond belief that the buoyant and vivacious President who addressed us in this Chamber five short months ago should now be no more.  Perhaps our grief and our shock at his untimely removal stem from the fact that we regarded him as one of our own and could not help regarding him as one of our own. I regard him, and many people regard him, as being the brightest and most brilliant of a long line of brilliant American Presidents.  His loss is great for the world but it is a particularly tragic loss for this country.  He was a really true friend of ours, not so much because he came from our own stock but because he loved right and justice so deeply.</P>
      <P>I wish to join the other members of the House who have spoken in assuring the people of the United States of America and also his widow, Mrs. Kennedy, and her children, of our very deepest sympathy in this terrible loss that has come upon them so suddenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McQuillan and myself, I wish to express our profound shock at the <Col N="7" /> death of the late President Kennedy. We wish to express also our deep sorrow for and deep sympathy with his widow and little children, his tragically bereaved family and the American people.</P>
      <P>Words at these times are useless to comfort.  I believe there is no consolation for the world for his loss.  President Kennedy established what appeared to be the impossible to attain&mdash;a &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo; tolerance between nations of deeply conflicting beliefs.  In his own country, with a contempt for the lipservice usually paid to these ideals, at great personal sacrifice, he fought, wherever he saw it, bigoted intolerance of race superiority based on colour.  In his legislation he showed his deep compassion for the aged, the mentally afflicted and the sick.  He gave a new and finer meaning to the word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; in America and in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, to assure those of his family, his young widow and the children who must now mourn him through the remaining years of their lives, will the world show them that his short life and terrible death indeed had a meaning for us all?  Will we pay him our highest tribute by, in fact, helping to make the world that better place for <Col N="8" /> men of all races to live out their lives and so complete his tragically unfinished ambitions for humanity? While genuinely-felt emotions and universal sorrow for the dead man and sympathy and pity for his widow and children come easily, we must see that the future will not show them that performance is another thing.</P>

      <P>May I on my own behalf and on behalf of some of my colleagues support the Taoiseach's motion of condolence?  I, in my own little way, have quoted here on several occasions the late President Kennedy's very able booklet <i>Profiles in Courage,</i> which inspired me.  Our greatest contribution to his memory would be to study and take example from what he held up for emulation, that is, men of principle rather than men of means. Men of principle he held up for emulation and if we did the same here, we would do much to pay homage to his memory and to what he stood for.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to unanimously.</P>
