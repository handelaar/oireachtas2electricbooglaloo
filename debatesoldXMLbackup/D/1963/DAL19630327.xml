      <P>As the Minister for Education stated, the main hold-up on schools built directly by the Office of Public Works was at the professional level.  There has been for years past an acute shortage of architectural draughtsmen.  With the co-operation of the Dublin vocational education authorities a scheme was initiated in 1962 for the training of draughtsman staff.  The section of the architects branch dealing with school planning has been reorganised and now a minimum output in planning of 100 new schools and 50 major improvement schemes each year is being achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that meter rent is charged to consumers on the two-part tariff only in respect of any meter which the consumer may require in excess of one.  There is a small and diminishing number of consumers charged at flat rates and in these cases rental is charged in respect of each meter installed.  These consumers may change to the two-part tariff on request.</P>
      <P>Meter rents, where payable, continue while the apparatus is retained by the consumer.  They are necessary to recoup the Board the annual capital and other charges arising from the installation of meters in consumers' premises.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a charter flight operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and carrying 103 passengers landed at Shannon Airport on 12th March, 1963.  Since the inception of jet aircraft, the refuelling time has been substantially reduced and international airport practice is to allow passengers to remain aboard during refuelling, subject to certain safety precautions.  These precautions were carried out in this case.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the airline concerned to decide whether or not passengers should be allowed to disembark in any particular instance.  In this case, I understand that the captain of the aircraft decided that the time at his disposal was insufficient to allow the passengers to disembark.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any protest by workers at the airport nor do I think that a protest would be justified.  An airline cannot be forced by an aviation or airport authority to allow passengers to disembark, if all relevant regulations are observed.  I am, however, asking the airline concerned for clarification of their policy in this matter.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that the flight in question was a charter flight and that no difficulties arose in relation to the KLM scheduled flights during 1962.  Scheduled flights will be resumed for the summer of 1963.</P>

I would add that that has been the wish of the trade unions, apart from the managements altogether.  It is not considered desirable that there should be any change made in that position.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned with the consideration of industrial relationships and with any points that might have to be taken into consideration to change the legislation governing State companies or private companies.  It has not been considered desirable up to the present that the Minister, in his position as supervisor, should intervene in matters affecting wages and conditions of employment as between the companies concerned and the trade unions.  It is a practice that would be undesirable.</P>

      <P>That is the case, but the Deputy must not misquote me in that.  I can say, quite apart from the obligations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of industrial relations, that if the whole construction and formation of a company were in such a condition that this would become necessary, he would have to go to the Government and suggest a change in the management. If, among other things, industrial relations came into the picture, that would be a different situation.  Such a situation has never arisen and I rely on the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a situation involving industrial relations.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister not stated a very important point of principle in relation to the undesirability of the Minister responsible not intervening in a dispute concerning his Department?  Surely this would be a very serious disability in the case of a Minister like the Minister for Industry and Commerce who would thereby not be permitted to intervene?</P>

There is a total of twenty-six establishments registered in the Register of Shipbuilding Yards kept by the Revenue Commissioners under Section 37 of the Finance Act, 1932.  There is no official classification of yards according to the tonnage of the vessels produced or repaired.  The overall figure of employment in the establishments which make returns is estimated to have fluctuated, in 1962, from a maximum of 1,800 to a minimum of 1,500.  No information is available regarding the use of Irish materials in this industry.  With regard to (d) of the Question, the development programme of Irish Steel Holdings, Ltd. does not include the production of steel plate for shipbuilding, but steel angles and other sections for use in shipbuilding will be produced on the completion of the development work about the end of 1963.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 to 41 together.</P>
      <P>These questions seem to be based on a misunderstanding.  Provided a slot machine is so arranged that it does not deliver money prizes direct to the player, without the intervention of an attendant, it is not considered to be in contravention of Section 10.  Furthermore, there is no question of this being in any sense a circumvention of the law necessitating amending legislation since the operation of slot machines in this fashion was clearly foreseen in the framing of the 1956 legislation and, in fact, the operation of slot machines as a form of gaming is explicitly envisaged by Section 4 (i) (c) of the Act.  Provided, therefore, their operation is covered by the licence attaching to the premises, the operation of such machines in the manner mentioned is not in breach of the law, and no question of a prosecution arises. I have no information as to the number of machines in operation in the State and, in view of what I have said. I have no grounds for undertaking a special survey in the matter.</P>

There is a practice that symbols are applied to trade marks which could indicate that they are registered trade marks.  The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that certain symbols which must now be prescribed by the Minister may not be used, symbols which might indicate that unregistered trade marks are in fact registered.

    <Title>Irish Steel Holdings Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1963: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the limit imposed by the Irish Steel Holdings Limited Act, 1960 on <Col N="476" /> the acquisition of shares in the company by the Minister for Finance from £4 million to £6 million, and on the guarantee by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the repayment of moneys borrowed by the Company from £500,000 to £1 million.</P>
    <P>The history and the development proposals of Irish Steel Holdings, Limited are, no doubt, known to the House, having been fully discussed during the debate leading to the enactment of the Irish Steel Holdings Limited Act, 1960.  During that debate, I said it was expected that the total cost of the work necessary for the implementation of the company's development and expansion programme would be of the order of £3½ million.  During the course of the work, however, unforeseen circumstances arose which vitiated the estimate on which that expectation was founded, and, while the development plans have not yet been completed, and are not scheduled for completion until towards the end of 1963, the final completion figure for the full programme, including a margin for contingencies, is now estimated by the Company at £5,020,000, of which they will provide £131,268 from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The factors contributing to the increase can be broadly classified as follows:</P>
    <P>(i) As the works progressed, it was discovered that the subterranean conditions were very bad and more and deeper excavation was found to be necessary, and the foundations had to be greater and more complex than originally foreseen;</P>
    <P>(ii) wage increases granted to the building and allied trades since 1959 increased civil engineering costs;</P>
    <P>(iii) certain additions and extensions were found necessary to provide for improved efficiency and economy of operation;</P>
    <P>(iv) despite extensive advertisement, both in this country and in Great Britain, the company were unable to recruit the number of skilled Irish tradesmen required, and in consequence they were forced to <Col N="477" /> utilise the services of a considerably greater number of foreign technicians at increased cost; and</P>
    <P>(v) the revaluation of the Deut-schmark in March, 1961, further increased the cost of certain subcontracts.</P>
    <P>In addition to this revised expenditure on the actual development project, it is necessary that a further £250,000 be provided for working capital in the exceptional period between the installation of the plant and its coming into full commercial operation.  Certain parts of the new plant are undergoing protracted tests, and this will occur as each unit of the new mills is installed.  In addition, certain teething troubles are to be envisaged.  The cost of material and labour on this unproductive but necessary development work is accepted as a commissioning cost which should properly be provided out of capital.</P>
    <P>The sum of £6 million includes provision of a reserve of £750,000.  This provision is being made in case the advance of free trade should lead to proposals for adaptation of the works to fit into an economic framework wider than, and different from, that at present envisaged.  This money is not committed to any purpose, and none of it can be used until a fully detailed plan involving its use has prior examination and approval by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the limit of £500,000 imposed by the 1960 Act on guaranteed borrowings by the company should be increased to £1 million. When the figure of £500,000 was fixed in the earlier Act, it was in mind that this figure would be additional to the then existing limit of £300,000, guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act. The legal position is, however, that the total guaranteed borrowings under the 1960 Act are limited to £500,000, which is insufficient to provide working capital for the extended operations of the company.  A margin is also required to cover, temporarily, further plant extensions, if such should prove necessary, in the event of free trade conditions arising, either by reason of our joining the European Coal and <Col N="478" /> Steel Community or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is of course a matter of concern to me that the original Estimate should have been so far short of eventual requirements and I can assure the House that every possibility of confining expenditure to the original Estimate has been thoroughly explored. I have gone even to the extent of considering the possibility of curtailment of the development scheme.  I was satisfied, however, that this course was not practicable.  It is clear that Irish Steel Holdings Limited are in business in a highly competitive field and the viability of the company, and the security of the employment of their labour force of some 700 workers, can be assured only if their operations can be carried on at the highest level of efficiency.  The development works now in progress are designed to bring about this position.</P>
    <P>I have also satisfied myself that all reasonable steps were taken by the company throughout to obtain the best advice available and to endeavour to keep expenditure as close as possible to the estimate.  It has proved that they were exceptionally, and unforeseeably, unlucky in regard to foundation conditions which could not be examined beforehand.  This is a hazard of large-scale foundation work, particularly in conditions, as here, where the site concerned was occupied by existing heavy plant which had to be maintained in operation to the latest possible moment, in order to minimise interruption of output.  The other factors of wage increases, labour shortage and currency revaluation were equally unforeseeable.</P>
    <P>As regards the modifications of the original plans, these arose under various heads: it was hoped to use certain existing electrical equipment, but this proved to be impossible; the steel-making department buildings were strengthened to make them suitable for handling hot metal, as the future availability of this material has come to be considered possible; some additional electrical equipment was provided to cope with extra mechanisation which was considered desirable.  The company's basic plans, as approved by <Col N="479" /> the Government and described to the House, are unchanged.</P>
    <P>While the House, like the Government, will be concerned at the large increases in the cost of these works, I am sure it will be agreed that there is no practical alternative to providing the money to complete the developments as planned.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While we approve generally of the proposal involved in the legislation before the House, I think the House would be interested in the reasons for the increased costs. It is somewhat less than three years since the proposal was last before the House and the question of increased financial provision was under consideration. As I understand from the chairman's report which was considered in January of this year, the increase in costs was attributable to the increased cost of civil engineering, chiefly site preparation, foundations, structures, cellar and culverts.  In view of the comparatively short time since the estimate was originally prepared, the House should be told why it was necessary to increase substantially the cost of the proposed re-development work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which should be of interest to the House is what has happened to our application to join the European Coal and Steel Community. Is the application being pursued or is it dependent on our application to join the EEC?  As I understand it, our original application was dependent on our application to join the European Coal and Steel Community.  In view of the fact we have decided not to proceed with our application to join the EEC, perhaps the Minister would say what has happened to the application to join the European Coal and Steel Community?  Subject to these two queries&mdash;why it was necessary to revise upwards the estimate of the work at Haulbowline and, secondly, what has happened to our application to join the European Coal and Steel Community&mdash;we generally approve of the proposal.  We believe that Irish <Col N="480" /> Steel Holdings Ltd. have done a very good job, faced with keen competition in a sphere in which they have to meet unusual difficulties.  Allowing for these factors, therefore, I should be interested to hear what decision has been reached in respect of the Coal and Steel Community application and also the factors which, within a relatively short time, contributed to the substantial increase in the original estimate in respect of the development work at Haulbowline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might usefully have given us a little more information than is contained in the four-page statement he has circulated. For example, he says on page 1 that the factor contributing to the necessity for the additional moneys was the fact that as the works progressed, it was discovered that the subterranean conditions were very bad and more and deeper excavation was found to be necessary, and the foundations had to be greater and more complex than originally foreseen.  The Minister might have told us how much of this new money we are to spend on repairing the deficiency in the subterranean foundations.  I would regard that kind of work as not very remunerative and as almost dead timber in an enterprise of this kind.  It has no market value, no fixed assets value.  It is the kind of thing you have to do in order to prop an enterprise on top of it.  But its contribution to the welfare of the enterprise is that it merely makes it possible for the enterprise to carry on.  The enterprise itself can make a profit or a loss, but the foundation, beyond making the enterprise viable, can do nothing to influence its prosperity.  How much will we have to spend in repairing the defective foundations and putting the subterranean foundations on a basis that will enable them to carry the superstructure?  Perhaps the Minister will give us some idea how much will be spent on these subterranean activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what classes of products are now being made at Haulbowline?  I know for a fact they did make flats and rounds.  They were also making angle <Col N="481" /> iron and galvanised sheeting.  It was contemplated they would go into the rolling mill stage and make some black sheet.  Have they started to make the black sheet yet?  If so, is it intended to go further than that?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know to what extent the existing tariff is being indented upon by Haulbowline to compete in the home market on favourable terms with the imported article.  It is well known that, were it not for the tariff, it would have been possible to import British and Belgian steel at prices for this range of commodities less than those at which they were being produced here.  Is that still the position?  To what extent is the tariff being used by Haulbowline as a protection against the cheaper imported product?  There were times when the British and Belgian steel prices were higher than those of the Irish product.  In order to ascertain what way the market is moving as far as Irish Steel is concerned, I should like to know whether at present Irish Steel could compete with British and Belgain steel if there were no tariffs, or how much of the tariff they find necessary to use in order to be able to compete with Belgian and British steel exports to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have told us, too, what his view is of the future of Haulbowline.  I hope it will be a bright one; I hope it will continue to give expanding employment.  Although everybody will accept it is very awkwardly placed&mdash;in fact, uneconomically placed&mdash;nevertheless, it has in very difficult times been able to do what on the whole has been a very good job, particularly when you recollect it has no natural sources of supply and has to rely in the main on scrap metal gathered in all parts of the country. Occasionally it may be able to use some small ingots which are imported, but by and large, it has operated on scrap metal gathered in all places throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister think of the prospects of this enterprise in Common Market conditions?  What does he think of its prospects of survival if there are no tariffs to protect it on the <Col N="482" /> home market?  I do not think it has ever been able to get any market in Europe for any of its products.  It has been able to get some markets in faraway places such as Asia and Africa for a limited number of its products, but I suspect even there the prices quoted were extremely keen and the sales were probably made on the basis: &ldquo;We have got the stuff and it is better to sell it at almost no profit, and really no profit, in order to dispose of it and get the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would the Minister like to say now what he thinks of its prospects in Common Market conditions?  Everybody knows that the steel market is not only extremely competitive but viciously competitive.  If anybody doubts that, all he has to do is to look at the stock exchange news in the morning or evening paper where he will find the shares of steel firms in England which are capitalised to the extent of £70 million and £100 million have fallen catastrophically in the past two or three years.  There is one wellknown firm with a capital of over £100 million, the shares of which three years ago were worth 50/- each and are worth about 11/- to-day.  The firm have stopped paying any dividend whatever and are no longer under British law regarded as a trustee security.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, huge firms such as Colvilles, Dormans, South Durham. When one finds their shares rolling down with such catastrophic effect from the point of view of the unfortunates who hold them, one may well get a shock and ask can we, with the relatively limited resources at Haulbowline, compete in European and world markets with firms having the enormous financial and technical resources of these British firms.</P>
    <P>I hope we can keep Haulbowline going.  It may very well be that a smaller unit of this kind can be more viable than the larger units to which I have referred but it will be hard going and those who can make Haulbowline a viable enterprise in the circumstances of to-day and the anticipated circumstances of to-morrow will <Col N="483" /> deserve some form of decoration in due course from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>However, I should like the Minister to say what his assessment of the outlook is because undoubtedly one must consider what the future will be before deciding to put in another £2 million of additional capital and take power to guarantee another £500,000 to the banks on behalf of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that when he is concluding the debate, the Minister will give us some picture as to what he anticipates the future of Haulbowline is.  I hope, as I have said, that it is a bright one but the going will be very tough and if we can make a success of it in the new conditions with which we are likely to be confronted in Europe and with which to some extent we are being confronted to-day, it will be a great tribute to all those associated with the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when the Minister brought in a Bill to extend the capital of Irish Steel Holdings less than three years ago, I queried as to whether it might not be possible to procure the money by a public flotation.  The Minister replied that this firm had at one time been a private company and had not been able to manage its affairs economically and successfully as a viable unit and the State had intervened and had built it up to a successful industrial enterprise.</P>
      <P>While I accept that there are a considerable number of men employed in this factory, I do not think the Minister has given us sufficient information to enable us to make up our minds as to whether this Bill is necessary or not. He mentioned a fact, which was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton, that the money was required for some reconstruction, due to subterranean trouble that had been discovered.  He did not tell us the precise amount of money that is being used for that purpose, although the increased capital is £2 million and borrowing is extended by another £500,000.  It would be no harm if the Minister were to clarify that point for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad also if he would <Col N="484" /> clarify another point.  If on the last occasion I queried the Minister about this firm in the House the firm was then a solvent concern and the Minister felt that it was only fair, equitable and just to extend the capital as the State infusion of capital had been responsible for building it up as a viable unit, is that still the state of affairs?  Is this firm a paying concern? In other words, are we selling the steel which is manufactured there and which, I take it, is largely used as raw material to service Irish industries? Perhaps we export some of it.  Is it an economic proposition?  Is it able to show a dividend profit?  Can the Minister say that in the foreseeable future, with the infusion of this capital, this firm will be a viable and strong unit or are we simply infusing capital into the firm to keep it alive?  Structural alterations were found to be necessary and are we infusing the capital for that purpose, or is that capital being injected into the firm because we will have to face considerable economic difficulties in the future as a result of the liberalisation of trade which obviously will come about and it is considered necessary to expand this firm so as to make it a stronger or more viable unit?</P>
    <P>I pose these questions to the Minister only because I think that when a Department comes to this House seeking further public money, the purpose for which that money is being used in its entirety and the prospects for the future ought to be made absolutely clear to Dáil Eireann and to the country.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell the House of the sales of steel that are taking place from this factory; where they are selling the steel.  Are they selling it entirely within the domestic market or are they exporting it on an open market in competition with other stell holdings in various parts of the world?  That is a reasonable question to ask and the Minister will agree that it is an important question because, come what may, while negotiations for entry to the European Economic Community have not been immediately successful for us, it is <Col N="485" /> obvious that there will be further liberalisation of trade and that we will have to face competitive conditions.  If we are to do so, the House is entitled to know if this money will give the infusion and injection of life into this firm that will make it a profitable unit.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point I made earlier and which I have made repeatedly on occasions when Ministers came into this House seeking public funds.  If this is a solvent concern, if the future of this company can be regarded as satisfactory in every way, is it not possible to have a public flotation on the open stock exchange and to get the necessary funds from the general public?  There are very few opportunities for real industrial investment by the public in Ireland to-day. A parallel quasi-State organisation, the ESB, went on the market the other day and the loan was oversubscribed in a very short period of time.  The public, the Dáil and everyone concerned are satisfied that the ESB is a strong economic unit.  Facing the conditions that will obtain in the future, taking into consideration, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, our application to join the European Coal and Steel Community, it does seem to me that if we are able to face up to all those circumstances, it is reasonable to ask why should not a public flotation be made in order to get the money necessary for Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  If the money could be raised by public subscription, and if it were not necessary for the Minister for Finance, as I assume he must do in this case, to underwrite the money, it would be to the advantage of the company, and public funds which are available to the State, and which are considerably limited, could be invested elsewhere, and perhaps in some other firm or organisation that might require an infusion.</P>
    <P>These remarks are made entirely subject to the fact that this is a completely viable firm.  I hope the Minister when he comes to reply will give the House&mdash;I must say he generally does &mdash;the full information on the questions I have raised.  I appreciate the fact that this firm is situated in a centre where the employment it gives is very necessary and where it is desirable <Col N="486" /> to maintain that employment. Indeed I have no doubt the employment given is very dear to the Minister's heart, as it probably is also to the heart of Deputy A. Barry sitting behind me.  At the same time, it is our duty here to survey and examine the expenditure of public funds and to ensure, so far as we can, that they are utilised to the best advantage.  It is for that reason, and that reason alone, I have intervened in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Esmonde that neither Deputy A. Barry nor I would lose a great many votes, if the Government's decision were to abandon Irish Steel.  Nevertheless, there may be some political &ldquo;lolly&rdquo;, as I have heard the term, in it for both of us, but that is not enough to ensure that it will be kept going, and it is not so significant as to colour my judgment as to the desirability of ensuring that the development works now in progress should be completed.</P>
      <P>A number of questions were asked by the three Deputies who have spoken.  Deputy Norton's I anticipated to some extent and I hope I shall be able to give reasonably satisfactory answers to the questions raised.  The first question was that raised by Deputy Cosgrave as to what the position is with regard to our application for membership of the European Coal and Steel Community.  While the application for membership of that body was made technically independently of our application for membership of the Common Market, it is obvious that the outcome of our application for membership of the Common Market will determine whether or not we will proceed with our application for membership of the European Coal and Steel Community.  In so far, therefore, as our application for membership of the Common Market is now in suspense, it may be taken that our application for membership of ECSC is also in suspense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me then to the question raised by Deputy Norton, Deputy Cosgrave and, I think, Deputy Esmonde, as to what the prospects are of the survival of this industry in free trade conditions, whether within or <Col N="487" /> outside the Common Market.  First, I want to comment on Deputy Esmonde's statement, and its implication, that this company would not attract public support if it put its stock on the public market.  I can assure Deputy Esmonde, though I was rather immature at the time, that if the ESB had put its stock on the market 30 years ago, it would not have attracted the same type of support as it did in recent weeks.  Because nobody else was prepared to generate electricity at that time to the point at which it would be required for national use, the then Government decided to set up a generating system of its own.  Similarly, it is because private enterprise failed in the carrying on of this steel producing operation in Haulbowline, and because the Government were able to get control of the plant at a reasonable price, that it was decided to produce steel in certain forms in Haulbowline through a State-sponsored company.</P>
    <P>It is true the company has been in existence for some years, but its scope of activity has been limited by very many factors.  Because that limitation was seen to prejudice its continued existence, it was decided that this new development was necessary, not only to ensure and maintain the employment of the existing 500 men employed there but possibly to expand it, and it is confidently hoped that this new development, when completed, will expand permanent employment in Haulbowline to 700 men.  I believe that when this expansion will have been completed gradually, when the teething troubles are over, and when it will have established better markets, it will be a reasonably viable undertaking.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the company were asked to examine their possibilities in free trade conditions.  The company pointed out that there were, in the first place, certain uncertainties as to the terms on which entry to the European Coal and Steel Community might be effected.  It appeared to the company that it was essential to press on with their plan to expand but that, in Common Market or free trade conditions, it might be necessary to <Col N="488" /> rationalise or specialise to a greater extent than is now envisaged.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening statement, there is in the financial capital structure a provision of £750,000 which the company may call on if they require it to proceed with such rational or specialised programme.  As far as they possibly can provide, the company have foreseen possible free trade effects on their operation and will be able, subject to their satisfying the Government on the point, to provide finance for whatever adaptations are necessary. It is true that the company are protected at the moment as to the bulk of their output by a tariff.  If the question is how does the selling price of steel in bars and angles produced at the moment compare with imported prices, the best assessment I can get from the company is that the prices at which Irish Steel now sell are higher than the lowest Common Market home prices and lower than the highest prices; they are, therefore, somewhere in between in an ever-fluctuating price structure.  In addition, and I think Deputy Norton anticipated what I am going to say here, they have markets as far away as New Zealand, not for a very significant proportion of their output but certainly of such significance as to engender a degree of confidence in the future of this industry.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the continued existence of the sheet mill. There was, when the State took over this enterprise, a sheet mill which was not fully completed and was, in fact, never completed until this present development programme was envisaged. It is now in course of completion.  I think I said when speaking on the original Bill that the sheet mill is not the most modern in the world.  Nevertheless, we have the basis of a structure there and it is considered economic to go ahead with the completion of it and produce sheet for home consumption.</P>
    <P>It is hardly likely that sheet can be produced economically to sell at competitive world market prices, but if the sheet mill were not completed, there would be an obligation on the company to find markets abroad for roughly 10,000 tons of steel produced <Col N="489" /> in the mill that would otherwise be absorbed in the manufacture of black sheet.  That sheet in turn would go to the galvanising process which employs roughly 60 men at present, so that not only would the company be faced with the obligation of finding an outlet for 10,000 tons, if they did not proceed with the sheet mill, but it could be likely that the continued employment of the 60 men engaged in the galvanising process would be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>As regards the most important question raised, the reasons for the increase in capital from £3.5 million to something over £5 million&mdash;I think the net increase is roughly £1.3 million&mdash;I think it is only fair that I should try to break it down as clearly as I can and give the reasons for the increase. First, the subterranean conditions to which I referred emerged, or rather knowledge of them emerged, only as the foundations were being built.  Trial borings were carried out and, as many of us know as a result of discussing mining legislation here over a number of years, borings of themselves do not reveal the true picture in any underground operation.  It is only when the full mining process is undertaken that the underground conditions are fully disclosed.  This was the case in the laying of foundations for Irish Steel.  The company found that not only were the subterranean conditions worse than anticipated, and certainly completely at variance with what was disclosed in the trial borings, but that the deeper the excavations went&mdash;they had to go deep because of the very heavy machinery which was to be built and already in position over it&mdash;the more complex the problem became.</P>
    <P>It involved seepage or infiltration of the sea that could not possibly be foreseen but between the erection of extra coffer dams, the increase in wages, the extra work involved and the increase in time that the extra work caused, the increase in the cost of the civil engineering works amounted to something like £600,000.  The actual cost of the extra structural work out of that sum, was about £300,000.  There were additions or extensions to items as the <Col N="490" /> work developed and as appeared to be prudent to the company, amounting to some £78,000.  Then there were increased erection costs amounting to some £200,000 but one of the major factors in that was the failure to recruit sufficient Irish technicians.  As I said in the opening statement, the company advertised extensively for Irish technicians with the required knowledge but, unfortunately, by reason of local competition to some extent&mdash;the existence of the oil refinery and the Verolme Dockyard was one cause&mdash;they were unable to recruit sufficient technicians and the contractors had to bring with them&mdash;it was a German firm, incidentally&mdash;technicians from Germany.  In that way, a skilled erector would cost the company about £10 a day as against £2 or £3 originally estimated.</P>
    <P>Escalator clauses in equipment contracts as quoted originally account for some £160,000.  Then there was a question of the devaluation of the deutschmark so that with other minor additions one can readily see how the increase of £1.3 million in extra costs occurred.  I was perturbed that such extra costs would have to be incurred and I made a close examination to see if they could be avoided, even at the expense of reducing the scope of the development programme.  But on careful examination, I found that it was better to permit the programme to develop as originally envisaged by the company.</P>
    <P>These remarks cover most of the points raised by Deputies but if there are any other questions they would like me to answer or any I have overlooked, I shall do my best to answer them.</P>

It will be realised that when the ministerial amendment relating to Wexford was accepted by the House, it was largely under protest by Deputies and on the understanding that they would be given the opportunity of submitting this amendment.  I should like to know now, before the Bill passes, whether the Parliamentary Secretary will avail of the opportunity still available to him to bring in an amendment in the Seanad that will be within the rules of procedure.</P>

      <P>Any Deputy knows that he cannot insert a provision in a Bill that will involve additional expenditure. The Parliamentary Secretary is the only person who has the authority to provide that additional expenditure and to make it legal.  Any other Deputy who attempts to table such an amendment would be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, and rightly so.  When we put down the <Col N="495" /> amendment, we were meeting a situation which was approved of by the Parliamentary Secretary and, in fact, the amendment should have been moved by him.  We had a measure of agreement.  We took advice and we sought to implement the advice given to us.  It is now possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to implement his own advice by responding to the beliefs he has expressed to me and to my colleagues from Cork.  He can do that in the Seanad.</P>

We framed the amendment and put it in here and then we were informed that the amendment was out of order.  I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would accept the amendment.  We are looking for nothing more in Cork than has been given in Wexford.  The amendment seeks to have provided only money which would be passed by his Commissioners, not by the county council, in an effort to prevent coast erosion.  That is the actual meaning of the amendment and it is not any more than is given to Wexford in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan in what he has said.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to remedy the matter in the Seanad.

I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to remedy this in the Seanad when it comes up there.  I think it is unfair to discriminate against one county.  I say that here frankly.

      <P>I can say it on the next Stage just as easily.  To be quite brief, the Parliamentary Secretary I think has been approached by the Wicklow Urban District Council who put two specific problems to him in connection with this Bill.  The first arises on Section 1, which is the definition section, under which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should allow me to put the question.  He can then speak on the Final Stage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it I need not repeat what I have said.  The Parliamentary Secretary has heard it. The first question arises in connection with the fact that under this legislation the county council are the promoting authority.  That seems a reasonable proposition.  As I understand the position, the Wicklow Urban district council feel they are in the position&mdash;as indeed would other urban district councils throughout the country&mdash;where they have harbours within their functional area.  They feel that they, so to speak, are the people in close contact with questions which <Col N="498" /> are likely to arise to be dealt with under this Bill.  They have suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that there might be some machinery whereby they would be entitled to initiate inspection and investigation.  It seems to me that is a reasonable request to make.</P>
      <P>I think it unlikely that a conflict as between the members of the urban district council and the members of the county council will arise on a matter such as this which, while it affects in particular one part of the county, does, in fact, affect the county as a whole and in that sense is under the jurisdiction of the county council.  But, in so far as the particular interests of the urban district council are concerned, it does seem reasonable that some kind of machinery should be set up whereby they would be entitled to request the county council to initiate inspection for the purpose of getting a scheme going and that if that were not done or if it were refused, there might possibly be a right of appeal to the Commissioners of Public Works or to the Minister concerned.  It is a point that has been put and I, and I know my colleagues in the constituency, have been asked to put it here.  I feel it is worthy of consideration and for that reason I mention it to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the main point the Deputy is making, again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That, under the Bill, the urban district council are, so to speak, cut out from any right to promote or initiate inspections, schemes, and so on, and that the Parliamentary Secretary might consider some machinery whereby they would, under the legislation, have a right to call on the county council to inspect for the purpose of initiating the scheme or the steps they consider necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is in connection with what might be regarded as purely emergency conditions &mdash; conditions which can come into being overnight and where it will obviously not be possible to go through all the machinery of inspection and declarations, preliminary examinations and <Col N="499" /> reports, and all the rest, as laid down by the Bill.  This may not be necessary. Possibly other legislation covers the point.  The suggestion made to me, and which, as I say, I know was made to the Department, is that county councils should in such circumstances, where emergency conditions arise, have the right of direct request to the Commissioners of Public Works for a grant to remedy damage done in such emergency conditions.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider both points to see if they can possibly be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.  In the urban district council, we, and my predecessors for the past 60 years, have been engaged in protection against coast erosion.  We often experience very serious damage overnight.  We have to make some arrangement then with the Department of Local Government and if we are left, as outlined in the Bill, it means we have to get in touch with the county council.  The county council would have to call a meeting and a couple of months might then elapse and more serious damage would take place during that time.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to devise some scheme whereby the urban council can get in touch with the Department immediately the damage takes place so as to avoid any unnecessary expense afterwards.</P>
      <P>I am sorry our amendments have been ruled out because on 6th September, 1957, the Government gave us a grant of £5,000 in respect of coast erosion.  I have no objection to Wexford or any other county getting assistance but Wicklow should get special consideration in view of the amount this problem has cost both the State and the ratepayers over a long number of years.</P>

I take it the urban council want to be in a position to promote a scheme themselves, if the county <Col N="500" /> council refuse to do it.  The people in the industrial end of the town are afraid it will be converted into an island overnight and that the county council might say: &ldquo;It is not our problem and we are not prepared to do anything about it.&rdquo;  Four or five times within the past six years we have had to come to Government Departments seeking advances for coast protection work in Wicklow. There is a problem there which is likely to recur.  If the county council fall down on the job, the urban council, the harbour board or some other body should have an opportunity of putting the position right temporarily until a major scheme is carried out.</P>
      <P>On the question of financing these schemes, what I said here on Committee Stage was that Wicklow would be treated as I understood Rosslare was being treated, that Rosslare was now getting retrospective payment for 80 per cent of the total amount of money spent there since 1957.  A number of schemes have been carried out in Wicklow on the basis of 75 per cent grant, with the exception of the last one which was on an 80 per cent grant basis.  That means that today the Wicklow ratepayers in the urban district are paying a shilling in the £ for coast erosion works and from 1st April, they will be paying 1/6d.  That is a lot of money and the burden is heavier on the ratepayers in Wicklow than it is on the Wexford ratepayers.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the matter favourably when it comes before the Seanad.  Perhaps this can be dealt with by regulation and, if so, provision should be made to treat Wicklow in the same way as it is intended to treat Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no fairy godmother in Cork.  There were no grants available for us.  We had to do the work ourselves while grants were being given to Wicklow and Wexford.  Had we not spent the £57,000 at issue here during the past 12 months in endeavouring to stop the erosion that was taking place, we should be looking to the Minister now for 80 per cent <Col N="501" /> of about £600,000.  Immediate action saved that expenditure.  However, I do not think we are asking too much in asking for the same treatment as is being given to Wicklow and Rosslare. The estimate I got from the county engineer covering works that would be considered was for about £30,000.  That again would have to be examined by the Commissioners and by the Minister and perhaps much of what we think we are entitled to would be cut down as it generally is when Government Departments get hold of these matters.</P>
      <P>The sum involved is not much but it means a lot to the Cork ratepayers who are already overburdened.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to put this through in the Seanad.  I am certain that if the rules of the House had not prevented this amendment being taken, the Parliamentary Secretary would be convinced of the justice of our case and would have accepted the amendment.  I would ask him now not to let the rules of the House knock out a just case.</P>
      <P>As I said here previously, I doubt very seriously whether this Bill would stand up to examination by the Attorney General in respect of those sections.  The Constitution that guarantees the rights of citizens does not imply that the Cork ratepayers should have to pay for something the State was paying for on behalf of the Wexford ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be quite a deal of confusion with regard to these amendments and with regard to the position generally.  I should like to make one thing abundantly clear. Were I of the opinion that these amendments had merit and were backed up by equity and justice, I would have no hesitation in taking the necessary steps to implement them. But that is not the position.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the points raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  He stated it was at my invitation that this amendment was moved.  He should recall the circumstances.  I was receiving a deputation from the Cork County Council when we were interrupted by an intimation that this Bill was being taken. I did state I would be prepared to consider any proposals or amendments. I would not use my position or the cloak of the Chair to evade these amendments, if there was justice in them.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison, good, bad or indifferent, between the position in either Cork or Wicklow and the position which obtained in Wexford, and it is completely unrealistic to suggest that there is.  Deputy Corry knows that on 14th March, I wrote to him as follows:</P>
      <P>I have carefully considered your suggestion that I should move an amendment to the Coast Protection Bill on the lines of the amendments proposed by you and the other Cork Deputies.  I think there is some misunderstanding in relation to the provisions of the Bill and I hope this note of mine will help you to understand it and clear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision anywhere in the Bill for the payment of retrospective grants.  In the case of Rosslare, money has been provided by <Col N="503" /> the Oireachtas in each year since 1957 for the execution of protection works.  The county council have, in addition, made contributions totalling £30,000 or approximately 25 per cent. of the cost of the work which is now estimated at £120,000. At the earlier stages of the Bill I explained that the grant for the Rosslare works would be adjusted up to the rate provided for in the Bill but that this would be done as an administrative matter and would be something entirely apart from the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the Rosslare scheme will be completed in 1964. The Engineers of the Commissioners of Public Works advised that the works would require very careful maintenance if their value was not to be completely lost.  No arrangements had been made for maintenance and we were further advised that the county council could not meet maintenance costs without statutory authority.  The amendments passed at the Committee Stage, and which may have given rise to the misunderstanding, were designed to overcome this difficulty. The amendments simply provide that the Commissioners may maintain the works and recover the maintenance costs from the county council.  They have absolutely no effect on the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for grants for protection against progressive damage being caused by the continuing encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms. Even if the damage on the Cork coast were being caused by a continuing encroachment&mdash;and from what I learned from the deputation on the 27th February last storm damage appears to be involved&mdash; the amendment suggested would introduce a new element of retrospection. It could possibly lead to demands for similar treatment for other maritime counties and I regret that I could not see my way to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Cork Deputies have given their side of the story, but I should like to <Col N="504" /> complete the picture.  Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Sullivan cannot deny that since April, 1962, in their representations to the Department of Local Government for grants in the Cork area the words used were &ldquo;storm damage.&rdquo;  When they saw this Bill on the Order Paper, they switched names. I do not blame them.  They thought they could utilise the benefits of this Bill.  In April, 1962, Cork County Council requested the Minister for Local Government to receive a deputation to discuss the possibility of obtaining grants towards the repair of damage caused by storms in the previous months.  In a letter of 15th May, 1962, from the Department of Local Government to the council, the position in regard to the availability of grants for private houses damaged was explained.  That might not have been much help to the Cork Deputies.  It was open to private persons whose dwellings had been damaged to apply to the Department for a grant under the Housing Acts towards the cost of repairs.  It was also stated that, while special grants could not be made available for the repair of damaged roads, the council could consider using their ordinary grants for the purpose as appropriate.  The Deputies could reasonably say: &ldquo;We have other work scheduled and this will cut down our ordinary programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to damaged sanitary works, it was stated that grants could not be made available but that applications for the raising of the money by loan would be favourably considered. Did the Cork County Council ever make an application to avail of the offer of the Department of Local Government under that heading?  It was stated by the county manager on 7th November, 1962, that the county council had spent £57,000 on the repair of storm damage.  At the county manager's request, the position was discussed with him and officials of the council in the Department on 22nd November last.  They explained that it was with damaged roads only the council were concerned.  It was made abundantly clear to the manager that there was no possibility of a special Road Fund grant being made available <Col N="505" /> for the purpose of remedying storm damage to roads.  On 17th December, 1962, before the council meeting at which the matter was to be discussed, the county manager by telephone discussed the matter again with officials of the Department of Local Government to confirm there was no prospect of a special Road Fund grant.  I was later requested to receive a deputation from the county council, and I duly received the deputation on 27th February last.  That is the position with regard to Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but I have to the best of my ability explained the position as we see it.  Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Sullivan on their part <Col N="506" /> have made their case in a very able way for Cork.  This matter now applies to all the counties&mdash;Wicklow, Cork and any other county.  It is a question of what is to happen if some thousands of pounds worth of damage occurs overnight.  It is reasonable to bring that to the attention of the House on this Bill.  Deputies could say that by the time the necessary procedures were adopted and representations made to the Commissioners to initiate a scheme, a whole town or village, as the case may be, could be wiped out and thousands of pounds worth of damage done.  That is quite reasonable.  There is no provision in this Bill, I repeat, whereby storm damage <i>per se</i> can be catered for but I do say, as elected members of local authorities who have spoken will agree, there is no county engineer or assistant county engineer who could not say that such and such an area, be it Wicklow, Rosslare, Youghal or any other part of the country, is not being gradually undermined and the necessary steps would have to be taken of examination by the local authority engineer.  The engineer could say that work costing £20 or £30 at this stage, if not attended to at that small cost, could run into hundreds and thousands of pounds. We could not possibly cater under this Bill for an act of God.  To bring that to its logical conclusion, not only the maritime counties, but every other local authority area would be causing us trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that point in a moment.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this work in Rosslare commenced in 1957.  The Deputy's Government, in 1956, went out of office on the Committee Stage of the Coast Protection Bill for reasons which we will not go into; they do not arise now.  It was quite obvious to us and to everyone else that a Coast Protection Bill would have to be brought in.  It was quite obvious also that our professional staffs had quite a deal to learn, and still have.  It was obvious to everyone on every side of the House that Rosslare needed urgent and immediate attention.  It was unique in the problems which were presented. The experience which has been gained from this work has been invaluable to our experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Everett and Deputy P. Brennan and on Committee Stage, by Deputy Faulkner, is that an urban council should have the power of initiating, setting the ball rolling, so that the Commissioners of Public Works would come in and do <Col N="508" /> a coast protection scheme.  That was mistaken.  I said at that time:</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I might refer to the suggestion that urban district councils should be permitted to function as promoting authorities. We have looked into this and we have come to the conclusion that specific statutory provision for urban district councils to act as promoting authorities should not be made.  Although some Deputies consider that county councils might not promote schemes requested by urban district councils there are reasonable men on these bodies and it is felt that any difficulty should be easily overcome. We feel strongly that there should be co-operation between the local authorities.  We have not heard anything to the contrary.</P>
    <P>A point made by Deputy Paudge Brennan was that in Wicklow now they will be paying almost 1/6d. in the £ as a result of the successive schemes done down the years going back to 1907.  I do not know what the amount in the £ is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>A shilling.  A penny produces £40 and we are paying 1/in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion underlying Deputy Brennan's proposal was that because Wicklow is a maritime county or seaport, it was a hardship on the community to have to find this money.  There are many towns in central Ireland which are not on the sea and which have to find money for other things.  Do not forget that in Wicklow there are certain benefits to be derived from the fact that it is a seaside resort and is a fishing place and has other advantages that bring a certain amount of business to the community and the hotels.  That cannot be denied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider a kind of compromise course?  While leaving the county council the sole right to act as promoting authority, would he agree to have some provision whereby the urban district council might request the county council and <Col N="509" /> only on meeting a refusal from the county council the urban district council could have some right of appeal to the Minister to try to get something going, if there was that conflict?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that in certain circumstances a conflict does exist.  I shall be quite prepared when I take this to the Seanad to look into the suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Everett and Deputy P. Brennan.  I do not think there would be much difficulty in doing what they suggest.  It could well be that friction might exist between an urban authority and a county council for some reason or other.  The Deputy must appreciate also what he might be drawing on the Wicklow County Council, for example.  Suppose I agreed to let the Wicklow urban council initiate and promote a scheme and the Minister for Finance put up 80 per cent. of the cost and the other 20 per cent. and the maintenance charges fell on the promoting authority, that might be all right if we were talking about a figure of £150 or £400.  What would happen suppose an entire sea wall collapsed?  I am pointing out the dangers into which we might run. Instead of a county-at-large charge, one could then find oneself in a very difficult position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy Corry has in mind is, I think, the position of the Youghal urban council and the Cork County Council.  Difficulty arises there because there are people on the council from areas such as Rathluirc who have very little interest in the effect of the sea on towns such as Youghal and a majority of the county council might vote against such a benefit and such a vote might be unjust.  There is that aspect. However, I shall see if the machinery suggested by Deputy O'Higgins can be incorporated.  It could be very important and it is perhaps as well to cater for it now.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that coast protection works have been going on in Wicklow since 1907.  On 31st July last, the Minister received a deputation from the council.  They wanted a grant of 100 per cent towards the cost of the work; the Minister informed them he would give them a grant of 80 per cent.  On 12th October, the Commissioners were formally notified of the sanction of a grant of 80 per cent of the cost.  The expenditure was to be met under a certain subhead in our Vote.  Work commenced on 15th October.  Sanction was given on the 12th and work started on the 15th; I think the Office of Public Works should be commended on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These works are being carried out not by the Commissioners of Public <Col N="511" /> Works, as in the case of Rosslare, but by the Wicklow urban council under the supervision of the town surveyor. As the council are quite capable of carrying out the works, it is obvious that they are also capable of maintaining them.</P>

      <P>They would simply enable the Commissioners to maintain and subsequently recover the cost of maintenance from the Wicklow County Council.  I presume that is not the Deputy's intention.  I should like to make it clear that the provisions in the Bill with regard to Rosslare do no more than enable the Commissioners to maintain and recover the cost from the Wexford County Council.  It is as simple as that.  The works there are very different in character from those in Wicklow.

      <P>I have made that point.  The question of storm damage, <Col N="512" /> act of God, and progressive coast erosion took up a great part of this debate. Now is the time for the potentially benefiting to take the necessary steps at local authority level to have a thorough examination made in places like Lahinch, Kilkee, Youghal, Wicklow, Rosslare, Bundoran and all around the coast.  They can ask the county engineer or one of his assistants to examine these different areas to see if there is any danger or any possibility of progressive encroachment. A stitch in time may save a lot of money but it is not possible under this Bill to provide against the sudden storm or act of God.  It would be impossible to do that in any Bill because storms affect more than seaside and coastal resorts.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered, to the best of my ability, most of the points raised. I regret I could not be more cooperative, particularly with the Cork Deputies, but I think they appreciate the position now that it has been fully explained to them.  I trust Deputy Everett and Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy P.

I should like to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their co-operation and good wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the position of county registrars who act as returning officers.  It is true that the freedom and efficiency of our electoral system makes the foundation stone of our democratic state.  It follows, I believe, that the county registrar, acting as returning officer, is probably the most efficient single individual discharging a function in connection with elections.  It is a function which involves a high degree of skill and responsibility and entails long hours of overtime work, since the ordinary duties of the office of the county registrar must be discharged simultaneously. So far as I am aware, every other officer employed for official purposes at an election is&mdash;and rightly so &mdash;remunerated for the extra work involved.  The county registrar is the sole exception.  He receives no extra remuneration, although he has full responsibility for the smooth and efficient running of the election. Frequently he is out of pocket.</P>
      <P>A county registrar who discharges the function of a returning officer has to work outside normal office hours and has to travel a great deal, much of that also outside his normal office hours, through whatever constituency he is responsible for.  In addition, he has to oil the machinery and make sure the election machine works, all at his own expense.  So far as I know, if anyone other than a county registrar acts as returning officer, he is remunerated or paid extra for his services. For example, on certain occasions, senior counsel or solicitors or county secretaries, or even county managers, act as returning officers and when they perform such work, they are remunerated for the extra duties and paid the appropriate fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many members of the county registrar's staff who perform such functions are remunerated for them. The position, so far as I know, is that the county registrars are paid what is regarded as an inclusive salary and this salary is fixed on that basis to cover all the duties including the liability or responsibility for acting as returning officers at elections.  There would probably be some justification <Col N="514" /> for this if elections were held at fixed intervals, as local elections are, but in fact there is no regularity in regard to elections and if by-elections are taken into account, elections sometimes occur at intervals of six months or possibly less.  When you take account of by-elections and general elections, often elections occur at intervals much more frequent than the normal five years which apply in the case of local elections.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see, therefore, how any fixed remuneration could be applied to the work involved in such events.  While it is true that the pay of all civil servants is supposed to be inclusive and to cover whatever duties may be assigned to them, I think it is correct to say that an exception is made in the case of electoral duties. All civil servants and local officials are paid extra, with the sole exception of the county registrar.  For example, the clerks of the county registrar's office are all permanent, full-time civil servants.  They have duties to perform in connection with elections and they are paid for them.  This is not limited to the lower grades.  All officials who perform electoral work in connection with elections, whether local or presidential, or returning officers in connection with general elections, receive gratuities or extra emoluments in respect of the work, with the exception, as I said, of county registrars who perform the same work, and, indeed, have the full responsibility of ensuring that the work is carried out, without extra remuneration.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is a scale of fees in existence in respect of the various officials who perform these different duties and it would merely involve a Ministerial order to ensure that this scale would be extended to county registrars.  It is not equitable to make an exception of county registrars as the big responsibility whether in general elections, by-elections or local elections devolves on them.  As professional men, most of the officials of the various local authorities, or in certain cases where outside people are recruited for specific tasks, such as senior counsel, barristers or county managers, have an equitable rate of remuneration applied to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> For that reason, I believe there is a very strong case for remunerating county registrars in the same way as other officials are remunerated, and I want to put it to the Minister, now that this measure is being considered, because it is the first time for a number of years that we have had an opportunity of considering the electoral laws, that the matter should be examined on a sympathetic basis. It is for that reason I have raised it on this stage.  It may well be that it will be raised on certain sections of the Bill now before the House.  I believe there is a strong case for remunerating county registrars on some equitable basis comparable with that applied in respect of other personnel.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware of the situation in Dublin county where there are two constituencies in respect of which the county sheriff discharges the responsibility of returning officer.  He has responsibility for Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  For all practical purposes, the sheriff cannot discharge certain of the duties so he acts personally in respect of one constituency and engages the services of a professional man in respect of the other.  The practice for a great number of years has been to engage senior counsel for this work.  So far as I am aware, the person so engaged for that work is paid the appropriate scale of fees or salary in respect of the work discharged.</P>
    <P>So far as county constituencies are concerned, because the county registrar discharges these functions, he is not paid any extra remuneration merely because he is remunerated on what is regarded as an inclusive scale. However, if a county is divided, or two counties are joined together, he has the responsibility of running an election in two counties and he is obliged to engage the services of another person to operate one of them.  In such cases, the person so engaged is remunerated by the Department for the work performed.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which should receive sympathetic consideration when we are legislating afresh in electoral matters.  It is on that basis that I <Col N="516" /> mention the matter now on the Money Resolution so that the Minister may consider the matter and, I hope, draft the appropriate regulation so as to provide for payment to these people for work done in whatever elections are held in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the arguments put forward by Deputy Cosgrave in this matter.  In the measure now before the House for which this money is sought, it is contemplated that voting may go on until 11.30 o'clock at night and that voters in the polling booth at that time should have the opportunity of recording their votes.  It might well happen that voting would not end until after 11 o'clock at night.  Everybody is aware that in respect of the collection of the ballot boxes, particularly in the rural districts, the county registrar and a senior member of his staff have to be in attendance.  They have to receive the boxes and have them sealed up for the night.</P>
      <P>We might find these officials working from an hour before the opening of the poll, eight o'clock in the morning, until 2.30 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock the following morning.  This is something which the Minister ought to bear in mind in respect of these officials.  The amount involved in giving this payment to cover the extra time and labour would be a very small percentage of the total cost of any election.  It has been calculated that to give them the appropriate scale of fees would not cost more than three per cent of the cost of an election.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter sympathetically.</P>

      <P>During the Second Reading of the Bill, this matter was raised and I did agree to have a look at it.  I have done that.  The costs of elections, including the payment of the returning officers, are all paid from the Central Fund and are consequently under the control of the Minister for Finance.  As Minister of Local Government, I have no function in this matter.  I should say that the question of returning officers getting special payment for these matters has been <Col N="517" /> raised by them on several occasions and the answer has been on all these occasions that the salary is inclusive of such duties as these.  There it has rested.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance and not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like raising individual cases but, as I understand it, in a presidential election where the senior returning officer is concerned, in respect of cases where extra officials have to be recruited for the work they are paid an extra fee although in some cases they are civil servants or servants of local authorities and are accordingly remunerated on an inclusive basis.  Therefore although the title or description of whatever office they may hold may not be that of county registrar nevertheless they are remunerated on an inclusive basis.</P>
      <P>There is a case for allowing extra remuneration in respect of county registrars and while I appreciate that the Minister might not have direct responsibility in the matter, in so far as the scale of fees may be laid down by the Minister for Finance, I would suggest the Minister might make representations to the Minister for Finance that where a county registrar is involved in carrying out duties as returning officer in elections he should be allowed some extra remuneration to cover out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person is carrying out the duties of a returning officer which duties are outside his ordinary work and are not and never have been part of his terms of appointment, a distinction is recognised.  He is paid an extra amount in view of the fact that he is not doing a job which he would be normally expected to do or which falls within the office which he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of making representations I would suggest that this could be usefully and appropriately raised on the Estimate for the Department of Finance and also on the Estimate for the Courts of Justice because it is they who administer the scale of fees and who employ the county registrars.  In regard to my <Col N="518" /> making representations on their behalf, I would not at this short notice be prepared to accede to that request but I shall draw the attention of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice to what has been said here by both Deputies who have spoken.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall, by arrangements made with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, secure that the total cost of preparing and publishing the register of electors, shall be borne in approximately equal proportions by the State and by registration authorities.</P>
      <P>As I suggested previously on the Second Reading of this Bill this ought to be a central fund charge and the expense involved in the time taken in calculating the proportionate expenses as between the local authority and the central authority could be offset against what the expenditure would be without letting it fall on central funds alone.  I may be told that the register contains the list of jurors and that this is a matter for the local authority but the question of jury service and the details of making up the list of jurors is something which is of benefit in the administration of justice. Therefore, this charge should be borne by central funds, either under the Minister's Department or under the Department of Justice, rather than by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the present twothirds of the total cost of the preparation of a register and registration duties was borne by the local authorities. Under the present proposal that proportion is being reduced to one-half and on the nearest calculation we can <Col N="519" /> make we reckon that in all there will be a saving to the local authorities of about £10,000.</P>
      <P>On top of that, the method of compiling all the general work that will be entailed in future under the new proposals will be less onerous and as a result probably less costly than it has been in the past.  While we are not proposing to carry the entire burden of such expenditure we are reducing the amount that is to fall on the local rates, which is a considerable improvement. I should also point out that these registers and registrations are not solely for use in general elections, that they also have their uses in local elections.</P>
      <P>In regard to difficulties about calculations I cannot see how they should arise.  There will have to be a final bill drawn up, possibly authenticated and put properly before somebody or other.  When the sum total of costs has been calculated for any area, it is only a matter of dividing it by two and I do not see any real difficulty in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned relief of rates.  Only a small amount is involved in this matter but it would be very much appreciated if the Minister could see his way to take this charge.  Some of it should be borne by the Department of Justice.  I do not suggest that it should all be borne by the Minister's Department.  The jurors list comes under the administration of Justice. It should be paid from the Central Fund rather than from local authority finances.</P>

      <Col N="520" /> 1.  In page 11, lines 24 to 56, and in page 12, lines 1 to 36 to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>

    <P>This amendment is the substitution of this shorter form of words for what is already contained in subsection (2) as circulated.  As the House can see, the amendment shortens the subsection very considerably and it was our wish that this should be done, where possible. I understand that what the amendment contains is what was contained in all the lengthy verbiage of the original subsection.

      <P>&ldquo;(b) Where the candidate is not the candidate of a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties he shall be entitled to enter after his name on the nomination paper the expression &lsquo;Independent&rsquo; or &lsquo;Non-Party&rsquo; and two other descriptive words, and if he does so, the returning officer shall cause a statement of that expression and such words to be specified in relation to the candidate on all ballot papers and on notices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill gives the best opportunities to Parties.  Whereas up to now a nonentity in a Party might not get a vote at all because the supporters of the Party would be thinking in terms of personalities and might miss a nonentity on the panel, this Bill enables a nonentity to have alongside his name &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Labour&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo;.  A nonentity will not miss a vote in future.  This Bill ensures that.</P>
      <P>This Bill tries to tie us down and roll all non-Party candidates into one. There is the difference between chalk and cheese between Independents. There are Independent Ratepayers, Independent Tenants' Representatives. They may be out for each other's blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section also affects the ballot paper for municipal elections.  There may be 20 or 25 candidates and seven or eight Independents, often with similar names.  When certain people <Col N="523" /> look for their candidate's name on the ballot paper, they are not able to distinguish. The nonentity in the Party will get a vote, even though it may be the last vote but there will be trouble trying to distinguish between the non-Party Ratepayer, the non-Party Unionist, the non-Party Commonwealth candidate, and all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>In regard to this thing we call democracy, I have many misgivings.  It allows a change of Government.  That is the only thing in its favour.  After that, we have Bills like this to ensure that there is fair play and that whatever rule applies to one group applies to all.  The ballot paper should be so simple that even a nitwit will be able to cope and cast his vote according to his choice.  The electorate is made up of 60 to 70 per cent intelligent voters; there is another 20 per cent which might be described as a floating vote; and five to seven per cent are stupid people who ask questions like: &ldquo;Is de Valera going up here?&rdquo;  They ask all sorts of stupid questions.  The paper must be simplified for these.  Parties can make the best out of this because the voters will see &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, or whatever it is, and that will be sufficient indication.  In the case of the Independents, they will simply be &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;.  There have been cases when there were two candidates with the same name going up as Independents; there were two Mullens and two Carrolls on the panel.  There must be some distinction made as between one non-Party candidate and another.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows what &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; means.  The most stupid persons know that an Independent candidate is a member of no Party, though some Independents are really Party men.  I am not one of them; I sit by myself. I do not sit in the Independent seats in the corporation.  I am independent of all Independents.  I want to get that straight.  I am not worried about this section but ballot papers in municipal elections often carry as many as 25 names.  How could a voter make head or tail of such a paper with the simple description &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo; appearing several times?  All the Independents <Col N="524" /> ask is that they be allowed to continue to use the description &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;. If that request is not acceded to, there will be no fairness in this at all.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate Deputy Sherwin's attitude on this but we must remember that, up to this, there has never been any question of distinguishing between one candidate and another on the ballot paper.  It would appear from the arguments put forward by Deputy Sherwin now that by preventing &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; being put after the names in future, that will, in fact, create confusion.  The fact is &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; has never appeared on a ballot paper up to this and therefore the non-use of &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; does not really arise or alter the situation in any way at all.  In future, there will be a distinguishing mark and the application of &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo; will be sufficient indication as to what the particular name stands for, or does not stand for, if you like.  I cannot see that the Independents will lose anything. They never had any identity hitherto.</P>

      <P>What does that denote? Does it denote that the other Independents are a group?  If they are a group, they are no longer Independent. Yet the argument seems to be that we should, in fact, give legal standing to such a description of people who actually act together but describe themselves as independent in their actions.  I cannot really follow this argument.  It does not carry conviction to me.  &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; will, in my opinion, be a guide.  Surely that is the way those who regard themselves as <Col N="525" /> Independent would wish to be described? Surely that is the real difference between them and the rest of us who belong to political Parties and who are described as belonging to them?  Those who belong to no Party will be described as &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo;. That is, I think, as clear as it is possible to make the situation.</P>

In the campaign, they will be asking both clever and stupid to vote for them as Ratepayers but when those people come to the booth, they will look for Ratepayers but they will not see that; they will see &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo;. The Minister should remember the campaign will be waged on a distinctive type of Independent and when the people come in to vote, they will be looking for that description.  I would ask the Minister to think again, in addition to the promise he has already given, between now and the Report Stage about this point.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: That Section 21, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In going over this matter again, I felt the arrangement we have in regard to the latest time for nominations and the length of time for withdrawal of nominations is probably too short, particularly where it would concern a person nominated without his consent.  The proposal in the Bill is that the latest hour for receipt of a nomination by, or through a candidate in person, or through his agent or somebody representing himself to be an agent, would be 12 o'clock and that three hours later is the time in which to withdraw.  While I am not fully convinced, there is the point that the three hours may not be enough in the type of case I have mentioned where the returning officer is being &ldquo;codded&rdquo; by somebody for an ulterior motive, which I shall leave to Deputies' imagination.  I think three hours in that case is too short and I would propose to have the latest hour for nominations a day earlier and the latest time for withdrawals a day later, thus giving 24 hours in which to deal with all withdrawals, whether of this or any other type.  Instead of having two times, one for nominations handed <Col N="528" /> in personally and one for those handed in on behalf of somebody, we could have just one time by lengthening it to a point where it will be possible for a returning officer to notify the prospective candidate nominated in his absence by an alleged agent, by telegram or otherwise in writing so as to give him an opportunity of knowing he has been nominated and an opportunity of withdrawing before he goes into the list and becomes a candidate without knowing anything about it.</P>
      <P>I feel this is something that we should consider further.  I think we can arrange it so that it will not disturb the present procedure in regard to the date of the writ, the announcement and publication of the writ and the acceptance of nominations and polling day.  If we can do that, I propose to come to the House on Report Stage with such an amendment, primarily for the particular purpose I have mentioned and I think it will also be useful to all concerned to have a longer time between the closing date for nominations and the time for withdrawals.</P>

      <P>Subsection 6 says that the nomination paper should be delivered to the returning officer not earlier than on the second day for nominations and not later than 12 noon on the last day for receiving nominations.  In subsection 9 (1), the returning officer is required to rule on the nomination paper within one hour after its delivery.  It strikes me that if a paper is delivered at 12 noon on the last day for receiving nominations, the returning officer will find it very difficult to rule on the validity of that paper within an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that strikes me is <Col N="530" /> the fact that, as everybody knows, nomination papers are frequently left in the returning officer's office in his absence.  Somebody receives that nomination paper in good faith, intending to show it to the returning officer when he comes back, but, in fact, the paper will not be deemed to have been delivered to the returning officer until he accepts it himself and the person may have forgotten to show it to him. There is the danger that in such a case the candidate might find himself not properly nominated.  I should like to put these points forward for the consideration of the Minister in regard to these sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on the Minister's suggestion which, <i>prima facie</i>, appeals to me. Sometimes, if you try to take precautions against every possible contingency, you may create new difficulties. If an agent produces to a returning officer a properly authenticated document, to the effect that he has been nominated an agent by a candidate, he may then lodge nomination papers on behalf of that candidate and with those nomination papers, he must lodge £100 in cash or irrevocable cheque.</P>
      <P>If a malicious person goes to the returning officer with a completed document of agency and presents a false nomination, he will be guilty of the criminal offence of forgery and along with that, he will lose £100. What better evidence in writing can a returning officer have than a formally executed document of authorisation of an agent?  If you proceed to the precautions suggested by the Minister, the returning officer, on receipt of the nomination paper and the deposit from the authorised agent, will then send a letter or telegram to the person nominated asking for confirmation and if he does not receive that within 24 hours, he will declare the nomination void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all living in a new age.  At any moment the Minister might find himself in Geneva at a meeting of some international body.  Any one of us, but particularly members of the Government, might find ourselves <Col N="531" /> attending some essential duty in Geneva, Washington, Paris, Rome or Strasbourg.  The telegram is addressed to the home address of the prospective candidate who is abroad and it never reaches him.  The returning officer is faced with the fact that there is no confirmation and he declares the nomination invalid.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, the candidate is in the country and he writes to the returning officer.  He will not have time to do that in 24 hours.  Unless he can attend personally to confirm the validity of the nomination, the returning officer will be left under the impression that it is invalid.  However, suppose the returning officer gets the letter, is that any better evidence to the returning officer than the formal agency appointment which the agent displayed before the returning officer accepted the paper?</P>
    <P>While I admit that the Minister's proposal seemed to have much in its favour, on reflection I suggest to him that the existing safeguards are sufficient because if a situation arose against which the Minister wishes to make provision now, the agent would be guilty of a criminal offence in presenting a forged instrument; the agent would lose £100 in order to play the joke and the agent would have committed a further statutory offence, probably under the existing Electoral Acts, in having attempted to put in the nomination of a person for whom he was not authorised to speak.  There are certain limits of precaution beyond which one cannot go.  The existing safeguards are probably adequate but the additional safeguard the Minister has in mind would, in my judgment, create dangers greater than the danger against which he wishes to provide.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to associate myself with the problem raised by Deputy Jones.  I remember on two occasions in my own personal experience nominations being handed in to the returning officer within five minutes of the last available hour.  The Deputy has a very valid point: in those circumstances how can the returning officer proceed to rule on the paper within the hour because if he is free <Col N="532" /> to rule within the hour, it automatically extends the period of nomination for an hour beyond the statutory limit for nomination?  It is probably true that the time of three hours for withdrawal is too short and <i>prima facie</i> I cannot see any objection to extending the period for withdrawals to 24 hours.</P>
    <P>I have known cases, again in my personal experience, where people have been nominated and have elected to withdraw.  It is administratively convenient &mdash; and one must not forget the urgency that attends getting out all the election literature, getting ballot papers printed, and so forth &mdash; to allow a period of 24 hours for withdrawal. That would be a sensible precaution, but if administrative problems make that extremely difficult, I would consent to a period of 12 hours from the last available hour at which it is legitimate to make a nomination but I prefer a period of 24 hours.  If that is administratively possible, I suggest to the Minister he should content himself with extending the period for withdrawals to 24 hours and with examining the problem posed by Deputy Jones as to how the returning officer can in fact rule on the validity of a paper an hour after the last hour laid down in the statute for accepting valid nomination papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon in regard to the desirability of simplicity in these arrangements.  One of the weaknesses of the present legislation is that there is a lot of red tape in which people can become very easily entangled but I am not sure that the point in regard to the agency would apply under the proposed legislation because under Section 21 (3) if a candidate is not nominated himself but has been nominated by someone else, the person making the nomination is not required to produce any instrument of agency at all.  It is quite possible for any person, provided he is a registered Dáil elector, to nominate someone else and the existing arrangements under the electoral laws are that if an election agent is being appointed who can deal with the question of nomination of a <Col N="533" /> candidate, the appointment of the election agent must be in writing and must be notified to the returning officer, but under the section it does not seem to me that anything in writing is necessary.</P>
      <P>I was also wondering in connection with this question of whether a deposit of £100 is an adequate safeguard, whether someone with a keen mind might not be able to get around that if he wanted to play a joke.  Section 20 of the Act provides that a deposit of £100 may be made in legal tender or, with the consent of the returning officer, in any other manner.  It is at the moment quite customary for the returning officer to accept for the deposit a guaranteed cheque.  If a person nominates someone else and at the last available hour produces to the returning officer a guaranteed cheque, that will be accepted by the returning officer who then has an hour within which to adjudicate the validity of the paper.  He adjudicates on the validity of the paper and decides that the nomination is valid.  There is nothing to prevent the person who made the nomination then writing or telephoning to his bank and stopping the cheque so that there is a nomination without any authority in writing.  A deposit is paid and subsequently stopped and I do not see that anyone has committed an offence under the proposals before us.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that the controlling body of my profession recommended&mdash; because, I understand, of that very danger&mdash;that instead of guaranteed cheques being used for the purpose of completing convenient transactions, they should be done by means of a bank order.  However, there is no point in going into technicalities.  If the Minister examines it, he will see that I am right.</P>
      <P>The point I was going on to make from that, on the assumption that I am correct, is, should there not be a provision in the Bill that in an eventuality such as that, if the State do not in fact get the deposit because of the guaranteed cheque being withdrawn, should that not automatically cause the disqualification of the candidate in respect of whom the cheque was given?  I am very much in favour of trying to simplify this thing as much as possible.  I think Deputy Dillon is 100 per cent. right when he refers to the desirability of simplicity in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in this seems to be to ensure that the person so nominated consents to be nominated.  Did the Minister ever think of having included in the nomination form a form of consent by the candidate?  I know in respect of very many organisations, for any position in the organisation down to committee man a nomination would not be accepted unless there was the signature of the person nominated.  That could get over a lot of your difficulties.</P>
      <P>I will not say a returning officer is bound but it is natural to assume that he would accept the signature of a James Dillon or a Neil Blaney or any person who is nominated as being an actual signature.  Signatures are accepted for many purposes although the person may not be personally known to the man who is charged with, say, accepting a nomination. There would be extreme difficulty, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, in trying to locate the man to know whether or not he agrees to be nominated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often occurred to me that one <Col N="535" /> of the difficulties in respect of nominations is that there is no provision on a nomination paper for the signature of assent by the nominee.  That should suffice.  It is a serious thing if a proposer or one who purports to be an agent nominates a person without his consent and forges his signature.  A lot of this difficulty could be avoided if the Minister would consider a form of assent to be included in the nomination paper.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a mountain being made out of a molehill here.  As far as Dáil elections are concerned the biggest danger would be in regard to withdrawal.

      <P>Probably.  In the case of a candidate at a general election there is a sum of £100 involved.  Some people speak as if £100 were a very minor matter.  The danger of somebody being nominated against his will is not very great.  In the case of local authority elections we all know that the town fool on numerous occasions has been nominated when there was no deposit.  It could happen that a succession of people could be nominated without their knowledge.  That is the only case where proof that the candidate did consent would be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, went along quite a bit with what I had hoped I had conveyed to the House as to what might be done by way of change to ensure that only nominations of persons who wished to go forward at an election were in fact accepted as valid nominations.  The idea of sending a telegram or other such communication that the candidate was a prospective candidate is my idea, certainly, but not that it should be sent in order that it might be confirmed back.  My idea was that as soon as a nomination <Col N="536" /> is accepted on behalf of a prospective candidate who is not available in person it should be communicated by telegram, letter or otherwise&mdash;it does not matter.  If it can be done personally, even, by the registrar, that is all right. But, the notice having been sent out saying to this person: &ldquo;You are now duly nominated and will be contesting and appearing on the ballot paper for this forthcoming election,&rdquo; there I would propose that the matter ends unless the prospective candidate comes back and says, as he would if he had not given his consent: &ldquo;I have not consented.  I do not wish to stand.  I want my name withdrawn.&rdquo;  That is really a slight correction that I would make to the Leader of the Opposition's view of what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>Over and above that what I should also say is that a number of smaller, possibly still very important, things have been directly or indirectly raised as a result of this suggestion of mine that I should have another look at this matter for a particular reason but these other little matters add up to the point that if we can find it administratively possible, and I think we can, to extend the time for withdrawals, a number of difficulties, the smaller ones that have been mentioned as well as the bigger ones, would be got over by having a longer time within which to make withdrawals.  All I am suggesting to the House for their prior notice is that having had this thought, I should like to look further at it.  What I have suggested is what I believe may be the way of doing the job, if possible, and I would propose to come back on the Report Stage with a proposal on some such lines.  In the meantime, if any Deputy has any other idea on this matter I should be glad to hear from him, apart altogether from anything that has been said in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Corish is very fine and would seem to close the gaps right away but to create another one, that is, that if we prescribe a form of consent, <Col N="537" /> written or otherwise, we immediately create an insuperable difficulty in some cases where prospective candidates, probably sitting Deputies, may not be in the country or it may not be possible to get them back into the country in time to do any signing.</P>

      <P>It is true that it is special treatment in a sense but it would be only to those who would be going forward.  That is what I want to get.  We want to prevent the situation that people will be nominated who do not wish to stand.  In doing that we must be careful that we do not prevent people from going forward who would wish to stand.  If we had to take a decision at any time as to which of the two things we most wished to avoid we would come down on the side of ensuring that everybody who might want to go forward would get there rather than excluding somebody who in fact should not be accepted.  It may be that these things overlap slightly but, again, I would say to the House that it is my intention to go into this matter further.  I would appreciate any further comments by Deputies between now and Report Stage and, as a guide, I have given my idea of what change I feel might be necessary and, if administratively feasible, I will probably come back on <Col N="538" /> Report Stage with the proposal that we do it somewhat on the lines I have indicated.</P>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Jones is concerned, he raised on the Second Stage this matter about withdrawal.  Regardless of what the number of hours that may be allowed for withdrawal, he was concerned about the ease with which somebody might withdraw a candidate's name and probably might withdraw it wrongfully.  That really is what was concerning Deputy Jones on Second Reading.  The only thing I can say is that it is part of this whole section that we have so far being talking about.  I intend to see whether or not we can in fact meet to some degree the point of view put by Deputy Jones and to come with a fairly open mind again to the House with something that we can discuss at greater length.  There are certain arguments for and against any change in the form we have here.  Since we are likely to discuss this again at length, I do not think I should go into it any further at this moment.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (1) (b), it is provided that polling</P>
      <P>shall continue for such period, not being less than twelve hours, between the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. as may be fixed by the Minister by order, subject to the restriction that, in the case of a general election, he shall fix the same period for all constituencies.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister contemplate under this subsection hours from 8.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.?  It says not less than 12 hours, but it could be more than 12 hours.  Is it the intention to extend it for more than 12 hours?</P>

We have, of course, experience of polling for 12½ hours under the existing law&mdash;that is, from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  The whole idea of extending the hours is to give some little flexibility.  If we felt 13 or 14 hours were an advantage we might make it 13 or 14 hours.  The present intention, however, is not to extend it.  This is designed to give more flexibility in regard to starting and finishing.</P>

      <P>We are thinking now of the candidates.  We should also think of the staff.  The trouble is one does not find many people coming to vote early in the morning, except, perhaps, in the larger towns and cities where the office workers may avail of the facility.  Opening at 8.30 in the morning is of no use to manual workers, all of whom start work at 8 o'clock.  Only a very small section, therefore, will be facilitated by this earlier opening.  It seems rather absurd to suggest that the polling station should remain open until 10 p.m. in the middle of winter&mdash; in the months of October or February <Col N="540" />&mdash;in the heart of the country where there is no proper lighting.  The Minister should have another look at this. I can understand the desire for some flexibility but there is the danger that, having the provision there, we might wake up and find ourselves in the winter months with the polling stations open from 8.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. That would not be desirable.</P>

      <P>There is just one small point with regard to subsection (b) where it is stated the Minister shall fix the same period for all constituencies.  Does that mean an identical period as to date as well as time?  I have in mind some of the islands off the coast &mdash; the Minister's own constituency enters into the picture here&mdash;where special arrangements have to be made because of rough weather, and so on.  I am wondering if the Minister is quite safe in this subsection. Will he be able to make whatever special arrangements may be necessary for these island voters?</P>

      <P>We deal with that in a later section, Section 34.  With regard to Deputy Tully's point, the very fact that we can start earlier in the morning means that where it is desirable not to go on as late as 10.30 p.m., by starting at 8.30 in the morning we can stop at 9 or 9.30 p.m.  This can be an advantage.  It is there to be used advantageously, not to discourage people from coming.  The whole idea is to encourage the greatest number to come.</P>

      <P>That must have been quite an arrangement.  My experience in this matter in the elections in which I have participated is that all who participate in elections are of the same mind in trying to avoid any acrimonious discussion or undesirable incidents in regard to objections to people, after it becomes known they have been appointed.  That has come about by having a little liaison with returning officers to ensure that if <Col N="542" /> objectionable people are likely to be appointed, again it will be quietly pointed out to the officials beforehand. In nine cases out of ten, the returning officer acts on this because he does not want any trouble and the more harmony he can achieve with all concerned, the more chance he has of carrying out his work effectively and efficiently.</P>

      <P>I agree that is probably the best way out of it but we have all had experience&mdash;I have had at any rate&mdash;of canvassing with an opposition man and finding him acting as a poll clerk on the day of the election.  The big trouble is to secure some definite arrangement that if the presiding officer is somebody who is non-Party, the poll clerk should be in the same position.  We should not overlook the fact that very often the poll clerk may have been canvassing for somebody the day before or may have got a promise of support from somebody and that person, on seeing him in the booth, may vote other than he intended to vote, for fear the vote might be disclosed or something like that.</P>

I think, under existing legislation and under this section, the presiding officer if he wishes can delegate his functions, if he becomes indisposed or for some such reason, to the poll clerk who will then take over?</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before subsection (4), to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The returning officer or presiding officer may, and if so required on behalf of any candidate shall, administer to any voter at the time of his tendering his vote and not afterwards on oath (or in the case of any person who objects to taking an oath on the ground that he has no religious belief or that the taking of an oath is contrary to his religious belief) an affirmation in the following form:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" />&lsquo;I swear by Almighty God (or I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm) that I am the same person as the person whose name appears as ..................... on the register of electors now in force for the constituency of ............................... and that I have not already voted at this election.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All down the years, as we know, the oath was always retained in the conduct of parliamentary elections.  When the Committee on Electoral Law Reform considered this matter very exhaustively, it was decided to leave the oath there for the purpose of preventing personation.  On the Second Reading, I mentioned this matter and the Minister said we were providing increased penalties.  I then pointed out that while that was so, these would come after the fact.  One of the greatest deterrents to the person who does not give much thought to the seriousness of what he is doing in coming into the polling station to personate a vote, is the fact that he is made to subscribe by way of oath or solemn affirmation that he is the person whose vote he claims and also that he has not voted already in the election.</P>
    <P>It is well known that despite the meticulous care that may be given to the drafting of the voters lists, it will happen that a person's name appears in two different polling areas within the constituency.  In modern times, it is quite feasible for a person to move from one area to another and to claim these votes.  I am sure nobody wants to see that happen.  The personation agents in the booth have a solemn duty to see that polling is carried out as laid down by the Oireachtas and that the result which comes from the election shall be genuinely the will of the voters.  We should take every step to ensure that nothing untoward will occur.</P>
    <P>No matter what penalties you may impose for an offence, there are always people prepared to take a chance.  I believe that apart from monetary penalties, the one thing that will act as a deterrent of which there can be no evasion is the fact that these people <Col N="545" /> must submit, if challenged, to being sworn in regard to this matter.  We feel very strongly that the Minister should not remove this provision which has been in the legislation since the electoral laws were first drafted and that he should not remove it now, particularly having regard to the fact that this matter was considered at length by the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his Second Reading speech that he had thoughts on this matter and that the Committee was not the only body that was giving thought to it.  I am prepared to accept that but I am not prepared to accept that the report of the Committee which left in this form of oath and affirmation should not be implemented in the Bill and that we should take the oath, which has been so long in existence, out of our electoral law.  It could happen that personation would take place and I believe that a solemn affirmation or oath is a greater deterrent than any monetary penalty imposed after the offence is proved.  I believe it is much more desirable that we should use the deterrent in the first instance by imposing the obligation to affirm or take the oath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Jones.  From my experience, I have found that the oath is a real deterrent and it prevents personation at the right time.  I have known cases where would-be vote-stealers have run out of the booth when they were challenged and asked to swear. Most Irish people regard the act of taking an oath as something very grave. I believe we should put that protection at the right side of the vote, not after the vote has been cast.  The Minister will be stepping backwards if he takes this provision out of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will dispute that the primary object of this whole Bill is to eliminate from our electoral law all unnecessary formalities, restrictive details and other obsolete provisions. I would say very strongly that this provision for an oath is an obsolete provision, that it is an unnecessary formality and that it is not a protection, but that it is a deterrent to <Col N="546" /> people who are genuinely entitled to vote and who are afraid to go to the polling station because they know that they were challenged and asked to take the oath on a previous occasion.  There are many people in this country who would forego their votes rather than take a solemn oath in respect of something which, in their opinion, is not worth it.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, we have increased the penalty for the offence of personation from £100 to £500 and, in addition, a possible six months in prison, either in addition to or in substitution for that.  Surely no one will really be convinced that the person who would take a chance on a £500 fine or six months' imprisonment, or both, will be deterred because of the fact that he will be asked to take an oath?  In addition, these people can dodge the taking of the actual oath by saying that they object to taking it on religious grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen it happen in my constituency that certain personation agents blackguarded voters because they did not like to take an oath.  That blackguarding has prevented and deterred people entitled to vote from going to the poll because they were afraid of being challenged to take the oath.  A £500 fine or six months in gaol, or both, is surely a sufficient deterrent and, if brought to the notice of the public, will be the most effective deterrent against personation on anything like a scale that would cause a change in the results.  If personation is known to exist to such an extent that it will bring about a result which should not be brought about, there can be a petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason why we should continue with this oath, particularly when the people you want to deter are not going to be deterred by it and can sidestep it by pleading religious grounds for not taking it.  It may well be asked why should we take it away in the general case and not take it away in the case of blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters.  In the ordinary case identification can be <Col N="547" /> established.  In so far as the blind, illiterate or incapacitated voter is concerned, only the voter himself can determine that.  If there is a question of a person's blindness, illiteracy, or incapacity, that question can be determined by the person taking the oath. However, I would rather see even that going than that the oath should be continued as part of the section to which Deputy Jones proposes the amendment.</P>
    <P>I believe it is something we should get rid of, that it serves no useful purpose, that it has not served that purpose in the past, and rather that it has deterred people who are entitled to vote from doing so because of whispers and rumours that if they present themselves at the polling booth, they will be challenged and asked to take the oath.  That will continue to happen if we leave the oath in the section.  The £500 fine with or without six months' imprisonment is the real answer to the problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been talking about two matters on which I do not agree with him.  One is that persons have been intimidated from voting because they were afraid they would have to take an oath.  Surely the presiding officer would not be doing his job if he allowed the personation agents to challenge everybody <Col N="548" /> going into the booth?  The other question is that of the penalty.  It has never been £100 or anything like it; it has always been the minimum.  It has been pleaded that the poor fellow did not know or that he was carried away by enthusiasm.  He usually gets away with a fine of £5 and I understand that on one occasion that £5 was made up to the person concerned by his Party.  He did lose his right to vote for a while but that did not matter because there was no election in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>It has always worked out that way. A man who steals another person's vote and then casts his own vote can get away with a fine of £5.  The same thing can happen under the existing law.  I am afraid I shall have to agree with Deputy Jones that the oath is the only deterrent as far as these smart fellows are concerned.  It at least makes people declare they are the people referred to and does not allow the smart fellows to chance their arm. Unfortunately, the fellow I am talking about was not challenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a mistake in his attitude with regard to this matter.  He referred, as I understood him, to the person who used to regard the oath as a formality.  I think most of us will agree that, in the normal Irish constituency, whether it be a city or a rural constituency, the ordinary Irish person does not regard the oath as a formality.</P>
      <P>The Minister's description of how the powers that were there were misused in his constituency&mdash;he spoke of people blackguarded by being threatened they would have to take the oath and that, for that reason, they stayed away from the polls&mdash; emphasises the argument that those people and the average Irish person do not regard the taking of an oath as a formality.  They regard it for what it is&mdash;calling on God to witness that what they are saying is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who go into the polling booth, no matter how enthusiastic they are politically, no matter how misguided they are in their political enthusiasm, and maybe quite prepared <Col N="549" /> to do so&mdash;as they might regard it as part of the game or part of the war if you like, to go in and endeavour to personate another voter&mdash;will not do it if they must swear.  They are brought up against it straight away and will stop doing it if there is any risk that they may have to take a false oath in order to cast the vote.  I think most Deputies will assure the Minister that that is the reaction of the ordinary Irish voter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken in his attitude to this.  I believe the amount of personation done in elections nowadays is very small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I think it is very small.  There are two types of personated votes.  There is what I regard with horror&mdash;as I think most people do&mdash;the person who steals another person's vote; the person who tries to get in early to take somebody else's vote so that that person cannot vote.  That is the very worst type of personation.  There is the other type&mdash; I think everyone who is in politics knocks across it during the course of some election&mdash;where a person who honestly wants to vote finds he will not be there on election day and tries to get somebody else to vote for him. That is equal, so far as the law is concerned: the penalty for either type is just the same.  They are both offences.</P>
      <P>It would be worth our while considering if it might not be possible to facilitate a person who, through illness or unavoidable absence on polling day, wants to get his vote cast.  Arrangements might be made to allow that to be done.  It would remove the temptation which exists in one of the types of personation I am talking about. The Minister should have another look at the proposition made by Deputy Jones.  If the Minister discusses it with his Party, he will be surprised at the number of people there whom he will find agreeing with Deputy Jones's proposition.</P>

      <P>So far as personation goes, I have a lot of experience. I am in a better position to talk about it than a Party man.  A Party man cannot afford to talk too much or he might embarrass his friends.  Being an Independent, I can spill the beans, as the saying is.  I know for a fact that in the election of 1922, one-third of the votes cast were the result of personation.  The boys went in on both sides.  The battalions marched in in every area.  That is admitted by all. For some years after the Civil War, both sides organised and marched in in groups, in large armies.  I know; I was a member of Sinn Féin after the Civil War.  I saw the group I was with.  There were a dozen of them there for no purpose other than personation. That was the case with both sides. However, we agree it is not as bad as that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is done.  I would say that from 50 to 100 must be handed into practically every Party headquarters in Ireland.  I am an Independent.  They even knock at my door.  I got about a dozen.  People said, for instance: &ldquo;Johnny cannot vote; get someone to vote.&rdquo;  I have no Party to &ldquo;stiff&rdquo; for me.  Otherwise, I probably would have &ldquo;stiffed&rdquo;.  My argument is that there is only one way <Col N="551" /> to nullify an evil and that is to do it yourself.  However, I was not in a position to do it.  It is still done and always will be done.  It should be an offence to attempt to personate.</P>
      <P>The one thing that gives a person courage is the card.  Around election time, I know that there are certain people&mdash;they are all members of the Party&mdash;who are professionals at this business.  They turn up at election time and offer their services, as I know. The one thing they want is a card. Once they have the card, they go in with courage.  They know the fellow sitting at the table will be afraid to challenge them.  Do not forget that. What is to be done about that?  It is the card.  If they had no card, they would not chance their arm.  It is the card which is important.  The election agents are looking on.  Their attitude is: &ldquo;We might be brought to court.&rdquo; What about the false card?  Would the Minister think that over?  If you can cope with that, you will end personation. Very few people will have a chance unless they have a card: remember that.</P>
      <P>The Party agents might have their suspicions.  They might ask a man to be sworn and that might act as a deterrent.  The person will make excuses and refuse to be sworn and get out. There is that point of view.  The agent is not too certain.  He has a suspicion. He should have that right.  He might be afraid to challenge a man in case he might be sued in the courts.</P>
      <P>Here is a further point.  Will the Minister do something about protecting agents because the one thing the agents are afraid of is that if they make a mistake, they might be sued in court.  Protect the agents and deal with this problem so that fellows with cards belonging to other people will be afraid to come in and you will end personation.  There is a little point in the oath.  Where an agent is not too sure, he will risk demanding that an oath be taken.  That would put the wind up the other fellow because he would not know what would be coming. There is a point in it.</P>

      <P>When replying to this point the Minister said that when this <Col N="552" /> Committee sat, its object was to tidy up the legislation.  I agree that was the object of the Committee.  I was a member of that Committee and what was hoped was that a piece of legislation would be brought in which would be forward in its thinking and that the Bill which would result from the labours of this Committee would be an agreed measure and could be recommended as such.  The weakness of the Minister's case in this regard is that while the Committee recognised the necessity for simplicity, for bringing the law up to date and for all the other provisions which ought to be made in regard to the conduct of elections, they still thought it was worth while to keep the provision in regard to the oath in the legislation.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that personation does not occur on a wide scale but that is all the more reason why we ought to ensure that it is lessened still further.  The type of person who attempts this type of offence is somebody who is generally led to do it. He is not as clear thinking as he might be and is urged to do this.  I have myself seen young people urged to go in and claim a vote because they were of the same name.  I saw it happen in the last election but when challenged, these young people immediately recognised the seriousness of the offence and refused to be sworn on that occasion. It was a useful deterrent and the weakness of the Minister's argument can be seen in the fact that the Committee considered this provision ought to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He is covered if he has reasonable grounds for believing there is personation, even if it is discovered afterwards that he was wrong.  In addition, the returning officer and the presiding officer are fully covered in any of these matters.  All these persons are covered by subsection (2) of Section 26 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, in respect of any action they may have had to take as a result of attempted personation or actual personation.</P>
      <P>That type of deterrent is a much more readily understood one and much more justified, since it is a real deterrent.  If the penalties are published prominently, as I hope they will be, in future in each polling station then I do not think we shall have any continuance of personation even on a small scale.  I do agree that personation at present is on a small scale but, small though it is, I think it will gradually get smaller until it ultimately disappears altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that some man he knew was fined £5 and lost his vote for so many years.  The losing of the vote is now gone by the board under these proposals.  That £5 fine would be one-twentieth of the old maximum.  If he were fined one-twentieth of the new maximum, then that would be £25. If instead of depriving him of his <Col N="554" /> vote for four or five years, it is decided to give him a few days in jail, it should be a great deterrent.  Of course, if the court so decides, it can impose a sentence of up to six months. The House does not fully appreciate how severely these people would be dealt with when they feel this offence will continue and that the form of oath is a better deterrent than the fine and the possible jail sentence.  I do not think the courts will treat this matter as lightly as has been suggested here. To my knowledge on the few occasions on which I have seen people prosecuted in my own constituency, they were dealt with pretty severely.  They were fined and disqualified from voting.  The disqualification does not arise now but I do feel the fine and the jail sentence is the real answer, provided the personation agents will continue to act in the future in the polling stations, because of their local knowledge of the people on the list of voters, in the manner in which they are there to operate.  If they will challenge and point out these people where they have reasonable grounds for believing they are attempting personation, they can have such people arrested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be the maximum.  When you are asking a personation agent to bring a person to justice, you are asking him to bring that person to justice for this very large sum and it is a very serious penalty.  I do not know any personation agent who is just that tough in the country or anywhere else.  If it were a reasonable fine, he would be covered.  It is essential that the oath should be administered. I am supporting the amendment and the Minister should consider it.  The Minister should allow the oath to be administered in order to protect the person from the penalty of £500 or six months.  Because of the <Col N="555" /> oath, he will not personate.  To charge him with attempting to personate will not be regarded as so serious an offence by the court.  At least a defence can be made for that.  In a case in which 18 people were involved in personation, the Attorney General said it was only a frivolous prank by youngsters.</P>
      <P>The administration of the oath is important.  The personation agent should be authorised to request the administration of the oath.  In that way, he would not be running any risk of false arrest or imprisonment.  As the law stands, he is not protected.  The presiding officer, the tally clerk and all the officials are protected, but there is no protection for Deputy Carter's agent or my agent in the polling booth. If, in perfectly good faith, he gets a person arrested but an error is made, the defendant has a right of action against the personation agent.  If the agent had the right to request the administration of the oath, it would help to prevent personation; the agent would be protected; and we would have a smoother working of the system than will be provided by the section.  Since the Committee recommended that the oath be retained, I am astounded that the Minister should leave out that recommendation.  I could understand his defending his action if the Committee had rejected that proposal.  Instead, the Minister is imposing his opinion on theirs.</P>

      <P>Whenever any person is arrested under this Act in consequence of a charge made by a personation agent that such person had committed the offence of personation, and either such personation agent fails to appear before the District Justice and support such charge, or the District Justice acquits such person of having committed the offence and finds that the charge was made by the personation agent without reasonable or sufficient cause, the District Justice may, at the request of the person so charged but not otherwise, order the personation agent to pay to such person such sum not exceeding £20 as the District Justice shall think proper by way of damages, and such sum when duly paid shall be accepted by the person so charged in full satisfaction of all claims by him in respect of the said charge and his arrest and detention thereon.</P>

      <P>That is the case where the personation agent for a candidate wrongfully accuses someone. He is liable to be ordered to pay compensation up to a maximum of £20. That deals with only one aspect of the case mentioned by Deputy MacEoin. It still does not get us any further at all on the question of the person who is endeavouring to steal another person's vote and who will be prevented from doing that because he will not go against his conscience and take a false oath but who, if that restriction is removed, will be quite prepared <Col N="557" /> to go in and endeavour to steal another person's vote on behalf of his political Party out of misguided enthusiasm. That is the kernel of the problem which exists if the Minister persists in refusing to accept Deputy Jones's suggestion and to allow the position now obtaining to remain, where the oath is retained as part of the electoral law.</P>

      <P>The Minister has contrasted the procedure in this section with that of the subsequent section, Section 27, where he retains the oath. He can find a good deal of sympathy for people who may be deterred from voting by reason of the fact they may be sworn.  Has the Minister sympathy for the illiterate person who goes into a polling booth?  Many people do not like to be branded to the countryside as illiterate.  If somebody is to blackguard them, to use the Minister's phrase, by having them swear they are so illiterate they cannot vote, how does the Minister equate his sympathy for one side with the other?  The Minister says you cannot measure a man's blindness, but you are going to make him swear he is so illiterate he cannot vote.  The Minister can see his way to get rid of the oath in this section, but cannot see his way to get rid of it so far as the illiterate person is concerned.  I cannot see the equality of the treatment the Minister is prepared to give.</P>

      <P>Look; if there were any other penalties appropriate to cases such as these, I would have opted for them.  What I did say, and would like to repeat, is that in the case of a person's identity being in question, where he comes in and there is a question of whether he may be attempting personation or not, his identity can be established in fact.  You cannot establish whether a person is so blind, so incapacitated or so illiterate that he cannot mark his own votes. The oath which it is proposed to retain here is the one measure taken where there is a grave doubt as to whether he would not be able to mark his votes. He would be asked to swear that he is not able to mark his paper.  He has already submitted that he cannot.  It is only when he is challenged that this oath would apply.  There is no penalty by way of law, legal proceedings or court proceedings in his case as there is in the other cases.  That is the difference of approach and that is why I have had this difference of approach, although, as I have said, I would prefer if we could wipe out the procedure of the oath in this second part and, indeed, I would suggest to the House that, if Deputies are of that mind, I would be prepared to come in on the next Stage with a proposal that it should be left out of that section altogether.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider this?&mdash;the Minister is making play with the fact that in Section 27 no penalty is set out.  The Minister will agree with me that if a person is administered the oath under Section 27 and takes it and if it is still not believed that the position is as he swears it and if that can be proved, that person can be charged with perjury and suffer all the penalties applicable to a perjurer when convicted in court.  So that, while penalties may not be set out in the section, that does not mean that there are not penalties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as I have already pointed out to the Minister, without being prosy about it, there is no doubt that, particularly today, the badge of the free man is his right to vote.  An illiterate person or blind person is entitled to vote if he is on the register <Col N="559" /> of electors.  The Minister is saying to him: &ldquo;If you claim to be blind or if you claim to be illiterate, no matter what badge of freedom you wear, you will not be allowed to vote unless you swear to it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point in connection with the Minister's argument.  The Minister argues that the reason for that is that a person's degree of blindness or illiteracy is not something that can be proved by anyone except the person himself, that he is the only person who knows exactly how blind or how illiterate he is.</P>

      <P>No; do not misquote me.  I allege and suggest and submit that it is only those persons themselves who can determine whether they are so blind, so incapacitated or so illiterate as to be unable to mark their ballot papers properly.  The Deputy is saying that I have said that they are the only people who can determine how blind, how incapacitated or how illiterate they are.  That is not the same thing.</P>

      <P>But on the other hand, he says that, as regards a person's identity, that can be proved, if you like, externally, by proof other than the answering of the person to the questions which may be put to him under Section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I want to put it to the Minister that there are two different types of personation. There is the question of the person who is going in to vote in another person's name.  There is also the question of a person who is registered as a voter, either twice in the same constituency or, in the case of a general election, in two or three different constituencies.  It can happen. A person who is a business man in the city of Dublin and who is residing in Wicklow or Meath or Kildare will be on the register in the constituency where his office or business is in Dublin and he will be on the register for his home address in Wicklow, Kildare or Meath and it is an offence for him to vote twice.  How can that be established except by the person himself and if he is not to be required to swear as to whether or not he has previously voted in the election, how else can it be established?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me that you can ring up the booth in Donnybrook and find out if Mr. AB has voted there.  You might, but is that any proof that AB in fact did vote, even though his name is crossed off the presiding officer's register?  The only person who really knows and can give adequate evidence as to whether or not he has already voted in the election is the person who comes in to cast the vote and who, we suggest, should, if challenged, be required to swear to the position.  The Minister says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that it is enough simply to ask him the question.  I think the Minister is all wrong.</P>
    <P>While, as I said already, I believe the amount of personation that goes on at the moment is very little, if the Minister pushes this through the House, it will be an encouragement to the person who wants to personate votes in the future and this effort at personation may become rampant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one more question.  The Minister is depending solely as a deterrent on a heavy fine and sentence.  That is all right if that is applied but, if the boys know that it is not to be applied, then there is no deterrent at all.  The fact remains that when a person is charged with personation, he is a member of <Col N="561" /> one Party or the other and if by chance he is a member of the Party in power, the Attorney General will have a vested interest in that person's personation and will just drop the charge, as has been done, and if it happens that there is a sentence, will reduce the sentence.  Nothing will happen.  Once it is known that the deterrent will not be applied, there is no deterrent at all.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that there is a minimum sentence of a week in gaol?  As long as it is known that there will be a sentence of seven days in Mountjoy, we will get some results. Will the Minister consider taking the question as to whether a charge is to be brought or not out of the hands of the Attorney General and provide that it will be solely a matter for an inspector or superintendent of the Garda?  So long as the bringing of a charge rests with a person who has a vested interest in the person who personated, the whole thing fails.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) provides:</P>
      <P>A request made by an elector within four hours before the hour fixed for the closing of the poll to have his ballot paper marked for him under this Rule otherwise than by a companion may be refused by the presiding officer if, in his opinion, having regard to the number of electors then coming in to vote or likely to come in to vote before the close of the poll, his acceding to such request would interfere with the proper discharge of his duties or would unduly obstruct the voting of other electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something that should be brought to the notice of the electorate. The ordinary publication of a notice in the newspapers, or the statement by the presiding officer at the start of the poll that he does not intend to allow such voters to record their votes after a certain time, has in it an inherent danger that this may not be as widely known as it is desirable that it should be.  I strongly urge the Minister to use every medium of publicity under this section&mdash;television, radio, and everything else&mdash;so that the electorate will be properly informed.  The procedure in the various constituencies and in the various polling districts varies considerably.  There is no uniformity. I ask the Minister to ensure that whatever regulations he makes, or instructions he issues to the registration authorities and to the <Col N="563" /> returning officers, are properly publicised well ahead of election time. That is very important in regard to those people who may have to have their votes marked or who may be of the types likely to be dealt with under this section.  I am afraid that some voters may find themselves unaware of the facts.  All possible media of communication and publication should be used to get the result desired.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In line 27 to delete subsection (3), lines 40 to 51.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the secrecy formula which was part and parcel of elections in the past will no longer have any place in our electoral procedure, that is, a little form that everybody associated with the election was called on to sign.  I think the total number of polling stations in the country is around 7,000.  We have a number of candidates in every constituency and each of them is entitled to have a personation agent and sub-agent.  Before these appointments are really properly made, there must be attached to those appointment forms, a form of secrecy which must be filled in with the name of the person in question and signed by that person and countersigned by the presiding officer on the morning of the election, by a peace commissioner or some other authorised person. These forms run into thousands.  The signatures and filling in waste a great deal of time.  They seemed to have developed into being merely a wasteful formula in recent years particularly, serving no useful purpose, and are regarded by those participating in elections as just a nuisance.  I think nobody will hold that the mere signing and filling of these forms adds anything to the secrecy of the ballot, which is what they were primarily intended to do.</P>
      <P>Instead of these, I should like to have displayed in all polling stations and where counts are taking place a notice to the effect that persons gaining any information there should not impart it outside, or something to that effect, and that certain penalties could follow if they do.  I do not know how the idea appeals to other members of the House but from my own experience and that of other Deputies with whom I discussed this in the past few days, I believe that the filling and signing of secrecy forms is just a nuisance.</P>

      <P>Under the principal Act, these declarations of secrecy were made before the opening of the poll and generally what happened was that the presiding officer required those who were present to subscribe to these declarations.  I thought when this was being considered, the Bill as drafted would allow the people who were to be in attendance at the stations on behalf of candidates, or anybody else <Col N="567" /> on coming into the station to sign the declaration.  On reading the amendment &mdash; perhaps I misinterpret it &mdash; it seems that the Minister is reverting to the original procedure inasmuch as he seems to be removing subsection (3) by his amendment which would allow the phrase &ldquo;before commencing to be so present&rdquo; to stand, and only in that case could they sign the undertaking.</P>
      <P>If the Minister assures me that personation agents may come into a booth representing a candidate at some later stage than the commencement of the poll and can exercise the right of an agent there on behalf of the candidate and that this is the intention in the Bill now, I shall be satisfied.  It has been the practice &mdash; I have seen it done &mdash; that the presiding officer would not allow a personating agent to take part in the proceedings if he had not been there at the beginning to sign this form.</P>

Now the Minister in his amendment is taking them out again.  Does that not re-erect, so to speak, the present position under the Fifth Schedule of the principal Act?

I should like to ask the Minister what provision is made for the return of a deposit to the relatives of such a candidate? Ordinarily, if the candidate's name remains on the ballot paper and he is included in the count, then unless he has secured one-third of the votes before elimination, his deposit is forfeited. The Minister should look into this and see what provision he intends to make about the return of the deposit of a candidate who dies before the commencement of the poll.</P>

      <P>Section 36 says that the vote becomes invalid which does not bear the official stamp.  Why? People go into a polling booth.  They are handed a ballot paper and they mark it properly and, because of someone else's stupidity, they are denied the vote.  In my constituency, <Col N="569" /> 300 people had their votes made null and void because of someone else's stupidity.  If they knew it, they would cause a riot and they would be entitled to do that.  Surely the counterfoil would be there and it could be easily shown that these were not votes just shoved into the box.  The returning officer must hand the paper to his clerk before it is handed to the voter and it ought to be the clerk's duty to see that it is properly stamped.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister can do anything about this problem.  It does create a most unfair situation from the point of view of the voter, if, through the fault of the official, the vote is disqualified. It does happen from time to time that because the official overlooks stamping the ballot paper or, as used to happen, he tries to stamp a number of them together and the stamp does not come through them all, the vote is lost.  For one reason or another, ballot papers do slip through without the official stamp.  That is not the fault of the voter.  He has done his duty and when they come to count his vote, it has to be disqualified.  I find it difficult to see what the Minister can do about it in this legislation, except by providing some kind of penalty which would attach to the presiding officer if a number of unstamped papers were found in boxes for which he was responsible.</P>

      <P>The ordinary elector is not familiar with the ballot paper before he goes into the booth and possibly he may be a person who is voting for the first time.  I cannot see that it would be possible to tutor electors and to warn them to be on the lookout <Col N="570" /> for either the coloured stamp or the official stamp.  A remedy ought to be found for this problem.  When the papers are taken out, one paper which may be properly marked but not properly stamped is disqualified while a paper which may be marked doubtfully can be considered again and, if the intention of the elector is clear, it is allowed.  Although the voter has marked the unstamped paper properly, his vote cannot be counted.</P>

      <P>I appreciate fully that while the incidence of spoiled votes is generally as low as one per cent of our total vote, there is nothing more annoying than the idea that a paper properly marked, particularly if it is marked in favour of oneself is, through the fault of some paid official, declared invalid.  The question is what can we do about it.  The prime responsibility would seem to be that of the presiding officer and, where a number of such spoiled votes come from a particular polling station or stations, without any question, the first thing to be done is to ensure that the presiding officer is made aware of it and that the particular person in charge of that station or stations is not appointed again.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the personation agents are also at fault in that if the papers are not being properly marked by the presiding officer, they must be somewhat asleep.  Thirdly, there are the voters themselves who can check to ensure that the paper is a properly stamped paper before they put it into the box.</P>

      <P>The trouble about a die stamp is that it might cut at the wrong place.  It might, in fact, not be cut down at the point where it should be cut down.  It might be cut in such a way as to impede the proper deciphering of the marking on the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>I shall look into the question of whether we can introduce some new type of stamp, whether it be a perforation or a perforated stamp, or a die cut out or an inked stamp.  This is a matter subject, in the first place, to the presiding officer's doing his job properly.  It then falls to the personation agents to see he does it properly and, to a lesser degree, the voter who rushes in and gets his paper at the last minute who should see if there is a proper mark on it.  We may be able to change the marks and to ensure that the marks are easily distinguishable in future.  We may be able to ensure that the stamps will readily be seen by looking at them or feeling them, and so on.</P>
      <P>We are making provision in this Bill to point out where the stamp should go.  Whether or not that is of any avail, I do not know.  However, so far, it is all we have felt it is possible for us to make in these proposals that might bring about a cure in this most annoying type of spoiled ballot we find at every election in every constituency.  These are ballots that should never have been spoiled and are spoiled because the paid official on the job has not done his job properly.  I shall try to see what we can do about it, but it has its difficulties. It is not just as simple as it seems, even if it is a vital matter.</P>

      <P>I think we cannot put an end to this thing but we should close all the gaps we can.  The Minister is considering publishing a notice in connection with personation to be hung over the ballot boxes.  He should also put a very simple notice there, <Col N="572" /> instructing each voter to make certain that the returning officer has done what he should do in this regard &mdash; that the paper is stamped&mdash;or that there is a danger of the vote's being lost.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the voter ought to have a look at it. The voter does not know what he is looking at.  For the Minister's information, several hundred votes were rejected because there was no stamp. We examined them all again.  Here and there we managed to make out an impression&mdash;&ldquo;Here is an impression&rdquo;, and it is allowed.  If the other boys saw it was their vote, they pointed it out and if it was someone else's vote, they said nothing.  That sort of codology goes on.  There ought to be a dyed impression.  Some lazy individual who stamps about 20 at a time is the cause of it.  The Minister should do something about it but do not expect the voter to see it.</P>

      <P>This has occurred to me in this connection before.  I do not know if there are any inventors on the Minister's staff but if you had a device whereby the ballot was stamped as it was going into the ballot box, I think it would probably solve the difficulties In other words, if some device were fitted on the ballot box, into which the ballot had to go, it would probably ensure the safety of the vote.</P>

      <P>As a veteran of eleven general elections, my advice to the Minister is to adhere to the form of stamp at present in use.  I have seen hundreds of thousands of votes counted.  I have never seen any enduring dispute as to whether a vote was or was not stamped.  I say deliberately &ldquo;enduring dispute&rdquo;.  A number of votes are cast aside for examination by the returning officer and the candidates' agents.  I have never seen an enduring quarrel as to whether or not a ballot paper was in fact stamped. We have all seen many papers that were inadvertently unstamped.  You cannot provide against human error, no matter how careful you are.  The number of actually unstamped papers was very small.</P>

You do see unstamped papers but to say that they have ever constituted any material element of the total poll is fantastic.

      <P>No matter what device you employ, on a rare occasion a situation can develop in which a person is made a presiding officer who ought never to have been given that responsibility but it does not happen commonly. No device employed will exclude every possibility of error.  But normally, unless you have a presiding officer of the kind to which I have referred who manifestly should never have been there and who never knew his duties, you do not see any dispute about the vagueness of the printing on the existing ballot paper employing the present type of stamp.</P>
      <P>Unless I were convinced some new procedure would prove practically error-proof, my advice to the Minister would be to stick to the stamp and procedure we at present employ.  It is not perfect but I have heard no suggestion made here today that would improve on it.  I think Deputy M.J. O'Higgins makes a suggestion which might be effective but not, I think, for the purpose of avoiding the possibility of improper votes being inserted in the ballot box.  I do not think it is at the ballot box that you want the stamping machinery but at the point of issue of the ballot paper.</P>

In my experience &mdash;in 99.6 or more of the ballot papers that I have seen counted in my time&mdash; the presiding officer has faithfully discharged that duty to the satisfaction of all reasonable persons participating in the count.</P>

To the best of my memory, in one constituency a person won a seat by one vote.  There is where the seriousness of the whole matter should come in.  The Minister should ensure that each paper is stamped as it is being handed out and a person who stamps about 20 at a time does not get away with it.  It is not enough to say that the official should not be employed again.  That is no satisfaction for the loss of one's vote. The Minister should think over how this can be avoided.

      <P>I would suggest that the problem of the marking of the ballot paper could be got over if when the voting had concluded the presiding officer, the tally clerk and the personation agent certified that the total number of valid votes cast in that box was X.  I cannot agree with my revered colleague here that the number of spoiled ballot papers through lack of marking is small.  I have had experience in three different elections and in all three cases where the box was not marked&mdash;there were 300 votes in each of the boxes &mdash; it did affect the election of a Deputy: one person was in and another out.  On examination, the Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil personation agents agreed that the total number of valid votes cast was 300.  The whole lot were disqualified but, worse than that, instead of the box being impounded and the votes not counted, the votes were then thrown into the heap and counted.  A great number of them got through and we know the result.  It had such a serious result that the returning officer refused to give a recount when they were found.  There was no legal <Col N="575" /> assessor there and the count had to be postponed until the next day.</P>

Not more than five agents shall be appointed by a candidate unless the returning officer otherwise permits.</P>
      <P>Is it intended that such agents will have the right we have now provided in Section 39, or is that right reserved to the candidate or what we used to understand as his parliamentary agent?</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to repeal Sections 9 <Col N="580" /> and 10 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, and the application of those sections to presidential elections and referenda.  Section 9 provides that:</P>
      <P>Any person who votes or induces or procures any person to vote at any election knowing that he or such person is prohibited, whether by this or any other Act, from voting at such elections, shall be guilty of an illegal practice.</P>
      <P>The only persons prohibited from voting are those under 21, and voting while under 21 is made an offence under Sections 26, 51 and 70 of this Bill, which provides that a person who is not registered or who is not entitled to be registered may not vote at an election.  A person under 21 is not entitled to be registered.  Section 9 of the 1923 Act is therefore unnecessary. For that reason, we are moving this amendment to wipe it out.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the 1923 Act provides that:</P>
      <P>Every person who votes at an election while he is, by or under this or any other Act, declared to be incapable of voting at that election, shall be guilty of an illegal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill, all incapacities for voting are being removed.  These incapacities were part of the penalties for certain offences.  I think we had one of them already.  For example, conviction in respect of corrupt practices at an election; conviction of treason or felony, sentences of death, penal servitude or imprisonment with hard labour and so on.  These are being dispensed with, along with many of the other incapacities we have mentioned.  The remainder of Section 10 provides that every person who votes more than once at an election shall be guilty of an illegal practice.  These are practices for which penalties are provided under Section 6.  We have different views about that at the moment.  The remainder of Section 10 provided that the court may in certain instances mitigate or remit any incapacities imposed by the Act by reason of a conviction.  No incapacities may be <Col N="581" /> imposed for any offence as a result of the proposals in this Bill and the remainder of Section 10 is, like Section 9, unnecessary.</P>

      <P>This amendment will enable a statement of what a referendum is about to be incorporated on the polling cards. In other words, it will be for the guidance and information of voters as to what a referendum will be about and that will be put on the polling cards prior to the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment, the Minister is proposing that the subject matter of the referendum shall be set out for the information of the voter. Under Section 13 of this Bill, a provision is made for the setting up of a board in regard to the register of political Parties which will decide matters in regard to any dispute that may arise.  We have had the experience in this House already of a dispute in regard to a matter which was being referred to the electors and the words which should be used to designate the matter being referred.  In this section now, again, we should make use of such a board as is mentioned in Section 13 subsection (8) (b), which says that the board would consist of a judge of the High Court, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann or in his absence the Deputy <Col N="584" /> Chairman, the Chairman of Seanad Éireann or in his absence, the Deputy Chairman.  Such a tribunal would give a fairer judgment, perhaps, on what is being referred to the electorate than a majority of this House pushing through their view as to what was being submitted.  That would be particularly applicable in regard to subsection (2) (b) of the Minister's amendment. There may not be agreement in the House as to the proposal that is to be stated in writing but if such a tribunal were set up to deal with the matter, its findings would secure greater acceptance in so far as it would be an impartial tribunal.  I would suggest that the Minister might consider adopting that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount, probably, to be said for the view expressed by the Deputy in this matter but the board or tribunal it is suggested should be set up might not report in time to allow the referendum to be held and a new situation could develop before the report of the tribunal was obtained as to what should be stated in writing.</P>
      <P>In the case of a constitutional referendum, the statement inserted on the polling card would be subject to the approval of this House before being put on the card or allowed to be circulated.  That procedure is more likely to be successful in having something put to the people on the polling card than submission of the matter to a board or tribunal would be.  Such a board or tribunal might not be so keenly concerned as this House would be about the urgency of the matter on which it was considered in the national interests to hold a referendum and to hold it quickly.  To have to refer the matter to a body outside the House would probably be wasteful of time and there would be the danger that the procedure would be too slow in certain circumstances.  I think the House is quite competent to deal with a matter such as this, if and when such cases arise and do not think they will arise very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may consider this a cumbersome method of procedure but it may equally prove a <Col N="585" /> cumbersome method of procedure where the register of political Parties is concerned.  The Minister will recollect that there was a good deal of controversy here on a previous occasion in relation to the matter which was to be submitted to the electorate by way of referendum.  The matter was debated for quite a long period here.  Eventually an agreed form was found for submission to the electorate.  Perhaps no arguments will arise but, if they do, I think we would be much more likely to get an agreed form to be put before the electorate from such a tribunal as we would by debating the matter here in this House.  It might be debated at considerable length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that it is debated here serves a very useful purpose, a purpose which a tribunal could never serve.  We start here hammering out what we feel should go on or should not go on.  The fact that we discuss the matter here and get publicity for it is surely an excellent way of getting across to the people a fairly balanced view; really our discussion here can be an advantage rather than a disadvantage.  It has that edge on a tribunal which would sit down privately and try to get something we would all more or less agree and to which none of us would agree in the finish.  There is a great deal to be said for having any matter discussed openly here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above what Deputy Jones has said, I should like clarification in regard to clause (b) of this amendment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... in the case of an ordinary referendum, a statement of the proposal which is the subject of the referendum in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal <Col N="586" /> is stated in the writing under the hand and seal of the President sent by him to the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how that is arrived at. Who will determine the statement of the proposal which is the subject of the referendum &ldquo;in the same terms as nearly as may be&rdquo;?  Who will determine what is &ldquo;as nearly as may be&rdquo; to what was stated in the writing under the hand and seal of the President sent by him to the Taoiseach?  I cannot clearly envisage what will happen. Does the President take the initiative in proposing a matter for a referendum? I understand this has reference to the power of the President to refer to referendum certain Acts passed by this House.  Where he doubts their constitutionality, he can elect to send such matters to a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the constitutionality of an Act passed by Dáil Éireann would be a matter for the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quite forgotten. In what circumstances can the President refer a proposal to an ordinary referendum?  What does this envisage?  What does clause (b) of this amendment cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, although we have not utilised the ordinary referendum in the past, I take it the Deputy realises this is an ordinary referendum arising under Article 27 of the Constitution which provides:</P>
      <P>A majority of the members of Seanad Éireann and not less than one-third of the members of Dáil Éireann may by a joint petition addressed to the President by them under this Article request the President to decline to sign and promulgate as a law any Bill to which this Article applies on the ground that the Bill contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way in which we arrive at an ordinary referendum.  Deputy Dillon asks who determines under clause (b) of subsection (2) &ldquo;the same terms as nearly as may be&rdquo;?  That <Col N="587" /> would be the referendum returning officer, subject to the courts interpreting what they thought was right, if somebody challenged it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is the President receives a representation from half the Seanad, supported by one-third of the Dáil, asking to refer the Bill to referendum on the ground that it is a matter of the gravest national importance.  The President decides that he will accede to that request.  He then writes under his hand and seal to the Taoiseach setting out in his letter the subject he wishes to be referred to the country in referendum. Presumably, he will say as to whether the Neutrality Bill passed by the Dáil and Seanad is accepted or rejected.  That is what the President writes in his letter to the Taoiseach. Somebody is then charged with the responsibility of issuing to every voter a polling card which has upon it a statement of the proposal which is the subject of the referendum &ldquo;in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal is stated in the writing under the hand and seal of the President sent by him to the Taoiseach&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I can understand a statutory obligation imposing on the responsible officer the obligation to set out the words of the President's communication to the Taoiseach, leaving it to the individual voter to interpret them as best he may.  Or I can understand a responsible body being established, consisting, if need be, of the judges of the Supreme Court, to determine the appropriate terms in which to propose the question that is to be resolved by referendum to the electors on the polling card, but I cannot understand the proposal that somebody, presumably the referendum presiding officer, is to indicate to the voter on the polling card not what the President wrote to the Taoiseach but what the returning officer will think is &ldquo;as nearly as may be&rdquo; what the President wrote to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to clarify that for us before we are asked to accept it because he will agree, I think, that in the employment of this most dangerous constitutional instrument, the referendum&mdash;I say that very deliberately; <Col N="588" /> it is a most dangerous instrument and one which can sap the foundations of a parliamentary demo-cracy&mdash;it is vitally important that the question to which the people are to be asked to provide an answer should be clear and explicit and that the answer should not be prejudiced by the terms in which the question is asked.  Perhaps the Minister would, owing to the gravity of this question, now clarify for us clause (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand it, the referendum returning officer would appear to have the responsibility in this matter.  However, in reading through that on which I have come to rely as indicating that he has such responsibility, I am not now quite so sure.  I propose to have a further look at the particular section of the law we are relying on to see whether it is as watertight and foolproof as I thought it was.  It may not be.  There might also be the possibility that in order to overcome what could be a very long-drawn out legal interpretation of what may be sent by the President to the Taoiseach, this reference to the same terms &ldquo;as nearly as may be&rdquo; may have to be amended or deleted because I could even see that, if gone into in a very minute way, it could probably upset the whole procedure by virtue of the fact that the courts would say that it does not conform to the very strict law as laid down there.  I think the better course in this case would be to take a look at both the powers regarding a referendum and the returning officer being the responsible person, subject always to the law courts in regard to interpretation in respect of what has to be put on the ballot paper or the voting cards.  In that case, the best thing I think, is to go back on the fundamental issue and secondly, have a look at the phrasing of paragraph (b) of subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In as much as the Minister is reviewing this question generally, I want to put this point to him for his consideration: the critical act in connection with the ordinary referendum is the communication from the President to the Taoiseach.  That is what <Col N="589" /> sets the machinery in motion.  I suggest that the Oireachtas, being the legislative body, should be vigilant to ensure, if this, to my mind, highly undesirable court of appeal by way of referendum in our legislation is to be invoked, that there should be no question whatever of any ambiguity arising. The President is a constitutional official of the State but what is going to happen, supposing a two-thirds majority of this House having passed a law come to the conclusion that the form of the question proposed by the President for referendum does not faithfully reflect the true problem to the people in the referendum?  What remedy has this House?</P>
      <P>I suggest that it might be worth considering and possibly consulting our President about it&mdash;as I suppose it might be necessary to do&mdash;that the President after consultation with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court would formulate the proposal in writing under his hand and seal and send it to the Taoiseach so that in so far as it was humanly possible, we could eliminate from the sphere of possibility, not to speak of probability, the danger of the President being brought into conflict with the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas believing that an appeal was being made to the people over its head through the referendum on ambiguous terms which in fact failed to do justice to the true intention of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am aware that such matters as these prove boring to some of our colleagues but the fact is that a referendum is a desperately dangerous element in our Constitution.</P>

      <P>No.  Let me be as clear as a crystal.  I am talking about a referendum which claims the right to override the authority of Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about referenda referred to in (b) which we are now discussing.  There is a great danger in them because the whole basis of Parliamentary democracy, which is in my submission to the House an exquisite instrument of individual liberty and enduring freedom, is put in very real jeopardy if there is the standing claim to refer the decisions of Parliament to <i>ad hoc</i> referenda, thus by implication, abandoning the appropriate remedy of the free people, that is, if Parliament is not carrying out their will, to change the membership of Parliament.  If an Executive are not carrying out the will of the people by the process of Parliamentary elections, you can change the Executive, but if you create a situation in which Parliament itself is reversed by a popular referendum, the whole authority of the Oireachtas appears to me to be greatly abridged and open to challenge.</P>
      <P>We are the sovereign authority in the country and our obligation, when we come here as Deputies, is to do what our conscience directs us to do and not what any vested interest thinks it has a right to command us to do.  Acting in that capacity, we are the sovereign authority for good or ill and there ought not to be any authority set up against us.  These are important considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the referendum is the voice of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here now is the very heresy.  We can have government by mob rule or we can have government by Parliament.  We can have legislation by calling the people together in the Phoenix Park and saying: &ldquo;Those in favour, say &lsquo;aye&rsquo;; those against, say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;  The result is that you have government without discussion, legislation <Col N="591" /> without deliberation, Executive action without argument or challenge. The whole purpose of Parliamentary Government is that the Executive sit here in the presence of Parliament subject to question and to censure if the representatives of the people do not like what they are doing, and having arguments with them across the floor of the House.  There is no question of putting simple issues which do not truly reflect the matter requiring consideration at all.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach falls into a very common error.  There may be some sacrosanct quality in a reference by referendum to the people at large which is not inherent in the decisions of a demo-cratically-elected parliament but I regard the decisions of a democrati-cally-elected parliament to be much more helpful and sacrosanct than the decisions on any referendum can ever be.  Decisions taken here are taken after full discussion and argument in which the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle will insist on every Deputy having his right to speak and be heard.  These are decisions which civilised men and women can live under, whether they like them or not, because they know they have means at their disposal to get them corrected without having to resort to violence, by climbing up on their barrel at the corner of the street and advocating the election of themselves or somebody else to replace Deputies who they believe have failed them in the Parliament of the country.</P>
      <P>When I come to deal with the type of referenda referred to in paragraph (b), I want to be certain that the ordinary and sacrosanct deliberations of this House shall not be lightly set aside by referenda proposed by our people in deceptively simple terms.  I suggest that we must do all in our power now to determine that if subjects are to be decided by ordinary referenda as defined by the context of this Bill, those subjects will be presented to the people in as objective a manner as it is possible to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In as much as these referenda must derive from some conflict between the <Col N="592" /> President and the Oireachtas, I suggest that in putting the question to the electorate, the President should be sustained by the advice of the two heads of the judiciary, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, in formulating the question that is to be proposed to the people.  In any case, where fault may have to be found with what is drafted, it will be a fault which nobody can attribute to the person of the President because it will be universally known that the question was not formulated by the President alone but by him in consultation with and on the advice of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most members of this House know that I hate the sight of Deputy Dillon and that it is unlikely that I will normally agree with him.  On this occasion, even though I would not vote for his proposals, I must agree with him.  There is a great deal of common sense in what he has said.  We have seen an example of this thing in France where Parliament, as a result of various types of referenda, has been practically wiped out.  It is important that it should be made clear that under no circumstances shall the elected representatives of our people lose their power to legislate. It should be entirely as a last resort that under any circumstances our powers are taken from us.  If we are to have referenda, it must be made clear to the people what the issue is to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we come in here and hold a debate, everybody has the right to get up and make his views clear but in the case of a referendum, the question can be completely misrepresented and the opposite result to what was expected achieved.  It is perfectly clear that that can happen.  People can completely and entirely misrepresent the issue.  A referendum is the last thing which should be held and if it is to be held, there should be no ambiguity in one way or the other as to what the issue before the people is.  We can have one Party or another in this House completely misrepresenting an issue and, therefore, before this matter goes any further, it should be taken back <Col N="593" /> and very carefully considered because it is a matter of great importance.</P>

      <P>Section 71 of this Bill provides for the form of a ballot paper at a constitutional referendum and includes certain changes, such as the provision of a special space for the official mark on the ballot paper and the counterfoil, for the voter's number on the register.  The purpose of amendment No. 23 is to enable corresponding changes to be made in the ballot papers for ordinary referenda.  This amendment, No. 23, in fact consolidates the provisions of Section 15 of the Referendum Act, 1942, and Section 1 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1959.  Amendment No. 41 provides for the repeal of Section 15 of the 1942 Act which will no longer be necessary and amendment No. 45 prescribes the forms of ballot papers at both constitutional and ordinary referenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART VI.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 55, lines 20 to 28, to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Council may, in pursuance of a resolution passed by the Council and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the Council voted, apply to the Minister for an order made in accordance with subsection (5) of section 88 of the Electoral Act, 1963, dividing the Borough into two or more electoral areas.</P>
      <P>(c)  An order under this section shall appoint in such manner as most nearly secures equal representation on the basis of population the number of members of the Council to be elected at a Borough election for each of the electoral areas created by such order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 88 as the Minister has drafted it, he is proposing to take power to form various electoral districts within the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford without reference to the elected representatives of the people in those areas.  I am proposing that regard should be had to the provisions of subsection (2) of Section 7 of the Limerick City Management Act, whereby the city is one electoral area, Section 6 of the Waterford City Management Act whereby the city is one electoral area and Section 4 of the Cork City Management Act, 1941, whereby the city is one electoral division. It was open to the elected representatives of the council in these areas to request the Minister to make the changes if they so desired.  On Second Reading I said we ought to be very careful in the Oireachtas in passing legislation not alone to give effect to the popular will but to be seen to give effect to the popular will.  We must jealously guard the democratic right of the elected representatives in these council areas to seek from the Minister an order setting up the ward <Col N="603" /> system, if they so decide.  Until such time as the councillors request that, the Minister should not take unto himself the right to create within those areas different electoral divisions from those existing at present.  In certain areas, there have been difficulties because of the large number of candidates standing.  There may be confusion inasmuch as the voters may not proceed to put a mark opposite all the names of the candidates appearing on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>In taking the decision envisaged in this section, the Minister would create areas within those cities corresponding to the old ward system.  He is taking power to do that without being requested to do so by the people elected by the voters in those areas.  All I want to ensure is that the rights of the councillors democratically elected by the people in those areas will not be taken from them, and that it is they, and they alone, who have the right to request the Minister to make this change.</P>
    <P>This is a right we have often referred to here.  It is a right put in jeopardy in other parts of this country and in areas outside this country.  The democratic process we profess to follow here ought to ensure that nothing will be passed in the Legislature which will in any way take away that right from the locally elected people.  I seek to have that preserved by offering this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones seems to have overlooked or conveniently forgotten that since 1941 the Minister for Local Government has had the very power it is suggested here he should be denied in respect of Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  Apart from these three cities, he has had that power in respect of every county council and every urban district in Ireland since 1941. This therefore is merely an effort to bring those three cities into line with the rest of the country.  It is no more and no less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers Deputy Jones sees are not real in view of the fact that we have had this power since 1941.  I am aware of nothing happening to justify <Col N="604" /> the fears the Deputy has.  There does not seem to be any great reason why these three cities should not be brought into line with the country generally.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the situation in Cork city when they fought a local election as one constituency with everybody up in a free-for all.  We had 72 candidates, 63 counts and five days' hard work for a big staff, not to mention the severe strain on the nerves of the candidates.  We had 72 names on the ballot paper, out of which 21 were to be selected.  The idea of having 63 counts, or even 20 or 30 counts, does not help to bring about the kind of result the people intend.  The idea that that is possible under this system is fantastic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you. Cork is the most extreme example of the situation, but even in the city of Waterford, we had in the 1960 election 41 candidates for 15 seats.  The whole 41 were on one ballot paper.  There were 34 counts in order to find 15 councillors from the free-for-all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we not declare every county council election an open forum and let all 25 or 28 councillors go up for the whole county?  Surely if the system we have in relation to the county councils and urban areas for all these years makes sense, it should make sense in these three cities as well?  The present system in those cities is absolutely crying out for revision.</P>
      <P>I think the fears expressed by Deputy Jones are not well grounded.  The fact that the Minister for Local Government has had this power for all these years and that it has not been abused by any Minister should bring about a change of mind on the Deputy's part in regard to opposing the idea of giving power to the Minister to make these three cities conform with the general law.  It is not something new or radical.  There is nothing hidden behind it.  It is merely conforming with what has been there for the past 22 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrasting the procedure in county council elections and the procedure contemplated here, the Minister is over-simplifying the matter. All the time the county councils have exercised their right of producing a polling scheme and submitting it to the Minister.  In this instance, however, the Minister is proposing to take a power which the Council have not requested. All I want is that the elected council should be allowed to request the Minister to do this.  The county councils make polling schemes and submit them for approval.  All I am asking is that the rights of the councils in Limerick, Cork and Waterford should be equally preserved.  If they so desire, they can make a request to the Minister to divide up the city as they require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has in some way misinterpreted the position. He mentioned a polling scheme coming up from counties but that is different from what he has in mind. It is entirely different because a polling scheme in that form has nothing whatever to do with the division of a county into electoral areas.  For instance, any county may have its existing electoral areas rearranged by the Minister for Local Government without any request whatsoever from the local body in that county.  Likewise, urban council districts, again, can and may be divided, rearranged and so forth by the Minister for Local Government without any request from the local council.  Even Dublin city and the boundaries of its various divisions can and may be divided by the Minister for Local Government without any representations from the corporation in the City Hall to the effect that it should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will come in. Deputy Jones's point is only this: the present position exists in Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  The Minister thinks, looking at the picture of the country as a whole, that it is a rational and sensible thing to bring Cork, Limerick and Waterford into line with Dublin for its electoral procedure because, looking at it from the point of view of the Custom House or Donegal, it seems to him extremely inconvenient to have long lists of candidates and everybody elected as a candidate at large.  That is the way it may seem to him but it may not seem so to the people locally.  Surely it is a sensible suggestion to take power here, at the request of the existing local authority, to change the electoral procedure if the local people want it changed? If they do not, if they prefer this system of electing their councillors and aldermen at large, why should we interfere?</P>
      <P>Manifestly, the people of Dublin prefer to elect them in wards.  I have no deep conviction one way or the other.  Where you have a relatively small city, there is a great deal to be said for electing the aldermen and councillors at large.  If the city reaches a size which makes the mechanical problem of counting the votes unduly onerous, all reasonable men will combine to divide the city up into suitable subdivisions to facilitate the process of conducting the count but they will sacrifice something, or it could well be that they might sacrifice something, which is at present valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we do not have in this country the very intensive organisation of wards in local elections but anyone who has any experience of residence in an American city knows the astonishingly powerful organisation <Col N="607" /> that is built on so small a political unit as a municipal ward.  I admit at once the situation obtaining in American cities represents one extreme but I am not prepared to admit that electing councillors and aldermen at large in a small city or a relatively small city is the other extreme.  In a city like Waterford and Limerick, it may very well be the ideal method.</P>
    <P>I should be inclined to feel with the Minister for Local Government that when a city had reached the size of Cork, if they were prudent, the local authority would reach the conclusion that the time had come to ask the Minister to approve a scheme of wards there, on the ground that the city had grown too big to elect councillors and aldermen at large.  I am not at all sure, if living in Waterford or Limerick, I would take a similar view.  I think that is a reasonable approach and that the Minister is going beyond where it is necessary for the Oireachtas to go in interfering with the local affairs of the people of such cities as Cork, Waterford and Limerick, if he arrogates to himself, not only the ultimate decision, but the initiative in such a matter.  Deputy Jones thinks, and I agree with him, that the appropriate provision here is that he should take power, at the request of the local authority, to divide the city into wards but leaving the situation that unless and until he is moved by the local authority to do so, he will leave things as they are.</P>
    <P>That may sound utterly unreasonable to the Minister but I want to put it to him that this is an Electoral Bill and, hopping and trotting, by way of Committee and discussion here, it has reached a pretty reasonable degree of virtual unanimous consent amongst us.  Electoral law is always a touchy matter.  I suggest to the Minister that the difference between his position and that of Deputy Jones is very narrow. This is not the last Electoral Bill we will ever pass but I suggest to him that he may with propriety leave the <Col N="608" /> initiative in this matter to the cities concerned, with the result, I believe, that he will get a request from Cork and he probably will not from Waterford or Limerick.  If he does, if that is the way it turns out, then the only real problem will be resolved at the request of the local people and the other two cities will comfortably carry on on their present basis, it may be for years and it might be forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon, because his suggestion does not give the small man a chance. If the small man who is known only in his own locality has to fight in a large area, he is severely handicapped. Those already in have the advantage. It would be wrong to leave it to those who are already in position to decide as to how others should get a chance of election.  If it is left to people who have a vested interest, naturally, they will look after their own needs first. Imagine the position if Dublin were one constituency.  In that case only people with money, only political Parties, could fight elections.  A poor man could not fight an election.  The poor local man must be given a chance. Otherwise, the machine will always be in possession.</P>

It is a good thing that we should have so many runners for so many seats in any local authority.  It is a healthy sign that the people are anxious about affairs.  In Limerick, there are 17 seats on the council.  The area of Limerick city does not lend itself to divisions of the kind there are in Dublin and that perhaps one may expect in Cork.</P>
