      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the work of the Camphill Village Trust for mentally handicapped children in Great Britain; and whether he will suggest to the Commission considering these matters to visit the Camphill Village Trust working community at Botton with a view to investigating the suitability of work on these lines for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Botton village community which appears to have been initiated in 1954.  It is conducted in accordance with the principle of the <Col N="370" /> anthroposophical movement established by Rudolf Steiner.  This movement manifests itself in many activities in addition to the Botton enterprise, including schools for normal children, schools for retarded and other handicapped children, a college for adults to inculcate the principles of the movement, an organisation known as the Biodynamic Agricultural Association, of which the Anthroposophic Agricultural Foundation is a component, the Goethean Science Foundation, a pharmaceutical manufacturing and importing company, a School of Eurythmy and a school of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, as well as a publishing company and a Bookshop Centre.</P>
      <P>The attention of the Commission on Mental Handicap was drawn to the Botton venture.  It is a matter for the Commission to consider whether a visit would be worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I detect in the Minister's reply a strong prejudice against this establishment?  I am not informed at all, but I understand it is actively engaged in the care of mentally retarded children.  The establishment has commended itself to certain people interested in this work in Ireland as a desirable one.  Would the Minister not think it desirable to take an objective look at this branch of the work to see if it has anything to offer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me if I knew anything about the movement and I told him about it to the extent which one can gather knowledge from publications.  I am completely without prejudice about it.  Responsibility in this matter rests with the Commission on Mental Handicap who have certain publications relating to this body before them.  What action they propose to take I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to say that, in his judgment, the Commission would be well advised at least to inform themselves as to the work that is proceeding, with a view to judging it on its merits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the quantity of barley exported since 1st January, 1962, to the nearest available date, the further quantity which his Department assume it will be necessary to export during the present cereal year, and the cost to date of these exports to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Exports of barley from 1st January 1962, to 31st March, 1963, were 23,821 tons.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 54,000 tons will be exported in the period from 1st April, 1963, to the end of the present cereal year.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer is committed to paying the loss on exports of 75,000 tons from the 1962 crop only.  As at 25th May, 1963, subsidy to the extent of approximately £117,000 on 33,000 tons had been claimed from An Bord Gráin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that taking the total grain available, the figure I have is that barley purchased from growers, unmillable wheat and maize imports, amount to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 579,000 tons. The estimated requirements are 423,000 tons.  There is only one obvious means of dealing with that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1961 Census of Population included specific queries on housing matters, which were framed in consultation with my Department. The results of the census, in conjunction with the results of the recent survey of unfit housing conditions, should provide a suitable basis on which up-to-date assessments of overall housing needs can be formulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from this survey which I requested, and which I found the greatest difficulty in getting local authorities to carry out, all local authorities from time to time put forward proposals for housing schemes and they must forward with their proposals <Col N="376" /> their assessment of the actual needs in the particular area in which they may be proposing to operate.  In that way, so far as the local authorities are concerned, they have much more information in a general way than merely the unfit housing problem which was specifically asked for under the terms of the survey.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.  My responsibility under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts is confined to sanctioning the borrowing of such amounts as are required from time to time to finance the operations of the local authority under the Acts. I understand that no complaints as to major structural defects are received <Col N="378" /> by the Dublin Corporation and that where minor complaints are made, the defects are invariably made good.  I would suggest that the Deputy might apprise the Corporation of any grounds for complaint that may have come to his notice.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1962: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 11, lines 52 and 54, and in page 12, lines 2 and 6, to delete &ldquo;or other land&rdquo; where they occur in those lines.&mdash; (Deputy Jones.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country over a long period, in relation to land tenure, there has been great interest in and indeed usage of what is known as &ldquo;squatter's title&rdquo;.  The land pattern in this country down the years was that a great many people were in occupation of land while very often their title to it might not be written. At times, that may have been due to their own failure to have the records in regard to land amended so as to write into them their right to the title of the land.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware, as are most Deputies, that it is common practice that when the ownership of land passes from the head of a family, on his demise, to a member of the family, the question of title is not dealt with at the time.  My concern about the use of the words &ldquo;or other land&rdquo; in the section is that a county manager acting for the planning authority could be <i>subpoenaed</i> in case of dispute in regard to a property and could be obliged to discover documents which might have the effect of disclosing information which might adversely affect a claimant to title to the land in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to be very careful to protect the right of the individual in this respect.  On several occasions during the debate on this Bill, I have referred to what we regard as the paramount right of the individual to property and have <Col N="388" /> urged that nothing should be done which would in any way weaken that right.  I want to suggest to the Minister on this occasion that in respect of this type of legislation, we should be sure that the right about which I now speak is protected.  There should be written into the Bill a protection for the individual from disclosure of information which might be prejudicial to his right.</P>
    <P>I have in mind at present the case of a householder who, having built a home, is unable to produce title to the land on which his home stands.  The local authority involved could not produce documents to show the ownership of the property although the person concerned did have permission from the local authority at the time he built his home.  To protect the interest of such person, the words &ldquo;or other land&rdquo; in subsection (1) of Section 9 should be deleted.  It is easy to understand the reason for the subsection, which says:</P>
    <P>A planning authority may, for any purpose arising in relation to their functions under this Act, by notice in writing require the occupier of any structure ... or any person receiving, whether for himself or for another, rent out of any structure or other land to state in writing to such authority, within a specified time....</P>
    <P>How are the rights of a person who is in the type of occupancy which I am now speaking about under a squatter's title, to be protected in this matter if at a later stage somebody produces information that may come by way of leakage from the local authority or some official thereof to suggest that the title of that person may not be as well founded as he would like it to be? The county manager could be <i>subpoenaed</i> and obliged to produce documents for the purpose of showing whether the person in question had a right to the property or not.  I would invite the Minister's comment as to how he proposes to protect the right of the individual in this matter.  As the Land Registry would show, a large number of folios in family settlements have not been written up and with the passage of time and the passing of the ownership of property and the change <Col N="389" /> over from the old landlord code, there is quite a large amount of property which at the present moment is by virtue of squatter's title in the occupation of people who have never gone through the expensive process of moving to the High Court to secure to themselves a declaration of their interest in the property.  Either by accepting the amendment or by inserting some other safeguard which he might suggest, the Minister should take the necessary steps to protect the rights of individuals in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the position were as outlined by Deputy Jones, I would agree to his request but the section is merely a reiteration of Section 10 of the Act of 1934.  The whole purpose of the section is to facilitate the planning authority in carrying out their statutory obligations.  The seeking of information as to who is the occupier or what interest a person may have in land, is not in any way for the purpose of determining who has a valid title; it is merely to determine the person with whom the planning authority is obliged under various sections to communicate their intentions, to communicate, for instance, that some development is envisaged that might mean the wiping out of a right of way.  We want to know to whom we have an obligation through our planning authorities to notify that a development is likely to take place and that, for instance, a right of way is being abandoned.</P>
      <P>It is not a matter of trying to take something from these people.  It is merely to enable the local authority to establish as best they can the person with whom they are to deal, on whom they are to serve notice, whether for their own local authority purposes or in the interests of the interested party. For instance, the abolition of a right of way could be an important matter to the land owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might get a few other items taken at random through the Bill where this section has some effect.  For instance, there is Section 25 (2) (f) and (g).  These provisions may require a planning authority to inform certain property owners of applications for permission to develop land and of decisions <Col N="390" /> in such applications.  We may get, through planning authorities, applications for permission to develop property in certain ways.</P>
    <P>What the local authority is being obliged to do under this section is to ascertain from the applicant, for instance, whether he is in fact the owner, what his interest is in the land, whether he has the right, if he got permission, to go ahead with the development, and to put an onus on him, under penalty, to give the proper information as to who has the right, so that the owner may be notified of a proposed development in respect of the land of which he is the owner but which he may not be occupying.</P>
    <P>We want to protect the interests of these people just as we may want to facilitate the planning authority.  It is not at all, as Deputy Jones fears, a matter of trying to dispossess people merely because they have not title which is up-to-date or have not taken out administration or because they have only a squatter's title.  It is not our business to ascertain such matters. It is our business to find out with whom we are to deal so that a person will not be injured because of the fact that he is ignorant of what is going on.  It is for that general purpose that we want the protection in the Bill and to make the thing workable.  Then in Sections 31, 32 and 33 we deal with notices relating to development carried out without permission or not in accordance with a condition.  This is the other side of the coin, where these things have been done which should not have been done.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that the planning authority should avail of any opportunity to elicit from the occupier, or some person with an interest in the land, the required information in order to determine who in fact is the responsible person on whom to serve the various notices required by law.  We need this power also under Sections 36 and 37 where notices are required in relation to the removal or alteration of structures or discontinuance of use. Compensation is payable and we must know to whom the compensation should be paid.  These facilities are required.  I have quoted typical <Col N="391" /> instances in which the planning authority must be facilitated and also instances in which the rights of the individual must be protected.  There will be an obligation on the authority to make people aware, but, before that can be done, they must know who the interested parties are.  That is the intent of this section.  It is very far from what Deputy Jones fears.  If the situation were as he says it would be, then I would be with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Admirable as the purpose of the section may appear to be, will the Minister not agree that throughout the country there are numbers of holdings which are, as Deputy Jones said, in process of acquisition by a squatter's title, really in pursuit of family arrangements? Suppose the local authority tries to determine who is the true owner of such a holding, the only thing they will discover is that the property belonged to Patrick Maurice Roe, who died in 1899; no administration was ever taken out but one of the seven children remained on the property; he has since died, leaving seven children, the third of whom married a neighbour, clann isteach, is now living with her husband on the property and is in the process of acquiring title. But, if you proceed to find out who is entitled to be notified by virtue of his or her interest in the place, you will find there are at least 30 entitled to notification, resident now all over the world from Alaska to Hobart, Tasmania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice in the country is, of course, that these estates remain without any clear title, unless somebody proposes to sell and the purchaser's solicitor demands that title should be acquired.  This dilemma is well known and there is a procedure under the land code whereby, on application to the circuit court, title is vested in some particular person.  Preliminary to the clarification of title, there is a process of advertising and so on.  I wonder&mdash;I see the Minister's difficulty&mdash;if the situation might not be met by providing that notices, and so forth, should be served on the occupier with simultaneous publication <Col N="392" /> in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or the local newspaper?  Far from simplifying the planning authority's position, if the planning authority is fixed with notice that the occupier is not the owner, but merely owner subject to the equity of 30 or 40 other people, may there not arise an obligation on the planning authority to attempt to serve notice on all these people in such a matter as, to take one of the many instances to which the Minister directed our attention, extinguishing a right of way?</P>
    <P>If we require the occupier to declare the character of his title to his holding, I suggest to the Minister we will set off in rural Ireland a most undesirable sequence of events, a sequence nobody wants set off; a better purpose would be served from the point of view of the planning authority if we simply require the planning authority to notify the occupier of the premises, giving due publication to the nature of the work in contemplation.  The number of cases where the true beneficial owner would not be reached either through the occupier or through publication would be very small indeed.  Where the beneficial owner is a person other than the occupier he is presumably a person who rents property.  Ordinarily, anyone who does that on a considerable scale has a solicitor who acts for him.  That solicitor will normally see the kind of advertisement to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The letting of property casually is not a very common proceeding and I suggest to the Minister that the alternative device I offer merits consideration and would avoid the problem to which Deputy Jones has referred, the disrupting of tacit family settlements, which are much more common than many realise for the simple reason that administration has become pretty expensive and a large number will not face the cost of administering, more particularly where the situation is that neither the parents nor the grandparents had their respective estates administered.  I do not doubt the Minister knows, as I know, of many holdings where there has not been an administration in three generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the <Col N="393" /> situation is as Deputy Dillon outlined it in regard to the purpose of this amendment and the section.  If there are people with an interest, even a part interest in land, structures or anything else, and they are abroad for years and if the interest is something they know they have, then it should be the duty of the local planning authority to make them aware of any changes or developments that may be anticipated or proposed in respect of the property concerned.  All the planning authority would ask the occupier under this section is what is his interest in the property in question and if there are, to his knowledge, others who have an interest in this property.  There is a penalty if an occupier for his own motives gives false information.</P>
      <P>All that is required is the names and addresses of persons having an interest in property, so that appropriate notices may be sent to all of them.  I see nothing wrong with that.  In fact, I can see every reason why that should be done rather than that persons with an interest in property should be kept in ignorance of proposals being made, and, therefore, deprived of the opportunity of making an objection to a development which they feel should not be carried out.  We are not attempting at any stage to determine as between 20, 30, 40 or any number of people which of them has the right claim or the prior claim.  It is merely a provision to ensure that persons interested in property will be made aware by the planning authority of any projected developments in regard to that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate what the Minister has in mind and I am sure the Minister equally appreciates the point I am trying to make in this regard.  There has been and will continue to be in this country an intense interest in land which at times occasions disputes and arguments.  Compelling a person to put in writing at this stage his claim to or interest in a property and the disclosure of this at a later stage might be prejudicial to that person's right to the property.  In a great many cases, the people have not such a clear title that they can indicate it and, indeed, in a great many <Col N="394" /> cases they jealously keep all this type of information to themselves.  However, at a later stage in this Bill we are enabling interested persons to have access to development plans and the documents which form part of development plans and by paying the appropriate fee they may be able to get a copy of a particular portion of the development plans in which they express an interest.</P>
      <P>What I have asked the Minister to do in this amendment is to protect the rights of the individual in so far as the type of disclosure about which we have been speaking would prejudice his right.  We do not in any sense propose this as a hindrance to development but merely to protect the individual against the disclosure of information which could be prejudicial to himself if disclosed by the planning authority to an interested party.</P>
      <P>In this country the ownership of land is an interesting subject for everybody, including one's neighbours, and if there should be the type of dispute to which I have referred and if the person with a squatter's title discloses that to the authority, I want to ensure that that will not be used or cannot be used in any way to take from a person's title to the land which he has by reason of occupation at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know what motivates the Deputy in this regard. There is this natural apprehension as expressed by Deputy Jones that occupiers of land may be asked for information which would seem to compromise their own rather shaky title, if it could be called a title.  That is a possibility and I know just as well as other Deputies how jealously is guarded the ownership of land throughout the country.  However, if the occupier only conveys what he believes to be true and if in telling the truth he is hurting himself I do not see that there is great wrong in that.  Should it be that he should be allowed to conceal the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is something which I do not think can happen and which, if we thought it could, we would take steps to ensure that it did not happen.  This bears out what I have been saying.  What we really want are the names and addresses of people who may have an interest.  We go after occupiers in the first instance as they would be the most likely persons to have that sort of information.  If the House wishes, I would give way on the question of stating in any detail an interest or a right so far as the occupier is concerned or his being asked to state so far as he knows the interest or right of any other party and merely confine the section to requiring the occupier to give the name and address of any person who, to his knowledge, has any right or interest in the property, thus confining his own statement to matters that could not in any way be used against him&mdash;in other words, names and addresses and nothing more.  What we are anxious to avoid is doing any damage to the rights of an interested party.  We might notify 12 persons and, perhaps, 11 of the 12 would have no interest.  Perhaps only one of those is really interested and has a right to be interested.  The section would give us the right to do that and, as I say, the name and address is sufficient for our purposes and we can discuss it again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that information from the Minister.  I mentioned one case which raised this doubt in my mind but there is another.  We are suggesting the amendment because of cases that have arisen.  There was an individual who built a house having secured authority from the local <Col N="396" /> engineer at the time.  At present he is in this place and he wants to extend his home.  Approaching the local authority or the Custom House for a grant requires production of title.  The local authority cannot give title at this stage and no estate office in the area can give it.  Neither can reference to the old grand jury list be of assistance. The individual cannot satisfy the local authority at present.  He could not even satisfy the Minister's Department in regard to his entitlement to a grant. Somebody may dispute his right to put his home there.</P>
      <P>There is a second case of an individual in somewhat similar circumstances. Eventually, by tracing back to the Land Registry, we found the folio which was originally opened in the 1880s and was never amended.  I am afraid this man must give up because the amount of searching involved would be so expensive that he would not know where he would finish up.</P>
      <P>Those are two instances of where the rights of individuals might be prejudiced if there was a disclosure of information regarding title where a dispute arises.  It is from that point of view I am putting the point to the Minister and the Minister is meeting it by saying that he is satisfied with the names of the people concerned. What I want to ensure is that individuals&mdash;and there are many of them in circumstances such as I have cited&mdash; will not have their rights prejudiced by the disclosure of information which may come into the hands of the planning authority under this section. Later on we are giving individuals a right to consult these records and obtain extracts from them on payment of the appropriate fee.  There are two things involved, one of which could be prejudicial to the other.  We do not wish to offer any hindrance.  We can see the necessity for the section and I am glad that the Minister intends to look at it again.  If he does that between now and the Report Stage and tries to deal with the problems on which the amendment is based I think he will find a solution to the type of difficulty we have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 12, line 18, after &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or orders&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this amendment might be discussed with amendment No. 46.  In Section 10, it is provided that the Minister may make regulations for prescribing any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or in relation to any matter referred to in this Act as the subject of regulation.  There is also the question of orders, and under this Bill, planning authorities are given extensive powers in Part 5 which deals with orders made by the planning authority. Sections 42, 44, 45 and 48 enable the planning authorities to make orders dealing with various things.  Section 42 deals with scenic amenities; Section 44 deals with hedges and the serving of orders on owners of hedges.  Section 45 deals with trees, groups of trees and woodlands in respect of which the planning authority may make orders. Section 46 deals with flora and fauna and Section 48 with public rights of way.</P>
      <P>When the Minister makes orders or regulations under this Bill when it becomes law he will lay these orders before the House for confirmation and they will be reviewable by the Oireachtas but the planning authorities' regulations or orders, which are far more important to the individual property-owner, will not be reviewable. If it is felt that the Minister should submit his orders for review, if, shall I say, he is not to be lightly trusted in the matter, is there any reason why the House should trust county managers and not provide that their orders should be reviewable or subject to any restraint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several bodies set up by the Oireachtas such as Bord na gCon, the Incorporated Law Society and the Pharmaceutical Society make regulations which are binding on individuals and restrain them in various ways and <Col N="398" /> these regulations are subject to review by the Oireachtas.  I suggest there is no good reason why the type of order or regulation which may be made by a county manager, for instance, as the executive authority of the planning authority, should not be equally subject to review.  These orders which may be served on individuals are very wide in their impact on the property of an individual and his rights.  A person's right to a hedge is called in question by the planning authority and he is ordered to remove the hedge.  A right of way is claimed over a person's property.  The retention or removal of a group of trees, the retention or removal of flora and fauna of any kind falls to be dealt with by the planning authority.  Yet the regulations which would be made would not be subject to review.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage, the Minister indicated that the regulations he would make in regard to the operation of this Bill would be laid before the House and would be subject to review by the House.  I invite the Minister to compare the treatment his orders are going to get with that of the orders which may be made under the aegis of the planning authority.  I am not suggesting that any or all of these orders will be wrong, but the possibility is there of an order being made which interferes seriously with the rights of property.  Where this concerns a large portion of the area of any local authority, that should not happen without a review; and I want to suggest to the Minister that the type of regulation envisaged in this respect should be subject to review also.  In the amendment, therefore, we wish to add to the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or orders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So far as amendment No. 46 is concerned, this is simply bringing into line the normal procedure the Minister proposes to adopt in regard to his regulations.  I believe this is something which would add to the respect everybody would have for this Bill.  If the planners of the future feel the orders they are going to make are reviewable by the Oireachtas, I believe their approach to planning will be sound and not in any way capricious.  This <Col N="399" /> will entitle them to the proper respect of everybody.  The rights of even one individual may, therefore, be vindicated in this House by bringing the order under review here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One must have a certain amount of sympathy with the principle Deputy Jones is trying to establish with regard to the treatment that should be given to regulations such as might be contemplated under this legislation by the Minister for Local Government.  The principle whereby regulations must have the direct approval of this House before being implemented has been debated here long before I came.  The principle Deputy Jones is trying to establish has been advocated by all Oppositions. I well remember when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they, too, in respect of some legislation introduced tried to have established a principle of having regulations directly approved rather than a Deputy having to seek to have them annulled.</P>
      <P>While I have a certain amount of sympathy with that principle, frankly I think it is impracticable and impossible for this House to treat of regulations in the way Deputy Jones would like us to.  Dozens or even hundreds of regulations could be made under this legislation.  It is impossible to deal with all aspects of town planning by way of legislation.  It is impossible to provide for all the things which concern Deputy Jones and every other Deputy in a Bill like this.  Under the Road Traffic Act, the Minister has power to make regulations.  The Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly the Minister for Transport and Power and to some extent the Minister for Finance&mdash;practically every Minister must take power unto himself, with the approval of the House, to make regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it may be said that what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and that that might apply to putting the onus on a Deputy to seek to annul a regulation.  If these regulations are made and are brought immediately to the attention of the <Col N="400" /> local authority concerned, then they are their business.  There are Deputies on practically every important local authority.  If they are concerned, the obvious thing for them to do would be to seek to have the regulations annulled.  I do not want to appear like Tadgh an Dá Thaobh&mdash;on both sides at the same time.  If every regulation made by every Minister had to have the direct approval of the House, we would be sitting 24 hours a day for the whole year&mdash;and even that would not be long enough.</P>
    <P>While it might be a good thing to accept the principle of having a regulation approved by the House, it would be impossible.  Under the Social Welfare Acts, for instance, dozens of regulations have been made and many more will be made.  While some of them may appear to be trivial, they could provoke a debate here of an hour, two hours or even a whole day.  From that point of view it would be impossible.</P>
    <P>Where a regulation is made and is laid on the Table of the House, that does not mean a copy goes to every Deputy.  I would be satisfied if we were to establish the principle whereby every Deputy would receive a copy of the regulation or order made.  If the Minister makes regulations under this legislation, I should like to see him ensure that they are sent to the local authority immediately and sent not only to the manager but brought to the attention of the members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones in his amendment refers to the inclusion of the words &ldquo;regulations or orders.&rdquo;  I assume he means orders of the manager?  This section deals merely with regulations made by the Minister and I think it is up to the Minister and to the members of local authorities who are also members of this House to ensure that local elected representatives will not be by-passed and that if and when a city or county manager makes an order under this legislation, it will be brought immediately to the notice of the members of the local authority concerned. Throughout this Bill, there is bypassing of elected representatives and this piece of legislation will not and cannot succeed if it is a fact, as it <Col N="401" /> appears to be in a good part of the Bill, that the members of local councils are by-passed and that planning and development matters are functions to be assigned to managers, architects, engineers and the like.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Jones is advocating has been advocated in respect of many pieces of legislation in the past.  To ask the Minister to change the general principle now might be a little too much, since the principle is being operated in respect of every Department of State and by every Minister. Again, let me say that to bring every single order before the Dáil for approval would be impossible as a practical proposition, in view of the fact that you could have very long debates on numerous orders and a lot of the time of the Dáil would thus be taken up discussing individual orders which would be of little interest to Deputies generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion as proceeded with by Deputy Jones on amendment No. 45 would seem to be directed almost entirely to orders made from time to time by a local authority in the person of the manager and to the argument that such orders should in fact be laid before this House He suggests that such orders should be treated in the same way as an order by the Minister.  Of course there is a great difference, in that these matters we are legislating for now may be appealed to the Minister and therefore are subject to review.  When the Minister makes an order, there is no such review except through the Dáil. The local authority, in the cases mentioned by Deputy Jones, are covered by the safeguard that there may be an appeal by aggrieved or interested parties to the Minister and oral hearings can then be established to debate, discuss and put forward the reasons why it is suggested the order of the manager should not be gone ahead with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the general way of looking at it.  In a specific way, this question of amenity area order is dealt with later in great detail in Sections 42 and 43.  This type of order would arise subsequent to the making of a planning scheme.  That scheme would have <Col N="402" /> shown the area in respect of which it was proposed to make an amenity area order.  As part of the published plan, due notice would have been given to the general public so that they would know all about it in advance.  In addition to that, of course, the elected members of councils would have every possible opportunity of bringing the views of the people who elected them to the notice of the council in general session.  The council would then have an opportunity of deciding whether the proposal should include this or that area, or not.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish pointed out, an impossible situation would be created from a practical viewpoint if all these orders were to be brought before the Dáil, particularly in the initial stages of this new law.  I mentioned earlier that these orders will be subject to review, in the last analysis, by appeal to the Minister by aggrieved or interested parties after they have had a real airing at the local authority meetings.  Taking those safeguards together, particularly the prospect of review by the Minister on appeal and, in most cases, by the general body of local representatives of planning authorities, there is real coverage in respect of those orders made by managers.  I have no fear whatsoever in regard to the matters in respect of which Deputy Jones was prompted to put down his amendment.  I submit the safeguards are adequate.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 proposes to delete the subsection and substitute another.  The subsection as it stands is nothing new.  In fact, it is one with which we are pretty well conversant in its terms and intention.  Regulations do not change or expand the law and this is really a safeguarding provision. There is nothing new, nothing revolutionary about it, nothing about it in fact which we have not had experience of in the past.  Under various sections in this proposed new law, as in many enactments of the past, it is true that certain powers are vested in Ministers to do things by way of regulation and there is not much point in giving them control if you set about having a debate or a review, after which the Minister concerned will operate the power given to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> I submit it is sufficient, and probably a much more practical approach, to allow the present subsection to stand so that the matters dealt with in any such regulations will stand as prescribed in such regulations unless they are annulled, rather than to have in the subsection a provision that Ministers should seek the actual approval in each case.  If such were the position, in a matter of urgency particularly, we would find the whole section completely valueless.  As I said earlier, the regulations will not change the law or expand it.  They will merely exercise a right enshrined in the law.  If some Minister should step out of line, then the regulations he would have made would assuredly be annulled by this House and his work and the work of his advisers in that respect would go for nothing.  There is that assurance as a protection against the madness of the Minister.  If it is wrong, the House will throw it out without doubt.</P>

      <P>There is, unless the House goes mad at the same time.  I do not think we would all strike the wrong chord on the same date.  The Minister also has his advisers and they would have to be correspondingly mad on the date on which he made up his mind to go beyond his powers.  There is the safeguard that no Minister will come to the House with a regulation which is likely to be thrown out.  There is this type of provision in several other Acts and there is nothing in it about which the House should have any fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate, but under subsection (3) of Section 22, the Minister may require a planning authority to do this or that and &ldquo;... thereupon it shall be the duty of the authority to comply with the requisition.&rdquo;  The Minister's regulations will be laid before the House, but what if the Minister is making orders such as I have already mentioned? What if the Minister is superseding the planning authority?  Will the Minister's orders be subject to <Col N="404" /> review?  Subsections like subsection (3) of Section 22 give the Minister power to require planning authorities to do what he envisages.  I presume the intention of the subsection is to ensure that such developments as the Minister thinks fit will be carried out.  If the Minister finds himself in the position of making orders, will those orders be subject to any review?  The Minister cannot appeal to himself.  A person aggrieved by the decision of a planning authority can appeal to the Minister, but the Minister can hardly appeal to himself.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate other sections for the purposes of this amendment, but I suggest it is valid because in subsection (2) of Section 10, the Minister proposes to submit regulations for review by the Oireachtas. Deputy Corish mentioned the question of regulations made by the planning authorities.  I can see that there is a review of those regulations by the Minister, but if the planning authority have not complied with the Minister's directions as envisaged in subsection (3) of Section 22, the Minister may find himself making orders, and I wonder if they are subject to any review?  I invite the Minister's comments on that aspect of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that the plan from which this danger may arise is not subject to the Minister's approval.  That is the way we are providing for various good reasons, but it does make less of the argument if the Minister, if he thinks fit, can change a plan which has never been approved by anyone other than the local people.  It sounds strange that such an onerous task should be brought before the House because it will only arise directly or indirectly as a result of an appeal to the Minister by an aggrieved applicant who failed to get permission locally.  If the local plan debars him from a particular usage of certain land, and if he thinks that is unreasonable, he can appeal to the Minister, and the Minister, having due regard to good and proper planning, as he is required to do in certain sections of the Bill, could then, and only then, find in favour of the appellant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Very few cases of this kind will arise, and the Minister, whoever he may be, will be obliged to have due regard to proper and orderly planning. He may not, because he likes the appellant or dislikes someone else, direct the local authority to change their plan in order to allow the appellant to do what he wants to do.  That type of order would arise only in relatively few cases.  After a lapse of time, it could happen that the local authority themselves might be of opinion that the change should be made, but they would have to go through a lot more hoops than the Minister to attain their ends without injury or injustice to anyone.</P>

It is only right that someone should be in a position, where deadlock arose, as it could and probably will&mdash;some outside party, if you like&mdash;to go in and say: &ldquo;You have to do it this way in order to integrate and have the plan make sense.&rdquo;  This could be in relation to a boundary going through a town.</P>

      <P>No, any more than the plan itself is.  The direction in this case would merely relate to the production and preparation of a plan.  The plan itself, as the House is aware, is in no way sacrosanct.  It is to set out generally what is to be done and what the intention is for the next five years. A dispute as between two local authorities would be in regard to the plan or plans and the direction is not sacrosanct either, so that there is no <Col N="406" /> great danger, if anything wrong was done by way of direction, that it could go on for ever.

      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this amendment, and as I say, we can discuss this matter later when we come to the sections.  The fact that we included orders in this amendment is to cover the point that it may be found that the Minister is making orders instead of the planning authority.  Regulations are subject to review but the orders, in this subsection, are not.  I want to put the point that is foremost in our minds.  I do not think that our intent is fully known in this matter, that is, that the right of ownership is in question in a number of sections.  Everybody accepts that the greater good of the majority is paramount but the right of the individual at any stage is equally sacred.  The regulations which the Minister will make under this will be subject to review and so far the House does not seem to see any difficulty about the orders.  The Minister has dealt with our amendment No. 46 and he says that there is no danger to the ordinary normal procedures that exist at present.  If that is the intent, and I accept the Minister's assurance, then I feel I can withdraw the amendment. In regard to amendment No. 45, I shall take the opportunity of dealing with the matter at a later stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give the House any indication of what is envisaged in regard to the administrative expenses of this Act? Has the Minister in mind the departmental administration or the administration as it will fall on the local authorities?  Has any estimate of any kind been made of what this will mean in respect of the rate in the £ over the country at large?  Will it be a uniform amount or will it bear <Col N="407" /> more heavily on one place than on another?  In my opinion, it will.  I presume that in the urban areas, particularly in a place such as Dublin, and to a lesser degree, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo and the built-up areas, the impost will be heavier.</P>
      <P>Also, could the Minister give any indication of what staff is envisaged in relation to the administration of this Act?  It is a new departure and the Minister has a small section, I take it, in his Department which is dealing with this problem and he has been making provision by way of courses and lectures and by inviting outside authorities to come here.  I presume his intention will be to send people abroad in regard to the question of the administration of the Act.  Could the Minister give any indication of the expense which may be involved in this section, first and foremost, centrally, and then decentralised, in so far as particular areas are concerned?  What staff does he envisage for a planning authority? I am sure the Department have estimated what will be necessary in that regard and have decided what minimum staff will be required to operate this Act.</P>
      <P>We know that town planning, the planning of amenity areas and so on, will require both outlook and skill and that the Minister envisages that competent, trained staff will be made available for the purpose.  I do not want to tie the Minister to any figures at this stage but I am sure he has some idea, certainly in so far as Dublin is concerned, which I take it would normally be the area which the Minister would tackle first.  Anybody who has seen Sir Patrick Abercrombie's plan of greater Dublin, and who has read the report of the United Nations planning experts, will see that the problem is wide and large and will be extremely complex. As I said on Second Reading, nobody could give me anything like a firm estimate of the ultimate cost in Dublin alone, but I am sure the Minister with his resources has at least had a preliminary survey made of what is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am availing of this section to ask the Minister to tell the House what <Col N="408" /> estimate has been made.  If he cannot give it in regard to the country, which I assume would be a very onerous task to impose on anyone, prior to a proper review of the country by planning authorities, then perhaps he could let us know for Dublin and what would have to be done with regard, say, to the planning of new roadways and the re-location of industry, the rehabilitation of the centre of the city and the envisaged new type of arterial roadways which would be necessary, with parking space.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has been giving thought to this matter.  Equally, I am sure some estimate has been made in regard to it.  It would be interesting if the Minister could tell the House what these expenses are likely to be and if any estimate has been made of what the impact on the rates might be by the implementation of this plan in whole or in part in the immediate future.  I appreciate that the Act will gradually be brought into operation and that even in the development plan for any area there will be priorities.  I appreciate also that the Dublin traffic problem has been engaging the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy appreciates the almost impossible task of providing for the House at this stage any sort of an estimate of cost.  Many things depend on the activities of the various planning authorities.  Therefore, just as the Deputy has probably anticipated, the overall answer is that it is impossible to say at this stage what these costs would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the local authorities and the Department are concerned, we have sought to get an additional four posts filled in the central authority.  These will be technical people with qualifications to deal with this matter.  Undoubtedly, more than that will be needed throughout the country.  It is our intention to try to assist the local planning authorities, by way of technical assistance, from our Department. If we can get them, well and good, we shall try to make them available in a helpful capacity to the local authorities. Add to that the fact that all local authorities, with few exceptions now, <Col N="409" /> are operating planning legislation to some degree.</P>
    <P>The activities that may generate later and that could be said to be part of our town and regional planning, but which probably would take shape if there never were a plan, can be costed only when they arise and can be argued in the future to be part of the cost of the plan.  I am sorry I cannot be more explicit than that.  I feel the House will accept that it is impossible to detail these things at this stage, always remembering that the Department's Estimate, as it arises from year to year, would be the place where expenses and moneys provided for these purposes would be enumerated and on which we could talk in great detail&mdash; that is, if the Department and the Minister for Finance had already had their say about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The Minister speaks of four planners being added to his Department.  Does he envisage one for each local authority?

The local authority solely would be contributing to that work. Take roads which would be considered necessary under new planning or the development of parks, green belts, amenity areas or amenities of one kind or another which may be desirable in any local authority area.  Will the funds be made available from the Exchequer for such development under this Bill or will it solely be the concern of the local authority, not alone from the point of view of aesthetics but of finance?  If the local authority alone will be dealing with this problem of development, it may become hamstrung because what may be desirable may not always be feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not been able to say, for instance, what expenses may fall on the Central Fund in regard to this Bill.  I quite appreciate that it is difficult to assess the expenditure that may fall on a local authority. Certainly, we can anticipate that local authorities will have to provide technical staff to implement this legislation. Under previous legislation, local authorities were to carry out certain functions but they got rid of the obligation by not passing the necessary resolutions.  That was the position under the 1934 and the 1939 Acts.  Under this <Col N="411" /> Bill, the local authorities will have no option: they will be bound to implement the legislation and will have to employ a planning authority.  I take it that where two or more local authority areas have a conjoint interest, a single town planner will suffice for a region rather than have one in each local authority area.  I assume that it will be necessary to employ a staff.  I am sure that all these matters were borne in mind when the Bill was being drafted.</P>
      <P>In connection with good planning, there is bound to be expense.  It is the intention to create a more aesthetic outlook, to create a proper background for the housing estates, which possibly will mean the provision of suitable playing fields.  There is the question of providing green belts in urban towns, swimming pools and other amenities. All these matters will fall to be dealt with under this Bill.  In that connection, it is appropriate to ask the Minister what assistance will be forthcoming from central funds for a local authority implementing this Bill.  In County Limerick, a penny in the £ on the rates produces about £2,020.  In some towns a considerable amount of rebuilding is required.  The provision of amenities and the creation of a proper environment for housing estates would involve large-scale expenditure.  If roads have to be made, will they be classified as new roads and qualify for grants?  Will amenities created under this Bill get the type of support envisaged in other legislation, such as, for instance, the legislation in regard to derelict sites?  Does the Minister intend that local authorities will receive in respect of the implementation of this Bill the type of assistance that has been given in respect of previous legislation or what is the meaning of the section which states that the expenses of the planning authority under this Act should be charged on the country?  That would seem to imply that the entire cost of implementing this measure will be a burden on the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that that is not the case.  The burden of rates at present causes a great deal of comment, to <Col N="412" /> say the least of it.  It is felt that burdens are being imposed on the rate-paying community which are beyond their capacity to bear.  If by the passage of legislation, burdens are to be imposed on local authorities for various necessary and desirable developments, without any assistance from the Exchequer, we will not get very far in the matter of development. We may have the adoption of the Act and the creation of a plan but the development may be very long deferred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we do not continue to defer, as we are doing.  The situation is that we all have accepted at a very early stage and have welcomed that planning means economy for the future, the basis of that belief being that proper planning means more and better work, with a saving of money.  That is the basic idea behind planning and is accepted by this House.  If we are going to do things better and do them more economically than would be the case if there were no plan, we must write off expenses we can visualise arising under the plan costs which would have arisen if there had not been a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill when it becomes law, if there is a planned programme, the probability is that such a plan will result in a lessening rather than an increasing of costs.  If we are to start now discussing who should pay for what, we will never get anywhere.  We must provide for costs arising under this Bill as a result of planned development but it should be pointed out that this will be superimposed on the existing schemes of financial assistance for housing, roads, amenities, the clearance of derelict sites, the building of vocational schools, hospitals and so on.  There is a certain pattern of financial assistance at the moment and in talking of costs that may arise, it has to be remembered that this enactment will be superimposed on the existing pattern.  If, for some reason, a major change takes place to the disadvantage of local authorities, if road grants disappeared or housing subsidies were removed, the provisions in so far as financial arrangements are <Col N="413" /> concerned would, without question, have to come up for review.</P>
    <P>The financial assistance in the future will be the same as the financial assistance in the past.  The fact that we may improve the appearance of our houses need not necessarily mean that they will cost more.  It could well be a question of more economical planning and better lay-out.  A great deal of the work which will be regarded as planned development in the future will be funded and the fact that the development is planned should make it more economic rather than add to the cost.  Special provision is made at present and that provision will continue in the future and will be funded under the various Government assisted schemes.</P>
    <P>In the bigger centres of population &mdash;Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and so on&mdash;we may have to shift from the development of estates and the laying of new roads to renewal of the worn-out parts, dealing simultaneously with the problem of congestion.  All that will have to be integrated in a planned approach on an overall basis. Urban renewal in city centres, particularly in Dublin, would make the sites much more valuable than they are now.  At the moment many of these sites are not used as they should be and ought to be.  I visualise an increase in value when obsolete buildings are removed.  Urban renewal should show not an initial loss but a gain.  Cleared sites in central city areas subsequently properly developed should be a commercial success and a profitable undertaking. Moving out from the city centre to the less valuable sites, there may no longer be a gain in urban redevelopment. Prudence will dictate that every effort must be made to redevelop the most profitable centre city areas, later taking care of the less profitable areas in which development might entail some loss.</P>
    <P>Development on the proper lines will enhance the value of these properties from the point of view of local finances.  The Dublin Corporation, through its experts, will be able to estimate just how development can take place at the lowest possible cost. I am hoping that development will <Col N="414" /> work out in the way I have outlined. I said earlier that this question of urban redevelopment and traffic congestion in our built-up areas are matters which will require review from time to time, particularly from the point of view of financing.  I repeat that now.  I do not think I can say any more at this stage.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say that he visualises a great deal of development being done through the medium of Government-assisted schemes.  Those were the Minister's actual words.  I welcome that statement because it gives reality to a dream I have entertained for years. Development should be done through the medium of Government-assisted schemes.  If I may say so, I think a great deal of the money spent on schemes for the relief of unemployment is just so much money poured away. I speak from personal knowledge and experience.  In regard to development schemes for housing in areas all over the country I am glad the Minister has in mind that the development would be assisted, I take it, ouside of any grants that would be given towards the building of new houses.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 12, line 45, after &ldquo;having&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as one of its objects&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is surely not intended that some organisations which have other interests and objects either cultural or educational and who may also be helping in local development should not be assisted in their activities.  For instance, there are bodies which promote feiseanna in various places as one of their objects.  Subsection (1) seems to limit the type of association which the Minister has in mind for this purpose and it would seem to limit this to one object, that of providing amenities and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other bodies in the country which have interests other than providing amenities and which should be entitled to the assistance which is envisaged in the section.  There are bodies which carry out functions of a cultural and educational nature and which are also interested in local development. There are movements such as Muintir na Tíre.  I do not know whether that is a body, which is registered under the Companies Act.  I do not think it is but it has been carrying out a great deal of development. There is also Bantracht na Tuatha which promotes not only educational and cultural objects but also the type of development envisaged under this Bill.  There are also Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuatha which have similar aims.  The Minister seems to limit the provision to bodies which have the provision of amenities as their sole object.  If this amendment is accepted it will enable the planning authority locally to give to these bodies <Col N="416" /> assistance towards the provision of amenities and facilities in tourist resorts, and so on.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the type of work which is being done by local bodies other than purely development bodies. Take, for instance, the matter of tidy towns.</P>

      <P>I find myself in agreement with the aims of Deputy Jones but not in agreement with his reading of the section or subsections or the necessity for his amendment.  As I understand it, paragraph (b) which it is proposed to amend is wide enough as now drafted to cover any company having as one of its objects the provision of amenities and facilities at tourist resorts, etc., I cannot imagine any group, company or local development association anxious and willing to do this sort of work not coming within the provisions laid down here and already covered under various heads. On the other hand, I see no real objection to including what Deputy Jones seeks.  I think it does not add anything but if it is felt that it is needed, I am willing to accept it.  I think it merely pinpoints what is generally provided in paragraph 8.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy about this section but if my fears are groundless, I should like the Minister to allay them.  Even as amended, the section seems harmless enough.  Under it a planning authority may assist any of the bodies or persons specified in subsection (2) by helping the body or person in money or kind or by the provision of services or facilities including the services of staff.  We then have listed local development associations, companies or bodies concerned with the preservation of amenities.  It also provides that a planning authority may get such assistance.  It is true that under Section 3 that, before these bodies are assisted, the public representatives must approve of the payment of money.  That is good and only right but under the section the officials of the corporation or county council or <Col N="418" /> a planning authority may incur very great expenditure in the assistance provided to a local development association, a company whose objects are such and such and a body or a person concerned with this, that or the other. Any sort of screwball may come to the officials of a planning authority and get facilities in the form of stationery, staff, tools and implements at public expense.</P>
      <P>Both sides of the House have expressed concern about rates but the best custodians of the rates are the members of local authorities.  Desirable as it may seem in respect of some of the associations Deputy Jones has mentioned, I think it goes too far if we allow officials to decide whether this type of expenditure will be incurred. There is no difference here between kind and money because kind also means money.  It could possibly mean that valuable officials would be seconded, so to speak, to any of these organisations to promote their objects.</P>
      <P>That is how I read the section.  If the Minister can allay my fears in respect of the things I have mentioned, I am satisfied, but, as the Bill stands, the public representatives have no control over any expenditure that may be incurred by a planning authority in assisting in kind the bodies mentioned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also say if a local development association means something in particular.  I have been assured by Deputy Tully that there are certain conditions to be fulfilled before a local development association can be established and recognised by Bord Fáilte, the Minister for Transport and Power or by the local authorities.  I do not know, but I trust the local development association is not one that can be assembled by a body of people with harebrained ideas and that an association such as is envisaged would have some standing and be representative of the functional area of a local authority in some way.  I am concerned about what appears to be happening all down the line, that is, the stripping of their responsibilities and functions from public representatives because in this case <Col N="419" /> officials may determine what facilities shall be offered to the different organisations and these services and other things which they may provide may involve a great deal of expenditure which will be reflected in the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This point of helping in kind is very well taken by Deputy Corish and I propose to have another look at it before Report Stage because I fully agree with him that there is no reason why the screwball would not be handed out value by way of kind just as readily as by cash.  If we want to safeguard the handing out of help by cash, there is no reason why we should not also safeguard the handing out of help in kind.  This merits further consideration and now that my attention has been clearly drawn to it by Deputy Corish I shall reconsider it between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>(1)  A planning authority may, within such limits and on such conditions as may be fixed by the Minister from time to time, contribute to the funds of any body which provides for training and research in relation to town and regional planning.</P>
      <P>(2)  Contributing under this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister envisage in respect of research?  Does he mean the type of conference I have already referred to, training development, or does he envisage in respect of research there would be some officers other than the planning officer engaged in it?  I take it that any training or research carried out would be done with a broad view of the citizen's rights and duties in this matter.</P>
      <P>So far as the contribution towards training and research is concerned, does the Minister envisage confining it to local authorities, or will it be carried out on a more national basis and will the local authorities be required to contribute?  I appreciate that the reserved function part of it brings it within the ambit of the elected representative.  I want to get from the Minister what he has in mind at this stage.  Is it confined to the region of the local authority or is it wider in its implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is probably aware, one of our problems is the shortage of fully-trained town planners.  This section has that in view.  This is not merely a matter of a contribution by a local authority for research into some local problem or for the training of local personnel. It can, of course, apply to any such isolated local project, but I would direct the attention of the House to the much broader aspect of it.  Under this we are trying to provide facilities for post-graduate and special courses for our existing technical personnel, and others later, to help them acquire the specialised knowledge of various aspects of planning we would wish them to have in the years ahead.  Of course, all this will cost money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> In regard to research, it is again intended to have research on a fairly high level and on a wide scale.  That is being actively pursued in my Department at the moment.  As yet, however, it has not gone further than my Department, and Deputies will appreciate that I cannot say much more in detail about it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would envisage a contribution from local sources towards that type of research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If we are doing research at a high level, the greater the benefits that will accrue, and those benefits will be available to all planning authorities.  Therefore, I think it would be fair to seek a contribution. Whether that will be obligatory or voluntary is a matter that has not yet been considered in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see from the intent of the section what the Minister has in mind.  I can appreciate that a good deal of research in many fields may be desirable and welcome and may in the long run contribute much to the wellbeing of the community.  A good deal of research has been carried out by local engineers in regard to road making.  At national level, that might provide a solution to some of the problems country areas are faced with in the making of roads.  I take it the Minister envisages other things such as housing development?  On the Estimate, I shall have something to say in regard to housing development.</P>
      <P>I believe it is desirable to have this type of research.  I wanted to get from the Minister the type of research he has in mind.  Is it at national level and does he envisage visits by personnel to various places abroad?  Whether it would contribute to the material welfare of the community, locally or nationally, the intent is to seek a contribution, obligatory or otherwise, from the local authority?</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) of this section states:</P>
      <P>Two or more planning authorities may make and carry out an agreement for sharing the cost of performing all or any of their functions under this Act and, where an agreement has been made under this subsection, the planning authorities concerned may terminate it at any time if they so agree.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might be able to enlighten me as to how they might terminate an agreement in regard to development?  I can understand local authorities in adjoining areas combining with one another for the purposes of this Bill in order to make a development plan in which they would present a homogenous picture to the planning authority acting for the two or more local authorities in the area concerned.  But how can they terminate this agreement?  If it is considered desirable in the first instance they should combine and have a certain measure of agreement, I should like to hear from the Minister under what circumstances he envisages they might at some time terminate this agreement. Would this mean the termination of the type of development for which they had originally planned, even if they had not implemented it?  Having in the first instance agreed on this development, steps would be taken to implement that decision.  Under what circumstances does the Minister envisage the same planning authority would terminate the type of agreement he has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be looking at this a bit too closely and regarding it as a contract between two commercial interests rather than between two local authorities making a joint arrangement for looking after each other's best interests and having particular regard to the best interests of the public.  The Deputy asks for an example of how an agreement could be entered into and got out of.  Let us take Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council as an instance.  They might agree on the development of Portmarnock as a resort mainly for use by Dublin city residents.  There <Col N="423" /> could be a situation where the corporation would enter into an agreement with Dublin County Council, not only to improve facilities at Portmarnock strand but also to maintain them in some sort of caretaker capacity.</P>
      <P>That might be a procedure that would go on for years, depending on the period written into the agreement between the two&mdash;it could be five, ten or 15 years.  The agreement could not be broken within that specified time but it could be terminated in a way which would not involve a breach of faith by either party to it.  One of them might feel: &ldquo;This is enough of this&rdquo;; or one of them might say: &ldquo;We will do better in the future&rdquo;, or decide: &ldquo;This is not needed at all in the future&rdquo;, and the partnership might be dissolved. The partnership had come into being initially for the benefit of the public.  A different set of circumstances would prevail where a commercial undertaking was involved in a contract and where, if the contract were broken it might mean a loss and involve court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation.  I was thinking that when this Act becomes law, planning arrangements will be made generally throughout the country and a certain length of time laid down within which plans must be brought into operation. There is also the question of review. A period of three years was mentioned within which a plan must be prepared and then we have the question of a five-year review of these matters.  In the meantime, elections take place locally and new sets of elected representatives will come in after the five-year period.  You could have an agreement between two planning authorities to carry out certain development in the fourth year.  Then, at the beginning of the sixth year, new planning authorities would come in and there might be disagreement immediately between the two contracting parties to the original agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister might deal with such a situation under subsection (2) of this section&mdash;that he would at such a stage decide that the planning authority which decided to terminate <Col N="424" /> the agreement would be obliged to pay whatever expenses were involved in the carrying out of the original agreement. It may be said we are inclined to look at these problems too closely, but what we are concerned with is to provide, by way of foresight now, that we will have covered any conceivable point that might arise later.  As I have stressed, under our present election system, local authorities change every five years and consequently you might have a measure of disagreement as between two groups of councils in such matters.  Perhaps the Minister has something further to add to his earlier explanation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 13, to delete all words after &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; in line 45 down to the end of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the question of appeals and what they may involve. Appeals to the Minister, certainly, will cause some cost to the appellants.  The Minister has already envisaged the type of appeal that would be possible where a person affected could be represented by counsel.  There could be an oral hearing and evidence taken to assist the Minister in his determination of the appeal.  The section says that the Minister may direct the appellant to pay the planning authority or he may pay the Minister the appropriate costs of the appeal.  When an appeal of this type is made, it is made by someone who is being affected in his property rights.  If the appeal fails, the individual concerned has lost so far as his property rights are concerned.  His appeal has been dismissed, and whatever it was envisaged to do to his property will then be done.  At that stage the Minister would have the <Col N="426" /> right to levy costs in favour of the planning authority or the Minister.  We suggest that since the individual has been punished, if you like, and has lost so far as his property rights are concerned, he should not be further affected by awarding costs against him.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, no one will appeal to the Minister unless his property rights are affected.  This will not be a frivolous appeal.  Anyone who appears before an appeal tribunal will have had the advantage&mdash;at least it is hoped he will&mdash;of some type of legal advice.  He will have been involved in that cost already.  If the appeal should be unfavourable to him&mdash;and that is what is mentioned here&mdash;and if he has lost what he considered to be his rights, I suggest that to further penalise him by awarding costs against him would be unfair.  In an ordinary case when a person has recourse to the courts of law, if he lost his case costs would probably be awarded against him, but I suggest to the Minister that, where an individual is appealing in defence of his property rights against a local authority or a decision of the Minister, costs should not be awarded against him.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to absolve the individual from having to pay costs on an appeal to the Minister which he has lost, and which has deprived him in one way or another of usage of his own property or some property rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When looking at this section the House should take fully into account the vast change that has been made in this Bill so far as appeals are concerned.  We have broadened the scope of those who may appeal so much that anyone may make an appeal about anything that is proposed to be done in any part of the country regardless of what interest he may have in it.  Anyone may appeal against any decision about any property and any development in any part of the country which is no business of his, just because he may have a peculiar slant about certain things he does not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We widened this on purpose to <Col N="427" /> enable every person who genuinely has an interest to come in under it, but in order to do so we had to leave it so wide that people who have no interest can take advantage of it.  It is only right that if anyone can appeal against any decision taken by any planning authority miles away, against something in which he has no real concern or interest, we must correspondingly have some safeguard at our disposal to limit that type of appeal.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have to remember that these appeals may be made by a person who has no say, good or bad, in a particular property.  Appeals need not necessarily&mdash;and will not in all cases or anything like all cases&mdash;arise from an aggrieved property owner who has been refused permission.  They can also arise from a person appealing against a property owner who has got permission to do a job.  There may be an objector in an area who will pursue a development week after week, and month after month because such people will now have an opportunity of knowing what the decisions are on any planning by virtue of the register and by asking for excerpts to be sent to them.</P>
    <P>Such appeals might fail, be made again and fail again, and the person should be made to pay for that little game or entertainment.  Those cases will be rare and the fact that costs can be awarded against them will deter them.  It is not likely that expenses will be incurred in getting someone to represent them or advise them legally by the persons I am thinking about.  It is far more likely that the person who gets the permission and against whom this type of crank may appeal will be put to the trouble of getting advice and attending the hearing which he ultimately wins.  It is with that type of person and that type of situation that we have to deal.</P>
    <P>Another type of situation we have to keep in mind concerns the owner of a bit of land.  He may apply to do a certain development and be refused and told it is completely out of the question. The same case could come up <Col N="428" /> again, and again, and again, without any possibility of the appeal being accepted the hundredth time any more than it was the first time.  The person could keep sending it up time without number.  It would be turned down and he could appeal again and demand an early hearing which is given as a right in this Bill.  That would cost the taxpayers, the ratepayers and everyone else, time and money, and at some time a halt must be called.  If that person insists on having his fun at the expense of the ratepayers and the taxpayers, he should have to pay for it. Such cases will be quite few in relation to the overall appeals, but the fact that we have the power to make them pay will be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have broadened this aspect so much that anyone anywhere can appeal against anything in any area.  It is for that reason, and not for any political punitive purpose, that it is put in here.  It is a safeguard against unnecessary appeals from people with &ldquo;kinks&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the situation as the Minister has developed it, and he has developed it much further than I had envisaged, with appeal after appeal being made.  I did not envisage anything of that nature going on.  If an appeal was made with regard to a particular property and it was refused, I could not see any sense in appealing against the same thing again.  I certainly would not countenance such a waste of time and money.  I want to protect the type of person who appeals, in relation to a piece of land or property, against the decision of the planning authority, which is something which affects his right to the property, either compelling him to do certain things or refusing him the right to do certain things which he thinks he should be able to do.  He appeals to the Minister and his right to do these things is refused.  I want to protect him against any costs being awarded against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, costs can be awarded against him just as they can be against the <i>agent provocateur</i>, to whom the Minister referred, the person who has not got a genuine interest <Col N="429" /> in an appeal at all, who is not genuinely interested in the type of development which is taking place.  I want to protect the interests of the person who is making a genuine appeal and who is being affected in regard to his property or land and who is affected by his appeal being rejected by the Minister.  In that event the decision of the planning authority stands and he suffers a loss.  I want the Minister to consider that he is a <i>bona fide</i> appellant. There may be good reasons why the Minister would not uphold his appeal but the Minister should not consider awarding costs against him.  I know the Minister would not consider doing that but I am endeavouring to have the Minister protect such a person in the legislation.  The amendment is not designed to cover the actions of anybody who may be acting in a capricious manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House will probably have realised that because of the broad aspect of this we do need something of this nature.  It could have been done in one of three ways.  One would be by way of deposit, the second would be to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, and that there was reason for going ahead, and the third is this method.  The question of the deposit could be fair but in certain cases it could be unfair.  There could be a poor person with a good case but who had not got the money for the deposit and he could not go ahead with his case.  The deposit would have to be of some significance; otherwise, it would not have any meaning.  If it were of significance, such a case as I have mentioned could arise and a person could not avail of the appeals procedure.  Then the question of establishing in advance that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case would really involve a preliminary hearing by somebody or other to decide whether or not there was a case, and then you would have the appeal proper, as the hearing.  For that reason, there would be duplication to a degree in an administrative organisation which, in fact, will be taxed to the limit dealing with appeals directly, without having to determine them in advance or saying: &ldquo;This is a genuine <Col N="430" /> appellant; we will hear him and we will not hear the other fellow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the last analysis, we came to this particular choice.  I think I can allay any doubts which may remain in the minds of any Deputies.  In a first appeal it would be the rarest thing if somebody should have costs awarded against him on losing that appeal.  I cannot envisage it happening except on the rarest occasion. I would not go the whole hog and say that it would not happen, but I would go near to it and say that it would be most rare.  I think that you can almost take it for a certainty that first appeals will be a &ldquo;free run&rdquo;, let us put it that way.  Therefore, the person with a genuine grievance, or who thinks he has a genuine grievance, and puts his case and even though we find he has no case or grievance, I would regard that as a fair exercise of his rights and that he would not come under this section to have costs awarded against him, because he was acting in good faith.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 14, line 7, after &ldquo;longer period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not exceeding two years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection as it stands reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every planning authority shall, <Col N="431" /> within the period of three years beginning on the appointed day (or such longer period as the Minister may in any particular case allow), make a plan indicating development objectives for their area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit the time which the Minister may allow for the making of a development plan to a maximum of two years, making in all a period of five years from the appointed day.  I suggest that it is necessary to place some limit on the period of extension to avoid the situation which arose in regard to the Act which is being repealed by this legislation, whereby the planning authority preparing the plan after the passing of the legislation had no planning scheme made for periods of up to 20 years.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last October the number of authorities which had decided to make planning schemes under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 to 1939.  Having got that information from the Minister, I asked him how many planning authorities had decided to make a planning scheme under this Act.  The Minister said that while a number of planning authorities made some progress with the preparation of draft planning schemes, only one planning authority&mdash;Dublin Corporation&mdash;has submitted a planning scheme for his approval.  He said, further, that the scheme had not been approved even at that date.  The reference is the Official Report of Wednesday, 31st October, 1962, columns 333 and 334.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has nothing in mind by extending the period of time he might allow to a planning authority. However, under the section, the extension could run to any period.  I suggest the limit ought to be two years.  In the legislation envisaged here, we propose to review development plans every fifth year.  Surely it is reasonable to assume that if a plan is made, there will be some date when people may expect it to come into operation. Certainly, when we envisage the review of planning every fifth year, we should not think in terms of time that might go beyond that.  That is why we seek to limit the period of further time the <Col N="432" /> Minister may allow to any planning authority to two years, making it, then, a total of five years from the date the Minister decides is the appointed date when the Act shall come into operation in any particular area.  At a very maximum, the local authority at that stage would have a period of five years in which to draw up a development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We consider that the two-year period should be added.  One thing which is pretty hard to understand is that while the Minister lays down three years, he has already intimated to local authorities that the technical officers should be sent on a two-years' training course on planning techniques.  Has he explained how it is expected that the actual scheme can then be drawn up in a year.</P>

      <P>If there are to be two years' training, how is it expected to have the planning carried out in the remaining year of the three years?  I do not know whether Fine Gael mean to take out the two years or three years completely and make it five years.  We believe five years would be a more realistic approach to the whole thing. I understand Dublin Corporation are in the position that they want to get ahead with the planning immediately. Possibly it might be necessary to make exceptions in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to see the same thing happen, particularly in the country districts, as happened on another occasion.  We do not want somebody to try to rush schemes through in order to comply with the statutory regulations, with the result that planning schemes are sanctioned which are not a bit realistic and do not face up to present-day problems. We had a particular instance before of <Col N="433" /> somebody starting to plan and, when the planning was finished, the estimated cost of the scheme&mdash;almost 30 years ago&mdash;was £20 million for a very small area.  It is quite possible that somebody wants to start planning now and, without the necessary technical knowledge which apparently the Minister thinks is stored away somewhere and can be taught to those people, we could have a repetition of that situation.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party feel that five years&mdash;with the exception possibly of Dublin and one or two of the other cities&mdash;would be a much more realistic approach and possibly that meets with the Fine Gael view on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to know quite what is intended&mdash;whether it is to speed up the introduction by insisting that a plan be drawn up before a certain date, or otherwise.  I am all with those who think it should be speeded up.  I am against the amendment in respect of these two years because I am with the idea that we should bring it in as fast as possible. The insertion of the two years here would be an indication for all to read and see that here are two plus three which give you, actually, to the last day of the fifth year before you need shake yourself.  I do not want it to get abroad that that is the approach we anticipate.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I would point out, as we already agreed earlier on this Bill, that we have made arrangements and changes in the Bill, in fact, to enable the Bill to be brought in and that the appointed date need not necessarily be the same in all parts of the country.  In addition is the facility, and a very real facility it may prove in the bigger centres of population such as the cities, whereby different parts of the plan under the Bill may commence at different times so that we could have roads and amenities or several other things starting on different dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the fact that the appointed date when the Bill would come into operation would not be the same in all parts of the country, neither need all parts of the Bill come into operation on the same day in any one <Col N="434" /> given authority if it seems to be that, by breaking it up, it facilitates the getting going of the overall and that you can lay back that which is most difficult and start with that which is the easiest.  At the same time, I do not want to be tied to a maximum extension of two years.  Neither do I think it is good tactics to put in the two years because people would think that there are two plus three years, which equal five&mdash;and I do not want that idea to get abroad at all.  For that reason, I am not for the amendment. Although I wholeheartedly endorse the idea of Deputy Jones who has put it down in order to speed things up, I believe that acceptance of the amendment would probably involve the danger of slowing things down rather than speeding them up.  For that reason, I am inclined to be against rather than for it.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this Bill last night, I reminded the Minister that it was only last August that he had been to the House with a similar Bill in relation to the capital requirements of the ESB and that the fact that he was coming back within such a short time showed, perhaps, in one respect that there was some degree lacking in the planning that might have been done at that time. On the other hand, however, it does show that what was described some 35 years ago by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health as a baby elephant was, in fact, a thriving baby and that piece of elephantine stupidity by Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, is now characterised for what it was worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister last night, in his introductory speech, made reference to rural electrification, though in fact, as he said himself, rural electrification was not covered by the terms of this Bill.  The position in relation to rural electrification, as I was developing last night, is that there are two <Col N="435" /> methods of dealing with the contributions necessary to ensure that those people in the less populated areas are able to obtain adequate supply or, indeed, any supply of electric current. One approach is that it is better for the taxpayers to meet the additional cost and, indeed, that is the method Fianna Fáil have put into operation.  The other approach is that in relation to the widespread use of electricity, it is just as fair as imposing an additional charge on the taxpayers to impose an additional charge on the other users to make certain that their less fortunate brethren will be able to get supply.  We chose the latter approach.  Whether one chooses one approach or the other from the point of view of overall financing of the Board, it does not in any way affect, and never did affect, the position as regards the method by which the Electricity Supply Board would make the services available to the consumer.  The ultimate cost to the consumer in a rural area would remain the same, regardless of whether one method of financing the Board itself or the other was adopted.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach when on this side of the House promised faithfully that if ever he moved back on to the Government side, he would abolish the special service charges and make certain that there were no special service charges in operation.  Of course, when he got into power, he found that that was an entirely rash promise, that it was a promise that nobody could possibly hope to fulfil and, instead of being man enough to say that he had been mistaken, he tried to cover it up and gave the present Minister for Transport and Power instructions on a recent occasion to endeavour to cover it up also.  The fact, of course, is that it was an irresponsible statement, made solely for the purpose of a political attack on the then Government, as everybody knew at the time.  It was just as irresponsible as was the attack made on Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said that it was better in 1956-57 to taper off slightly and not to wind up all the rural electrification connections in that particular year with consequent <Col N="436" /> hardship for the teams of men and staff that were involved.</P>
    <P>Looking back over it now, it is perfectly clear that the decision he took at that time was correct.  In fact, in the year ended 31st March, 1956, 34,257 consumers were connected.  In the year for which he was attacked, 34,627 rural consumers were connected, more, in fact, than in the previous year, and since then the number has been tapering down, and correctly tapering down, to 17,000 in 1958, 15,000 in 1959 and 14,000 in 1960.  As I say, looking back on the records as they are there now, as apart from estimates, it is perfectly clear that the decision then taken by Deputy Norton and for which he was so bitterly attacked by the Fianna Fáil Party was absolutely the right decision.</P>
    <P>Every year I ask the Minister for certain statistics in relation to the cost of electricity generation and I confess frankly that they are statistics that give me immense pleasure.  It is sometimes difficult to compare the cost of electricity generated and produced at one station with the cost at another station because one must take into account the weather and the station at which the load is taken.  It is a truism that the worse the weather for our harvest, the better the weather for electricity production; the heavier the rainfall, the easier it is to produce electricity from hydro-electric schemes.  It has been pretty well established now that the basis of the policy of the Electricity Supply Board is to provide that the hydro-electric stations will carry as much of the load as their water supply will enable them to carry.  It is, therefore, clear that in a very wet year they are able to take up more of the load than they would be able to take up in a dry year.  Apart from that, in relation to other stations which generate electricity by heat, there is always the question whether these particular stations are utilised for main pay load or only thrown in at peak periods.</P>
    <P>In the statistics given to me from time to time over the years, an effort has always been made to compare the cost on a load factor parity basis.  When one examines these costs, taking the two years 1960-61 and 1961-62, which are set out in the Official Report of <Col N="437" /> 29th March, 1962, and 28th February, 1963, respectively, certain peculiarities emerge, peculiarities about which I should like some little explanation from the Minister.  I know, for example, that the capacity of the Electricity Supply Board generating plant in both those years was practically the same at 723.5 megawatts.  In the second year, output was a little more than in the first year, but the general implication is that the plant available for 1960-61 was in fact more than was required.  I should like the Minister to tell me, first of all, whether in fact the plant that was available for 1961-62&mdash;I have no figures for 1962-63; whether or not the Minister has, I do not know&mdash;was fully extended during the whole of that year.  I say &ldquo;the whole of that year&rdquo; but I do not mean by that phrase to include a period of extraordinary weather, weather such as we had earlier this year.  Indeed, in respect of that period, I pay my tribute on behalf of Fine Gael to the loyalty and devotion to duty of the ESB staffs, particularly the outdoor staff who, to my own knowledge, in the hilly areas of east Kildare and west Wicklow, as well as in other parts of the country, did more than men were entitled to be expected to do to keep current going for the consumers in the areas.</P>
    <P>I find also in considering these figures that the increase in capital employed in 1961-62 was only some £6 million. Yet, it would seem from the increase I spoke of earlier from last August, that the increase in this current year must be very much higher.  Is that because there has been a very high upsurge in the cost of construction, generation and distribution?  Or is it because the Minister is thinking now more in terms of commitment than in terms of actual cost?  I know the Minister did indicate in his statement that he was considering commitment as well as cost but I was not perfectly clear how he was correlating the two.  Those of us who remember the year 1960-61 and who compare it with 1961-62 are rather surprised to see that the 1961-62 year was so very much cheaper for hydro-electric stations.</P>
    <P>While there was some deterioration in the weather in that year, to those <Col N="438" /> of us who do not keep weather records, it would seem that the difference is incommensurate with the climatic differences and I should like the Minister to give us some indication of the cause.  It may be that, in relation to some of the problems I am posing at this stage, he will not be able to answer.  If that is so, if he is not, shall I say, on top of his job to that extent, I will forgive him and allow him to wait until the Estimate comes along to give me the information.</P>
    <P>If the Minister examines the position for 1961-62, he will see that the Shannon, that scheme derided by the elephantine stupidity of a colleague of his, produced far the cheapest current per unit at approximately one-third of a penny.  The Erne was the next cheapest.  The Liffey cost about one and one-fifth of a penny per unit.  The Lee cost about one penny and the Clady something under one penny.  I find it difficult to understand why the Clady should generate at a substantially lower cost than the Liffey or the Lee and I should be grateful for some explanation of that before the money for this new generation is given to the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I remember the way in which certain people were violently attacked on the subject of sod peat, violently attacked for their criticisms of wet sod peat. Remember, it was then handwon peat and not even macerated sod peat.  It is interesting to look at the figures.  We find that the cost of generation for the handwon sod peat stations is almost 2d per unit compared with one-third of a penny per unit in Shannon.  When we come to macerated peat at Portarlington and Allenwood, the cost is about one and one-fifth of a penny. Lanesboro is a little less.  It is only when we come down to milled peat, a comparatively new invention for electricity generation, long after the discussions to which I have referred, that we are anywhere near comparable figures.  Indeed, the milled peat figure for both Ferbane and Rhode are over the cost of North Wall, Marina and Ringsend.  The native coal figure for Arigna is able to bear comparison with the milled peat figure and, as well as <Col N="439" /> that, to bear comparison, though not as cheap, with Marina and Ringsend.</P>
    <P>How the generation of electricity by oil is affected by the refinery is a matter upon which I am not competent to speak, but I should like to know; I refer to the costing basis on which these figures are computed by reference to the cost of turf, be it sod turf, macerated turf, or milled peat, provided by Bord na Móna, on the one hand, and the Electricity Supply Board, on the other.  Who fixes the price?  Is the price fixed by reference to the rates at which the Electricity Supply Board would be able to get their supplies of hard fuel elsewhere or is it fixed by reference to the cost to Bord na Móna of producing this fuel?  In other words is it a case of putting the cart before the horse I have never been able to get a clear picture in that respect and it is only fair, before the Minister asks us to vote the money for this further generation and other general purposes in this Bill, that he should make the matter clear for us beyond all question.</P>
    <P>Is it clear that all possibilities in relation to the erection of further inland hydro-electric stations have been completely and absolutely exhausted. It is clear that the possibility of large hydro-electric stations has been exhausted but coming on to the smaller ones, is that clear beyond question? Has there been any exhaustive examination of the possibilities of generating by the somewhat high and speedy rush of the tide in certain long inlets or bays?  In certain of the larger bays with narrow inlets, the tide does seem to come in and out at such speed that it might be possible to generate electricity, as people at one stage, before the advent of nuclear power, believed on the other side of the water that the Bristol Channel would be able to provide a source of supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister, might I suggest, was much too vague in his opening remarks about the possibilities of nuclear generation.  We should get in the House some indication from him of the progress that has been made in other countries and of the possibility of bringing such progress to bear on <Col N="440" /> our generating problems here and the likely cost involved in such a nuclear generation.  I am sure there must have been a clear examination of the minimum size of nuclear generating stations that could be erected.  I am sure that the examination in other countries and here by the ESB must have made it clear what would be the smallest possible unit that would have any comparative cost success.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later, it is inevitable that nuclear power will be one of the things upon which mankind will depend not merely for the uses to which it is now put but for peaceful development as a warlike deterrent.  I use the words &ldquo;warlike deterrent&rdquo; quite deliberately, not &ldquo;warlike uses&rdquo;.  So far as we are concerned, it is in the civil harnessing of nuclear power to development here that we are likely to be able to use it ourselves and that we hope to be able to use it ourselves. Something more than a vague statement by the Minister that a watch is being kept on the possibilities is very desirable before this £25 million is made available to the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to pay tribute to the staff of the ESB who not alone during the period of very bad weather early this year kept the service in operation and carried out immediate repairs but who right through the year every year see to it that there is the least possible interruption of current.  We are very glad to know that no matter in how remote a part of the country a breakdown may occur, before many hours are over, let it be day or night, the repairs are carried out.  We are very pleased that the efficiency of the ESB and their employees enables us to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell me something which has been troubling me, a number of my colleagues and a large number of people in the country. Is there any obligation on the ESB to guarantee a certain voltage?  Very many people have complained&mdash;and I find it happening in my own home&mdash; that on occasions when all the people in an area are cooking at the one time or for some such reason, the strength of the current seems to drop considerably. <Col N="441" /> Although where I live it happens only during peak periods, I have been told that in many areas there is a drop for very long periods and the current is very much lower than it was when the electricity was originally installed in some of the houses in those areas.  There may be an explanation for that but I should like to know whether the ESB are entitled to charge for the type of current they are supplying.  If somebody is entitled to get a certain voltage, surely that voltage should be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to rural electrification and there is one aspect to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Over the years, there has been considerable objection by certain people to the special service charge but eventually those people have decided in many areas to take the current at the charge laid down. I have experience of a very large number of potential consumers who have agreed to take the current; they were told to have the houses wired and that the ESB would give them a connection. Yet we find weeks and months passing and the people who started wiring the houses in the early stages have got no connection.  Their neighbours get discouraged and gradually things are back where they started except that some people have spent a considerable amount of money preparing for the current which now they may not get as their neighbours will not prepare for it because of the long delay.</P>
    <P>It may be said there is a shortage of staff but about 12 months ago, a considerable number of men who were at least semi-skilled and who had been doing the work for as long as ten or 11 years were let go by the ESB in a number of areas and told there was no further work for them.  To anybody aware of this, it is hard to explain that the ESB are short of staff, especially if the people concerned are walking around or signing at the exchange or working at some other job which is possibly part-time or casual.  Could something be done to expedite connections when people decide to take current?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> A matter which has been debated here before&mdash;I shall only touch on it briefly&mdash;is the position of people living close to areas already serviced.  People have a wrong idea about this and so have the ESB, though I do not understand why.  It seems ridiculous that people, who live in an area where there is electricity all around, should be required to pay a very substantial special service charge for a connection to their homes and often to their farms especially when they would be prepared to use a considerable amount of electricity.  The ESB, I know, have a habit of estimating the possible use of current as likely to be a few lights and perhaps some light electrical appliances. That is unfair when people are prepared to guarantee that they will use a considerable number of electrical farm implements such as milking machines and coolers.  They should not be put in the position that they will not get a supply unless they pay a very high service charge.  I asked the Minister to look into that before and I do so again now because if there was a reasonable approach, I think the difficulty might be got over.</P>
    <P>Many people cannot agree that they should be required to pay meter rent, ground rent or whatever you wish to call it&mdash;some people have fancy names for it&mdash;during the summer months when they use little or no electricity. As an example, if the charge for the amount of electricity used by an old person is ? for two months and the meter rent is 15/6, you may say that is a small amount and does not matter but to an old age pensioner it does matter.  Surely, some other system could be devised?  The ESB might consider spreading a unit charge over everybody and abolishing meter rent entirely.  While some people would have to pay more, people who do not have to use a lot of electricity would not have to pay for something they are not using.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised the question of people who only use electricity in summer months when letting houses for seaside visitors and so on.  I do not wish to dwell on it now but I think the change made last year was unfair to the people concerned.  I discussed this <Col N="443" /> with the Minister before but unless he is prepared to change his mind, I see little point in pursuing the matter any further.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the previous speaker's figures of the cost of production per unit of electricity.  We should remember that, apart from the fact that native fuel is being used to generate electricity, there is also a social value involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but we want to get exact costs so that we can assess the social and the economic values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be most unfair to say, as was stated, that there is a certain amount of subsidy being spent on a certain type of electricity because it is produced in a certain way&mdash;milled peat was the method referred to here and previously.  We know that is true but the social value is great.  There is the other point that unless we are able to use oil from Whitegate I would be entirely opposed to any system of generating electricity using imported fuel.  It is far better to use native fuel.  Then, even if there is another stoppage of fuel as happened before, we would still have a source of supply.</P>
      <P>I hope that by the time the bogs are completely used up&mdash;that will hardly be in our lifetime&mdash;nuclear energy will be developed to the stage when it can be safely used.  The Government would be foolish to spend a lot of money experimenting with nuclear energy at present.  If there is money to be spent, it could be spent far better on the traditional methods of producing fuel and power.  The money at present spent in areas where, first, there was little employment and, secondly, where bogs or land were very little used is well spent and the ESB and the Minister deserve every credit for continuing to use that kind of fuel for electricity generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied, although the experts seem to be satisfied, that all the rivers that can be used for generating electricity are at present in use.  If the technical staff of the ESB were given <Col N="444" /> the job of harnessing some of the other rivers, even though it might mean major drainage or deepening schemes, I believe they could do it and that fact should not be lost sight of by the ESB or the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the ESB are to continue to give service, I hope they will try to give it to all who can possibly be reached because, while it has been said here that the people who are using the current are the people who are paying for it, the general taxpayer is paying a certain amount and that includes everybody in the country.  In my constituency particularly, there is a feeling among those who live on the fringe of the developed areas that they are being neglected by the ESB and the Government because they either cannot get electricity that they badly need or, if they can, they are asked to pay an exorbitant amount for it.</P>
    <P>I notice recently that the ESB have offered to give current in an area where previously the people felt the cost was too excessive.  The ESB are now giving it and they have reduced the special charge to 1/- per two months.  I do not know how this charge is assessed but it is paring it very fine when they include the 1/- which cannot amount to very much even over a long term of years.  Although the people are delighted to get it with the extra 1/- per two months, if the ESB had said: &ldquo;We are now able to give you current at the normal charge&rdquo;, that would have been appreciated by the people concerned.</P>
    <P>When the ESB are connecting new houses or old houses in a built-up area, every effort should be made to ensure that unsightly poles are not put here, there and everywhere throughout a housing scheme.  It may be said that is a matter for the planning authority. I know the ESB have the right and occasionally insist on putting poles where they think they should be put. It is a shame to see unsightly poles stuck higgledy piggledy all over a modern housing scheme or one of our many old-world villages, making into an eyesore something that previously had been a pleasure to look at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="445" /> join in paying a sincere tribute to the manner in which the ESB provided power and light during the recent very bad weather.  We have passed through a winter which was probably the worst in 100 years.  The engineering staff of the ESB, the workers and all associated with them did a splendid job in seeing there was the least possible inconvenience, particularly in the areas seriously affected by the storms and snow. I hope the Minister will convey to all concerned the appreciation of the general public for the work of the staff of the ESB.  The manner in which they discharged their difficult duties in probably one of the worse winters on record should not be allowed to go without a word of appreciation in this House.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Transport and Power and other Ministers of the Government talk about the ESB, they seldom recall the speeches they made about it many years ago.  I am glad they have reached the stage of appreciating the commonsense, intelligence and foresight of the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government and of Deputy McGilligan, who can be described as a pioneer of the ESB.  The proposal to harness our rivers for the purpose of providing electric power was described at the time as a white elephant, a useless impracticable scheme in which the taxpayers' and the ratepayers' money was being wildly squandered.  Now we see those who hurled those serious charges realising the great benefits that scheme brought to the country.  We welcome the conversion of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the purposes for which the ESB was established.</P>
      <P>I should like to register a protest in regard to rural electrification charges. Nobody knows better than the Board that in rural Ireland undertakings were given to the agricultural community and the labouring people that overhead charges would not be increased. It was on that understanding that a number of people connected and availed of rural electrification.  As soon as they made a connection, they discovered the charges were substantially increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="446" />
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unfair to encourage people to avail of a service on the understanding that there would be no increase in charge and, as soon as they avail of it, either to increase the valuation or increase the overhead charges.  The cost of rural electrification today is certainly very high, having regard to the limited income of agricultural workers and others in rural areas, particularly the small farmers who connected on the understanding that they would be provided with cheap light, fuel and power.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Minister to formulate a scheme whereby cheap power and light will be provided for the poorer sections of our community living in cities and towns.  In the case of old age pensioners, widows, and those in the low income group who find it difficult to pay their ESB bills, arrangements should be made in instances of hardship to provide them with cheap light and fuel.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the way the ESB in recent years have used our bogs for the provision of electricity.  The erection of power stations in areas where we have huge tracts of bog has entirely transformed the face of the country.  I welcome the establishment of power stations in areas like Portarlington, Rhode, Shannonbridge, Ferbane and other places where the ESB are now providing a substantial amount of good employment.  The engineering staff of the ESB should immediately set about further bog development in these areas where they have already erected power stations.  This should now be quite possible following the visits abroad of study groups from the ESB.  Further such development would enable the ESB to provide much greater employment and current at a cheaper rate. This development could take the form of the utilisation of many more bogs, particularly in Laois and Offaly where there is the most suitable bogland in Europe and where there is a highly skilled body of workers readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister does not interfere with the day to day administration of the ESB.  It would not be proper if he did so, but I think it necessary he should endeavour to do something to <Col N="447" /> reduce the number of electric poles now dotting the country.  He could take his lead from the Post Office who have managed to put a considerable mileage of their cables underground.  This is a matter of amenity which deserves the greatest consideration because at the moment many areas throughout the country are most unsightly with telegraph poles, ESB poles, road signs and now the new signs erected under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act imposing speed limits.  As I said it should be possible for the ESB to take the lead given by the Post Office in this respect.  Where future planning is in sight, the board should co-operate with local authorities so that cables could be laid underground in areas where new roads and footpaths are contemplated.</P>
    <P>As far as progress in the generating of electricity, either from bogs or water is concerned, we are as far advanced as any country in the world and I should like now to pay a tribute to the board for their foresight and planning in this respect.  There is one aspect, however, with which I must find fault, that is, in regard to the charges for electricity.  We appreciate that the board have had to meet demands for increased wages and other expenses but the charges are still extraordinarily high, particularly where they affect the poorer people in rural areas.  Whether by way of increased subsidy or otherwise, the Minister should induce the board to reduce these charges so that they will be within the capacity of people to pay.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the possibility of the greater utilisation of our bogs in the near future, I should like to pay a tribute to the former Chairman, Mr. Browne, who did such excellent work over the years.  The present Chairman is just as enthusiastic in the matter of bog development.  Generally speaking, the board have done excellent service in helping to brighten up the life of rural Ireland, to make life there more attractive and to help alleviate some of the drudgery in the remote areas.  I would ask the Minister, however, to expedite the electrification of the more remote areas, what I would call the <Col N="448" /> pockets that have not been reached so far, districts it would not pay the ESB to develop.  I can assure the Minister that if he comes to the House and asks us to vote money for the purpose of developing these pockets he will receive a great measure of support and goodwill. It is our duty to provide these services for the people.  If there are a number of people in remote parishes who think rural electrification would be an asset to them, it is our duty to have it provided for them.</P>
    <P>I hope no time will be lost in completing the rural electrification scheme and going over it again over a period of five to seven years, to connect other areas that have been overlooked, or to connect branch districts to already connected areas and serve a number of small holders.  I know quite well that the board will be willing, and only too pleased, to provide such services, and this House will provide the money.  I believe that the Minister will be met reasonably and fairly on all sides of the House when he asks for money for development of the character to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago, the Minister came to the House looking for a rather considerable sum of money for the ESB for rural development. At that time I brought to the attention of the Minister and the ESB the areas of Burnfort and Rahan which are within three or four miles of Mallow.  We had hoped that those areas would be connected.  They are not mountainous districts and they are not out of the way.  Any district within three, four or five miles of Mallow is not out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Deputies know that at present it is absolutely essential for any farmer who is progressive to have electricity installed in his premises.  There are many people in those districts who are still depending on candles and lamps.  They have no power for water supplies; they have no power for milking; they have no power for anything.  I thought when that money was voted here, that area would have been connected.  Since then, I have received many letters in that connection but nothing has been <Col N="449" /> done.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is to be done.  If it is not, we will have to adopt a different attitude when money is being voted in this House for the ESB in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reception of this Bill has been very constructive, and I want to make some observations on the various points raised.  Deputy Sweetman charged the Taoiseach with having, on a previous occasion, promised that there would be no special service charges, that there would be no need for them if we got back into office.  What the Taoiseach was doing was trying to call the bluff of the then Minister in charge of ESB affairs, by saying that if the ESB could afford to finance rural electrification without capital subsidy from the Government, there would be no need to apply special service charges.</P>
      <P>On that occasion Deputy Norton was warned that capital subsidies could not be abolished, and that if they were abolished, the effect would be an almost immediate increase in electricity charges.  He said at the time that he did not consider it necessary to raise electricity charges.  However, unit charges and special service charges were duly raised in 1956 by the Coalition Government.  They have been raised on one occasion since then.  As a result of the capital subsidy not being continued from 1955 to 1958, the extra cost to the ESB was something of the order of £559,000 annually.</P>
      <P>The capital subsidy commenced again in 1958 when this Government took office.  I should say, in actual fact, as time goes on, and as the ESB grow in strength, the special service charges as a proportion of the total revenue from all ESB sources steadily diminishes.  It no longer has the same impact on the financial operations of the ESB as it had before.  For example, in the current year the revenue of the Board was £20 million.  Of that total revenue, £20,000 represented revenue from special service charges in rural areas, which is not a very high proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about variations <Col N="450" /> in capital expenditure from 1961 to 1962 as compared with 1960 to 1961. I am not quite sure what point he was making, but I think the answer is the greater volume of work which was in hand in 1961-62.  There was an increase in costs due to the general increase in labour and materials.  It was relatively small, something like five per cent. Expenditure varies from year to year as stations and other work come into commission and use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about arrangements for fixing the price of turf between the ESB and Bord na Móna.  That is arranged by direct negotiation.  Bord na Móna like an oil supplier must be able to pay its way and the price is calculated on this basis. I am glad to see that as Bord na Móna extend their activities, as of recent date there was a considerable reduction in the price asked by Bord na Móna of the ESB.  In that connection I should like to deny the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon in a recent public speech to the effect that the ESB were subsidising Bord na Móna, and that Bord na Móna would be losing money, were it not for the existence of the ESB.</P>
    <P>A question was asked about the hydro-electric stations.  Some surveys are still being undertaken.  I am advised by the ESB that none of the possible sources of hydro-power are likely to prove economic and that there is no likelihood of their being introduced in the foreseeable future.  I asked the ESB to make a special examination of tidal power.  There is a particularly good example near St. Malo.  The ESB are keeping in touch with all the modern principles attaching to this form of generation.  There is no comparison between the power available in the long stretches of our rivers with outlets to the sea and those elsewhere.  Therefore, it would not be economic.</P>
    <P>In regard to nuclear generation, the ESB are in touch with engineers from the various nuclear authorities.  There are constant changes in the situation. In fact, when I last spoke to the Chairman of the ESB, he told me that the cost of nuclear power is so high that we could not even begin to consider <Col N="451" /> a nuclear power station unless we ran, on a 24-hour load without any variation or reduction in power, a system required for the whole of the island of Ireland.  Now, the position may change in future but all I can say is that the ESB are in constant touch with the nuclear authorities and constantly getting the latest advice on the position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked why we had to come to the Dáil so soon to ask the Oireachtas to permit the ESB to draw on further capital during the next few years.  The answer is the rather unexpected increase in consumption and of course, as he knows, if one could add 10 megawatts a time to generation, possibly we might not have to come so soon but as the increase in power in a single station has to be planned five years ahead and is now of the order of 40 to 60 megawatts in order to be economic, all planning has to be well in advance.  The example I gave on Second Reading of the additional set to be provided at Ringsend is an indication of how quickly a very large amount of capital can be committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman was debating the question of the varying methods of assisting in the development of rural electrification as between assistance by the taxpayer and by the consumer.  In fact, we have at the moment a combination of the two.  The rural electrification account of the ESB is subsidised to the tune of some £690,000 by the urban consumers and the cost of electricity in rural districts, I might add, is very moderate by any standards, including British standards, and the general increase in the cost of electricity, as compared with that of other commodities, has been very small since, shall we say, 1938.  To show how <Col N="452" /> the combination works, as I said, the urban consumers and the very large rural consumers have been subsidising the general rural consumer to the tune of £690,000 in a recent year and at the same time, the Government give a once and for all capital grant towards the cost of rural electrification. Recently the subsidy was raised to 75 per cent and the amount is provided from the Central Fund and the interest and sinking fund to pay off the amount is indicated in the Estimate for the Department and amounts this year to some £350,000, so that you have a double contribution from the urban consumers and from the taxpayers at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also asked for a statement on the varying costs of electricity produced from the hydro-stations from one year to the other.  The cost per unit is represented by the annual capital and operational charges divided in proportion <Col N="453" /> to the number of units generated. When the water available for the generation of electricity is reduced, the output in kilowatts must drop and the cost per unit must rise.  The ESB always generate the maximum power from the hydro-stations but naturally the amount differs according to weather conditions.  I might add that weather conditions can be quite surprising. We have had a most peculiar reduction in water supply at the end of a very wet summer season.  The last example of that was at the end of 1958 when there was a very sudden reduction in the volume of water at the Shannon after a very wet summer. That can affect the costing during the whole of the financial year in the most surprising way.</P>
      <P>Then of course we also have illusions about weather conditions which are most remarkable.  For example, the head of the Meteorological Office, which is run by my Department, told me that for a very great part of the Republic in 1962, the rainfall was not abnormal compared with some 40 years average, but what was abnormal was the fact that the temperature was lower in the summer season, so that when what was not actually an abnormal rainfall ceased, people continued to feel chilly and dispirited in many places because of a lack of sun and low temperatures. One's impressions of weather can frequently be misleading because the human being considers not only rainfall but temperatures and sunlight. Therefore, there may be occasions when one wonders why the cost of hydro would appear to be higher than it should be.  It is, of course, because of a sudden fall in water levels which are not appreciated by ordinary people.</P>

    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked a question about the use of plant.  The plant of the ESB is never fully extended over the whole of the year and the plant must be geared to deal with the peaks and the demand is not uniform throughout the year.  One particular condition which applies in this country is that there is not a sufficient 24-hour use of electricity by industry.  Therefore you have a different form of peak <Col N="454" /> and a different peak problem in the winter months from what one would have in an area where, quite apart from the domestic demand, there were a number of industries working on a two or three shift basis and using large amounts of current.  It is very interesting to compare the type of peaks there are in relation to the maximum amount of power that has to be available at any one time.  It is interesting to note that from time to time suggestions have been made by certain Deputies who specialised in the theory that the ESB has excessive capacity.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would remind the House again of the extraordinary conditions during the winter months of this year when every single station in the ESB was running absolutely flat out.  If there had been an abnormal breakdown&mdash;the kind of breakdown that can take place from time to time in any of the big stations&mdash;the ESB would have been in a very difficult position.  They only just had enough generating plant, making allowance for using everything at its maximum rate, to deal with the tremendous demand at that time.  I am sure the House would wish the ESB to remain in that position so that when blizzards alter the grid system around the country by blowing down poles and wire, and when there are sudden tremendous demands for power, the ESB will be able to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies deprecated the existence of many unsightly poles. I suppose this whole question will come up for consideration when the Planning Act comes into operation and it will be possible for local authorities to make observations on the existence and desirability of a number of ESB poles but any change will be extremely costly.  I cannot remember how much more it costs to lay a cable underground across the country but it is very much more than that of erecting poles. However, I do remember the cost, in a typical housing scheme in a small town, of providing an underground cable to each house instead of the present poles.  It amounts to £40 a house, assuming there are no specially difficult conditions&mdash;and that is a very considerable sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it could be laid on the houses in some cases but many people might object.  This will come up for examination under the new Planning Bill, when it is passed. I myself dislike seeing a great many unsightly poles.  They look like a spider's web in many areas.  I hope we shall be able to afford the underground system, if at all possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully spoke about certain areas where voltage fell below the minimum.  I understand the voltage regulation is an essential part of the general regulations of the ESB which will be examined and regulations will be drafted in relation to guarantee of voltage.  We have been discussing these draft regulations for some time with the ESB.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully spoke about some delays in respect of the rural electrification scheme.  I explained, in answer to a question recently, that with the increase in the subsidy there has been a considerable increase in demand.  I did make the suggestion to them but the ESB decided in their own right, apart from anything I said, to recanvass areas so as to provide electricity in the most orderly and organised manner at the lowest cost.  There may be delays where two or three people want their houses connected and where the canvasser will try to get another half dozen people in the immediate area to take power so that the work can be done more efficiently and that the cost would be less and may actually affect, marginally, the extra service charges to be paid by a few people.  They may actually be less if the work is done in an orderly, organised way in a given area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate the effects of the 1962 Act and the increase in the subsidy, the number of consumers connected under rural post-development&mdash;that is, in areas where there is already a network&mdash;is estimated for the year ending 31st March, 1963, at 4,670 as compared with 3,200 for the previous year. That represents an increase of 40 per cent even though the Act was passed <Col N="456" /> only in the middle of 1962.  The gross expenditure during the same period increased by 47 per cent.  That shows that people are taking an interest in connecting with the system.  I hope we shall see many more of those who are still making use of other forms of light taking part in the rural electrification system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully questioned the system of imposing service charges on the community in general.  He suggested a universal unit charge.  That has been examined many times.  The present system is the fairest and is practically universal everywhere.  I do not think it would be any advantage to people of low income if the system were changed.  The service charge is based on a calculation of the annual contribution to the capital and maintenance cost of providing the connection. Any deficit is charged as an extra service charge to the particular would-be consumer.  If it is 1/-, as Deputy Tully suggested, it has to be 1/-.  It is an exact mathematical calculation. It is only fair that it should be applied exactly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to some area that had not yet been developed.  As I indicated in reply to a question, the ESB anticipate developing all the areas of the country by June or July, 1964.  Work in a number of areas will be completed by the end of this year. I am sure the area to which Deputy Corry refers is included, too, because they are covering every area within the space of about 15 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan suggested making differential charges to consumers with lower incomes.  I think that would be most inadvisable.  It would be most difficult to administer.  It would cost quite an amount to the ESB to provide differential charges to people in different personal circumstances.  The answer is to increase social welfare payments and to increase whatever aid can be given to people in less well off circumstances.  I should like to remind Deputy Flanagan that since 1954 the social welfare payments have gone up by something like £20 million and all but £2 million was given by the present Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Deputy Flanagan paid a lengthy tribute, not by name, to the Taoiseach for his entire and complete responsibility in devising the turf development scheme.</P>

      <P>I said Deputy Flanagan was referring with delight to the turf development scheme and, in so doing, was paying a tribute to the Taoiseach was was entirely responsible for suggesting the scheme and getting it going.  I am glad to hear that, for once.  In reply to Deputy Flanagan, I might say that all the bogs suitable for turf development will be exploited by 1968.  The engineers of Bord na Móna and the ESB are in close co-ordination in devising the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not guarantee that at all.  Any good bog where the technical conditions are suitable will be developed.  The examination has been completed and unless some new technique is evolved&mdash;and the research department of Bord na Móna is very active and always examining new techniques and new ways of lowering costs of milling turf&mdash;it is unlikely there will be any change in the programme which has been devised and which, as I say, provides for the use of all the available and economic turf in the country before 1969 for the provision of heat for power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have already mentioned the fact that electricity charges were increased in 1956 as well as in a later period but that the cost of electricity has gone up very much less in comparison, I should say, with most commodities, since 1939, partly because of <Col N="458" /> the great growth in consumption and the great growth in production.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered virtually every question that has been asked of me and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill, 1962&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to enable Ireland to continue to play a full part in maintaining, in co-operation with other States concerned, the safe, orderly and efficient flow of aircraft particularly the newer jet aircraft which fly not only at very great speeds but also at very great altitudes.  Practical experience shows that it is only through common action by the States concerned that the economic utilisation of their upper airspace can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Owing to the high speeds of jet aircraft flying above 20,000 to 25,000 feet, reliance cannot be placed on visual watch from the aircraft to avoid collisions. All such traffic must, therefore, be controlled from the ground.  Jet aircraft move quickly from an area under one control centre to another and from one national boundary to another, sometimes in a matter of minutes, and this places a considerable strain on the existing control systems organised on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concomitant with increases in the numbers and speed of aircraft there has been a significant growth in the volume and complexity of radio and electronic equipment designed to extend the reliability and use of aircraft in varying weather and other flying conditions.  This expansion calls for the rationalisation of demands on available radio frequencies, and other communication media.  Keeping control centres to the minimum demanded by technical considerations and the standardisation of equipment and procedures are necessary steps in <Col N="459" /> avoiding any possibility of saturation in aviation communications media.</P>
    <P>The problems arising from the increasing use of jet aircraft are accentuated in the airspace over the Western European countries because of the high density of traffic and following negotiations between them Western Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed at Brussels on 13th December, 1960, the &ldquo;Eurocontrol&rdquo; International Convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation.  The Convention concerns upper airspace, i.e. above 20,000 or 25,000 feet but a contracting State could ask that the control services of its lower airspace be entrusted to the Organisation to be set up under the Convention.  Approach and aerodrome control would not, however, be taken over by the Organisation.  Accordingly, if we join Eurocontrol, air traffic control for planes landing or taking off in this country and planes in transit over Ireland below the upper airspace would continue to be exercised by my Department.  The staff of Eurocontrol will consist of qualified officers from the countries which are members, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Convention has been ratified by six signatory States and it came into operation on 1st March, 1963.  Membership of Eurocontrol differs from that of the Common Market in that Britain is a founder member while Italy is not yet a member.  Italy's difficulties in becoming a founder member are believed to derive from the fact that its air traffic control service is administered by the military. Spain has applied for membership of Eurocontrol and a number of other European countries are considering participation or association in some form.</P>
    <P>Air traffic for Eurocontrol purposes comprises civil aircraft movements and those military, customs and police aircraft movements which conform to the procedures of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In the case of air traffic which does not conform with those procedures Eurocontrol <Col N="460" /> will ensure that there is proper co-ordination of their activities so as to attain the maximum degree of safety of operation in airspace.</P>
    <P>The Organisation established by the Convention has two parts; a permanent Commission for the safety of air navigation&mdash;which is called the Commission&mdash;and the Air Traffic Service Agency&mdash;which is called the Agency.  The Commission is the governing body.  The Agency is the executive body run by a Committee composed of representatives of the States and a director to be appointed for a term of five years.  The provisional planning staff at present operates from Paris but will be moving to the permanent headquarters of the Organisation in Brussels.  Ireland has had an observer in attendance at the provisional planning meetings.</P>
    <P>The work of the Organisation will include the establishment of air traffic control centres, the determination of the areas to be controlled by the centres, the equipping and staffing of the centres, the fixing of charges, the relationship of the Organisation with other control administrations and policy in relation to equipment. Decisions on air traffic control centres or treaties with other States must be unanimous, that is to say, each country has a veto.  Directives about financial matters require a majority of votes weighted in accordance with the gross national products of the member States.  Recommendations on common policy on navigational equipment require a majority vote of the members. Member States have discretion as to the implementation of these recommendations. The weighting of votes in the Commission, although related to gross national products, is tapered in favour of the smaller countries.  On this basis, Ireland would be entitled to one vote out of 38 in the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>How could we be tapered below one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial arrangements of the Organisation provide for annual estimates, allocated either to the operating budget or to the investment budget, to be approved by the <Col N="461" /> Commission.  Capital expenditure will be shared proportionate to gross national products of the contracting states.  Operating costs for the first three years will be shared in the same proportion.  Later that proportion will apply only to the net cost of services rendered to aircraft other than civil aircraft of contracting states.  In the case of civil aircraft of contracting states net operating costs will be shared proportionate to user.  Provision is made for the raising of charges directly against users.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the contribution of Great Britain to Eurocontrol in the early years of operation will be almost one-third of the whole. France and West Germany will contribute a quarter each, Belgium and the Netherlands about a twentieth each and Luxembourg about £1 in every £400.  The 1963 budget for Eurocontrol is estimated at £90,000, and Ireland's contribution would be about £700.  The cost of the organisation next year may rise to £2 million on which our contribution would be £16,200 on the basis of gross national product.  As against this expenditure, there would be savings in the costs of operation of navigational services in this country, as part of these would be borne by Eurocontrol, and eventually large savings in capital expenditure on the purchase of equipment.</P>
      <P>Formal adherence to the Eurocontrol Convention will be dealt with in accordance with the procedure laid down in our Constitution.  The purpose of enacting the present Bill is to ensure that the necessary legal status can be given to the Organisation to carry out its functions in the upper airspace on adherence of this country to the Convention. The upper airspace for this purpose is that above altitudes of 20,000 to 25,000 feet.  The precise level will be detailed by agreement in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives the Organisation corporate status so as to enable it to enter into contracts and other commercial relationship and to sue and be sued in the courts.  The Bill also gives the Organisation the necessary authority to ensure that in its daily tasks of allocating airspace to aircraft so as to <Col N="462" /> secure the safe and orderly flow of traffic its working would not be frustrated through the failure of some aircraft to follow instructions.  Accordingly it is proposed that aircraft flying anywhere in Eurocontrol airspace will be guilty of an offence under Irish law if they fail to comply with authorisations to proceed issued by Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to give diplomatic inviolability to Eurocontrol archives and to premises housing Eurocontrol installations and to exempt the Organisation and its employees from specified taxes and customs requirements.  This provision repeats that made in other countries and is the minimum necessary to provide the means of common action. Provision is made also to enable the necessary payments to be made to Eurocontrol.  These fall into two classes.  In the first place the State assumes responsibility for annual contributions to be assessed under the terms of the Convention.  Recurring liabilities of this kind would be defrayed from voted moneys and accordingly would come before the Dáil annually.  It is possible also that the State might have to collect at least on an interim basis charges from users of Eurocontrol services and remit them in whole or in part to the Organisation. Provision is made accordingly to enable regulations to be made for the collection and transmission of user charges to the Organisation.  In addition power is taken to enable user charges to be collected by the State in respect of services provided by it. The purpose of this provision is to make express provision for the collection of these charges and accordingly to remove any possibility of legal doubts in the matter.  The Bill makes provision also for the acquisition of land for transfer to Eurocontrol for the purpose of its activities.  The main requirement for land, in so far as civil aviation is concerned, is for airport purposes and the amount of land required for radio aids and housing navigational facilities is insignificant. Right of entry on lands for the purpose of erecting radio buildings and aids can be negotiated usually without <Col N="463" /> recourse to compulsion and accordingly the extra powers of acquisition involved in the proposals contained in the Bill are unimportant.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making of Ministerial Orders, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which appear to be necessary or expedient for carrying out the Convention.  All important matters contained in the Convention are covered by the Bill and the purpose of the provisions is to enable incidental and administrative requirements to be met from time to time.  The Bill provides also for the making of Regulations requiring owners and hirers of aircraft to keep records.  The use of electrical and radio equipment in aircraft, in control centres and in ground aids to navigation has progressed to such an extent that the facts of any incident in the flight of an aircraft may be determinable only on the basis of the evidence supplied by the examination of this equipment or the recording apparatus incorporated in or associated with it.  It is accordingly necessary to include items such as discs, films and tapes in the definition of the records for the purpose of the provision.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to mention, however, in relation to the provisions in the Bill with respect to offences and the making of regulations that, in the ultimate, reliance cannot be placed on punitive measures for securing compliance with the requirements and procedures of Eurocontrol.  The Organisation is founded on the practical necessities of the limitations of the available upper air space and the impossibility of the safe and efficient use of that space except on the basis of full co-operation and exchange of information between national administrations and between the Eurocontrol Agency and those engaged in the day to day operation of aircraft.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Eurocontrol is a civilian organisation and that our adherence to the Convention does not involve the country in any way in military commitments, either explicit or implied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> I recommend the Bill strongly to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House accept without question any arrangement for the greater safety of those who fly with the various civilian airlines of the world.  It would be wrong, however, if we did not take this opportunity of mentioning how proud we are, how proud this country is, and should be, of the extraordinarily good safety record of Aer Lingus.  The record they have been able to achieve is one that not merely pays of itself a tribute to the personnel in the service but is also something that makes for travellers' peace of mind and the peace of mind of all those connected with those travellers.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I know very little about air safety, but to-day I heard something that somewhat surprised me, something in relation to the operation of Dublin Airport.  That airport belongs to the Department of Transport and Power and not to one of the air companies, although it is operated, of course, by Aer Rianta as an agent for the Minister.  I was told to-day&mdash;I should like the Minister to verify if it is correct&mdash;that it is at present impossible to arrange for a charter cargo plane to come into Dublin Airport between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  Traffic during that period is so heavy that safety arrangements make it impossible for a chartered cargo service to be accepted.  I do not know whether that is true but that information was given to me by a person who had been trying on behalf of his firm to charter a plane for the purpose of exporting an Irish product.  If that is the position, it seems to me to be a very extraordinary one.  I could not help feeling that there must be either some misunderstanding or the position needs clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has often been very great air traffic at Collinstown, on the other hand, there has never been anything like the concentration of traffic that would make such a prohibition essential in the interests of safety unless, of course, some mechanical device or some new regulation is required to provide that safety for the amount <Col N="465" /> of traffic that would be involved.  Perhaps, indeed, the enactment of this Bill will mean that greater traffic can be handled at airports.  I do not know but certainly the piece of information which came my way today from an Irish exporter who is anxious to charter a plane for the purpose of sending exports from Ireland is a matter that needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to a shortage of planes or to a shortage of skilled personnel for Air Lingus.  I believe that in regard to the former it does not arise.  There may be some question in relation to the latter, that all the personnel required may not be available, but I was told it was not in respect of Air Lingus planes; it was in respect of any plane coming in, that any chartered plane would not be allowed in for cargo purposes between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., and I find that very difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>It would be peculiarly difficult to understand also if we are to accept the statement that was made by the Minister the other day in Limerick in relation to Shannon Airport.  If the Minister was serious when he said the Government could not prevent the transfer of passenger services from Shannon to Dublin, how could that possibly work in with the safety arrangements of which I was told by an exporter today?</P>

We all know he regularly lives in the clouds but I always understood that, clouds or no clouds, 25,000 feet was about the height of those planes.

      <P>However, my obeisance to the rules of order as indicated by the Chair is always well known and I shall refrain from making further comment on that matter.  However, in relation to the speech by the Minister, it was intriguing, to say the least of it, how there could be for smaller countries a tapering off of voting power when the smaller countries get only one vote.  I should be interested to know what tapering there could be below one.  It seems to me that these smaller countries were provided <Col N="467" /> for in that manner, not with a tapering off but with the minimum vote necessary if they are to have any representation at all in the council that will govern affairs for general European air navigation.</P>
      <P>So far as the convention is concerned, I take it we must either subscribe to it <i>in toto</i> or not subscribe.  It will not be open to us in any way to amend the convention.  As a small country we must either take it or leave it.  Of course, that is understandable in the conditions and, therefore, we feel we must accept the convention.  I go further than that and say that we gladly accept the obligations and the assistance that these Eurocontrol arrangements will involve as regards the safety of air navigation. We do so because we as a Party have always felt it is desirable for us to broaden our horizons in relation to co-operation across Europe and across the world.  If this Bill has done one thing alone it is a good thing; if it has brought this Minister down to 25,000 feet, at least we have got him down some distance towards earth and perhaps with a little luck and with the result of the by-election tomorrow he may come down further.</P>

We are all conscious of the great contribution that Aer Lingus has made to these high standards of safety.</P>
      <P>When the Minister refers to land purchase, I assume that one of these stations will be operated from this country and I assume also that some Irish technicians will get opportunities to take part in this international service.

We are proud of the way Ireland has taken part in air transport and any feeling that Shannon was going to be overflown in the interests of direct flights to Dublin is something the House should resist.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome any measure which will help to prevent air accidents.  I presume the Minister will get this measure through the House but there are a few points on which I should like to comment.  I should like to bring the Minister down to earth in regard to his statement that there may be a resemblance between this set-up and the countries of the Common Market.  There is a very close comparison in that the same countries are affected, with the possible exception of Italy.  The Minister points out that the voting here is favourable to Ireland. The voting is on the basis that Ireland will be entitled to one vote out of 38 in the Commission.  If the Minister describes that as favourable, I wonder what his impression would be of our voting strength if we become members <Col N="469" /> of EEC.  I think one vote out of 38 is very small representation, practically negligible.  Possibly the only reason we are given it is that next year and every year we must pay £16,000 to this body.</P>
      <P>Every possible action should be taken to safeguard air travel.  One reason put forward by the Minister for this measure is that jet planes fly so high and fast that within a few minutes they overfly different countries and it is difficult for control centres in adjoining countries to keep in touch with these planes.  I should like to know why this measure is not more widely based if this organisation is to help safety in the air.  One would think it highly desirable in a matter of air safety to have as members as many countries as possible where there are air bases and landing facilities and passenger services.  Why is this confined solely to countries which are members of NATO?  Only one of the NATO countries of Europe is omitted, Italy, because at the moment air protection services in Italy are handled by the military and the body that is being set up under this Bill is a civilian body. Because in Italy air traffic control at the moment is administered by the military, theoretically at any rate, they cannot take part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an emergency, it would not take long for the civilian control exercised in this Commission to be switched over to military control.  Power is being given under this measure to acquire sites in Ireland.  The Minister may think we are all very naive when he states that we are not in any way involved in military commitments, either explicit or implicit.  The people of the country are not such fools, as the Minister and members of his Party believe, that they will swallow everything he says on a matter of this kind. The fact is that this body which is civilian in its interpretation today can be given a military interpretation tomorrow as part of the NATO set-up. There is no doubt about that.  We know the Minister's leader, the Taoiseach, has said that he is in favour of joining NATO but he had not the guts to come into the House and say it publicly.  He has stated over the years&mdash;and his Party have said&mdash;that <Col N="470" /> we could not join NATO because we would be giving up our neutrality. We have since decided to give up our neutrality and we are in favour of NATO.  So far, we have not got into the Common Market and the EEC countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is the first of its kind in which Ireland has been accepted into a group very closely associated with NATO.  The Minister has said that certain offences can be committed when this measure becomes law.  Where legislation is passed, I feel it is commonsense to suggest that there should be power of enforcement.  There is not the slightest power of enforcement in this measure and if any country anywhere decides to fly over Ireland and ignore these regulations, what can we do about it?  If the smallest country in South America decides to send aeroplanes over this country at a height of 25,000 feet or more and flouts the regulations which the Government believe they have power to make now, we can do nothing.  It is just as nonsensical as the position regarding our fisheries.  We have fishery protection boats that are not able to protect our trawlers or fishing grounds.  Now we are setting up legislation which may involve certain offences and if these offences are committed, we can do nothing about them.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says Spain has applied for membership of Eurocontrol and a number of other European countries are considering participation or association in some form or other.  Would the Minister elaborate on the countries?  I am not interested in what Spain is doing because we know the type of Government there.  That would be the apple of the Taoiseach's eye, if he could have that type of Government here, seeing how difficult the situation is for him at present.  I should like to know the countries considering participation or association.  Why is it necessary for us to apply for full <Col N="471" /> membership rather than association which, in the Minister's words, is being considered by some other countries?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that in the voting, directives about financial matters require a majority, weighted in accordance with the gross national products of member states.  I presume that is fair enough but I should like the Minister to comment on this one:</P>
    <P>Decisions on air traffic control centres or treaties with other States must be unanimous, that is to say, each country has a veto.</P>
    <P>Suppose tomorrow morning this country wanted to make some reciprocal arrangement with the United States?  If this measure becomes law, is it not a fact that any one of the European States can veto our arrangements with the American Government? Is that desirable?  Would it not be more advisable to have association at this stage, rather than what I might describe as full membership?  We should not be so anxious to jump into this for prestige purposes, the same as we jump into every possible line of action thought up by a Government with such inventive minds as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport and Power.  I do not want to elaborate too much on what is going to happen this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> America in the next five or six weeks.</P>

The situation I refer to, where this country might like to make some arrangement on air services with the American Government is one the Minister should bear in mind.  It is quite possible that situation may arìse. At present we have Aer Lingus going into the hotel business in conjunction with American interests.  We know what that means.  As far as the Americans are concerned, their intention is to get to Dublin direct from America, which means overflying Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall allay the Ceann Comhairle's suspicions by referring to the Minister's statement that Ireland's voting strength on this Commission is to be one and that the power of veto lies with other member States in regard to any arrangement made between two countries.  I should like to pose this question to the Minister. If Ireland and America wish to make certain arrangements as far as air services are concerned, will it be necessary for the Irish Government to submit those arrangements to Eurocontrol for its approval?  If so, it is a backward step at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am in full agreement with any steps to improve safety precautions in the air, but I would much prefer to see a wider body established.  I would much prefer to see the Americans, the Russians and all those other people throwing their weight into a worldwide body that would have the power to deal with those who offended against the majority.  There is no use in five or six countries thinking they can bring about a certain measure of control in air services and safety precautions. If bigger countries flout the wishes of these States, legislation of the kind now before the House is a waste of time and highly undesirable.  The reason I harp on that is that I am so keen on seeing the best possible safety measures brought into operation.  I do not believe the type we have in this measure are the best possible under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I cannot help it if Deputy McQuillan dreads joining international organisations, but with <Col N="473" /> the sanction of this House, we are going to join Eurocontrol, and that is that.  Eurocontrol cannot veto any arrangements made with the United States.  It will extend only to the area above the national territories of the member States.</P>
      <P>In regard to violation of regulations, any plane violating air navigation regulations can be detained if it lands at any airport in a country which is a member of Eurocontrol.  Mercifully, we do not have to spend millions on expensive air traffic police to prevent all sorts of illegal incidents taking place in the air above us, because on the whole, the international regulations are well observed by civil aircraft, and indeed by military aircraft, in the vast majority of countries.</P>
      <P>When planes come into Shannon Airport, the Shannon Airport Air Traffic Control will be controlled by the national service and not by Eurocontrol, as the planes are then below 25,000 feet.  Eurocontrol will not operate in the North Atlantic.  It is concerned with the control of navigation in the upper air space 20,000 to 25,000 feet over territories of members who belong to the organisation.</P>

      <P>Association with Eurocontrol would be of no value to this country.  We would have no say in the location of centres or any other matter in which we might wish to have a voice.  We should try to avoid association in our position in relation to European organisations in general.  We should play our part and accept our responsibilities in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eurocontrol has nothing to do with NATO.  I might add that Sweden and Switzerland have observers at Eurocontrol, and moreover, the Commission cannot act on any important matter except unanimously, and so they could hardly drag us into a war. That disposes of the ridiculous suggestion <Col N="474" /> of Deputy McQuillan.  Eurocontrol deals only with air traffic control and has nothing to do with the routes and operations of air companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked about the location of centres for the Eurocontrol technical and administrative operations.  This has not yet been determined.  The Commission, on which we will be represented, will determine the areas.  There again, their decision must be unanimous. Irrespective of the locations, it is expected a number of Irish technicians will be employed by Eurocontrol.  We have very friendly and happy relations with all the officers concerned with the formation of this organisation.  As usual, our own officers are playing a part over and above what might be regarded as what they would have in relation to the size of the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say the officials of my Department, as those of other Departments, are able to express the image of Ireland and play an excellent part at a great many international conferences, as Deputies well know. Deputies have asked about our contribution. The reason I spoke of our being entitled to vote, to a certain participation in the voting, was the fact that if it were tapered, our contribution would be one vote in 100. As it is, it is one vote in 38.  That is what I meant by tapering.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about certain regulations with regard to chartered traffic at Dublin Airport.  I am making inquiries into this matter.  I do not know of any such arrangement at all.  I read the regular reports of the amount of freight handled at Dublin Airport constantly increasing. I have discussed the whole matter on occasions with the Chairman of Aer Lingus in an endeavour to see what could be done to promote the development of air freight.</P>

      <P>Deputies have asked why more countries had not offered to be members of Eurocontrol.  It has been started by countries where there is the greatest density of jet aircraft, where aircraft converge from all parts of the world and where the control of navigation is becoming more and more difficult.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,587,970 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the salaries and expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net total required for 1963/64 is £2,709,370.  As shown in the Book of Estimates, this represents an increase of £219,320 on last year.  However, <Col N="476" /> Deputies will recall that a supplementary net sum of £33,500 for 1962/63 was voted in March last but this occurred too late for inclusion in the appropriate columns relating to 1962/63 in this year's Estimates Volume.  The actual net increase for the current year, therefore, is £185,820.</P>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to comment on the salient features of the Estimate, with particular reference to those subheads which show a significant change as compared with the amounts provided last year.  I shall then review briefly the main activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last and, before concluding, I propose to refer to some general matters associated with this important Vote.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead A, which provides for salaries, wages and allowances, there is an increase of £17,845 as compared with last year.  The additional amount is mostly attributable to normal incremental advances accruing to the staff in the current year.  Whilst there has been a slight reduction in total personnel since last year, the maintenance of an adequate level of trained staff is essential to the satisfactory implementation of the land settlement programme.</P>
    <P>Subhead B provides mainly for travelling expenses arising from the inspection, survey and allotment of lands under the Land Acts.  Incidental expenses, e.g. telephones, telegrams, advertisements, etc., are also included under this subhead.  The additional £3,050 this year relates largely to an expected increase in travelling expenses due to general acceleration of land settlement activities.</P>
    <P>Subhead D represents the taxpayers' contribution in the current year towards the service of land purchase debt, accumulated, since 1923, on both tenanted and untenanted land.  The moneys in this subhead are in the nature of statutory commitments.  The total contribution this year amounts to £965,750, or about 35 per cent. of the entire net Estimate.  Of this amount, more than £820,000 is required to make good deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities conceded in 1933.  The increase of £32,150 in Subhead D this <Col N="477" /> year is attributable almost entirely to the halving of purchase instalments payable by new allottees as land settlement continues.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead G, a total of £215,000 is provided for three distinct items.  Firstly, there is provision for £185,000 for the purchase of lands for cash in the open market under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall comment more fully on this activity in a few moments. The second item provides £10,000 as compensation, payable in cash, for tenancy interests resumed on the small outstanding residue of estates of the former Congested Districts Board. Last year there was an unexpected increase in the intake of land from this source and it was necessary, towards the end of the year, to augment the original provision of £5,000 by a supplementary sum of £25,000.  For the current year, it is expected that £10,000 will suffice.</P>
      <P>The final part of Subhead G, G.3, is a new item and represents auctioneers' commission on relevant purchases of land for cash and land bonds.  As was explained when introducing the supplementary Lands Estimate last March, it has been the practice to pay auctioneers' commission in respect of lands purchased by the Land Commission for cash under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  The necessary funds were heretofore included under Subhead G.1.  The principle of paying auctioneers' commission has recently been extended by me, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to certain properties purchased on a voluntary basis for land bonds and to the resumption of unvested tenancies. The anticipated aggregate requirement for the current year, viz. £20,000, is now provided for under Subhead G.3. I have no doubt that the extension of payment of commission on the lines indicated will prove a decided incentive to auctioneers to offer lands on their books to the Land Commission and that, with fewer contested cases, there will follow an acceleration in land acquisition for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Reverting to the main item under Subhead G, the purchase of land for cash under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, Deputies will be aware that the volume of financial provision for this purpose has shown a progressive expansion each year since 1958.  The original provision last year was £140,000 but this was increased by £35,000 in the Supplementary Estimate.  The upward trend is being maintained in the current year and the amount proposed, £185,000, represents an increase of £10,000 on last year's total record provision.  It is scarcely necessary to remind the House that the main bulk of land acquisition is financed in land bonds issued under Land Bond Orders made annually by the Minister for Finance and that the scope of Section 27 of the 1950 Act is limited to the purchase for cash of land required for the creation of migrants' holdings or to facilitate the rearrangement of intermixed holdings.  Last year, a sum of £182,279 was expended under Section 27, the total area purchased for cash being 2,231 acres; in the previous year, an expenditure of £135,795 was incurred in respect of 1,837 acres. The prevailing trend in the supply of suitable properties coming on the market suggests that there will be no difficulty in utilising the expanded volume of funds being made available this year for the purposes of Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an increase of £1,000 under Subhead H, which provides for payment of gratuities, pursuant to Section 29 of the Land Act, 1950, to persons displaced from employment on estates acquired by the Land Commission for distribution. Last year, gratuities totalling £7,004 were paid to 34 ex-employees&mdash;an average of £206 each.  In all, from the passing of the Land Act, 1950, to 31st March, 1963, a total of 279 displaced employees have received gratuities aggregating £37,146, an average of £133 per man.  Displaced employees who are deemed competent to work land are automatically considered for <Col N="479" /> allotments; indeed, this is only right and proper.  If they are not considered suitable for allotments, however, they become eligible for a cash gratuity, depending on such factors as length of service, personal and family circumstances and availability of alternative employment.  It is difficult to anticipate accurately the extent of commitments under Subhead H in any particular year but, having regard to the increased level of acquisition activity, an additional sum of £1,000 is likely to be required for the current year.</P>
      <P>Subhead I, for the most part, provides the funds required to finance improvement works on estates being divided by the Land Commission. These works include the erection of dwellinghouses and out-offices, the provision of access roads, fencing, drainage and water supply, turbary development, repair and maintenance of embankments, etc.  All of these works are an essential feature of the land settlement programme and the heavy expenditure incurred on them each year inevitably accounts for a substantial proportion of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>Last year, the amount originally provided under Subhead I, viz. £690,000, proved inadequate and a supplementary sum of £35,000 was voted in March last, bringing the aggregate provision for the year to £725,000. Total expenditure for the year, from the subhead, amounted to £720,101, of which some £292,000 was incurred on building projects.  Land Commission estate improvement works generally, in the course of the year, provided employment for about 920 workmen, including gangers and tradesmen, whose wage bill totalled some £304,600.  The Incentive Bonus Scheme for Land Commission workmen engaged in general estate improvements continues to operate satisfactorily. Application of the scheme resulted in a significant saving in expenditure in the course of the year. Productivity increased simultaneously and the amount paid to the men by way of bonus was substantially higher than in the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="480" /> The amount proposed under subhead I this year is £790,000, which comprises over 29 per cent of the net Estimate.  There has been an increase, effective from 1st April, 1962, in wages for Land Commission labourers and tradesmen.  Moreover, new dwellinghouses for migrants are now being fully serviced by the provision of piped water, hot water system, bathroom, toilet and sewerage facilities. Despite the inevitable increased costs involved, however, Deputies will, I feel sure, regard the provision of these amenities as a welcome development in Land Commission housing.</P>

      <P>While on this subject, I may mention that progress in the provision of water supplies for domestic and stock requirements of tenants and allottees continued during the year ended 31st March last.  In all, 123 wells were provided in the course of the year, compared with an output of 106 wells in the previous year, either through the operation of the Land Commission's well-boring machines or by contractors employed by them to augment the output of their own machinery.</P>
      <P>The necessary funds for the purpose of making grants for the preservation and improvement of game resources are provided under Subhead L. Grants are provided, with the funds available, to assist approved game development schemes formulated by local organisations representative of all appropriate interests.  In this connection, I have repeatedly stated that I prefer to deal with one representative body at county level.  I have also made it clear that grants from Subhead L would be confined to assisting locally organised direct improvement schemes which hold promise of worthwhile practical results and which are backed by efficient local organisation and initiative.  These schemes, in the main, relate to vermin destruction, that is the control of predators, other than foxes; grants are also made available for game-farms and for general restocking purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision under the subhead last year originally stood at £10,000 but <Col N="481" /> it became necessary, for the reasons mentioned on the occasion of the supplementary estimate in March last, to augment this sum by £3,000, thereby bringing the total provision for 1962-63 to £13,000.  During the past year, 20 schemes involving an aggregate expenditure of £25,000, were approved. To assist these schemes, grants amounting to £16,777 were sanctioned, on the basis of payment <i>pro rata</i> with vouched expenditure by the Regional Game Councils concerned.  By 31st March, 1963, the financial provision for the year had been fully expended. the remaining approved grants, together with any supplementary grants, which may arise, will fall to be paid in the current year.</P>
    <P>In order to meet outstanding commitments and in anticipation of a greater volume of game development schemes, provision this year has been increased to £25,000.  Regional game councils, which have now been established in 24 counties, will shortly be asked to submit their proposals for the current year to my Department for consideration.  Having now entered on the third year of active State participation in this sphere, it gives me particular satisfaction to know that the financial assistance provided through my Department has contributed to the advancement of the game movement. In most counties a spirit of co-operation and mutual understanding prevails and I look to the various regional game councils to press ahead with the practical side of the work.</P>
    <P>The game movement is primarily for the benefit of our own people but should ultimately result in the development of an important national asset. Game councils should I think, recognise the importance and urgency of making our farmers more game conscious and also of inculcating, in farming and sporting interests, a spirit of community effort for the development of local game resources. Grants by my Department are allocated equitably, having regard to the special conditions and problems in the various counties, but it must be clearly understood that these grants are intended merely as an incentive to local initiative and that the major part <Col N="482" /> of the expenditure must be provided by the local organisations themselves.</P>
    <P>My repeated appeals for unity in the game movement at national level, have not so far met with a satisfactory response.  I am determined, however, that the planning of game development on a national basis must not be held up indefinitely by a spirit of faction and mutual suspicion on the part of some interests.  The question of the most appropriate and effective measures to be taken, in the prevailing circumstances, is at present under examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>Having explained the major features of the Estimate at some length, I do not propose to elaborate on the remaining subheads which are largely unchanged from last year or else represent self-explanatory token provisions. I shall continue, therefore, by reviewing the principal activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.  Though some of the statistics are still provisional, no significant variation is expected when final returns become available. The overall results are very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with progress on the tenanted land side first.  During the year, approximately 800 tenanted holdings were revested in tenant purchasers. The scope for activity in this sphere is regularly diminishing as the disposal of the outstanding core of difficult cases continues.  By 31st March last, tenanted holdings pending for vesting aggregated only about 8,000, comprising some 6,000 holdings on estates purchased under the Land Acts 1923 to 1954, and about 2,000 holdings on acutely congested estates of the former Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>The true significance of what has been achieved to date in the sphere of tenanted land purchase is best appreciated when the extent of these residual cases is measured against the original commitments of some 400,000 State-conducted sale transactions.  In the whole 12 counties of Leinster there are now only 200 holdings outstanding for vesting.  The relatively small number of properties for which land purchase proceedings have yet to be concluded <Col N="483" /> is situated mainly in congested counties. These residual holdings, however, in no way represent a survival of landlordism: the tenants thereof enjoy all the benefits of land purchase, the mere act of final vesting being but the ultimate and conclusive symbol of ownership.  They are being disposed of as rapidly as possible, consistent with their need for enlargement, rearrangement and general improvement prior to vesting.</P>
    <P>For untenanted land activities which, of course, nowadays constitute the more spectacular sphere of land settlement, the year ended 31st March last was one of solid achievement.  To function effectively, the acquisition machine must be geared to a high level of inspection to allow for the many cases where the lands involved are finally not considered suitable for land settlement purposes.  It is very gratifying to find, therefore, that for the third successive year, the total area inspected by the Land Commission, as a preliminary to considering the institution of proceedings, exceeded 70,000 acres.  The area for which proceedings actually materialised in the course of the year aggregated 31,000 acres.  At 31st March last, there were some 48,600 acres which were the subject of proceedings in the acquisition machine.</P>
    <P>The fact that activity is continuing at this satisfactory level is due largely to the substantially increased funds, both in cash and in land bonds, made available to the Land Commission by the Government in recent years for the purpose of land acquisition.  I have already dealt with the cash outlay for land purchase last year.  Here I should add that bond issues for land acquisition in the same period were just short of the £1 million mark.  Since the volume of land settlement depends on the amount of land taken over by the Land Commission for distribution, it is imperative, especially having regard to the revised concept of the size of a viable holding, that the tempo of acquisition be maintained and, if possible, accelerated.</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement generally during the year ended 31st March last, <Col N="484" /> the overall outcome can be summarised by recording that the aggregate area distributed amongst some 1,850 allottees exceeded 32,000 acres, in addition to the provision of over 1,000 turbary rights.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are, of course, now working to the new standard whereby holdings and enlargements are planned as far as practicable in all areas so as to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of varied quality.  It goes without saying that all applicants below that level are now eligible for consideration for enlargements.</P>
    <P>To comply with the revision in the size of holding which took place during the year, it was necessary to review and recast resale schemes in respect of a number of estates for which allotment proposals had previously been formulated to the former standard. For a while it seemed that a temporary curtailment in land settlement for the year could scarcely be avoided but, as the impressive results which I have just mentioned clearly demonstrate, the industry and enthusiasm of the staff eliminated such a possibility. Before passing on, therefore, to comment in more detail on some specific aspects of land settlement during the year, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to compliment the officials of the Land Commission, both indoor and outdoor, on this splendid output for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer specifically to the progress made last year under the twin processes of migration and rearrangement.  Taking rearrangement first, the number of holdings dealt with in the course of the year was 467.  This was a very praiseworthy achievement indeed.  In all, since 1950, a total of over 6,200 fragmented holdings has been rearranged, the vast bulk of them being enlarged and otherwise improved, in the process.  Rural Deputies, in particular, will be well aware of the difficulties confronting the Land Commission in the delicately-poised work of rearrangement and they will, no doubt, appreciate the degree of tact and patience required on the part of the Inspectorate in the successful formulation <Col N="485" /> of proposals acceptable to the tenants concerned.</P>
    <P>As rearrangement schemes are carried out on a voluntary basis, the results naturally depend largely on the extent of co-operation afforded by the participating tenants.  It is a matter for regret, however, that in some isolated cases obstructive tactics occur&mdash;mainly through excessive demands by individuals&mdash;thereby placing the prospects of improvement for groups of tenants in jeopardy.  Such a situation, even if relatively rare, obviously cannot be permitted to continue.  I would, therefore, urge all tenants of intermixed holdings to recognise that the proposals put forward by the Land Commission are intended for the betterment of their conditions and I would earnestly appeal to them to refrain from adopting an attitude which, if persisted in, may lead to changes in the existing voluntary nature of the rearrangement programme.</P>
    <P>The migration of landowners from congested areas is inevitably associated with rearrangement of intermixed conditions, inasmuch as the additional land required to enable fragmented holdings to be consolidated and enlarged is frequently obtainable only as a result of the transfer of a number of tenants from the particular townland being dealt with.  During the year ended 31st March last, a total of 102 migrants was installed in fully-equipped new holdings in non-congested areas.  These results reflect a marked improvement as compared with the number of migrations, that is 67, in the previous financial year, even when allowance is made for difficulties resulting from the cement strike which affected building work generally in that year.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, of course, that enlarged holdings must be reasonably compact having regard to modern trends.  Towards this objective, I have authorised the Land Commission to engage in local migrations, that is to say full transfers, even within the one mile stipulated distance, where the resulting overall advantage, in terms of a really superior settlement, may be deemed to counterbalance the extra cost.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are sometimes <Col N="486" /> criticised&mdash;not always with justification&mdash;for holding lands on hands for extensive periods prior to allotment.  In addition, Parliamentary Questions affecting properties in the possession of the Land Commission in specified counties or districts are frequently addressed to me.  It will, I daresay, be conceded that the Land Commission must continue to have in their possession a substantial area of land for use as a working pool for land settlement in each county.  I must deny, however, that it is their practice to retain lands on hands for longer periods than necessary for the sole purpose of deriving profits from them.  On the contrary, there are standing instructions to the effect that acquired lands&mdash;and especially arable lands&mdash; be put into the possession of the approved allottees as quickly as possible. Where delay occurs, there are invariably justifiable and compelling reasons for it.  The allotment of an estate has sometimes to be deferred pending the acquisition of further lands in a particular district in the interests of a comprehensive and better-balanced scheme of resettlement for the locality as a whole.  Here let me quote from the Inter-Departmental Committee which reported on the problems of small western farms: the concluding portion of Paragraph 10 of their Report says:</P>
    <P>The Committee understands that there is a system prevalent in Holland where the State Agency responsible for acquiring land holds it until a sufficient area is available to create an economic holding.  The Committee is aware that the Land Commission act likewise and it is considered that they should intensify this policy in the interests of a comprehensive scheme for a district, in spite of local pressures for earlier division.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies, I can state that at 31st March last, the Land Commission had in their possession, apart from substantial areas of mountain and rough grazing, turbary and other inferior quality land, some 48,000 acres of arable land.  That such an acreage, however, is not unreasonable can be gauged from the fact that <Col N="487" /> the average annual allotment, involving all classes of land, during the past five years was about 41,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, despite the abnormally severe weather in the period January to March, there was a pronounced improvement in Land Commission housing activities during the year ended 31st March last.  In all, 183 new dwellinghouses and 324 new outoffices were provided by or with financial assistance from the Land Commission in the course of the year while a further 12 dwellinghouses were reconstructed.  The corresponding output for the previous year was 139 dwellinghouses, 213 outoffices and 17 reconstructions.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to progress on the preparation of a range of new building plans of modern design for Land Commission operations.  Deputies who attended the recent Spring Show at Ballsbridge will doubtless be aware of the interest aroused by the model of a fully-serviced Land Commission house which was placed on display there.  For the benefit of those Deputies who may not already have seen it, the model is on exhibition near the Library of Leinster House for the duration of this debate.  During the past year a number of dwellinghouses to this plan were built by the Land Commission on migrants' holdings throughout the country.  Deputies will, I feel sure, regard this new design as marking a further step forward in the improvement of Land Commission building standards.</P>
    <P>In addition to giving grants and making advances for dwellinghouses and outoffices on estates in the course of land settlement, the Land Commission make advances to tenant-purchasers to supplement grants for new houses from the Department of Local Government.  Since April, 1961, advances up to £200&mdash;irrespective of the amount of the annuity payable by the applicant&mdash;have been available in these cases.  During the past year, 39 such advances&mdash;the bulk of which represented the maximum amount payable&mdash;were made by the Land Commission.  I feel, however, that having regard to increased building <Col N="488" /> costs generally and in order to assist small farmers in providing themselves with new dwellinghouses, the current level of the advance needs to be reviewed. I am, therefore, having the whole matter fully examined, in consultation with the other Departments concerned, with a view to further increasing the amount of the Land Commission advance and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the position regarding the revesting of tenanted land during the year ended 31st March last.  The vesting of untenanted land allotments was also an important feature of the year's work.  The aggregate number of properties, comprising holdings, parcels and rights of turbary, vested in tenants and allottees in the course of the year was 3,750.</P>
    <P>The position regarding payment of land annuities continues satisfactory. Out of a total collectible amount of over £73¼ million, since 1933, the arrear at 31st March last amounted to £141,288, which represents a 99.8 per cent successful collection.  This record of promptitude in honouring their annuity obligations reflects the utmost credit on the agricultural community and I unhesitatingly avail myself of this opportunity to compliment them on it.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission scheme of resettlements out of the areas of high flood risk in the Shannon Valley is now in the final stages.  As Deputies know, this is not a scheme of flood control; rather is it aimed at affording relief, as far as practicable, from the hazards of flooding by the erection of new buildings on higher sites, the reconstruction of existing buildings in suitable cases and the provision, where necessary, of dry stands for stock in times of abnormal flooding.</P>
    <P>Progress under the scheme up to a recent date may be summarised as follows:&mdash; Work on 49 dwellinghouses and 53 outoffices has been completed and a further 11 dwellinghouses and 10 outoffices are at present under construction.  In all, 32 dry stands for stock have been allotted, necessitating the migration of 6 landowners and their resettlement on new holdings <Col N="489" /> elsewhere.  Efforts are continuing to acquire a further area of land to provide sites for buildings for 5 other participants.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme is being borne by the National Development Fund and, up to a recent date, total expenditure amounted to approximately £113,000.</P>
    <P>My remarks on this Estimate in recent years have included a reference to the purchase of land in this country by non-nationals and also to the measures taken by the Government to ensure that such property transfers would not hamper the land settlement programme.  As Deputies know, particulars of land purchases and leases by non-nationals&mdash;apart from transactions relating to urban properties or non-urban properties with less than 5 acres of land&mdash;have, since 1st August, 1961, been recorded in a register kept by the Land Commission under the procedure authorised by Sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Finance Act, 1961. The position up to a recent date is that since 1st August, 1961, a total of 142 properties&mdash;many of them small units&mdash;aggregating 11,200 acres have been purchased or leased by non-nationals subject to payment of stamp duty at the 25 per cent rate.  In addition, 2,242 acres, involving 179 transactions, were purchased for purposes of industry other than agriculture and 62 other properties totalling 4,566 acres were acquired for other purposes but exempted from stamp duty under the relevant provisions of the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I fail to see in these authoritatively compiled figures any concrete evidence of the big &ldquo;sell-out&rdquo; of Ireland which is alleged in some quarters to be taking place.  It is remarkable that allegations made from time to time in relation to this highly sensitive subject are never supported by statistics, despite the fact that the true position is made known periodically by way of reply to Parliamentary questions and otherwise. Indeed, it is hard to resist the suspicion that there is a tendency to make sweeping generalisations in this matter on the basis of isolated transactions.</P>
    <P>I can state categorically that, insofar <Col N="490" /> as the land settlement programme is concerned, the acquisition of land by non-nationals has not impeded progress to date.  As I have often stated, many of the properties acquired by non-national interests may be described as &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; and would not be at all suitable for land settlement purposes.  It is also worth repeating, perhaps, that the transfer of land to new ownership&mdash;whether native or foreign&mdash;in no way impairs the Land Commission's powers to move for acquisition of the property for relief of congestion if circumstances should warrant such a course.</P>
    <P>The funds provided in this Estimate will be used, in the main, to advance the land settlement programme.  Land settlement is by no means an easy task: the extent to which the human element is involved in the work ensures that.  Perhaps one of its most difficult aspects is the realisation that, with the demand for land far exceeding the supply, it is virtually impossible to formulate a scheme of division for any particular estate which will satisfy everybody; there will invariably be disappointment for some aspirants.  I do not know what the formula for success is but I do know that the formula for failure is to try to please everybody. It is only too true to say that few sectors of the public service give rise to such high feelings as land settlement.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Lands I have received, and no doubt will continue to receive, my share of criticism.  It was, therefore, a very rewarding experience for me to receive only last week a letter expressing appreciation at the fair and equitable manner in which a particular estate&mdash;and one far removed from my own county, at that&mdash;had been distributed by the Land Commission amongst seven allottees.  But more gratifying still was the fact that this gesture of appreciation was accompanied by a genuine sincerity expressed in these words: &ldquo;We feel deeply indebted for sanctioning what is to us a wonderful gift.  In return for this expenditure of public money on our behalf, we promise that we shall farm this land well and produce maximum yields&rdquo;.  This, I suggest, is the farming <Col N="491" /> spirit which is needed so badly to-day: at any rate, it is the standard which every allottee of Land Commission land must set himself, if the heavy outlay on land settlement is to be justified.</P>
    <P>This concludes my opening remarks on the Lands Estimate.  If there are any points on which Deputies require further details I shall endeavour to supply them.</P>
    <P>I have, however, deliberately refrained from commenting at this stage on some aspects of land policy which are at present under examination in my Department.  I feel that the new Land Bill, which I hope to introduce later in the year, will provide the House with a more suitable occasion for a full-scale debate on those items.  I confidently recommend the Estimate and will be glad to hear the views of Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having listened attentively to the Minister, I admit there has been a degree of progress by the Land Commission. However, on several occasions, he refers to the fact that the degree of progress recently made by the Land Commission is due in no small way to the various sections of the Land Act, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very simple matter for the Minister to point out what is being done in relation to land division in recent years in view of the fact that on entering the Land Commission he had the 1950 Land Act under which the Land Commission could proceed and produce the results which the Minister has disclosed to us tonight. During the passage of the 1950 Land Bill the Government of the day were torn to shreds by the present Minister for Lands and by the Fianna Fáil Party in general who could see no good or valuable section in that Bill.  Valuable time of the House was taken up in fault-finding and unnecessary criticism of that Bill by the Fianna Fáil Party. That is regrettable but there is a certain amount of gratification because of the conversion of the Minister for <Col N="492" /> Lands and the Fianna Fáil Party to belief in the 1950 Land Act.  I am glad that when the Minister claims any degree of progress for the Land Commission he has the courage to give credit where credit is due, that is, to the Land Act which was sponsored by the inter-Party Government and which he and his Party spoke against, voted against and undermined in this House and outside it in every possible way.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note the amount of money available for cash transactions on the open market under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  If the Land Act, 1950, had not been passed it would not be possible for the Land Commission to purchase land on the open market.  That is why I say that whatever degree of progress the Minister can boast of is the result of the seeds which were sown by the passing of the Land Act of 1950.</P>
    <P>In view of the speeches the Minister has made throughout the country and the warnings and strong words he has uttered, I am disappointed and depressed that he has not spoken in the same tones in this House.  He has been touring the country organising his own Party, suggesting that there is a revolutionary Land Bill coming before the Dáil and giving details of that Land Bill but all he can tell the House on the occasion of his Estimate is that there is a Land Bill under consideration and that he will introduce it some time this year.  Only three lines of the Minister's speech on the Estimate contained reference to the revolutionary changes being made in relation to land policy.  That falls far short of what should be done by an energetic Minister for Lands, anxious to give the country and this House details of future policy in relation to land settlement. Having regard to the speeches made by the Minister in recent weeks, I had expected that he would avail of the opportunity provided on the occasion of the debate on his Estimate to give the House full particulars of the revolutionary changes he and the Taoiseach have been speaking about for some considerable time past.</P>

      <P>The chief points made by the Taoiseach in his speech were as follows:</P>
      <P>Future Land Commission policy will be to provide family farms.</P>
      <P>Where farms were enlarged to the new standard the State will contribute 50 per cent of the purchase price and costs of improvement.</P>
      <P>Interest free loans will be made available to western landholders who sell their farms to the Land Commission to buy land elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission will be empowered to re-occupy vacant or unworked farms.</P>
      <P>Legislation to purchase holdings from elderly or incapacitated owners is envisaged.</P>
      <P>Loans will be made available to small farmers for the purchase of livestock and equipment.</P>

      <P>New plan for farms: Taoiseach outlines schemes: non-farm employment to be extended: Government action on western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was 15th August, 1962.  From that day to this, we have not heard a word about that, except when the Minister for Lands takes it upon himself to make a speech.  When he does not want to make a speech in relation to the United Nations, he falls back on the speech which was delivered in Thurles by the Taoiseach, from which he picks pieces to suit his audiences. There is nothing in his speech introducing the Estimate which gives us to understand that the new plan which <Col N="494" /> got so much publicity is being put into operation.</P>

      <P>Coming on to 22nd September, 1962, the Minister issued a warning.  &ldquo;Owners must make up their minds,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Derelict and vacant holdings will be acquired.&rdquo;  The Minister was addressing the Agricultural Science Association in University College, Dublin.  He availed of that opportunity to sound a warning to certain people who had land set.  He was probably availing of the opportunity to obtain for himself some publicity and headlines.  Mark you, the Minister picked his venue. He did not make the speech in the west or in the midlands.  When he wanted to issue a warning about land policy and about conacre and the setting of land, he did not go down to the rural areas to sound that warning.  He picked on University College, Dublin. That speech met the same fate as the speech made in Thurles by the Taoiseach on 15th August.</P>
      <P>What is the position now?  In the closing words of the Minister's speech, we find reference to the fact that 11,000 acres of Irish land have been purchased by non-nationals and that some other lands have been purchased by non-nationals also for industrial or building sites.  Now, no one on this side of the House has any objection to any non-national purchasing a site on which to establish a factory or build a residence, but we strongly object to this invasion by foreigners, by Germans and other Europeans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It does not matter whence they come, they are non-nationals and, in my opinion, they should not be allowed to purchase land here.  There is an institution known as the Irish Land Commission which has the responsibility of relieving congestion, enlarging holdings, rearranging holdings, providing our own people with land.  What do we find?  We find a new invasion.  It took a considerable time to rid this country of foreign control.  After 40 years of freedom, we see an Irish Government standing by and allowing the land of Ireland to be sold out to non-nationals, non-nationals who have no responsibility to the country, who care nothing about the country, who come in here to exploit the land, to make what they can out of it, pauperise it, and then sell it and fly the country.  These people are gambling with the soil of this country and they should not be allowed to do so.  I protest strongly against this new invasion by a new type of landlord.  When lands are put on the market for sale, the non-national, with his cheque book, can outbid any Irish smallholder.  Every day extensive tracts of land are being sold.  The Land Commission are not interested or, when they do become interested, the lands are already sold. In many cases, these large tracts purchased by non-nationals would have been of tremendous benefit to our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is bad enough, but we had an even worse spectacle in the past few weeks.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking in Mullingar, almost extended a welcome to non-nationals.  He expressed the hope that these non-nationals would show the Irish farmer how to work.  A most disgraceful pronouncement from an Irish Minister for Agriculture! It is difficult to understand the mentality of a Minister for Agriculture who extends a welcome to non-nationals and expresses the hope that these foreigners coming in here will wake up the Irish smallholder and show him how to work.  I do not hold the Minister for Lands responsible for what the Minister for Agriculture says: God forbid that I should burden the Minister for Lands with responsibility <Col N="496" /> for the utterances of the Minister for Agriculture.  The latter expressed the hope even that more non-nationals would come in here and buy up more Irish land.  That was published in the Press and I am sure there are some Deputies here who heard him make that disgraceful pronouncement in Mullingar.</P>

      <P>It should be the aim of the Minister for Lands to keep the people on the land.  If we continue as we are going at the moment, we will end up with the cities and provincial towns over-populated <Col N="497" /> and the rural areas stripped.  Goodness knows, emigration has taken many thousands of our people away.  Recently there was a report published by the London County Council which stated that in one part of London there are as many Irish as there are in the whole province of Connacht.  Many smallholders have emigrated and sold or set their land because economic conditions compelled them to do so. We should endeavour to keep our people on the land because the community in general must depend on the progress and the unity of the parish unit.  We can see from educational and school returns, from statistics available in every form, that in parts of the country schools are closing down, no children are to be found, fairs and markets are disappearing because of the lack of an agricultural community to support them.  The country churches are becoming empty because of the lack of a rural population.  This is a state of affairs that should be tackled and tackled courageously by Government policy, and the Minister for Lands is allowing valuable and useful time to pass without taking effective action.</P>
      <P>The ownership of land should be extended as widely as possible.  Very little encouragement has been given to young people to work on the land by making them the owners of land.  I have read a speech by the Minister for Lands in which he said he hoped to provide a pension scheme of £3 a week without any means test for the owner of a farm who reaches a certain age and who hands it over entirely to a member of the family to work.  I was expecting the Minister for Lands to tell us something about that £3 pension tonight.</P>

I am glad to say the Land Commission have taken action in regard to the size of an economic holding.  The size of an economic holding can properly be described as between 45 and 55 acres.  By the time the Minister for Lands leaves office, I am sure he will have the greater part of the Fine Gael Party's land policy put into operation.  I believe the Minister had his first idea of the size of an economic holding as a result of pronouncements made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael policy in relation to the Department of Lands which was published at the time of the last general election, in which it is stated very clearly that the policy of the Land Commission would be re-examined by the Fine Gael Party in the light of the needs of the present time.</P>

      <P>It states that the Fine Gael Party, if elected as the Government, would start a scheme to provide farms for young farmers which could be leased for a period of years at an annual rent so that young farmers would be able to use their capital and credit in providing stock and equipment. On the same occasion, the Fine Gael Party declared in their published policy in respect of the Land Commission that foreigners buying agricultural land would be required to be registered <Col N="499" /> and to register their purchases with the Land Commission.  I venture to say that if the Fine Gael Party were in office today, non-nationals would not be allowed to buy land as they are buying it at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we see again that the Land Commission should be given and must be given the task not, as outlined by the Minister, of repairing houses but of providing houses for small farmers, and legislation is not needed for that.  On that occasion also the declared policy of this party was that interest-free loans ranging up to £1,000 would be made available to those on the land to help them to increase production in accordance with the advisory services available for them.  If that policy were put into operation tomorrow morning, I venture to say that after a short while rural Ireland would wake up to its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister is considering the question of making grants available for the repair and the improvement of dwelling houses, as he told us, let us hope he will go the whole hog and implement what we have urged on him, the provision of houses for our small farmers who are not in a position to find money to erect houses for themselves.  Many of them cannot comply with the terms of the small dwellings loans legislation and have not got the money to meet the gap between the cost of the house and whatever loan is made available by the Land Commission and the various grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of those houses should be payable over a number of years, just as in the case of Section B of the Land Project.  There are thousands of small farmers who have not got the money to provide themselves with a better home and that payment should be spread over 35, 40 or 50 years.  Let the next generation help to pay for it. Why should a small farmer have to pay during his lifetime £2,500 or £3,000, if it would stop at £3,000, for <Col N="500" /> a house and out-offices?  His son and his family after him will also benefit by that house and it is only proper that it should be spread over a sufficient number of years.  That is the policy the Fine Gael Party will put into operation after the next general election.  We hope to be able to implement that policy and provide those houses and also to be in a position to give land to farmers' sons on a leased basis, land which Fianna Fáil are allowing the non-nationals&mdash;it does not matter whether they are Germans or Turks&mdash;to purchase.  We want to see that land going to Irish farmers' sons.</P>

      <P>I hope the first stage of implementing our policy will be effected in North-East Dublin to-morrow. The Minister referred briefly to game development and the grants <Col N="502" /> provided by his Department in this connection.  No serious effort is being made to develop game preservation. We have a number of game farms and numerous representations have been made to the Minister to provide financial assistance and facilities for their owners so that these farms can be modernised and better equipped. The Minister knows that orders are flowing into those farms from all over the country and particularly from the Six Counties.  These orders cannot be met and the owners of the farms are working almost blindfolded and handcuffed for want of certain facilities that could and should be provided by the Minister's Department for these people who have undertaken to run these farms for the sake of preserving game.</P>
      <P>The importance of game preservation cannot be over-emphasised and the Department could do much more in this respect.  At the same time, it would be wrong not to express appreciation of the little that is being done by providing greater facilities for regional councils.  Those promoting game councils appreciate the little help they get from the Land Commission and are grateful for it.  But tackling a matter of this kind in a half-hearted way will not produce results.  I expected the Minister to present an extensive picture of game preservation apart from throwing a few halfpence to game councils here and there.  That will not preserve game.  To succeed in game preservation we must help progressive people with game farms, encourage the establishment of more of them by asking people to engage in the business and by giving them financial help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had expected something in the nature of a game board to be established long ago to go into this matter seriously and in detail and advise the Minister on the necessary expenditure. Game can be of great importance to the tourist industry and we know how much we can benefit by making our tourist facilities attractive.  The advice and assistance of Bord Fáilte should be obtained in this regard.  The Department of Lands should have a special section devoted entirely to the preservation <Col N="503" /> of our game and special finances should be voted by the House for that purpose.  We do not seem to realise the urgency and importance of the problem, and the Department are not dealing with it energetically enough.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Shannon Valley.  The question of providing houses and outoffices has been dealt with there, and what has been done has been appreciated, but, like the game problem, this problem also has not been tackled in a courageous enough manner.  The Minister has honestly admitted that what has been done in the way of improved housing will help those who wish to remain on in the Shannon Valley to do so undisturbed. but it will not relieve the flooding. The Department are usually alerted to the problem when serious flooding occurs.  It would not be impossible to relieve the situation there.  If the Land Commission, the Office of Public Works and the Forestry Division put their heads together, I believe something could be done, although I know it would certainly be most expensive. But now that we have provided these people with houses and out-offices, it is only right that we should take steps to prevent their lands being flooded.  This is a problem that must be tackled, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the activities of the Land Commission in my own constituency. I know that a number of holdings have been divided in my constituency recently.  As the Minister correctly said, it is not possible to please everybody. I have known a number of holdings which were divided in a very fair manner in recent times.  I feel I should say that because it is far from what I have expressed on other occasions.  As I say, holdings were divided there in the past 12 months, and if I had any serious criticism to offer, I would have made it in the House.</P>

      <P>I was not an applicant for it, but some of my supporters got it.  I do not want to be <Col N="504" /> looked on as a crank who always wants to find fault with the Government.  If I see they deserve thanks and appreciation, they get thanks and appreciation. The inspectorate of the Land Commission have a very difficult job.  It is sure to be more difficult when you have more applicants than there is land to give out.  No matter what happens, some people will be disappointed in relation to land division. All that can be done is the best possible to relieve the situation.  Many smallholders who have got additional holdings appreciate very much the benefits which will enable them to remain on the land in their own country.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister and the Land Commission to be more generous in compensating employees of estates taken over and to take into consideration the age of these employees who are losing their employment.  The Minister said there was a shortage of money for the purchase of land.  I venture to say that, if he seeks additional money from this House for the purpose of compensating those who lose their employment, it will get the approval of all sides of the House.  The more generously such people are treated, the better.  I know of a number of occasions on which they could have been more generous in their treatment of these people.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to hold conferences more frequently with the Land Commission and endeavour to convey to them the wishes of the House.  It is about time steps were taken to give land in special circumstances to landless men, more particularly to cottage tenants whose cottages are convenient to estates.  There is such a thing as the accommodation plot of four to six acres on which the council cottage tenant may graze a cow or a horse.  I want to put this on record&mdash;I am glad Deputy Corry is here to hear it&mdash;that at one stage it was the cottage tenant who was the backbone of sugar beet production for the sugar factories before their cottage plots became infested with eelworm.</P>

      <P>Now that the sugar company are being more generous with contracts, landless men and cottiers should be given an opportunity in this regard.  I know the Land Commission have a general policy to increase the acreage of smallholders to economic size, but this should be proceeded with at more speed so that married men with large families living in cottages will be in a position to rear their families and to educate them in a proper manner.  The Land Commission should feel bound to help out such people by giving them parcels of from ten to 15 acres.  This would help them to educate their families and it would also help the national production and the economy as a whole.  We have only to think back to the war years to realise that it was the smallholders in rural Ireland who did most for the country's economy then.  It was not the big man who kept the country on its feet.  It was the poor people who worked hardest and we know the small credit they got for it afterwards, as evidenced by the lack of understanding of their problems by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are points the Minister should bear in mind.  Deputies from the southern part of the country who pass through my constituency will have noticed the modern type of Land Commission dwelling house being erected on the Franks Estate near Mountrath. The model house is on display now in the main hall of Leinster House and I should like to hear the comments of Deputies and of the Minister on it.  I greatly admire it.  It is bright, attractive architecturally, and though it may not be furnished in most cases as luxuriously as the model suggests, the cottage should help to brighten the <Col N="506" /> appearance of the countryside when it is erected generally.  I must congratulate all concerned in its design.</P>

I do not propose to take all the credit for the new design for future Land Commission cottages.  I feel sure Deputy Blowick will have something to say on this matter and will enlighten the House about the preliminary work on this cottage done while he was in office.  The next step will be to have these houses erected where required.  I trust an effort will be made to erect them as near as possible to main roads and not to hide them in laneways and behind fields where nobody can see them.  They are attractive and will serve to improve the appearance of the countryside if erected where they can be seen.  They will certainly serve to take away the gloomy appearance of certain areas.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Land Commission to do something to improve the quality of fencing cottage plots.  I suggest that the concrete stakes and strands of wire should be got rid of and fences composed of iron posts erected in their place.  This would encourage tenants to maintain the fences and to improve their appearance with paint.  I understand there is a type of teak fencing stake available now which is quite cheap.  I again urge the Land Commission, through the Minister, to do something in this regard.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30th May, 1963.</P>

      <P>The question of eligibility could be determined only by some test such as the primary school certificate or the entrance examination to a secondary or vocational school. <Col N="386" /> Without applying such a test to every pupil over 14 years of age it would not be possible to answer the Deputies' question.</P>
