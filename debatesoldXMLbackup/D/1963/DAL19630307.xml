    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we reported progress last night, we were recording the fact that 250,300 people have emigrated since this Government took office after the election before the last, and that at the present moment there are something more than 60,000 persons unemployed.  Those figures must be taken in association with each other.  If one were to take below the line expenditure as well as above the line expenditure, Government expenditure would reach the figure of £235 million this year and the national debt would, for the first time, have topped £500 million.  We have a trade deficit for the first time in any year of £100 million.</P>
      <P>I suppose the situation would be far more serious if it were not true that the tide is running with the Government. For instance, when one considers the trade deficit, one must consider the flow of money coming into the country because of the fact that we are selling land to foreigners and because of the fact that those 250,300 people are sending home heavy emigrants' remittances.  We on this side of the House attempted to have a register kept of the amount of land and property sold to foreigners but we did not succeed in getting that done because the Government decided that it would not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, there is money coming in here which has been called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  If there were gross unemployment in Britain, many of our emigrants could be sent home and instead of getting their remittances, we would have a swelling unemployment figure and there would be nothing we could do to stop it.  There is also the fact that there is a large amount of semi-public building going on, particularly in the city of Dublin.  It is perhaps a coincidence and because of the supposed imminence of the Common Market that many projects in Dublin have arisen in or about the same time. I do not think we will ever again see a situation in which we will see Liberty Hall being built by the trade unions, a huge international hotel being built, <Col N="820" /> UCD being transferred to Belfield and the P.J. Carroll building being built, at the same time.</P>
    <P>There is also quite a lot of building outside Dublin, such as at the Shannon Free Airport, and Limerick has its own building spree.  We know that when this comes to an end, the Government have a plan to build a 20-storey building to house civil servants at Beggars Bush. That is the reason why there is no crisis in the country at the moment. The Government's policy has produced what could have been a crisis, only for the fact that all the chances went with them and are continuing to run with them.  However, there is no guarantee that they will continue to run with them and the Government's remedy for the situation is a wages pause and a sales tax.  That can only be defined as an attempt to lower the living standards of the people.</P>
    <P>If we are to have wage restraint and a broadly based sales tax, the same amount of money will go a far less distance.  That is an admission of the Government's failure.  If the policy adumbrated in Clery's Restaurant five years ago of 100,000 new jobs had succeeded even in part, and the Taoiseach admitted yesterday that he was not satisfied with the progress made, we would not have reached the impasse which we have now reached where nothing has saved us from a serious financial crisis except &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money, a lot of public building and emigrants' money.</P>
    <P>Another factor that has helped the Government is the fact that except for the loans they and the State-sponsored bodies are floating, we have had a general reduction in interest rates.  The interest rates of the housing societies have been reduced and they are still getting ample money.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, after the last Act, went on the market with 5½ per cent. Credit Bonds and they are now getting money at 4½ per cent.  These factors are all with the Government and yet they have failed to produce any policy of faith or hope for the future and all they can give us is a reduction in our living standards to be caused by a wage pause and a sales tax.</P>
    <P>The figures show that local authority housing is virtually at a standstill. <Col N="821" /> The Minister for Local Government has criticised local authorities and said that it is their fault, that they are not producing plans for housing and that they are not pushing forward claims for sanction.  That is as it may be, but if the policy which he has laid down is not producing the goods, it devolves on him to change his policy. If a labourer's cottage in my county is to cost 28/- a week and if, by applying for the Small Dwellings Act loan and the usual grant, a man can build the same house for a smaller price, surely there is something wrong with the Minister's policy and housing will remain at a standstill until the Minister stops throwing the blame on local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach yesterday, and I very much regret his outburst, indulged in a criticism of the farmers' organisations and made the suggestion that farmers were seeking too much of the national cake.  He expressed extreme irritation at the fact that there was an agitation for higher prices.  One must define the situation in relation to the price of milk.  There has been an increase of one penny in ten years.  In the case of all other increases given to people who depend on the State for their salaries or for prices for their products, these increases were given in a gentlemanly way, either in the Budget or by way of Supplementary Estimate. A completely new method of doing it was used when the penny was given to the farmers.  A penny was put on to the price of cigarettes in a little Budget at the same time and the farmers were told: &ldquo;Pay your penny for cigarettes and here is the penny for your milk.&rdquo; I know farmers in my area who were not affected at all and they have not smoked a cigarette since.  That is Fianna Fáil's way of saying: &ldquo;Thus far and no further.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach yesterday said other things that I do not like.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of this morning, on Page 11, Column 4, where he said: &ldquo;There was also an agitation for a higher price for creamery milk, presumably by way of an increase of 1/- a lb. in the retail price of butter.&rdquo;  I do not think the people who are looking for an increase <Col N="822" /> in the price of milk are looking for an increase of 6d. a gallon or anything like that.  We must define the increase in the price of butter if we are to consider what a penny a gallon on milk means.  A penny a gallon on a yield of approximately 280,000,000 gallons is slightly less than 2½ a lb on the price of butter and an increase of 2d a gallon would work out at 4½ a lb in the price of butter.  Those are the figures.  If we are talking about a penny, it means 2½d on the price of butter and if we are talking about 2d, it means 4½d on the price of butter.  The Taoiseach was irate at the time he made that statement but such a figure as an increase of one shilling in the lb in the price of butter could not be allowed to go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>Further in the same reference, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;This agitation seemed largely to be a product of the rivalry between certain farmers' organisations&mdash;a product of the struggle for status and power.&rdquo;  I regard that sentence in two ways, first, as an indication to his supporters down the country to have nothing to do with any agitation and, secondly, as an attempt to create a cleavage between different agricultural organisations. One of the few hopes for better organisation of agricultural effort and education as far as agriculture is concerned lies in the farmers' organisations. Any attempt by anybody from the Taoiseach down to create a cleavage in these organisations is to be deplored and I regard that statement of his yesterday as a definite attempt to create a cleavage.</P>
    <P>Of the two organisations involved in this matter, one relates to the creamery areas and the other covers the rest of the country.  If there is going to be a general demand for an increase in the price of milk, it is natural that both organisations should put forward the case for that increase on behalf of those whom it is their duty to represent.  It is not a coincidence. It is clearly because the Budget is imminent and that for ten years all they have got is a penny and they need more.  The present position cannot continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I quote from the same reference and again I specifically want to disagree with the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>Creamery milk production was the most profitable production carried on by the Irish farmer and one in which, by reason of Government action, all element of risk, so far as was humanly possible, had been eliminated.</P>
    <P>I do not think any production which was at a sensible figure ten years ago and has had an increase of, perhaps, five per cent in the gross price of its product since could be described as profitable.  We know that all the costs must have increased by from 25 to 35 per cent.  These increases are so obvious that I do not need to outline them here.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach, who continued to mention the sum that was being voted in this Vote on Account for the dairying industry, had not adverted so much to that and had not again, almost like the penny on cigarettes, thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of the country and said: &ldquo;If these people want the penny, it is £1 million&rdquo; or whatever the figure is; if he had taken a different line and indicated that efforts were being made by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture towards diversification of milk products, if he had indicated that there was a serious effort to get milk out of the low-price product range, butter, and into the high-price product range such as cheese, chocolate crumb and milk powder and that there was a sensible approach to doing that, then we might have seen some sort of understanding on the part of the farmers.  If the effort is to get no understanding, to divide two farmers' organisations, on the one hand, and throw down the gauntlet to the rest of the country on the other, saying, &ldquo;These people want more money and you will have to pay them&rdquo;, there is no hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that if we are to market our products well and get the maximum income for our farmers, at the same time seeking to pay the minimum subvention from Government <Col N="824" /> funds, if we can get the money from real prices, there is only one way of doing it, by diversification.  There is no indication that marketing diversification is getting the attention it should. When the Government came into office in 1957, one of the changes they made in the Vote on Account in that year was to include £250,000 for agricultural marketing.  Since then, Deputy T. Lynch has regularly, every few months, put down Questions to find out just how much of that money has been spent.  I do not suggest that spending money alone is good or that it is necessary to spend money to get results, but it is quite obvious that if there is activity in the investigation of markets and production, it must cost money.  If no money is spent, it is evidence of no activity.  If Deputy Lynch intervenes in this debate, I am certain he will give the replies to the latest Questions he asked on this subject but in broad outline they indicated that all that was spent on the original project was the expenses of the committee which sat for four or five years and then there was a &ldquo;bit of a fiddle&rdquo; in that when administration expenses were needed for An Bord Bainne and for the newly-constituted Pigs and Bacon Commission, the money was transferred from the Fund of 1957 into these two bodies.</P>
    <P>We know they have administration expenses but I am rather loath to accept the definition of a fund for investigation of agricultural marketing and production as the administration expenses of these two excellent bodies. That indicates to me that the Government in five years have done &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about the things that matter and so long as the Taoiseach indicates that his line is to pay off the farmers with the minimum, always telling the rest of the country what it is costing and without any effort at leadership or diversification or any effort to get more for the farmers without going to the Exchequer, then so long will we have a disgruntled agricultural populace who will not give their best.  I believe their best would be a wonderful thing for the country.</P>
    <P>The other matter associated with marketing and diversification is <Col N="825" /> efficiency in processing.  The only thing done about creameries over the past five years has been the completion of the installation of pasteurisation plants.  That will help the bovine TB scheme but there is wide scope for rationalisation.  There are creameries which should amalgamate with other creameries even though that may be distasteful to other people, even to certain groups of farmers.  This is 1963 and we must face facts.  We must get the best possible for the farmers and make the best efforts to see that it does not come, if possible, from the Exchequer.  If rationalisation must come, let it be so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not refer to the question of housing on the farms and nothing has been done about it.  If I may compare this situation with the bovine TB eradication scheme, you had in that scheme something that was sometimes described as three-quarters necessary and one-quarter an international veterinary racket.  Whatever it was, every farmer had to produce his clear-herd certificate and is on the way to doing so.  Whatever it cost had to be done.  I am not sure that if free trade comes in any of the forms we expect, we may not have to adopt a minimum standard of housing for dairy cows on farms.  The Government have done nothing about that and will be caught on the wrong foot.  If I indicated quite recently my worries in that regard, the misrepresentation of some of the less lucid Fianna Fáil backbenchers did not worry me or change my resolve.  If the Taoiseach does not accept the dangers that lie in that situation, the Vote that he parades here now as the reason why he should throw out the farmers without any efforts to lead them to better production will be doubled, trebled or even quadrupled without any advantage to the farmers and at the same time with very considerable effect on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government, whatever they say and whatever the Book says, have failed in their efforts as far as industry and commerce are concerned. They failed because whatever is written in the Estimates, industries have not succeeded in availing of grants and loans to bring them up to the efficiency <Col N="826" /> standard which is so necessary if we are to enter any form of free trade. It may appear on the face of it, if you read the prospectus of the Industrial Credit Company or if you read the hand-outs from An Foras Tionscal in relation to grant loans, that everybody is regarded as equal.  But I have no doubt that the way it is working out is that an industrialist from abroad, with no commitments to any commercial bankers, has a far better chance of availing of the maximum subvention than an old-established industry here employing male labour for generations. We have to face the situation of the old-established industry which may be doing well but has given debentures to commercial banks.  That is the main reason why these industries have not succeeded in availing of grants and loans with the same facility as good industries from abroad.  Until the Government succeed in getting a large proportion of financial assistance to these old-established industries, they will be a failure.  It is not much good if you get nine or ten new industries established at a fantastic cost per worker, when, with the advance of free trade, old-established industries have to let five times as many workers go.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when it is necessary to take stock and wonder whether or not, for the expenditure involved, it is worth while to establish an industry where the capital cost per worker is as much as £20,000, apart from the trading capital.  I know you cannot have a rule of thumb for that. The old figure 15 years ago of £1,000 per worker is out of date.  The average today is perhaps £5,000 per worker. It varies from one industry to another. If we had all the money in the world, we could take all these industries. One of the things that must guide us in the acceptance of industry from abroad is the degree of capital investment we are making by Government grant or loan per worker to be employed.</P>
    <P>While it would be quite wrong for anybody in the Opposition to indicate individual industries that would not seem good value, perhaps, as far as <Col N="827" /> workers employed are concerned, it is wise to bring it up here in a general way.  I do not intend to go any further with that.  Any criticism of that kind of individual industries might affect their prospects in the future.  We have a duty to see that such does not happen, and the Government have a duty to see that their responsibility as to whether the money is well invested or not is carried out to the full.  We in the Opposition can only leave that duty to them.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was sent in here last night to waste time.  The purpose was to make sure there was no great number of contributions from elsewhere that might vie with the Taoiseach for the newspapers this morning.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a very amusing man and I like him.  He is a good friend of mine.  It was quite an interesting performance.  He adopted the line of asking us were we objecting to the money being voted. He took individual figures and asked us were we objecting to them.  Our function here is not to do that.  Our function is to indicate whether or not that money is being spent in the right way.  We do not have to pick up an individual figure and say we object to that.  We reserve the right to say: &ldquo;There is a Vote.  We believe we could get better value for that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary likes to read the debates afterwards, he will find that is largely kind of criticism that has been forthcoming from these benches.  There is not criticism of the money spent in individual instances. That is a good way of losing votes&mdash; and we have to be careful about that. When the Parliamentary Secretary asks us are we objecting to increased social welfare benefits or the increased vote for agriculture or when he tells us money could not be got at the time of the Coalition&mdash;when he says all these things, he is only using political catchcries. We feel we have a right to criticise on the basis of how the money is being spent.  We do not have the information available only to the Cabinet in this time of change.  If we are to <Col N="828" /> behave as a responsible Opposition, we must say to the Government: &ldquo;We have the gravest misgivings, but yours is the responsibility.  Later we will talk about whether or not you have lived up to that responsibility and met it fairly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question of our tourist industry is one that has agitated many minds over the past year.  While I did not intervene in the debate on the Vote passed here recently, on a previous Vote, I made the case to the Minister for Transport and Power that too many grants were being availed of by luxury hotels.  The Minister came back with an exact parallel of the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that small, old-established industries have as good a chance as anybody coming in from Germany or elsewhere. He said the small family hotel had just as good a chance.  I come back with the same sort of statement I make in relation to grants for industry. It has not worked out that way. The Minister for Transport and Power has rather changed the set of his sails in that regard.  He would need to.  I do not think the luxury hotel has a great future here.  I see that in the Inter-Continental Hotel in Dublin bed and breakfast will cost 117/- Perhaps there will be sufficient millionaires floating in and out of Dublin Airport to keep it full.  I do not profess to know the figures for that.  I am certain that the small local hotel, providing good food and accommodation&mdash;a thing rare enough in this country&mdash;has not availed of the grants available to any great extent.  The Government, therefore, have to do what the Minister for Transport and Power said he is doing&mdash;I do not know if he is&mdash;that is, reset their sails in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has always nailed his flag to a high-cost economy.  It is not today or yesterday that he said he had no objection at all to Government expenditure increasing.  It was yesterday that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands said that he was sorry the figure in the Vote on Account was not £200 million and that if it could be afforded, he would be very glad to see it at that figure. That is a philosophy and it is interesting <Col N="829" /> to note what the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, felt about that matter as far back as 6th March, 1961.  I quote from the Dáil Debates, Volume 124, column 1166 where he said:</P>
    <P>If we, as representatives of the public, or the Government, or the Deputies supporting the Government, can persuade people that it is better that they should have less to spend at their own discretion in order to increase the amount of Government spending, then nobody need have any complaint.  Five shillings and fourpence out of every £1 of private income is now being spent by the Government, taken from the public through taxation or rates, and spent on the public services. If we want to increase expenditure on the public services, we have got to persuade people that instead of giving 5/4d. out of every £, they should give 6/- or 6/6d. or 7/-, persuade them that it is better for themselves that they should spend less at their own discretion and let the Government do their spending for them.  But that issue should be put fairly to the public. They should be told, not merely what their choice is, but the consequences of any particular choice.</P>
    <P>  Anyone who wants to read the entire speech from which I have quoted and then would like to read in the newspapers of today what the Taoiseach said yesterday will see the exact parallel.  The Taoiseach's line is that we should have a high-price economy. We on this side of the House believe that while giving all the services that are possible and keeping a mindful eye on the question of good housekeeping, an eye which Fianna Fáil have never kept, and that is their record, we should get out of the lives of the people as much as possible.  Fianna Fáil want a completely organised State, a State in which the people will be persuaded that they should spend less and the Government should spend more for them.</P>

      <P>As I say, the Government believe in a high-price economy and in a large percentage of the national income being used by the Government and we believe that simultaneously with the provision of fair services and then the provision of an impetus for agriculture and industry, where that is needed, we should try to keep out of the lives of the people as much as possible.  That is one of the main differences between the Government and the Fine Gael Party; that is the difference which will see us in power before very long and see the present Government moved over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Donegan speaking about a low cost economy when I recalled the colossal deficits the Coalition Governments left us on each occasion when they were defeated both in 1951 and 1957. It makes very strange hearing.  I have noticed in this debate that the attitude of the Fine Gael Party towards the Book of Estimates and our economic policy in general is one in which quite evidently, either consciously or unconsciously, they are influenced by the ghost of the 1956 crisis.  They are being very careful to avoid making any serious constructive statement as to how we should deal with the national economy at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well to point out, when we hear Deputies from Fine Gael talking about the adverse balance of payments probably being worse than indicated and making all sorts of insinuations for which there are no grounds at all, that there is &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money coming into the country, that an excessive amount of land is being purchased by foreigners and that there are a lot of hidden factors in the present balance of payments position, they themselves by their own policy brought about by far the most terrible <Col N="831" /> adverse balance of payments position in our whole history.  They are very careful in what they say no doubt because the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, speaking at the Cork Chamber of Commerce on 25th January, 1956 and reported in the <i>Irish Times,</i> pointed out that the disquieting feature of 1955 was failure of incomes to increase in real terms and the failure of productivity to increase. He pointed out that there had been a fall in savings and that the consequent increase in the external deficit would be £35 million.  Now that is the actual deficit, after allowing for all the invisible credit items.  He went on to say that the fifth round of wages, amounting to some £20 million of money put into circulation, had the direct effect of increasing imports without a corresponding increase in exports. He warned the country at that time that they should increase output so as to enable a real increase in workers' living standards to be achieved, without a corresponding rise in prices.</P>
    <P>The crisis that took place at that time was due to the existence of two Coalition Governments operating confused policies, and due to the fact that from 1948 to 1954 the Coalition Government preached the idea of getting rid of our external reserve as quickly as possible, of repatriating them, and even as late as 1954, Deputy Costello was saying that they would have again to promote the idea of reducing the external reserves of the banks, that they should be used immediately for every kind of purpose.  During the whole six years when we were in opposition, we were accused of being anti-Irish and of not listening to the true national interest when we warned the Coalition Governments of what would be the effect if as a result of their economic policy there finally were not sufficient reserves available to meet the balance of payments position that might arise at one time or another.</P>
    <P>What is even worse is that since that time members of the Coalition Government have tried to pretend that the reason for the crisis lay in some <Col N="832" /> peculiar economic position in Great Britain arising out of the Suez situation. The facts do not prove that and the gross national income of the British people rose steadily from 1954 to 1958.  The only reason for the crises lay in the fact that the Coalition Government, divided as they were in counsels, did not have a real economic plan to put into operation to ensure the growth of productivity.  They had not faced the realities of our position in the easy period after the war when things were coming back to normal and when there was a demand for goods everywhere.  They did not make proper provision for a real growth in the national economy.  They lived on the spurious reputation they achieved because, at the end of the war when they got into office, there was naturally a bound in production and a bound in sales as a result of scarcities ending; and, having failed in their endeavour, they then tried to make Suez an excuse for the appalling condition in which they left this country.</P>
    <P>We do not want to hear anything from Fine Gael about our gambling with the nation's economy and we notice in their very statements now that quite obviously the ghost of 1956 still hangs over them.  At the present time we are in a better position to face this balance of payment position because there has been a great expansion in production and because we are taking time by the forelock and have been watching the economy, as we invariably do, with the greatest of care during the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to this matter of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  I have ascertained the facts as far as I can; I gather there is no evidence of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money pouring into this country. There is evidence of foreign investment in industry, evidence of some property development in this country by insurance companies, but there is no evidence of a great volume of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money pouring into this country, which could make the position temporarily easy for us.  The desire of the Government is so to arrange consumption and so to arrange the economy that we can proceed to continue the expansion of the economy <Col N="833" /> without any harm being done to the nation.</P>
    <P>I think it necessary at this point to point out some of the progress we have made.  Naturally, the Fine Gael Party do not like to admit the progress that has been made in the past four years.  We notice that the Labour Party are beginning to show a more constructive attitude.  They ask us to do more and more; they ask us to make a greater and greater effort.  It has been interesting to note, in connection with the debate on the Vote on Account, Deputy Corish's extremely constructive speech, together with the speeches of the Labour Party on the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>; they have recognised that there has been an improvement in the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to record to-day that in the past four years the national output of the whole country went up by 20 per cent., a unique increase in the history of the country in peacetime. The living standards of our people increased by one-sixth, after making all allowance for increases in the cost of living.  The fixed investment of capital increased by two-fifths in the past four years, again a unique increase.  Our external assets, which we can use to cushion us against temporary balance of payments difficulties, have increased by one-fifth, although it should be mentioned in that connection that there has been, we believe, some revaluation of those assets by the banks; nevertheless, external assets have increased during that period of development.</P>
    <P>During the period 1961-62, the gross national product increased very largely and the fixed capital invested in the country increased by 14 per cent in one year, again a record figure.  We are making some real progress.  Let us take the level of exports.  Reference has been made to the fact that there was a slight reduction, a regrettable reduction, in exports in 1962 as compared with 1961, but the level of exports from 1956 to 1962 increased by no less than 60 per cent.  Employment in industry increased by 20,000 persons.  We have yet another achievement; for two years running, as many people were newly employed in the <Col N="834" /> non-agricultural sector as left the land.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied with the progress we have made.  We should like to have seen greater progress.  We hope greater progress will come in the future.  All we can say is that, having overcome the appalling crisis period of 1955-56, we were disappointed by the length of time it took to ensure recovery. But we can say at least that we have made progress along certain lines, progress that had not been made at any period since the war and since the time when we were living in competitive conditions.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now about progress in agriculture.  We are well aware of the fact that the income of the farmer has not increased since 1953 in proportion to that of the non-agricultural sector.  I want to make it absolutely clear, so that farmers will not be deluded by propaganda here, that that has largely been the case throughout Europe.  Every country has been complaining about the lack of progress.  One of the principal reasons for the formation of the agricultural policy of the EEC has been the necessity for doing something to ensure that farmers' incomes show a parallel rate of progress with those of the industrial sector.  It is well to recall some of these facts.</P>
    <P>There is the fact that, according to the Danish Government, the level of prices for livestock and livestock products in Denmark, taking last year, showed no increase since 1951.  There is the fact that up to 100,000 people have been leaving the land in certain years in the most advanced agricultural country in the world.  There is the fact that one-third of the entire rural German population has left the land since the war.  There is the fact that in France the rate of migration from the land has been colossal.  I do not want to bore the House by quoting too many figures, but I examined the growth in agricultural income of the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and France and in no case did they show any features different from our own. The non-agricultural income was expanding at a far greater rate.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there has been nevertheless some progress since 1956 <Col N="835" /> in agricultural income growth.  We record the fact that in 1956 the total profits of the farmer were some £97 million; they had risen by 1962 to £117 million, showing some progress definitely, even though it is not in line with the progress in the non-agricultural sector.  If one makes allowance for the migration that has taken place from the land here, as in other countries, the growth in income per head from 1956 to 1961 has been in the order of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we hear this talk by the Fine Gael Party that we do nothing for agriculture, it is as well that we should give a few facts of some of the basic changes that have taken place.  The livestock population of this country is a very important element.  A tremendous campaign has been in progress for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis which has naturally had an effect on the livestock population because of the elimination of reactors. Let us look at the comparative growth in the cattle population during the period of the Coalition Government and since.  There are some changes that take place as between one year and another of a purely temporary character and I shall not, therefore, be unfair and choose years that are of a special character; but, between 1954 and 1957, the total cattle population of the country actually went down by 81,000.</P>
    <P>In order to be fair, and not to take two years in which there might have been this temporary reduction, as there has been recently, one can take the 1954-56 period in which the total cattle population went up by 32,000. From 1956 to 1962, the cattle population has gone up by 220,000 showing that progress is being made on the farms of this country in rehabilitating the cattle industry and establishing a greater cattle population, despite all the difficulties of wind and weather, and despite the bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign.  If Deputies like to take 60,000 or 80,000 off that increase because of the allowance between different years, I do not mind but genuine progress in livestock density increase has been secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> When we take the contribution of the Government to aid the farmer, there again we can show the Fianna Fáil Government have maintained a tremendous investment in agricultural aid throughout the period and I should like to have this figure rammed home to all those in Fine Gael who claim that agriculture is the preserve of Fine Gael.  The total expenditure on all agricultural services is about three times this year what it was in 1957-58 and about twice what it was in 1959-60.  That includes the contribution to the agricultural rate, fertiliser subsidies, increased afforestation planting, increased aid of every kind, together with massive subsidies.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have done what the Coalition Government failed to do during two periods of office.  We have set up two marketing boards, one for dairy produce and one for pigs and bacon, and have given them the powers by which they can markedly improve the whole of the marketing arrangements for the sale of our very valuable livestock and livestock products.  When I hear Deputy Donegan saying we have done absolutely nothing about assisting the marketing of our produce, I would like to throw it back in his teeth.  His Government were in office for two periods, three years in each, and they never thought once of dealing with marketing in the only way it can be done, by establishing boards with advisers and experts who can examine all the problems of how to dispose of our dairy produce and our pigs and bacon in an intelligent way.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Government have made grants of £167,000 available to bacon curers to enable them to improve their premises and to reduce the cost of processing bacon.  That fact seems to be entirely lost or forgotten but we have actually given that sum and now under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, there has been a survey of milk processing which will be published.  I wonder why the Coalition Government, who were supposed to be so devoted to the interests of farmers, did not undertake that survey when they first came into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to admit that we have been rather late about establishing marketing boards and we probably have been rather late about making a survey on milk processing but the fact is that this Government have done it.  They have established the two boards.  The Dairy Produce Board has already achieved a limited success in selling Kerry Gold butter at a far higher price than it could be sold previously.  I know myself from being in private business during periods when I was not a Minister that selling any product is a difficult matter and to develop a new sales organisation is something that simply cannot be done overnight, particularly in view of the conditions under which we sell our bacon, pigs and surplus butter in Great Britain. It is a matter of extreme complexity and of course we are fundamentally affected still by the British policy in regard to the prices paid for these products.  That is why we are at the moment so disappointed that we have been unable to join the Common Market where we hoped for a rationalisation in regard to production, marketing and price as a result of what we could see taking place within the Common Market and as a result of the various agricultural arrangements being made at the time we were applying for membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to hear from the Opposition whether they recommend a reduction of the £8½ million mentioned in the agricultural aid vote. It is all very well for Deputy Donegan to say that their sole duty is to say how the money should be spent.  Let them go through the total Agricultural Estimate with this increase of £8½ million and make proposals for a re-division of the expenditure or for a reduction of the expenditure.  We would like to hear some solid proposals but we take it that no member of the Opposition will plead for a reduction in the Agriculture Vote by the £8½ million increase which is shown in the Book of Estimates and we take it in that connection that nobody will suggest <Col N="838" /> that of that sum of £8½ million the figure of £3½ million, being the contribution to agricultural rates, increases in fertiliser subsidy, farm building grants, assistance for arterial drainage and improvement schemes, should be reduced in any way.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Coalition Government always take credit for the farm buildings scheme.  We notice that in their propaganda, but I made inquiries because I wanted to make certain I was right.  An announcement that there would be grants for farm buildings was made by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture on the 31st December, 1947, and I think the announcement was that these grants would come into operation in April, 1948.  Therefore, the Coalition Government cannot take credit for the farm buildings scheme in view of the announcement of the Minister for Agriculture. In fact, the scheme did not come into operation until 1949-50 because of a shortage of materials.</P>
    <P>In relation again to this debate, on the agricultural side, Deputy Dillon made an interesting speech in which he announced some features of agricultural policy which would be inaugurated if the Fine Gael Party should ever gain office.  One of the things I noticed was that he did not question as a whole our agricultural programme and the only proposals he made were of a marginal type, certain changes.  What were they?  He suggested we should have more advisers under the small farms scheme.  The Government propose to make more of them available, particularly in small farmer areas.  In all the periods of Fianna Fáil office, the number of advisers has constantly increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also suggested that interest-free loans up to £1,000 should be made available to farmers.  It is arguable that that should be done but since 1957, the sum made available to farmers from the banks has grown by something like £20 million.  I have been interested to meet bank officials, all of whom have told me that the amount of bad debts in relation to that credit, in spite of some frightful periods of weather and crop disasters, has been very small.  I note also that <Col N="839" /> the Agricultural Credit Corporation, with, I think, too little publicity, have announced they are prepared to lend £200 without any security to creditworthy farmers and another £200 with one personal guarantee.  That is a new form of credit which is apparently kept under the bush; at least, I hope there will be more publicity about it.</P>
    <P>We can hardly take Deputy Dillon's proposal for interest-free loans of £1,000 as a fundamental change in agricultural policy, any more than we can take this proposal for an increased number of advisers as a fundamental change in policy.  That is all I could see in Deputy Dillon's speech.  The rest was a reiteration of our policy, with the suggestion that it should be pushed perhaps more enthusiastically. However, no fundamental changes in policy were suggested.  We still look to Fine Gael for proposals for a fundamental change in agricultural policy: I cannot find them.</P>
    <P>We should always like to assist the farmers more.  The Taoiseach made clear the difficulties in so doing, over and beyond the increase of £8½ million in the present Book of Estimates.  I think that at this time one should try to illustrate the extent to which we are helping the farmers, even though we admit that the aid we have given has not succeeded in enabling us to overcome the problem, which has affected the whole of Europe, that their incomes are not expanding as fast as those in the non-agricultural sector. We should nevertheless illustrate in a simple way what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I totted up the agricultural aid in the present Estimates and made it a total of £36 million.  That is roughly £100 per holding of agricultural land or, if you like to put it another way, it is roughly £3 per arable acre given in a year.  I do not think that that is a niggardly sum, though I quite recognise that farmers do not see it in cash in the shape of £100 for their holding, on an average.  It flows towards them in numerous ways.  It flows towards them in subsidies which they never see in cash: they only get the price for the pig or the price for exported butter. <Col N="840" /> It flows to them through grants and through capital schemes of various kinds.  It flows to them as a contribution. I do not think, in a country with our national income, that total agricultural aid, measured at £100 per holding&mdash;it is quite a simple calculation: £36 million and there are 360,000 holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am not including increases in remuneration; I am giving the amount the Government are spending on agricultural aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it quite clear that the farmer does not get it himself in cash in his hand.  Nevertheless, if we want to make comparison, the British are able to give far higher subsidies because of the great volume of their industries.  The British subsidies represent a tax, if you like, or a percentage, of between one and one and a quarter on the total gross national production in Britain.  Therefore, it shows that we are trying to make as big an effort as we can in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let me give some illustrations of some other increases that have taken place in Government aid to ensure increases in national production.  The Forestry Vote this year is double what it was in 1957-58.  Take education. The Vote for vocational education is <Col N="841" /> double what it was in 1957-58.  I might add that during the Coalition Government period the total Vote for vocational education went up only about ten per cent: we have doubled it since then.  The Vote for primary education is 40 per cent above what it was in 1957-58.  During the three years of Coalition Government, between 1954 and 1957, the Vote went up by a mere ten per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution of the Government to social insurance has doubled since 1957-58.  I thought it would be wise to give these figures to illustrate that we have been trying to do what we can to promote the economic development of this country. Deputy Donegan spoke about Fine Gael believing in a low cost economy. The Taoiseach also mentioned last night that the total central and local taxation of this country, expressed as a percentage of the gross national production, amounts to about one-quarter. Unfortunately for the Fine Gael Party, they will be very much out of line with other modern countries if they continue with this propaganda that they intend to have a low cost economy.  In the most progressive nations in the world&mdash;whether those run on semi-Socialist lines or those run largely on free enterprise lines or those where free enterprise and Socialist enterprise mingle together&mdash;the rate of taxation, local and national, is fairly high.  It is a strange fact, if you like, that in the whole of the Northern European countries the percentage of total income taken by the Government or by local authorities is very much the same: it varies something between 23 to 32 per cent and there are a number of countries with figures of 26, 27 or 28 per cent.  Therefore, it seems that countries that are prosperous have not gone in for this low cost economy referred to by Deputy Donegan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Fine Gael Party really believe in a low cost economy, let them start making proposals for striking large sums off the Book of Estimates.  Let us have them.  Let us get down to the low cost existence suggested by Deputy <Col N="842" /> Donegan.  I myself believe it is absolutely essential in this country, as in every modern country, for the Government to draw money from the taxpayers, and redistribute it for social services and for other purposes to ensure a growth in the national economy. I believe that that operation is absolutely essential for the improvement of the economy.  I think it would be wonderful if we could start some kind of new guild in this country to which all the best Deputies would belong. Then every time anybody asked us for a grant for any purpose we all, together, would say: &ldquo;I shall see whether the people can be taxed so that you may have this grant.&rdquo;  It would be a very good thing for the psychology of this country.  We are no more perfect than the Opposition in this regard. I do not pretend to be perfect myself.</P>

      <P>I listen to Deputies. We have all been doing it since the foundation of this State.  It would be wonderful if we could be the first country in the world whose Deputies would form a guild amongst themselves and would always use the phrase: &ldquo;Yes, I shall see whether the people can be taxed in order to provide you with that grant&rdquo;&mdash;which may be for a very worthy cause.</P>
      <P>Nobody can accuse the Taoiseach of being dishonest in his attitude to the Book of Estimates.  He made perfectly clear what was being provided by the people by way of central and local taxation and that we could not depart very largely from that percentage.  I recognise, in dealing with the present Budget, that we have to take care of that position.  In any event, I thought it was just as well to clarify the position so that everyone would know where we stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some startling increases in Government expenditure for various purposes, all of which have been designed to stimulate the economy. I should like to mention the fact that in the past four years the promotional grants for Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Development Authority, the Shannon Free Airport <Col N="843" /> Development Company, and technical assistance, have increased by as much as 125 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <P>This money does not yield a direct dividend.  There is no visible return in the form of actual cash, but I think it is quite evident from the growth of the economy that the work of those organisations has been effective.  Again, I should like to see some of them getting even more grants, but there are always limitations.</P>
      <P>Grants for technical assistance have been increased and I am quite sure we would not refuse further grants.  I should like to see more firms employing industrial consultants in order to increase their productivity.  Nevertheless, there has been a very big increase in that expenditure and, as I have said, the total has gone up markedly.  There has also been increased expenditure on airports, on forestry services and on telephone services, all of which make a contribution to the burden of the Budget, and all of which will be remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the best proof of our progress is not really so much in hard figures as in the feeling of confidence which is quite evident in the country. There are more people working for the national interest in voluntary associations and committees of every kind than ever before since the actual struggle for independence.  Obviously, there has been an immense growth of <Col N="844" /> activity in increasing productivity. There are seminars dealing with productivity of every kind.  For the first time, we have real action by the national productivity committees.  We have speeches by trade union leaders on those committees.  We have a growth in the country of associations of every kind interested in the improvement of rural life.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in the country that real prosperity can be achieved. There is a real feeling of confidence in our land of a kind that there has not been since the war.  I do not think anyone can deny that.  I meet many people who have been away from the country for many years and when they come back, one of the first things they see is the fact that there is obviously a far better spirit in the country.  I am not saying we cannot make even greater progress in that connection, but one can see advances on every side.</P>
    <P>When one reads in the newspapers that there is some controversy emerging as to the question of whether goods going from Ireland to the West Indies should be carried on special vessels going direct from Dublin to the West Indies, or whether advantage should be taken of some special rate on the basis of sending goods on a vessel to Liverpool and on to the West Indies, that is evidence of progress.  We can also see evidence of the exports, sometimes of an experimental character, sometimes of a continuing character and sometimes new exports, which we are sending all over the world and that is a sign of progress.  When we see, for example, that in a recent period, exports from this country to the Common Market countries&mdash;exports which have to face tariffs of anything from four to 40 per cent.&mdash;have increased by 40 per cent. in one year, again we have evidence of enterprise.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made that the Government were rudderless and had no policy.  When I think of the bad old days in 1955-56, that suggestion from Fine Gael makes me laugh.  If we take the survey of industry undertaken through the Department of Industry and Commerce, and if we take the surveys undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and then examine all the positive aids and grants, I think it is true to say that in no other country in Europe has there been a more consistent campaign for the growth of productivity and the stimulation of exports than there has been in this country.  In the course of the past year and a half, a blueprint for the future of every industry has been in course of preparation with advice given, and opportunities paid for by Government administered grants for the members of the industry to come together and consider their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said last night, the policy of the Government has not altered in the face of the present situation in regard to the Common Market.  Our policy remains the same for industry.  We are preparing to enter a free trading world.  Grants for re-equipment, loan facilities, taxation concessions and all the administrative, <Col N="846" /> executive and technical help that can be provided go on just as if we were entering the Common Market.  There is nothing rudderless about that.  There is no shadow of change in Government policy in regard to the development of industry.  The policy remains the same.  We are arming to enter a free trading world and making preparations to increase productivity largely, to increase production and have better markets for our products abroad.</P>
    <P>The same thing holds true for agriculture.  While it is true that if we entered the Common Market, our policy in relation to the marketing and processing of certain products might have to be attuned to that situation, nevertheless, if we do not enter the Common Market, we want to develop low costs of production, improve the breeding of our livestock and improve our marketing arrangements so that, no matter what our external conditions are, we will be able to produce, at the lowest possible cost, goods of the highest quality and market them in the best manner.  There has been no change in that policy.</P>
    <P>While it may be very difficult in connection with agriculture to examine the particular way in which, for example, our beef policy might be different if we were in the Common Market from what it would be if we do not join, the basic policy remains the same: to assist the farmer in every way possible to lower his cost of production, to increase his yields, and to take advantage of whatever markets are available.  I wish to deny completely that we are in a rudderless state and have no policy.  In some cases, we are able to plan ahead for a considerable period.  In the case of Bord Fáilte, Bord na Móna and the ESB, we are able to plan ahead for periods of from five to eight years.  In the case of our air policy, we are able to plan ahead.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Sullivan does not like listening to me when I say that I would like to have had longer than an hour and a half to reply to all the reasonable questions put to me, he is not being reasonable.  I was dealing with the various increases in the Book of Estimates and I find that if you subtract the increases for agriculture, tourism, education, social services, pensions, transport and the amount to repay the capital issues for the growth of the telephone service, the total amount left is £2.7 millions. Unless some Deputy comes forward and suggests a reduction of all those increases, we are only arguing about £2.7 millions.  That is what it amounts to and I do not think that £2.7 millions is going to make or break the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to hear from Deputies on the opposite side if they have any observations to make on the £2.7 millions. If they have, we will take account of their advice.  That amount represents the miscellaneous services and we can have an honest debate on that subject but I guarantee we will not hear from Deputies opposite anything in the nature of a suggestion for <Col N="848" /> substantial changes in policy.  I see no Harold Wilsons or George Brownes on the Opposition Benches and we do not hear any complaint from them in relation to a new policy.  We do not hear any proposals for radical changes in policy.  We have been in office since 1957 and I have not heard of any radical suggestions for changes in policy from the major Parties opposite. That must indicate that even if we make mistakes, and every Government can make mistakes, we are generally going along the right road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I come to the allegation that the Taoiseach has been blowing hot and cold and that we are all blowing hot and cold, that having spoken about the progress we have made, we are now unduly alarming the people in regard to the slight inflationary trend we have seen and in regard to the problem of the adverse balance of payments.  It so happens that this is a situation that occurs in a great many countries besides ours.  You can see it happening in many other countries in Northern Europe since the war.  The countries that have made progress, with productivity increasing and exports rising, as ours have been, have suddenly come to the point where the public become a little bit too enthusiastic and try to take more out of the economy than is justified at a particular point.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are warnings in the Netherlands, in Sweden and in France.  It is quite normal that there comes a point when quite suddenly consumption grows too rapidly, when savings do not accumulate sufficiently and when the increases in the people's incomes go beyond the increase in productivity in a particular year.  There is nothing sensational about the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  The thing about it we notice is that the countries that have made the greatest progress are those who are able to take warning when expenditure outgrows the increase in productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can look at the whole history of a series of countries in Northern <Col N="849" /> Europe a number of which have, unfortunately, made greater progress than we have since the War.  They all come together in one way or another, either through their trade unions and employers, or through joint councils to take stock when that situation arises in order to counteract a balance of payments difficulty or a reduction in exports due to the price of their goods making them non-competitive.  I want to make it clear that that is not a peculiar happening.</P>
    <P>The cost of living in Northern Europe has gone up very much the same as it has here.  There has been very little difference in the increase in the cost of living in these countries as compared with the increase in the cost of living here but it is natural that those who guide the national economy should watch these matters just the same as everybody else does because our productivity is too low.  If the value of money declines at the same rate and to the same level in any particular group of countries or in any particular trading group, that does not make the competitive position of any one country in that group less favourable than that of another.</P>
    <P>What we have to make sure is that we do not allow any decline in the value of money to reach a point where relatively our exports become less competitive in the markets in which we sell them.  The problem here is that because of the small size of our industry and because of its comparative newness, we have to increase our productivity very much more if we are to export more.  We have to take special care.  When Deputies talk about a wages pause, they are not explaining the matter properly to the people. It is a process that we now know to be accepted by socialist countries and capitalist countries alike.  Increases in expenditure and in personal incomes should go roughly in company with the growth of productivity in any one country.  You may take it that the Social Democratic Party in Sweden and the Liberal Party who compose the Government and the Opposition may disagree over methods of dealing with the economic situation but they do not disagree between themselves on <Col N="850" /> that general proposition.  Nor do the Socialist, Catholic and Liberal Parties of the Netherlands disagree on this general proposition.  All we ask is that people start thinking wisely on that subject here.</P>
    <P>The Government are not trying to hinder the growth of income in the country but are making the simple proposition that if you put a pint of ale into a half-pint pot, half the pint will be wasted.  It is as simple as that, it is lucky for us there is no controversy about it.  It is not a question of putting forward some old, out-of-date, conservative Victorian formula for consideration by the people.  We have the advanced left-wing parties in Europe agreeing with the right-wing conservative parties on the simple proposition that if you put a pint into a halfpint pot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not going to worry me.  This is accepted everywhere and even in Sweden where <Col N="853" /> they have millions of tons of iron ore and enormous forestry resources an increase in wages is recognised as producing an import element.  It is good if exports go up to meet increases of imports. What we want to ensure is the kind of economy where we can have continuous increases in remuneration and where we know the result will be accompanied by an expansion of exports so that the whole country can grow in prosperity without overbuying from abroad.</P>
      <P>The problem the Government are facing is one that is met by every modern country.  There are periods when any country may start to overbuy from abroad and all we want to do is to handle that situation carefully and intelligently and to make sure that our remuneration can grow in such a way that it will not have an adverse effect on our productivity or our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know from travelling about the country and meeting people, the people understand a great deal better than some members of the Opposition think they do.  I have been very surprised to find a much greater appreciation of this whole business than I thought was possible.  The people are beginning to understand these economic problems. They understand that there can be no isolated industry or trade in the country.  A vast number of separate enterprises, from the smallest farmer to the largest factory together produce a national profit for the year.  The community should then decide how that profit should be spent, how much should be engaged in saving for further development and how much can be spent in increasing consumption expenditure, in having a better life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is beginning to be understood by our people as it is now understood in the Northern countries of Europe where it is a matter of basic information acquired and understood by everybody.  We are not living in an isolated community and people in particular industries cannot consider themselves as cut off and isolated from <Col N="854" /> those in other industries.  The effect of what goes on in any one industry is felt by the whole community.</P>
    <P>I have shown that we are not rudderless, that we have a tremendous campaign for industrial and agricultural expansion.  That is continuing and we have not been ruffled by our failure to join the Common Market and our plans for greater production continue.  We have made some progress in the past four years and we hope to go on making progress.  We shall try to deal with this Budgetary position as well as we can, bearing in mind the fact that all but £2.7 million of the increase between this year and last year would seem to concern expenditure of a very vital kind.  We believe that if we do have to increase taxation, the people of this country will be willing to pay for those increases in expenditure which are designed to improve the economy as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why people have the impression that the Government do not know where they are going is that Government speeches alternate between arrogant complacency and panic.  Ministers lecture all and sundry about what should be done and fail to take effective action themselves.  One of the latest lectures was the homily on how to cook.  It seems to me we have reached the lowest possible level in dictation and lecturing when Ministers appear to think they are carrying out an effective policy by giving advice to all and sundry but refusing to implement in practice what they preach to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Book of Estimates presented for the coming financial year indicates a very heavy growth in expenditure. If we compare the growth in public expenditure as between the years 1959-60 and the present financial year of 1963-64, we find that the Supply Estimates voted expenditure has increased from £102.3 million to £140.6 million, an increase of £38.3 million.  If we add to that the increase in the Central Fund and Road Fund, we find the total increased expenditure for 1959-60, including the Supply Estimates and the Central Fund and the Road Fund, <Col N="855" /> was £129.1 million.  It has increased in the present financial year to £180.5 million, an increase of £51.4 million.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine in relation to that increase what has happened to a number of the Government plans and proposals.  One of the announcements made here in 1957 after the present Government took office was a plan to modernise and streamline the Civil Service.  It was hoped that that plan, which would involve new methods and techniques, would result in a reduction in the number of civil servants employed. We find this year that there has been, in fact, an increase in the numbers. Therefore, while we have growing Government expenditure, we also have an increase in the number of persons in the Civil Service.  I believe it would be better to remunerate properly and quickly all sections of the Civil Service rather than increase the numbers and have unnecessary delays in dealing with some of the claims.</P>
    <P>If we compare the figures for the population during the period, we find that in 1946 there were 2,955,000 persons here.  For the first time since the Famine, the population increased in 1951 to 2,960,000.  In 1961, it had dropped to 2,814,000.  Therefore, we find that, although this plan was claimed to reduce the cost of Government, in fact the cost has increased substantially, although it is responsible for catering for a lower population.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get precise figures about the numbers emigrating.  For that reason, I want to urge on the Government to publish the actual figures.  We secured last year some figures which were given in respect of the Overseas Emigration Board's Seventh Report&mdash;a publication published by the British Government, Command Paper 1586.  It showed that the number of persons from the Irish Republic entering national insurance in Britain in 1959, 1960 and 1961 were as follows: 1959, 58,316; 1960, 72,962; and 1961, 67,598.  These figures indicate the very considerable drain that has taken place on our population through emigration.  This is in contrast with the plan announced <Col N="856" /> by the Taoiseach in opposition to provide 100,000 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>While these facts indicate what has happened, we find a very substantial rise in the cost of administration.  I do not think anyone would suggest that these Estimates under certain headings or the proposed expenditure should or could be reduced.  No one questions the wisdom of public expenditure on productive capital projects or indeed desirable capital projects. But I have here some figures which indicate, as far as one particular aspect of public expenditure is concerned, what has happened.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to the number of houses built with State aid under the capital programme, as set out in the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> show that in 1954, there were 11,179; 1955, 10,490; 1956, 9,837; 1957, 10,696; 1958, 7,480; 1959, 4,894; 1960, 5,992; and 1961, 5,978. During the same period, the amount of money granted from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin Corporation had dropped from £4,622,195 in 1955 to £1,847,956 in 1959.  There was a drop in respect of Cork and the total for the rest of the country shows that in the year 1956-57 the sum provided was £10,998,000 and in 1958-59 it was £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that has been the subject of comment is the fact that fewer houses are being built and that at present the accent seems to be on luxury hotels and large buildings.  In fact, however, the vast majority of the tourists who visit this country &mdash; particularly our own people who return for a holiday&mdash;patronise the smaller hotels and guest houses.  Figures which have been taken out indicate that at least 80 per cent. of the visitors to this country patronise the middle-class and smaller hotels.  I believe there is a very strong case in favour of encouraging the facilities in these hotels rather than placing the accent the other way.</P>
    <P>At present there is an acute scarcity of corporation dwellings, particularly in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  The need there for more houses and a greater rate of building by local authorities is obvious.  The figures I have published indicate a very serious <Col N="857" /> decline in State investment in local authority housing and a consequent decline in the number of houses being provided.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters that has been the subject of discussion here, and one of the matters that was commented upon this morning, is the question of our foreign trade.  I want to relate my remarks on this to the trade which took place last year between the EEC countries and ourselves and the trade between this country and the EFTA countries.  A few moments ago, the Minister for Transport and Power appeared to be satisfied and complacent about exports to the EEC countries.  In a reply given last week to a question, the Taoiseach, at column 599 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 200, No. 4, gave the figures which show that total imports from the Common Market countries amounted to £42,289,045 and our total exports to these countries amounted to only £10,740,725.  If, on the other hand, we compare our trade with the EFTA countries, we find imports amounted to £145,277,436 but our exports to the EFTA countries amounted to £128,520,380, and if we take the figures for Great Britain and the Channel Islands, imports were £125,201,999 and exports were £104,696,572.</P>
    <P>It would appear therefore that the balance of trade between this country and the EFTA countries is substantially more favourable than between ourselves and the EEC.  On this occasion, I want to reiterate what I said in a recent debate and it is that I believe that we ought not merely to pursue trade discussions with Britain and trade discussions with the other European countries with whom we have trade agreements but we should ensure that we are in on any future EFTA discussions.  I appreciate it may not be possible for us to gate crash some of these discussions, if we are not invited to them but there is a very strong, and in fact a compelling case, because of the importance to our economy, for our being in on these discussions in the future and if not in them, then at least having observer status.  I was glad to see in a recent <Col N="858" /> article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> reference being made to this matter.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view during the course of the discussion here a few weeks ago on the failure of the Brussels negotiations that in the future whatever trade discussions took place, this country should be fully and adequately represented.  That is brought forcibly to our attention by a recent announcement in Britain.  I heard the Minister for Transport and Power claiming credit for the decision to establish a marketing board.  We can only judge any of these decisions on the results achieved.  Last week, there was an announcement in Britain that the quota of butter to be granted to this country in the coming year was something over 12,000 tons compared with 96,000 tons for Denmark.  It is about time this Government woke up and that we secured a proper quota commensurate with our traditional trading in this vital commodity.  It is not sufficient to establish a marketing board if the Government do not take effective action.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I believe we should ensure that not merely are trade negotiations on a full scale initiated between ourselves and Britain but that also we should immediately secure a discussion on the trade agreement we have with the EEC countries.  When we find that the rate of imports between ourselves and the EEC countries is four to one against us, of £40 million for imports last year, compared with our exports of £10 million, it is time we had a fresh and a hard look at these agreements with a view to having them revised.  Similarly, because of the trade discussions which are taking place between the EFTA countries, it is obvious it is in our interests that we should at least have observer status at these discussions if not participate directly in them.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the recent breakdown in the Brussels negotiations was not merely the fact that it found other countries unprepared for the consequences but that we ourselves, having staked all on being admitted by 1963 or 1964 now find that we have no practical immediate alternative.  In view of the consequences on our economy of the <Col N="859" /> breakdown of these negotiations, we have to think very carefully before we unilaterally reduce tariffs without some <i>quid pro quo</i>.  If we reduce tariffs, either before we are members of the GATT, or before we have any multilateral arrangement under GATT, or while we are not members of EFTA or the EEC, we may find, when we come to negotiate, we have no effective bargaining power and no trading ability in order to negotiate changed agreements or to negotiate on the basis of general reductions which will be effective not only for this country but for the other countries as well.</P>
    <P>One of the significant changes in the past six years has been the steep rise in the cost of living.  The consumer price index in February, 1957, was 135 and in November last, it had risen to 157.  That imposed additional burdens on all sections of the community but in particular, it adversely affected pensioners and those living on fixed incomes.  Some sections who had the power to negotiate, who were represented by trade unions or other organisations, were in a position to negotiate a rise in wages or salaries but there are a great many people, people living on fixed incomes from investments, and pensioners, some of whom received some increase but many of whom received no increase whatever to compensate them for the rise in the cost of essential foodstuffs and the rise in the cost of many essential services.  Not merely did bread and other essential articles of food increase in price but bus and train fares increased and health charges also increased.  The result is that a great many people on fixed incomes found themselves facing higher charges without any compensatory advantage or any alteration being made in their position to compensate them for the increase which has ocurred.</P>
    <P>It is because of that, and because of the serious effect on the position for a number of these people, plus, indeed, the general effect on our economy as a whole, that I question the wisdom of the decision to introduce a purchase or sales tax.  This purchase or sales tax was recommended in the Third Report of <Col N="860" /> the Commission on Income Taxation. I do not know if Deputies and the public are generally familiar with the basis on which that decision was taken.  It was, first of all, a bare majority decision.  It was taken by six members as against five who were opposed to it.  I do not believe a serious alteration of this nature in our tax structure should be taken by a bare majority in the circumstances in which this change is recommended and I should like to quote now some of the recommendations, which even the majority made, and try to find out will this recommendation be implemented or is there any likelihood of its being implemented?</P>
    <P>On page 50 in paragraph 115 it is stated:</P>
    <P>We accordingly recommend the introduction of a purchase tax at a rate or rates of between 7½ and 15 per cent. on a base of £65/75 millions wholesale value, but in any event excluding</P>
    <P>(a)  goods essential for agricultural production</P>
    <P>(b)  goods essential for industrial manufacture</P>
    <P>(c)  exports, agricultural and industrial</P>
    <P>(d)  food, particularly essential food</P>
    <P>(e)  fuel</P>
    <P>(f)  newspapers and books</P>
    <P>(g)  household non-durable goods</P>
    <P>(h)  goods already subject to heavy customs and excise duties, e.g. tobacco</P>
    <P>(i)  works of art, and goods that are primarily of a cultural nature.</P>
    <P>We recommend that the purchase tax be a part-substitute for income tax and that the revenue from it be used to reduce the rate of income tax.  The revenue which we recommend to be raised by a purchase tax, i.e. £6 millions at least, should permit of a reduction of about two shillings in the present rate of income tax, i.e. from 7/- to 5/-.</P>
    <P>  Is there any likelihood that will be implemented?  Is it not obvious that this tax, if it comes into effect, will be <Col N="861" /> in addition to, rather than in substitution for, any existing tax?  I accept the views expressed in the minority report in which those opposing criticised the decision to recommend the adoption of a purchase or sales tax; they quote certain economists, and others, on the matter.  They sought the views of three different economists.</P>

      <P>I refer again to the Third Report, page 76.  One of those <Col N="862" /> quoted is the Rev. W. Paschal Larkin, OFMCap., Professor of Economics in University College, Cork.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expediency of a general purchase tax is very controversial. Its suitability for this country is very questionable owing to our low per capita income, and our rather static consumption habits.  Even in England...there is a strong campaign for further substantial reduction in purchase tax, and its ultimate abolition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>  Professor G.A. Duncan, Professor of Political Economy in Dublin University had this to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All (sales or purchase) taxes possess three qualities in common:</P>
      <P>(i)  They are excise duties, falling with greater or less inequity according to their technical construction;</P>
      <P>(ii)  They are regressive, since, to raise revenue in significant amounts, they must fall on articles of common consumption;</P>
      <P>(iii)  They impose vast amounts of paper-work and accounting on traders, and consequently pre-dispose to evasion.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I doubt if sales, purchase or turnover taxes have had a happy history anywhere, except as excises at wholesale level expressed specifically on easily traceable commodities&mdash;and then their produce is somewhat inflexible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>David O'Mahony, Lecturer in Economics in University College, Cork, gave it as his view:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A purchase tax would tend to raise the cost of living and thus stimulate demands for increases in money incomes, which would in turn increase costs and thus impair our competitive position.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criticism expressed by the majority was that this tax would affect home produced goods.  It would be a tax on Irish industry.  I believe Irish industry has sufficient burdens, sufficient drawbacks, sufficient difficulties to contend with, without a tax of this sort.  The effect of this tax was, in fact, referred to in an OEEC publication in relation to the influence of sales tax on productivity, and it was stated that <Col N="863" /> the revenue aspect of such a purchase tax has always appeared subordinate to its economic aspect.  A purchase tax is a wage cut.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the effect of the publication of the White Paper on employer-labour discussions.  I have repeatedly expressed the view that one of the most hopeful signs in recent times in this country was the joint labour-employer discussions.  These discussions were initiated and adopted not merely for the purpose of discussing wages and salaries but of dealing with the far wider question of productivity, of employer-worker relations generally, the ability of industry, the changes which would be necessary in changing circumstances of trade, and generally the whole question of employer-worker relations in industry. These talks, which took place last July, were welcomed by everyone associated with industry and by the trade unions. Outside altogether of the participants directly concerned, they were welcomed also by citizens generally, by people who recognised that for the first time there was a chance of industrial peace, a prospect of a cooperative effort on both sides to achieve a common objective, to eliminate the causes of dissension and difficulties which had formerly prevented that full co-operation and collaboration so essential for progress.</P>
    <P>The publication of the recent White Paper has seriously jeopardised these talks.  It is for that reason that I welcome the change that has since taken place and which I believe is directly attributable to the discussion we had here on the White Paper; the Taoiseach has since written to the Federated Union of Employers and the Trade Union Congress asking both sides to discuss the problems with him and stating he was prepared to meet them either jointly or separately.  I see that as an effort to redress the damage done by the publication of the White Paper and to secure what I believe is essential for economic and social progress&mdash;not merely the co-operation of the trade unions and employers but the joint effort which must be made in a <Col N="864" /> partnership between the State, on the one hand, and employers and trade unions on the other.</P>
    <P>It is an indication that the discussion which was held here had a beneficial result in so far as it influenced the Government in the direction of joint discussions on these matters and the realisation that you cannot dictate in a modern society to one section of the community and expect one or two sections to bear a greater share of the burden, that it must be shared equally or not imposed at all.  It is for these reasons we believe that the discussions which were initiated can and will be fruitful, provided there is no attempt made by the Government to impose a standstill or to re-introduce the atmosphere which was prevalent on previous occasions of dictating to one section or attempting to dominate from a position in which the Government can influence those directly employed by the State or indirectly by State bodies.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which has been the subject of discussion in recent times is the extent to which some projects have been proceeded with at the same time.  There is a case for examining critically the amount of expenditure in order to see whether all the projects which are under the direct or indirect control of the State should be proceeded with simultaneously, if particular State industries or State companies are proceeding with major works, particularly construction work of a non-productive character.  I am not satisfied that it is necessary for State companies to have, as many of them have, elaborate or grandiose buildings as offices or headquarters.  In fact in some cases it tends to create a wrong impression but, in any event, in circumstances in which there is a great need for more houses, particularly corporation houses&mdash;the same is true of Dun Laoghaire and other local authorities&mdash;the emphasis should be on the provision of such houses.  If there is a shortage of skilled personnel or if there are any temporary difficulties in supplying the capital necessary, there should be a postponement of the work being carried out by some of these State undertakings, especially <Col N="865" /> work of a non-productive character. Any other works such as power schemes are obviously in the immediate national interest and should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the growth of the present Book of Estimates is the steep rise in the national debt.  The national debt now stands at over £500 million and the sum necessary to pay the interest on that is very considerable and is growing.  It is essential to have a critical look, therefore, at the extent to which hire purchase debt has increased in recent years.  The figures published in the quarterly bulletin of the Central Bank for January of this year show that the total hire purchase debt has increased from £9.9 million in 1956 to £31.8 million in September of last year.  Sums financed by external capital have increased from £4 million to £11.9 million during the same period.</P>
    <P>Much of this debt on hire purchase is in respect of non-essentials.  Some of it, of course, is in respect of capital goods, agricultural and industrial machinery, and so on, but an analysis is necessary of the extent to which hire purchase debt has been incurred on knick knacks, non-essential articles or articles whose purchase could certainly be postponed until circumstances warrant such expenditure.  In particular is it necessary to examine this in the light of the serious increase in the burden of the national debt.  Indeed the recent increase in the national debt burden has evoked comment not merely from leader writers in newspapers but from economists and statisticians.  The effect of this increased burden is that more is being borne by the community generally, by the taxpayer, and we must add to that proposal to impose additional taxation through a purchase or sales tax.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said earlier, that I believe the most dangerous indication in the present circumstances is the impression that the Government give of being complacent.  It is impossible to be complacent with the continuous drain of emigration, with the substantial rise in the cost of living, with the fact that we are importing from the EEC countries four times as <Col N="866" /> much as we export to them, that we have no clearly defined trading arrangements in the immediate future, that, faced with all that, we find the total numbers in employment are either less than or only the same as were employed in 1956.</P>
    <P>The Government approach to this problem has been to place a growing burden on fewer people.  There are increased charges for social services, increased costs in respect of the administration of the State and no worth while breakthrough or expansion in exports or trade possibilities.  These facts are obvious from the bill which is being presented to the Dáil in the Book of Estimates.  These are the inescapable conclusions which force themselves on anyone who has read through these figures which require the most critical examination by the Government in order to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful expenditure, to channel into directly productive enterprises a greater proportion of the bill which is being asked from the people and to gear the economy to meet the competitive challenge which will take place, whether we are members of EEC or members of EFTA, or whether we have to trade on the basis of bilateral arrangements with Britain or with the other Continental countries with which we have agreements.</P>
    <P>Whatever the future may hold in respect of these arrangements, we must be more competitive and more efficient.  All the indications are that the people who should give a lead in this direction, the Government, are less efficient and less competitive than they should be.  They are responsible for increasing the burden on industry, on agriculture on all sections whereas, in fact, the lead and the direction should be the other way.  The Government should indicate and clearly define the problems to be faced and assist industry and agriculture to make themselves more efficient and more competitive to meet trading conditions and to provide our people with a better standard of living and increased opportunities in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate yesterday evening and this morning, <Col N="867" /> one is struck by the different approach of different Deputies, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to the issue being debated.  We in the Labour Party agree that, if services have to be provided, they must be paid for.  The only point at issue as far as we are concerned is whether or not the method of raising and of spending the money is the correct one.  Having said that, I would say that I was rather amused by the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance last night who considered it was far more important to talk about what happened with regard to social services in this country from 1908 to the present day than to discuss what might happen in the year 1963.  I was even more surprised to find the Minister for Transport and Power this morning indulging in the very same tactics.</P>
      <P>Personally, I do not believe this occasion is one which should be used or the scoring of petty political points by any Deputy or any Party.  Perhaps this is the most important matter which will come before Dáil Éireann during the year.  For that reason, the point of view of the various individuals and the various Parties should be put in a practical way.  There is no use at all in finding somebody like the Minister for Transport and Power trying to give the impression that this country started in 1947 with the Coalition, who made a mess of things; that it disappeared until some time around 1954 when another Coalition Government made a mess of things&mdash;and then all the Daniels came to the judgment and, in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party appeared for the first time, with flags flying, and, since then, have been making a tremendous job of bringing the country back to what they think it should be brought back to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone is that an unfair way to approach this matter but I think it is a harmful way.  We must realise that the country got its freedom over 40 years ago; that it was ruled by one Party until 1932 and that the present Government, with the exception of two short periods, were in office from 1932 <Col N="868" /> to the present day.  During that period, they had on numerous occasions the support of the Labour Party in the things they did.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said here yesterday, the Labour Party are at all times prepared to support any measure which we think is in the interests of the country, no matter what Party introduces it.  To try to give the impression that everything good comes from one Party and everything bad comes from those who are opposed to that Party, in my opinion, is a very wrong and harmful way of dealing with matters which come before this House.</P>
    <P>A passing reference was made by a number of Deputies to a recent wage pause.  The Parliamentary Secretary last night said that he never saw a wages standstill and that there was never a wage pause.  Obviously, away back in the war years, we all must have been badly codded because we were all under the impression that there was a wages standstill.  Our wages were tied by that standstill order.  Now we are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that that did not exist at all.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a number of people have tried to prove that the present wage pause does not exist.  The Minister for Transport and Power, however, did admit that it existed, though not under the heading of a wage pause.  I was intrigued by his explanation of what he thought was the necessity for relation to the national economy and by his suggestion that if the workers&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash; were spending 8/- out of every £ they earned on goods imported into this country, they were damaging the national economy.  When pressed in regard to the matter, he pointed out that that could include the cotton for somebody's shirt.  He assumed, from that, that if somebody wants to buy a shirt&mdash;unless he can get one that is made in Ireland&mdash; he is injuring the national economy or trade balance, provided he is a wage earner.</P>
    <P>I was picturing in my mind the rush there must have been of farm workers' wives last year, with their 6/- increase in their hands, to ruin the economy of <Col N="869" /> the country; to spend abroad; to buying luxury goods, including shirts, for the 6/- which the Agricultural Wages Board allocated as a fair increase to farmers' workers.  How ridiculous can the Minister get or how stupid can be the arguments in favour of this so-called wage pause?  If we follow it to its logical conclusion and if the fact that if a worker gets more money and buys something, the raw material of which comes from abroad, he is therefore widening the adverse trade balance, surely the Government should take power here, if they can, to prevent anybody from spending money and to take money out of people's pockets&mdash;because it amounts to the same thing?</P>
    <P>A group of workers are entitled to a wage increase and if, by Government action, they are prevented from getting it, surely it follows that they have been deprived of something which is rightfully theirs, the very same as if somebody has £1,000 in the bank and is told that he may not use it because he might buy shares, and so on, which would damage the national economy? The Minister for Transport and Power was possibly making his statements here just as they came up.  He got a little bit rattled when there were a few interjections.  Later, having had another look at the matter, he may come along and say that, while he is reported as saying that, he meant something different.  We shall not be able to say what he meant.  I am not quite sure that he knew what he meant himself.</P>
    <P>It is true that there has been quite a substantial increase in output in the country.  The gross output has increased, according to statistics supplied, and the export level has also increased very substantially in the past five or six years.  That there was a reduction last year is true but there is a point which I think should not be overlooked.  When people start juggling with figures, particularly with figures regarding livestock, I always have a feeling that they are trying to make the best case possible by putting the increase in a certain way and by not putting the increase in the correct way.</P>
    <P>It is true that when there was a big increase in output some years ago, the <Col N="870" /> increase in exports was caused mainly by the export of cattle to Britain.  Is it not extraordinary that, while we can shout from the housetops about the wonderful thing it is to increase our exports, even though they be cattle, if it suits, we can condemn those responsible for exporting the cattle and say they were running down the number of cattle in the country.  It must be either right or wrong.  If it is right to export cattle, then the people who encourage the export and, as a result, build up quite a hefty balance, should get the commendation to which they are entitled.  To take the opposite view and say: &ldquo;It is grand to have this wonderful amount of money coming in for exports, but you are wrong to export so many cattle,&rdquo; is an unreasonable approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power referred to the fact that from 1954 to 1957, the total cattle population decreased by 81,000.  As he knows, that was caused by the export of extra cattle.  They did not die in the country. There was no epidemic.  They were sold abroad and money came into the country for them.  The Minister also said, however, that there was an increase of 32,000 in 1954 to 1956, and an increase of 220,000 in 1956 to 1962.  This question of cattle exports shows, in my opinion, in its true light the necessity not to put too much &ldquo;pass,&rdquo; as they say in the country, on the question of the balance of trade, because if the price of cattle goes up by a couple of shillings per cwt. and if there is a big increase&mdash; as there was in two years in the past decade&mdash;in the export of cattle to Great Britain, our balance of payments is all right.  I think when that matter is looked at in the proper way, it shows that very dishonest propaganda can be made out of the balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made, again by the Minister for Transport and Power, to the £167,000 which has been given to set up two marketing boards, one for dairy produce and one for pigs and bacon.  He said that in fact, they were doing very good work.  I have a very close connection with the agricultural community and I am afraid they cannot <Col N="871" /> agree that those two boards are, in fact, doing a wonderful job, or that they have done anything outstanding since they were set up.  It is suggested that they are used more as a cover for Government inactivity rather than as an aid to the farming community.</P>
    <P>Milk prices are a burning problem. It is very true that costs have arisen substantially in the production of milk, and it is also true that this will affect&mdash; not as the Taoiseach said by 1/- in the lb. but by some pence in the lb.&mdash;the price of butter if there is a consequent increase in the price of milk.  At the same time, I believe something must be done to try to find an outlet for milk and other dairy produce.  I do not agree that dumping it on the British market and paying for it with the Irish taxpayer's money to be eaten there is the correct method of dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>The biggest criticism we have to make of the Vote on Account is the fact that apparently the Government have come to consider an unemployment figure of somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000 as normal.  It is true that three weeks ago the figure had gone up to 71,105 and we are all prepared to agree that part of that increase was caused by the incidence of bad weather.  We are not prepared to agree, however, that the bad weather had such a tremendous effect on the unemployment position as some people seem to think it had, because building workers were put on wet time and therefore were not signing on at the labour exchanges, and for that reason the thousands of them who were put on wet time were not counted in the figure.</P>
    <P>However, the figure has dropped but it is still somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000.  We want to know&mdash;and we will be asking about it later on the Estimates&mdash;what effort the Government intend to make to try to create further employment.  Are they satisfied with the efforts they have made so far to meet the situation?  We all know&mdash; the Government as well as the Opposition&mdash;that over the years there was a heavy drain of emigration.  It had <Col N="872" /> reached a stage where people who were out of work and had no prospect of getting work emigrated, and so many had left the country that the numbers remaining on the unemployment list had dropped down to between 50,000 and 60,000.  We now have a steady 20,000 to 25,000 per year, representing, I assume, those who leave school and reach the employment age.  Apparently that will continue unless the Government do something about stopping the outflow.  That can be done only by setting up industries based on agriculture which will give employment to those people.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the efforts the Government have made to enable people to find employment by establishing industries.  My criticism is that I believe they have not gone far enough.  Again, I believe there was a dishonest approach by certain people when industries were being set up.  We all know of the advertisements which appeared inviting people in the Shannon area who had come back for Christmas to stay at home.  If rumour is true, quite a substantial number did so, and so many applied that they were told: &ldquo;We were talking about long term planning; what in fact we were saying was that in years to come, we want to know where we can look for employees.&rdquo;  In fact, the jobs which the workers thought existed there did not exist, and will not exist for quite some time.  No matter what the object was, I consider that was a very dishonest way of dealing with a matter of that sort.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that people should be enticed to leave employment in England or anywhere else, if there are no guaranteed jobs for them when they come back here.  I believe that the answer to our problems is not to encourage more people to emigrate, but that if we could encourage 500,000 or 1,000,000 of our own people to come back from abroad, the income which they would receive would be a shot in the arm to our economy and it would pull us out of the doldrums we seem to have got into.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Government to say they are encouraging outside industrialists <Col N="873" /> to come in here.  It is easy for them to say that proposal is meeting with a certain amount of success but I do not think it is good enough.  The Labour Party believe the onus is on the Government to set up industries to give employment.  If they set out to do that, we feel they could make a success of it.  There are, I know, a number of development associations all over the country, and I know they are in the habit of trying to encourage industries into their areas.  The Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce have been doing their share to try to improve the position but it is important that even in those cases the Government should make an effort to direct people who come in here and are anxious to start industries to certain areas.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say to local development bodies who go to these authorities for help that it is not a matter for them but is a matter for the local bodies themselves.  It may be easier to suggest those things than to do them but if the Government put their minds to it, it should be easy to have a list of places where there are available capital, sites and labour. Most of these local associations are pushed off by the Department or by the Industrial Development Authority when they come along asking if it is possible to have an industry sent to their particular area.</P>
    <P>We have got our ideas slightly askew as far as industrialists are concerned. Enough encouragement is not given to Irish people who want to start up industries or to improve existing industries, particularly when there is a prospect of a large labour content.  I had experience of a factory which was burned down.  For some reason, it was not insured and when the owner desired to rebuild it, he got no assistance whatever and a large number of people were thrown on the labour exchange. We also have people who want to expand and, while they are met with courtesy by the officials of the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce, they do not get very much encouragement. <Col N="874" /> They are told in a courteous way that something will be done or that something will not be done but that is the end of it.  Those people then get fed up and throw away the whole plan, although they may have had something worth while if they had got encouragement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power referred to credit for farmers and said it was a fact that creditworthy farmers could get loans of £200 from the Agricultural Credit Corporation without security and another £200 with security.  The term &ldquo;creditworthy&rdquo; is the operative word here.  Very often, people who consider themselves creditworthy are disappointed to find that the officials consider them anything but creditworthy on account of some deed in which there is a reference to a claim which somebody else had on their land back about 1920.  If there is going to be any publicity given to this question of more loans for farmers, the Government must see to it that the term &ldquo;creditworthy&rdquo; refers to somebody who is worthy of credit and not to a person the officials think is worthy of it.  That is an entirely different matter.</P>

      <P>If you need money, you will always have difficulty in getting it. I have great pleasure in nothing that there is an increase in the Estimate for Forestry and I wish to compliment the Minister on the amount of forestry work done and the large employment content.  Perhaps the Minister could explain to me why Forestry is included in the vote for Agriculture.  It makes it more difficult for us to obtain information but perhaps those things are sent to try us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the increase in the amount for education.  The Labour Party believe that not nearly enough is being done under that heading.  We feel that the time is fast approaching when this country has got to see, whether we like it or not, that the young people leaving school have a good basic education and, even if they have to emigrate, that they do not <Col N="875" /> emigrate as unskilled labourers.  It is one of the shocking things of life in this country that so many school-leaving children have to go as unskilled labourers.  There ought to be some form of apprenticeship for those who do not feel like going on for further academic education.  We believe that some form of training must be given to stop the spectacle of youngsters from decent families having to go abroad as unskilled labourers because they have not got the extra training or education.  They finish up as unskilled labourers for people who have not half their ability or brains but who have got a little extra education.</P>
    <P>We compliment the Department on spending more money but we feel it is not nearly enough and we also feel that if more money were spent, it would repay itself ten times over.  Far more of these people who are only too anxious to accept emigration as the only way out would be prepared to make an effort to survive in this country and to start some business or industry of their own.  It is important that that aspect should be watched by the Government and every effort made to follow it up.</P>
    <P>One of the matters on which I cross swords with the Minister for Transport and Power is his reference to a policy of wage agreements in a number of countries which he said were arrived at in many cases by agreement between employers and trade unions and accepted by Government as national policy.  That is quite true but these Governments do not seek to sabotage these negotiations and agreements by introducing a pay pause in the middle of them.  They do not intervene in matters of this sort until such time as a fair basic wage has been fixed for employment in those countries.</P>
    <P>It is more than stupid for anyone to suggest that there could be any question of a tie-down in wages as long as we have the situation that so many of the people employed in rural Ireland are working for a wage of slightly more than £6 a week.  The increases granted to these people over the past couple of years are only about one-third <Col N="876" /> of those granted to social welfare recipients.  I think the Government will have to decide, before they ever again suggest there should be an agreement on a national wages policy, that there is a fair, basic wage on which people can live.  None will quarrel with the subsidy to agriculture. We believe agriculture must be subsidised as our primary industry but in the Labour Party we do not agree that the system by which it is done at present is the correct one.  Worthwhile changes could be made in that system.</P>
    <P>A matter that the Government must consider in the very near future is the giving of some type of compensation directly by Government aid to farm-workers. It appears that the body set up to regulate their wages is not prepared to do the job but is prepared to allow them to carry on on starvation wages.  If we want to save agriculture &mdash;and in that connection I think the most important people are the agricultural workers&mdash;we must do something for those workers.  The onus is on the Government to do it.  Whether or not agriculture is successful is of very vital importance to the economy.  It is all very well for people in cities and towns to say the agricultural community is being spoonfed.  During the emergency, those same people thought nothing too good for the agricultural community. Whether there should be derating of the first £20 in valuation or not, as mentioned by Deputy Corry last night, is just plain cod.  The amount being paid in rates by those people is so small that it will have very little effect. The disposal of agricultural grants must be considered by the Government to ensure that the best use is made of the money available.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to inform people if it is possible for them to return and get employment in this country, but before that is attempted, those who are already working here must be encouraged in every possible way, either to house themselves, or get the local authorities to house them. The stock answer of the Department of Local Government is that they do not bar local authorities from building houses for the people for whom they want to build them.  Deputy Corry said <Col N="877" />&mdash;and this is one thing on which I agree with him&mdash;that 90 per cent. of the responsibility lies with the local authority and the other ten per cent. with the Department.  That ten per cent. includes the people who are living under certain conditions and the subsidy given by the Department is only one-third, but if these people live in certain other conditions, there is a two-third subsidy.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the trouble because no local authority wants to add to an already high rate burden by having to finance housing for those who, while they need houses, do not come within the two-third subsidy category.  That system, which has been handed down over the years, should be examined by the Government and a decision made to change the regulations as soon as possible. People should be encouraged to build their own houses.  My experience of the Department is that they are very co-operative where people are building their own houses and assist in every way they can.  Good housing adds to the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one type of person which the Minister for Lands might be able to help, the people who are small farmers, people who, outside those in city slums, are the worst housed in the country.  The principal reason for that is that the necessary finance is not available to build new houses or repair old ones.  Legislation passed last year may have eased the situation and perhaps they are now able, if the local authority plays ball, to do a considerable amount towards remedying the situation.  If the Minister for Lands would consider dealing with the matter through his Department and, if possible, have the amounts paid through his Department and repayable to his Department, it would have a tremendous effect on the housing of farmers. We would find people who at present have very little hope of ever living in a good house would be able to repair their existing homes or build new ones.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power referred to voluntary organisations and suggested, as far as I could <Col N="878" /> understand, that the fact that there were so many organisations operating was a good sign that the country was on the &ldquo;up and up&rdquo;.  I cannot see the relevance of that.  I cannot see that it has anything to do with the question. Very often when people are completely browned-off everything else, they get interested in a voluntary organisation to take their minds off the position the country is in.  Possibly the Minister did not think of it that way. If we are to depend on things such as the operation of voluntary organisations, matters entirely outside Government control as an index of the progress of the country, we shall be going on the wrong lines.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe that this money is needed.  If you want services, you must pay for them and if money is needed, the Government must fulfil their responsibility and find it.  But if the extra money which they hope to find is to be got by taxing the lowest paid in the country, whether it is called sales tax or a turnover tax, if this tax is to be levied on the consumers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To some extent it is true, as Deputy Tully said, that Parties may not be so important.  If that is so, their policies are certainly important insofar as they affect the lives of our people.  It is not the name or label of any particular Party but their policy&mdash;if certain Parties have policies&mdash;that will reflect their strength in this House and will <Col N="879" /> reflect, one way or another, on the lives of our people.</P>
      <P>I have listened with particular interest to the Labour Deputies who have spoken in this debate.  In the main, their approach has been a realistic one.  To suggest that the cost of the bill now being presented to the taxpayers can be found from some Santa Claus is completely unrealistic. Those who advocate that the works represented by this Book of Estimates are necessary in the national interest have a duty to support whatever taxation will be required to get on with the national work.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Labour speakers agreed there has been a substantial increase in output and exports.  That came about by the planned policy of the Government. I should like to refer to the complaint made by Deputy Corish that in some way or other the Government were slow in taking the people into their confidence.  I assert there has been no Government in this country who took the people more into their confidence than the present Government. Indeed, it would have been impossible otherwise for this Government to have achieved the success achieved in their national economic policy, without the full understanding and co-operation of the people in all sectors of the economy.  It started off with the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, showing the plans of the Government and the line intended to be pursued. There were interim reports following that.  Indeed, the recent White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> starts off with these words:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this White Paper is to draw attention to the economic danger caused by the gap between incomes and productivity (i.e. output per head) which has developed over the past year or so, and threatens to become wider, and to seek the understanding and co-operation of all sections of the community in efforts to close this gap.</P>
      <P>  Paragraph 2 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of national economic policy is to ensure, by better organised and more efficient use of <Col N="880" /> productive resources, that real incomes and living standards will be progressively raised.  An increase in output is, however, the only safe basis for an increase in incomes. Serious consequences follow from attempts to push up the general level of incomes faster than output.</P>
    <P>  Again, the whole purpose of the issue of this document by the Government was to take the public fully into their confidence, to point out the potential danger in the situation ahead and in particular to make sure that those in protected Government employment, such as the Civil Service, and those employed in State bodies, who are permanent, sheltered, pensionable employees, would not by any action start off a ninth round of wage increases before the country could afford it.  Step by step, this Government have been taking the public into their confidence to fully disclose the national economic position and to ask for their co-operation and help.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the speeches made by the main Opposition Party on this Vote on Account.  It would appear they are endeavouring to fly in the face of economic facts and that some of them are trying to suggest to the country the old Fine Gael philosophy, which can be best summed up in the poem, &ldquo;We will all be ruined, said Hanrahan, before the year is out.&rdquo;  It appears to me that the Fine Gael Party would always prefer an economic wake to a wedding.  They are now endeavouring to put over that the country is facing certain economic disaster.  None of them, however, appeared to deny the growth in national output and in exports.  Though the increase in economic growth has been up to five per cent. in some years, we will take an average figure of four per cent.  This feat was regarded by impartial observers outside the country as being a tremendous economic achievement.  That achievement came about by the planned policy of the Government, with the full co-operation, understanding and help of the community.</P>
    <P>Let us take any of the ordinary visible tests of the effectiveness of the <Col N="881" /> Government's economic policy.  There is the test of internal expansion in economic activity.  There has been a very remarkable expansion in industry over the last few years, and the figures there are still rising.  Let us take the building industry, which is regarded in many countries as an economic indicator.  There was never such a building boom in this country as has been witnessed over the last couple of years.  Deputy Donegan seemed to suggest that, by increasing building activity, the Government were saving themselves in some way from economic disaster.</P>
    <P>At all events, this is true and cannot be denied: that, from one end of the country to the other, at present it is virtually impossible to get building contractors to take on new work.  In my own Department and in the Land Commission, we cannot get contractors to construct houses because they are so busily employed elsewhere. Indeed, it is having a slowing down effect on the construction of the houses necessary to speed up the Land Commission's migration programme.  We have been driven to go out and get direct labour to get houses constructed, even in my own county of Mayo.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that many of our people who have been engaged in the building industry in England for some years past are returning to participate in the building boom here. Building contractors are in the position that they are short of skilled building workers.  That is due to the boom in building about which Deputy Donegan complained this morning as being, in some way, a Fianna Fáil trick to save the financial situation.  As I said, activity in the building industry here, in Britain and in other countries is one of the economic factors on which economists look as an indication of the internal economic expansion of the community.</P>
    <P>We have another test, the rise in employment and the decrease in emigration referred to last night by the Taoiseach, and we have a still further test&mdash;which is something that might be considered by those who are moaning about agriculture&mdash;that is, <Col N="882" /> that the price of agricultural land was never higher than it is to-day, and that goes from one end of the country to the other.  That is not a sign of stagnation in agriculture; on the contrary, it is a sign of appreciation by those concerned of the future of agricultural development in this country and the gainful employment to be derived therefrom.  Equally, we have the position with regard to property outside the agricultural sector which has reached an all-time record level in the matter of price, which over the past three or four years has been increasing from day to day.</P>
    <P>That again is a sign not alone of the soundness of the economy but of the confidence of our people in investing in Irish property and in Irish land.  We have the favourable improvement and the intense mechanisation going on throughout our farms, even in the small farms in the West of Ireland.  It may be true that to some extent this mechanisation is causing some disemployment of agricultural labour in the agricultural sector but at all events it is part of the progression of the times in which we live.  It has commenced; it is here; and I think it must continue.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Fine Gael speakers to what they term &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  It is an extraordinary thing that if there is an inflow of money or capital for industrial or other purposes, it there and then becomes &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money, according to the Fine Gael Party.  It would never occur to them that there is an inflow of capital for investment in industry because of the stability that has been established here by the Government's policy, because of the remarkable economic progress that has been made in the past few years, because of the confidence of some outside people in the future of the State and because they feel that investment, particularly in Irish industry, is probably one of the safest investments available in the whole of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>If we take what any outside impartial observer would look at in examining the economy of any country, we should have a look at the index to the figures for Irish industrial equities in <Col N="883" /> so far as they reflect the economic activity in this land, in business and in the economy generally.  If, for instance, any independent economist goes to examine the American economy to pass any judgment on it, he starts off with the <i>Dow Jones Industrial Register.</i> In the same way, if any economist is examining the British economy, he will examine the <i>Financial Times</i> index. Speaking of the <i>Financial Times</i>, which is an economic paper of world-wide repute, and must be impartial in its advice to its readers, we find that it had this to say in the issue of 1st March, 1963, when commenting on a new issue of the Irish and Overseas Trust.  In an article advising its readers on the publication of this new financial activity, it states that this trust was formed only last month so that there was no past record of investment to judge from, but that there were several encouraging pointers.  One of the encouraging pointers which it gave in asking its readers to support this investment was:</P>
    <P>(3)  Both the Irish equity index and the country's production index have shown a comparatively high rate of growth in recent years.</P>
    <P>If a financial paper of international repute, making a special comment on investment in a financial trust in this country, gave as one of the reasons to persuade people to invest in it the fact that both the Irish equity index and the country's production index have shown a comparatively high rate of growth in recent years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me quote from our own index and let Deputy MacEoin swallow and digest these figures if he is able to.  I quote these figures from the Dublin Stock Exchange daily stocks and shares list for Wednesday of this week, March 6th.  They are the price index numbers of ordinary stocks and shares of Irish companies and it gives them from the year 1959.  Taking the year 1959 it gives, for the month of January, a figure of 109.7; in 1960, the index was up to 146.8; in 1961, it was up to 167.9; in 1962, it was up to 198.7; in 1963, in January, it was up to 232.9; and in February, which is the last figure here, it was up to 237.6. So here we have the index for Irish industrial equities showing an increase from 109.7 in 1959 to 237.6 last month.</P>
      <P>That is a remarkable story.  These are the remarkable figures.  They show a progressive rate of increase to the extent of well over 100 per cent. in Irish industrial equities between 1959 and the beginning of this year.  What do these figures mean?  They mean increased internal industrial activity. They mean possibly some increase in investment in industry in this country. They reflect the utter and absolute confidence of the investment and commercial world in Irish industry.  Since the foundation of this State there was never such a progressive figure of increase in the index of the Irish Equity Register.  There was never such a bright and confident picture painted by cold figures.  There is no answer to these figures.  I invite any speaker from the Opposition Benches to explain this extraordinary increase in Irish industrial activity since 1959.  Let them try to talk that away, if they are not prepared to accept any of the other economic signs that I have indicated, signs visible to all throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also substantially and sensationally increased output and exports over the past few years.  That is evident to all.  Indeed, only for this increase, an average of four per cent, as a result of the Government's programme for economic expansion many of the activities envisaged in the Book of Estimates could not have been proceeded <Col N="885" /> with.  Neither could the rounds of wage increases that occurred be borne by the national economy.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now for a moment to a statement made by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde last night, which is again indicative either of the Deputy's complete divorcement from reality or the mentality which persists amongst some members of his Party.  He alleged that this Government was Dublin minded, that we were all Dublin people living in Dublin who had completely lost touch with or did not know what was happening in rural Ireland. I should like to give the Deputy some reminders about what has been happening in rural Ireland during the lifetime of this Government and as a result of this Government's economic planning.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy, and others concerned, that one of the matters affecting rural Ireland to a very large degree and the general economy as a whole is the amount of employment provided by afforestation. In conformity with the general policy of this Government afforestation is being pursued to strengthen the national economy.  We have been endeavouring to eliminate inefficiency and reconstruct our programme to the best economic advantage.  Some people have been complaining that we are not in a position to exploit large acreages of nature forests, as they do in other countries with huge capital resources, but, as a result of Government assistance, we have been able over the last four years to achieve a planting programme of 25,000 acres each year.  We have added to the national stock and to national assets 100,000 acres of forestry.  That is something Deputy Esmonde and his friends could never conceive as possible of achievement.</P>
    <P>In connection with unemployment figures, Deputy Tully said the bad weather had nothing much to do with that.  I should like to correct the Deputy and to point out that in the Forestry Division, which employs something like 5,000 workers, there was a disastrous pause in activity in the early months of this year.  The total area planted in January and February <Col N="886" /> was only 613 acres as compared with 12,000 acres in a normal season in these two months.  Naturally forestry workers were laid off and there is grave danger that, because of the setback, we shall not achieve the 25,000 acres this year.  There are still some areas in Wicklow where no work can be done yet, but we are doing what was never done before in an effort to catch up; we are giving overtime employment in forestry in an effort to achieve the target of 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>In time, the efforts to build up great reserves on the wasteland of the country in the form of forestry will pay a dividend which will be of tremendous help, not alone in providing employment but in establishing subsidiary industries such as those which exist in countries where forestry is indigenous.  I instance the Scandinavian countries where forestry is the main basis of the economy.  In so far as Deputy Esmonde alleges that this is a Dublin Government, based on Dublin, and having no interest in rural Ireland, I should like to point out that in this vital matter of forestry, which affects the whole of rural Ireland, greater progress has been achieved by this Government than by any Government since the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>Let me come to another matter which is part of Government policy and which vitally affects rural Ireland, that is, the report on small farms in the west which came out as a result of the establishment of the interDepartmental committee set up by the Government.  The provisions of that report are well known to Deputies but what matters is that the Government and I have accepted fully the recommendations in that report and these matters together with others are at the moment the subject matter of a Bill which has been agreed to in principle by the Government and which is at present with the draftsman for introduction to the Dáil in this session.</P>
    <P>Without any question of new legislation, as a matter of general economic policy and for the benefit of the farmers in these congested areas the Government, through me, have already given effect to some of the recommendations <Col N="887" /> of that report.  The Land Commission are already creating in all their operations throughout the country the new viable unit to which we aspire and that is a family farm of 40 to 45 acres.  We realise that this process will take time but it can be done and must be aimed at as a matter of policy.  Whatever community we shall be associated with economically in the future it is urgent now that as a matter of economic policy we should plan our land units on a basis that we shall be at least as competitive as, if not superior to, those people against whom we expect to compete abroad in the export of agricultural produce.  The Government have provided the financial part of it in these estimates and decided, as I have said, even before the introduction of legislation, to plan economic farming units such as I have described.</P>
    <P>Another matter of policy to which effect has been given through the Government again, for the purpose of making sure that our land will be put into full production, is the compiling of a register of vacant and derelict holdings that are there over a number of years, generally non-productive and getting more so day by day.  That has already been done and action has already been taken in order to ensure that these lands will be put in the hands of those who will bring them into full production and thus assist the general overall national economic improvement in farm productivity that we all desire.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters of which evidently Deputy Esmonde and his colleagues are completely unaware. It would also appear that some of these Fine Gael speakers are unaware of the fact that this Government brought small creameries to the congested areas in these poorer counties in the West of Ireland and that for over the past two or three years, for the first time, the benefit of the dairying industry has been made available to the small farmers of the west.  There are many of these creameries now established and flourishing throughout my own county and the adjoining <Col N="888" /> counties that up to this time were left without the opportunity of benefiting from milk production, which I think is accepted as one of the most profitable forms of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>In passing, let me say this.  I had personal experience of talking to a number of these small farmers in the west who in planning their creameries sought aid from the Government, which they got.  These men who were deprived for so long of this form of regular cash income, this most profitable form of agricultural production, informed me that they would be very happy if they had the opportunity of producing milk and selling it, with the resulting benefits in pig rearing and calf rearing, at sixpence a gallon less than the price at present payable in what we call the creamery areas.  This is a form of economic activity and a form of benefit that has been brought to the people of the remote rural areas by this Government and, evidently, while all this was happening Deputy Esmonde was still asleep.</P>
    <P>It would also appear that he has not heard of the committees which have been established by the Government in each and every one of these congested counties for the purpose of economic development in their areas. The Taoiseach, speaking at Thurles, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Government attach particular importance to the Committee's suggestion that in each of the western counties members of the staffs operating the different schemes and projects should organise themselves into a development team and hold regular meetings at which ideas and suggestions would be discussed and developed.  The first meetings of these teams take place in the autumn.  The teams will make contact with the local voluntary rural organisations and consult with them.  The Government believe that exchanges of views between officials conversant with local conditions and leaders of rural organisations will be most helpful in inducing initiative and promoting a spirit of community development in the western areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> We never had, as the Minister for Transport and Power said, greater evidence of community spirit.  We never had throughout the length and breadth of this land a greater indication of the awareness of our people of what can be achieved by community effort with the assistance of a Government in which they have confidence.  At this time we have brought these organisations, which must meet regularly in each of these western counties, down to the people's level and these organisations are there so that any rural organisation in the community, any individual, can come along to them and say: &ldquo;Here is a plan I have thought of that will be of economic benefit to my parish or village.&rdquo;  It is the duty of the committee there on the spot, without any of the red tape of going up to different Government offices, to examine this plan and discuss it with them.  If they approve of it there is already a special organisation set up in the Department of Finance to take over and give effect, through whatever Government agency is suitable, to this plan for the benefit of this local community.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of Government thinking and planning for rural Ireland which is perhaps again unknown to Deputy Esmonde or some of his Fine Gael colleagues.  They must be living in outer space if they are not aware of the special efforts that have been made by this Government for rural Ireland to plan, in so far as they can, economic activity and increase the economic prospects of our people there.  It would also appear that some Deputies here are unaware of the vast State expenditure in huge drainage schemes such as the River Moy in the West that is now in full blast and that they are unaware of these special measures that this Government have undertaken so that the smaller people in the more remote areas of rural Ireland will fully share, in so far as the Government can arrange it, in national prosperity.  All these matters, it would appear, are completely new to Deputy Esmonde or some of the Deputies on those Benches opposite.</P>
    <P>It would also appear, of course, that Deputy Esmonde has not ever read <Col N="890" /> or heard of the Government's White Paper on the fishing industry or what has been done under it.  I would advise him, as he represents a rural constituency, to get a copy of the programme of sea fisheries development and to make inquiries as to the Government's plans that are there announced for the development of major fishery harbours around our coasts.  Preliminary tests are being made, even in his area, towards the achievement of this end, and new and vast financial provisions are being made available to bring the fishing industry of this country to the position in which we think it should be.</P>
    <P>Remember the provisions made for the young trainees under this Government scheme.  In a short time, I hope it will have a very marked effect on our economy.  From the young trainees whom we are getting now, I hope that in a comparatively short time the result of this part of Government policy will not alone be reflected in the prosperity of those immediately concerned in the industry but in the economy as a whole.  Under the provisions made here, it is not alone feasible but possible and probable that a young boy of 16, starting off at one of these schools, can achieve the ownership of a chattel worth £25,000&mdash;one of these 65-foot boats&mdash;before he reaches 23 years of age.</P>
    <P>Speaking as the second youngest member of a family of ten reared on the land, I only wish a Government in those days had some kind of scheme whereby I could be the owner of a £25,000 chattel before reaching my 23rd birthday.  It would appear, again, that the members of the Fine Gael Party are unaware of these developments for rural Ireland, are unaware of the planning, efforts and money being made available by this Government for the benefit of the most remote parts of our country.</P>
    <P>People on the benches opposite have been talking about &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  I would again suggest to them to look further than the expression &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;&mdash;manufactured for their own particular political purposes to indicate an increase in economic activity <Col N="891" /> and investment here&mdash;to see that in any country, wherever it is, the fact that there is more investment in industry, more investment in property and in business is the financial indication of the stability of the country and the economic policies it pursues.</P>
    <P>If one looks to the future, a prudent man will not invest in some banana republic in South America nor in a country in respect of which he has any doubt as to its financial solvency or the financial policy being pursued by it.  It is a positive indication of the confidence created by the policies of this Government in our own people, in ourselves and our economy, that we have had such remarkable figures that I have quoted from the index here of industrial equities in the Irish Stock Market, indicating the success of the financial policies achieved by this Government.</P>
    <P>This Book of Estimates is an indication of the Government's activities in different spheres.  It is true to state that, if the economy could allow it, there are many fields in which the Government would wish to expend more money.  In some of the matters affecting rural Ireland and, in particular, in respect of some of the matters for which I am the responsible Minister, in so far as the national finances have allowed it, there was never a greater amount of money provided by any Government since the foundation of this State for the purpose of helping me to solve the land problem.  There was never a greater amount of money provided for the purchase of land for the relief of congestion.  There was never a greater amount of money provided for the purchase, by cash, of lands in the open market for these great national and social purposes.</P>
    <P>If the economy, under the planning of the Government, can, as I believe it will, with the understanding of our people, continue at the same rate of growth, then this country will be in a position to move forward still further with the economic progress that has been achieved as a result of Fianna Fáil leadership, with the full assistance and understanding of our people.</P>

It is well that we should remind ourselves of the fact that this Fianna Fáil Government have now been in office for almost six years. The present situation of the country is entirely their responsibility.  They can have no alibis nor can they pass the buck to anyone else.  What is there, if it is good, they can take credit for; what is there, if it is bad, they must accept responsibility for.  In those circumstances, in considering the condition of the country now, we must have regard to the task which this Government set themselves when they were first elected to office in March, 1957.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together and to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the estimated total number of employees in each year 1951-58, and (b) the estimated average numbers in insurable employment based on the numbers of social insurance stamps sold in the years 1950-62.  No estimate of the total number of employees has been computed for 1950 and, in the case of years after 1958, it has been decided, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 6 of 15 February, 1961, not to prepare estimates for later years until the relevant results of the 1961 Census of Population had become <Col N="894" /> available.  These data are not yet ready. The figures for average numbers in insurable employment are not comparable over the period shown on account of changes in the procedure for exchanging insurance cards in the years 1952-53 and changes in the upper salary limit for the compulsory insurance of non-manual workers at various periods.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the list of hospitals to which patients can be sent by dispensary  <Col N="897" /> doctors in North Tipperary includes the Limerick Regional Hospital; and, if not, why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made from the Tipperary (NR) County Council which is the health authority concerned.</P>
      <P>I take it from the Deputy's reference to patients of dispensary doctors that he has in mind patients in the lower income group availing themselves of free general medical services under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953. Where it is necessary to refer such patients for hospital treatment the normal arrangement applying in North Tipperary is that they should be referred by their doctor to the appropriate hospital operated by the health authority.  In any case where the consultants employed by the health authority consider it necessary, the patient would be referred by them for treatment in an extern hospital. Limerick Regional Hospital may not be availed of for the provision of free treatment for patients from North Tipperary except in the circumstances I have mentioned or, of course, in an emergency.</P>
      <P>Any patient in the lower or middle income group who of his own choice, secures admission to Limerick Regional Hospital would obtain from his health authority the same benefits as apply in the case of a patient entering any other approved extern hospital of his choice, viz. a contribution towards the cost of maintenance and treatment.</P>

The approved list is a list approved by the health authority, not the Minister for Health.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the title &ldquo;the College of Surgical Chiropody&rdquo; is the business name in which a business in Cork which advertises a course of training in chiropody is registered under the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916.  It will be appreciated that it would be illegal for any person, not a company, to conduct any such business without registration under the Act mentioned and that such registration does not imply that any form of official recognition is accorded to or that any official responsibility is taken for the activities of the business.</P>
      <P>Neither should the fact that the proprietor of this business quotes in his prospectus a letter which he addressed to my Department or the fact that, in a statement which he issued recently to a Sunday newspaper, he claimed that &ldquo;he was in regular touch&rdquo; with my Department and the Department of Education be taken as an indication that any person whose sole qualification in chiropody is that he has completed the course advertised by this institution would be accepted for appointment to any post in the health services involving duties in chiropody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make the position quite clear, I think it is desirable that I should put on record that a certificate that a person had undertaken this training (which consists of a correspondence course requiring, according to the prospectus, an hour's study daily for six months, followed by a fortnight's practical instruction) is not accepted as having any value in relation to any public appointment in this country at present and, further, that it is extremely unlikely that it will have any such value at any future date.  I feel that I should also say further that, to the extent to which the statements of the proprietor of this business might be <Col N="901" /> taken at their face value, they are calculated to mislead the public and can only tend to discredit our national reputation in the matter of professional training generally.</P>

Being aware of all these things, as I am very fully aware of them, they are prepared to countenance all sorts of playacting, but no effort to mislead them as to the facts of the situation will be successful.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.  Employers are not obliged to furnish periodical returns of employment to me but figures issued by the Central Statistics Office indicate an increase in employment in transportable goods industries of 20,633 in the year 1962 as compared with 1957. The increases in employment in 1960, 1961 and 1962 over the preceding year in each case were 6,829, 6,930 and 3,600 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Deputies' question regarding additional industrial employment likely to be provided in the years 1963 and 1964, I would refer the Deputies to a reply given by me on 21st February, 1963, to a question concerning the estimated employment <Col N="911" /> content of projects expected to come to fruition in these years.  I am not in a position to furnish an estimate of the additional employment which may be provided by existing industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite catch the first part of the reply.  Did the Minister say that the figures available from statistics suggest that 20,000 new jobs were created in 1962, over and above the number available in 1957?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to an answer he gave quite a while ago when he estimated that 3,000 new jobs would be created this year at maximum.  The Taoiseach queried that figure recently when we asked a question about it and suggested that because old firms would also create new jobs, the figure was incorrect.  Would the Minister say how we should vary the figure of 3,000 to take into consideration some of the old firms creating new jobs, in addition to the new industries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I could not estimate the number of new jobs that may be provided by existing industries but the figure to which I referred in my previous reply was related to estimated employment content of projects coming into production for the first time in 1963 and ranged between 1,500 at the minimum and 3,700 at maximum production.</P>

      <P>There are 137 valid appeals under Section 18 of the Labourers Act, 1936, from tenant-purchasers in County Kildare to be decided.  Twenty-two of these appeals were received within the past three months; 31 from three to six months; 26 from six to 12 months and 58 over 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that many of these applications have been with the Minister for periods varying from six to 12 months, could he take any steps to ensure that decisions will be given so that the local authorities will be able to proceed with the vesting of these repaired cottages and thus enable the tenants to take advantage of certain provisions under the Housing Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some four or five months ago, I held an examination into the whole question of vesting and of delays in regard to vesting, and these appeals that were contingent on vesting.  I did take the steps the <Col N="920" /> Deputy suggests and one of the steps in regard to County Kildare was to get on to the manager to tell him there were 93 cases, correspondence about which then rested with that local authority, and to which we did not receive replies in some cases for over 12 months.  The matter is now proceeding satisfactorily and we hope to have decisions on these appeals in the near future.  That is the background, that we are not getting co-operation from the Kildare County Council and many other county councils who seemed to be delaying their replies to our inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister, although possibly it is unnecessary, that when he refers to the county council, he does not refer to the members of the county council&mdash;he is involving the staff of the county council who are in fact the Minister's minions.</P>

If there is any dereliction of duty there, it should have been obvious in the interest that would have been displayed by the members.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that ordinary members of the council have no means of knowing when an applicant decides to vest and appeals to the Minister?  Information is gathered by councillors only in a disjointed kind of way when they get <Col N="921" /> complaints from individual ratepayers that they have appealed to the Minister 12 months ago and have heard nothing from the Minister or the county council. It was with a view to ascertaining how many appeals were before the Minister that I submitted this question. Now the Minister says that some of these cases were there for 12 months.  I suggest he should put some official of his Department on the job and bring home responsibility to whoever is responsible for the delay.</P>

      <P>Recipients of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance who live less than four miles from a local office of my Department are required to attend there on occasions in the week other than on the occasion of the weekly payment and the frequency of these attendances depends on a person's distance from the local office.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was recalling the fact that this Government have been in office for six years and it is as well now that each side of the House, particularly this side of the House, feels itself free fully to deal with Government policy without any inhibitions in relation to Common Market negotiations or matters of that kind.  It is well that the record of the Government in these past six years should be put into proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March, of 1957, when the Government took office, this country had just emerged from a serious economic blizzard which had affected not only Ireland but most other countries in Western Europe.  Indeed, it is worth recalling that during the economic difficulties of 1956 when the terms of trade turned sharply against this country, when chilled Argentinian beef <Col N="936" /> dumped on the British market affected our cattle prices, when all these difficulties of one kind or another began to emerge, there were whoops of delight from the camps of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Reference was made at Question Time today to the price of milk.  One can remember in 1956 the farmers from the Golden Vale mobilising themselves for a march upon Dublin and the men who were organising the pinpoints of that march were Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators.  How their hearts bled for the dairy farmers in 1956 and for the wheat farmers too. They were told up and down the country by Fianna Fáil exponents: &ldquo;You should not have had the price of your wheat cut.  Elect a Fianna Fáil Government and you will get back by way of an increase in the price of wheat 12/- a barrel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was some of the background which saw this Government enter office in March, 1957, but of course there were other things they talked about then.  Take housing.  How well we remember in this House, Deputy Briscoe conniving and conspiring all round this city to bedevil the housing situation in Dublin city.</P>

      <P>There was no money, we were told, and no houses and the poor people in this city were led by Deputy Noel Lemass, the then Deputy Haughey and Deputy Briscoe into a conviction that that was so.  I assert that that was a deliberate conspiracy to mislead the poor people of this city.  The fact now emerges because at that time when this vile campaign was going on, there were 1,500 dwellings being built in this city and the waiting list for houses had been successfully reduced to 4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of this campaign, in Dublin city alone, when these conspirators found themselves facing the responsibility of office, instead of 1,564 houses there was a sudden drop to 1,000, then down to 460, a slight rise to 505 and then down to 207.  We have the miserable situation today in Dublin that it is hoped this year, doing the best they can, that they may possibly reach 500 houses.  The result is that today there are 9,000 families seeking houses in Dublin city; of those 4,000 are affected by one medical condition or another and have been passed as urgent cases by the city health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a miserable record.  Whoever is responsible should and will be held to account.  Perhaps in the very near future the test of public opinion in this city and county will be applied to that <Col N="938" /> miserable record in relation to housing. However, there was more.  When they began to assume office, they talked about taxation.  I wonder does the Deputy from Cavan who was not in the House at the time remember the word &ldquo;levies&rdquo; and how the poor people who had to import Jaguar cars were listened to with sympathy by Fianna Fáil because of the import levies they had to pay on motor cars, television sets, radios and things of that kind? In the general election campaign of 1957, taxation became the bye-word of Fianna Fáil.  People were being taxed too heavily.  The burden of taxation was such that it could not be borne by the people and the Fianna Fáil Government would see it end.</P>
    <P>These things now must be subject to review.  Take employment.  Unemployment figures were bad in 1956. They began to improve in the beginning of 1957 but they were not good. Fianna Fáil used the expression: &ldquo;Employment figures are the test of any Government&rdquo; and with buglers blowing a fanfare the Taoiseach gave us the Fianna Fáil plan for 100,000 new jobs.  All that had to be done was to vote in a Fianna Fáil Government and jobs would grow like mushrooms in summertime after a shower of rain. Emigration would cease and the Irish people would find jobs growing all over the country.</P>
    <P>I have here the Dáil Reports which make rather amusing reading now six years later.  It is a Dáil Report which contains speeches by Fianna Fáil Ministers in the first flush of victory after their election to office on March 20th, 1957, just this time of the year.  When the Vote on Account in that year was moved by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, it was formally opposed by the Opposition because the Minister made it clear he had not had time fully to examine the details of the Supply Services of that year which, as the House would appreciate, he said, were prepared by his predecessor.  He gave an undertaking that there would be an earlier Budget and, in the Budget, people would see evidence of Fianna Fáil's concern in relation to the reduction of taxation.  And so the Budget came.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> It is well that Deputies should remember that in that year a sum which appeared large&mdash;in fact, Fianna Fáil Deputies described it as &ldquo;shocking&rdquo;&mdash; a sum of £111 million was required to run the State.  &ldquo;Shocking&rdquo; said Fianna Fáil, in effect&mdash;&ldquo;but, of course, we had nothing to do with it. It was a figure that was there because of our predecessors but we shall deal with it now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his Budget statement of that year&mdash;and I am reading from Volume 161, column 939 of the Official Report &mdash;the Minister for Finance had this to say on the subject of taxation and State expenditure:</P>
    <P>In the short time available since the Government took office it would obviously have been impossible to examine critically and justly all the objects of expenditure of the taxpayers' money.  The searching out of wasteful or unnecessary expenditure and its elimination will require keen and continuous attention...</P>
    <P>  I shall just pause there to ask the sympathy and understanding of the House for what we felt over here on these Benches when we saw and heard the Minister make this statement and say those words: &ldquo;the searching out of wasteful or unnecessary expenditure and its elimination will require keen and continuous attention.&ldquo;</P>
    <P>Hawkeye Ryan was on the job.  This new Minister was coming in to clean out the Augean Stables.  We were to have a vista, we were told in the Budget statement, of keen and continuous attention, the concentrated activity by this new Government searching out wasteful and unnecessary expenditure. He goes on:</P>
    <P>...but the urgency and difficulty of our budgetary problem this year required that a start should be made at once.</P>
    <P>Then he says:</P>
    <P>I shall mention a number of specific economies which have already been decided upon but which represent merely an instalment of what the <Col N="940" /> Government in time intends to do.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;merely an instalment&rdquo;&mdash;and he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It will be no surprise that I should begin with the administrative machine.</P>
    <P>The present annual cost of the Civil Service, Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces amounts in round figures to £25,000,000</P>
    <P>  He tut-tutted mentally and said:</P>
    <P>almost £17 million for the Civil Service, over £3½ million for the Garda Síochána and nearly £5 million for the Army.</P>
    <P>  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The existing Civil Service structure seems too elaborate for our needs. The grading system is to my mind unduly complex.  I intend that these matters will be examined and radical changes made which will, I believe, ultimately produce worthwhile economies.</P>
    <P>  So spoke the Minister for Finance of the newly-elected Fianna Fáil Government on 8th May, 1957, when he was asking this country and the taxpayers to provide for him and the activities of the State £110 million.</P>
    <P>We propose to examine those sentiments and to see whether there was much behind them other than the thought which promoted the framing of the words.  In the six years, since, I do not know whether Deputy Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Finance, applied &ldquo;keen and continuous application&rdquo; to the expenditure requirements of the State.  I do not know whether he succeeded in cutting out &ldquo;wasteful or unnecessary expenditure.&rdquo;  I am sure he had good intentions.  The way to a certain warm place is paved with them.</P>
    <P>We cannot proceed according to what may have gone on in the mind of the Minister for Finance.  We cannot judge what changes of policy may have been decided on by the Government nor what shifting of feet on different problems may have brought about in the past six years.  We can only judge the results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> To day, the Civil Service, the Garda and the Defence Forces cost something over £10 million more than they did when these brave words were uttered six years ago.  The existing Civil Service structure which in 1957 seemed too elaborate for our needs and about which the Minister for Finance said he intended to make radical changes is still the very same&mdash;with this difference, of course, that there are more civil servants to-day than there were six years ago.  Today we are spending more on the Civil Service, more on the Defence Forces, more on the Gardaí, more on these particular headings of expenditure which the Minister extracted as an example in his Budget statement of 8th May, 1957.</P>
    <P>Maybe the increase in expenditure could not have been avoided.  If it could not have been avoided, the question is whether it should ever have been seriously put forward as a legitimate enterprise by the Government in the way of economy.  The fact, of course, is that no serious effort appears to have been made by the present Minister or the present Government to examine, in a careful and responsible way the manner in which State expenditure is assessed and the national requirements in that regard because to-day, instead of £110 million being required for the expenditure of the State, after six years of Fianna Fáil, we have now reached a new record.  This year, the requirements of the State will total £200 million.  That is not bad, in the short space of six years.</P>
    <P>Adding in the Central Fund the total increase in State expenditure is over £50 million.  That is a pretty poor result for the Minister for Finance who, in the flush of victory in May, 1957, held forth to the taxpayers the belief that very shortly radical changes would be brought about.  We are now spending £1 million a week more on the requirements of the State than we did when this Government were elected to office.  That seems to suggest a certain amount of inefficiency. It seems to suggest that the Government have not the ability to carry out what they said they would do.  It may be that what they said they would do is incapable of achievement and, if so, <Col N="942" /> it should not have been said.  If it is capable of achievement, why has it not been achieved?</P>
    <P>It is certainly remarkable that in 1963, when a suggestion was put forward by the Government&mdash;and dropped like a hot potato&mdash;that there should be a pay pause, and when everybody was told: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, take care; control your demands&rdquo;, that the one institution and organisation in the State that applies no strictures to itself should be the Government.  It is remarkable, surely, that the requirements in relation to the Government's demands continue to shoot up, with not a single explanation or apology for it.  We now have a record State expenditure of £200 million, that is, £4 million a week, and still no member of the Government is the slightest bit apologetic on that account.</P>
    <P>I remember reading through the Dáil debates of other days, other years, and other personalities.  A short while ago I read with interest the horror with which a member of this House in 1931 viewed the expenditure of those days.  There was a tall Deputy who used to speak from this side of the House at that time.  Referring to the requirements of the State, which at that time totalled the sum of £30 million, he turned to the then Leader of the Government and said: &ldquo;You are running the State as if it is a mighty empire&rdquo;.  Even applying the ordinary three-fold rule of thumb to the changes in the value of money, there is still a tremendous difference between the requirements in the way of State expenditure today and the requirements of 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that most people, even those on whom this bill may press unduly hard, would say: &ldquo;Well, if the money is needed so be it.  It has got to be paid.&rdquo;  If it were genuinely needed for the provision of essential services in the State, the average person might not like it but he would certainly feel there was nothing that could be done about it.  There is a conviction, amounting almost to a certainty, that there has not been any responsible scrutiny of the requirements set out in this Book of <Col N="943" /> Estimates, and that no real effort has been made to apply what was promised: a keen and alert attention to the demands in relation to the particular services.  For that reason we can justly say that this Book of Estimates is another demonstration of the inefficiency of the Government and their unsuitability for the tasks which they have set themselves.</P>
    <P>That is not the only record we mark this year.  Six years after Fianna Fáil came into office this record figure of £200 million is only one record.  There are two others that we reach this year. In this financial year we also reach a record figure for the national debt of £500 million.  Never before has this country owed so much money.  There was a time when a certain Party in this House used to be so concerned about the national debt that they got out posters showing the three golden balls of the pawnbroker and decorated hoardings of the city with these posters saying: &ldquo;Watch out; the country is being put in pawn.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Those pawnbroker's signs were used by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition in 1949 when the then Minister for Finance was seeking money by way of a national loan.  I have not got the figures before me, but I think the national debt at that time was one of the lowest in any <Col N="944" /> country of comparable size in the world.  It was almost insignificant. When, in pursuance of a capital programme in those years, Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, said to the people: &ldquo;Instead of investing abroad, here is a national loan; invest your money here at home so that your money can work at home&rdquo;, there were cries of horror from Fianna Fáil that the country was being put in pawn, and that we were pledging its future.  It is well to remember those things in these days.</P>
      <P>As I said, the second record is that we have a national debt of £500 million. One of the difficulties in our yearly budgeting is the servicing of that debt, the raising of taxation in order to pay the interest on the debt.</P>

      <P>There was no irresponsible Opposition here in the past six years when the Minister for Finance announced that in a few days a new national loan would be floated. On those occasions, Deputy Sweetman or the Leader of the Opposition stood up from these benches to assure full support for the loan.  That is, perhaps, a formality here.  It used to be done in the same way by a representative of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The difference is that what was said on behalf of this Party was meant.  Deputy Sweetman or the Leader of the Opposition did not run out from this House and order the printers to print posters with the pawnbrokers' sign on them.  The difference is that when a spokesman on behalf of this Opposition assures the Government of support for a national loan, those words are not spoken only from the teeth out.</P>

      <P>There is a national debt of £500 million.  That has to be paid for by every tenant of a council house in Cavan, by every old age pensioner who scrapes his knife on his little bit of plug, by every man who goes into a public house and orders a pint, by the majority of the poor people of this country.  They are paying now to service a national debt of £500 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the fact that the record national debt has to be serviced and it can be serviced only by raising money to pay the interest.  The only way money can be raised to pay the interest is by taxation. When taxation has to be imposed, every person in this country, rich or poor, to a lesser or greater extent, has to contribute to the raising of that taxation.  It is for that reason that we in this House have a duty that may at times appear unnecessarily harsh, but one that has to be discharged, to be as careful as possible in relation to our scrutiny of the objects of State expenditure.  We in the Opposition can do that only by debates such as this and by ensuring that if there is evidence of ministerial default, it should be exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be failing in our duty if we did not do so.  To increase unnecessarily the added debt in this State is a very wrong thing.  It would mean that unnecessary expenditure would be indulged in obtaining for the Government of the day temporary and fleeting popularity, but leaving behind an obligation to be borne by rich and poor alike.  It is because we see this year a record figure for expenditure of £200 million and an accrued debt of £500 million that we question whether efficiency is being displayed in the running of the national finances.  It does not appear to us that in any phase of activity in the past six years, there has been any attempt at proper housekeeping on the part of the Government. Every single year, the demand in relation to expenditure has increased.  Every single year there has <Col N="946" /> been a substantial addition to the national debt.</P>
    <P>We do not hear now any statements such as those made by the Minister for Finance six years ago when he introduced his first Budget.  All that is gone.  Apparently the view of the Government is: &ldquo;What does it matter? The poor fools will pay anyway.&rdquo;  The idea seems to be to think of a number and put it in the Book of Estimates. But, at the same time, the people had better be careful.  There is to be a pause in pay demands and in income but there is not to be any pause in Government expenditure.  That adds up to inefficiency and we assert that the Government are not an efficient Government.  They have not displayed any evidence of efficiency and have been drifting along from record to record in relation to high expenditure without any clue as to where they are going.  The only thing certain is that expenditure is going up.</P>
    <P>That is only the second of the records we note this year.  There is another, equally disturbing.  At the end of this financial year, we had a record adverse balance of trade with other countries.  For the first time, we are £100 million &ldquo;in the red.&rdquo;  We have bought more than we have sold to that extent and we are &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; to that enormous degree.  We have had our ups and downs in trade as a nation over the past 40 years.  In 1956, the difficult year for this country, the balance of payments resulted in a problem but even then our adverse balance of trade had not reached the figure it reached this year.  That is a record we must comment on in this debate.  But are the Government concerned about it?  Not a bit.  Some of them do not even know of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dolan is wondering if I am talking about the balance of payments.  There is a record adverse trade balance of £100 million.  It seems somebody is not being very efficient.  It seems that somebody is holding down a Ministry who is not capable or, perhaps, the <Col N="947" /> situation is that nobody is giving any proper lead in the Government.  We had a great deal of bluster over the past 12 or 18 months about realism in the Government.  The Taoiseach, in succeeding his predecessor, was supposed to be a realist.  I wonder what we were supposed to imagine his predecessor was?</P>
      <P>The present Taoiseach has traded on the term &ldquo;realism&rdquo;.  He was introduced to the public some 18 months ago as the new Fianna Fáil Leader who would turn Fianna Fáil away from themselves.  Has he achieved anything except so much bluff and bluster?  I suggest that one thing he has not brought about and one thing that has been needed in recent years is leadership. I assert that one of our difficulties now is that there is no member of the Government, least of all the Taoiseach, who knows his own mind with any certainty from one day to another. We have had many examples since Deputy Lemass became Leader of the Government of the Government announcing a decision and then taking panic measures to deny the first announcement.  We have had not only a gap or a break outside Ireland in relation to Western Europe but this has certainly set our people at sixes and sevens.  If the Government do not know where they are going, one cannot expect the people to know where the Government are bringing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That situation in Government has had its sequel in a slipshod approach to national and State activities resulting, in the context of which I am speaking at the moment, in a record adverse trade balance.  If that were a designed and planned enterprise, one could understand it.  If it were designed and planned that we should run a deficit this year for a particular purpose, such as the importing of plant or machinery urgently required; if that were designed and controlled, it might be understandable but there has been no design or plan in this case.  It has just happened.  In fact, at the end of the year's trading, it is rather a surprise to the Government to know that we lost so much in the past year. <Col N="948" /> That shows that there is no leadership. A small country such as ours, in these times above all, cannot hope to survive unless there is intelligent leadership in Government.</P>
    <P>Our adverse trade balance is not the last of the records we celebrate this year.  We mark this year, if a figure recently disclosed in the British House of Commons of 67,000 new Irish applicants for insurance cards, is correct, a record in the number of our people emigrating in a five-year period. At the end of the past five-year period, we succeeded in exporting to Britain 250,000 Irish boys and girls since 1957.  That is a notable figure, the fourth record for the year.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Transport and Power would say they were a notable army working for us in England, part of our garrison abroad and a very important part it is because that money they have been sending back in remittances in the past 12 months has helped to prevent our adverse trade balance turning into a balance of payments problem.  It has helped to reduce the deficit but it is a very disturbing fact that after all the euphoria the Government have tried to create about boom and prosperity and &ldquo;never having had it so good&rdquo;, the plain fact is that a quarter of a million of our people had to pick up their bundles and go to seek jobs in England.  That is a record figure for continuous emigration over a five-year period.  It is certainly one of which no Government should be proud.  It is in those circumstances that we continue to examine the record of the Government.</P>
    <P>Their record has been notable in relation to the four matters I have mentioned; but there is a fifth.  As we learned today at Question Time, the total amount collected in local taxation in the financial year under review is £22½ million.  That, again, is the highest since this State was formed&mdash; a fifth record.  We have the highest figure for State expenditure; the highest figure for the national debt; the highest figure for an adverse trade balance; the highest figure for emigration and the highest figure for rates, which is to be collected by way of <Col N="949" /> local taxation from every ratepayer in the country.  No wonder there are cries of horror at this time of the year when the administrative machine goes into operation and the rate is struck. No wonder the ratepayer, who is also a taxpayer, looks with profound depression on the mechanism now being prepared, which will eventually translate itself into a half-yearly rate demand.</P>
    <P>Soaring rates, soaring taxation, soaring emigration, a deficit in our trade with other countries&mdash;these are the results of Fianna Fáil administration. There was a time when Fianna Fáil Ministers used to say, when reminded of their shortcomings: &ldquo;It is not our fault.  You left us in debt.&rdquo; There was indeed a reference reminiscent of that at Question Time today when the Minister for Local Government proceeded to excuse his appalling record of a couple of hundred houses in Dublin city by trying to suggest it was some sort of delayed reaction to the action of his predecessor over six years ago.  There can be no alibi now. This present Government are fully responsible for the state of Ireland today.  If it is good, they can take the credit; if it is bad, they take the responsibility.  They cannot shelter behind anybody's coat strings.  They cannot pass the buck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no passing the buck.  If we have those records this year, the responsibility is that of Fianna Fáil.  We have no means of knowing how the Minister for Finance proposes to face up to the question of raising the money to pay this enormous bill.  We are conscious of the fact that the taxpayer hears still ringing in his ears the assurance given by the Taoiseach in the general election in the autumn of 1961 that there would be no increase in taxation.  We know well that only a short time ago the people were asked to vote for Fianna Fáil on the assurance that a ceiling was being put to the load of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> We are told by the Taoiseach that there are going to be reforms in relation to the system of taxation.  We will have to wait and see what these reforms will be, conscious of the fact that this Dáil, the same as any other Dáil, is a House which assembles, sits for awhile and then passes away.  This House has been here for some 18 months.  I do not know if it will be here this time next year.  I do not know whether it will live its full term. But outside, watching us, and watching that Government, there are the people who exercise the ultimate power in this country&mdash;the electorate.  They are studying this Government by placing on one side their pledges and promises and, on the other, what they have achieved.  Bluster and big speeches cannot take the place of actual performance.</P>
    <P>We have had in the past 12 months an unreal situation where all attention was focussed on what was supposed to be the difficult and anxious negotiations in Brussels.  All of us were led to believe that Irish Ministers were having headaches by reason of the onerous duties, the bargaining and hard fighting they had to do in Brussels in relation to our expected entry into the Common Market.  If in the last 12 months somebody referred to the growing unemployment figures, he was told: &ldquo;Do not say a word about that. It will only embarrass the negotiations for our entry into Europe.&rdquo;  If a question critical of the Government arose in the past 12 months, we were told: &ldquo;Do not say a word.  The Belgians and the French will get to hear about it and we will not get in.&rdquo; All that is over now.  It transpires now we never had any negotiations. We were twirling our thumbs here when the Dutch and other countries were out-pointing us.</P>
    <P>The common Market has blown up and, in its process of blowing up, the air of unreality which it created has been swept aside.  We are now back on our own resources.  We cannot hope for any escapism in other lands and other pastures.  We are back relying on ourselves, sinn féin.  It is in that situation, in the beginning of the spring of 1963, with 67,000 unemployed, with 250,000 working in England, with the <Col N="951" /> balance of trade running against us, with repacious demands on behalf of the State in relation to expenditure, with soaring rates&mdash;in a situation of that kind, we of the Opposition ask: &ldquo;Quo vadis?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note Deputy O'Higgins has paid the Fianna Fáil Party the tribute that, when in power, they accept responsibility.  I can recall two Coalition Governments in power here made up of a number of Parties, each of which attempted to take credit for what was good and to throw the blame on the other for what was unpopular.  So far as this Government are concerned, we take responsibility.</P>
      <P>The increase in the Estimates this year is large.  Some of this is due to increases for those with a claim on the public purse, such as public servants. Some of it is due to a greater outlay on services which are more or less the barometer of our standard of living, such as social welfare and health services.  But a large part of it is being used to stimulate higher production, to expand national income and, by so doing, give a better standard of living to all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first came into this House, I was intrigued by members of the Opposition advocating day after day more and more expenditure on practically every facet of government, and then coming in at this time of year, on the Vote on Account, and holding up their hands in horror because of what they claimed to be the size of the bill produced by the Minister for Finance.  I might add that I am no longer surprised at this attitude on the part of the Opposition. It is something that we on this side of the House have come to expect from them, an irresponsible attitude.  One has only to make a brief study of the various motions by Opposition Parties appearing on the Order Paper during the year, advocating very considerable increases in expenditure; one has only to look at the questions by Opposition members that appear on the Order Paper, many of them implying increased expenditure, to visualise the <Col N="952" /> enormous increase that there would be in the present Book of Estimates if the Opposition had their way.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a number of Opposition Deputies expressing the utmost concern at the size of the bill who a short time ago were advocating increases in expenditure in every Department of State.  We on this side of the House are anxious to try to keep expenditure within limits.  We have to steer a course between the enormous demands made on the Government for better and bigger services and the capacity of our people to pay for them.  It should be noted that a very considerable proportion of the increase in the Book of Estimates is going to agriculture.  It is recognised by every Party that agriculture is our basic industry and that our economy is entirely dependent on agriculture, on our agricultural exports and on exports of goods which have agricultural products as their raw material. The fact that we are giving this extra money to agriculture does not mean that we are depriving any other section of the community of money because our other industries are to a large extent dependent on agricultural exports.  If it were not for our agricultural exports many of our industries which are dependent on raw materials from other countries would be unable to get these raw materials and we would have considerable unemployment. Therefore any expenditure on agriculture is going to react favourably on all other types of employment here.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I find it difficult to see where there can be any objection to utilising more money to stimulate this industry.  It is well to note that except in one instance all the increases under the heading of agriculture are going towards increased and more efficient production and better marketing.  It will be agreed that success in these particular aspects of agriculture are fundamental if we are to improve the standard of living of our people.  Some part of this money is going to improve farm advisory services which is something in which I have always believed.  I have always advocated that we should improve our advisory services to the greatest possible <Col N="953" /> extent within the limits of our capacity to pay for them.  I am personally glad to note the increase for this particular service.  There is also very much more money being allocated for the lime and fertiliser subsidies. This, also, is something for which we should be particularly glad. It is a very good sign that the Government find it necessary to increase the amount being allocated for these subsidies because it shows that the farmers are making more and more use of these commodities.  This is something which everybody in this House has been advocating over the years.  The largest increase being made available under this heading is for the marketing of dairy produce.  This again is of the utmost importance. There is no need for me to go into details, that can be done on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>During the year, we have been concerning ourselves with the development of industry and the possible adverse effects on industry of our entry into the Common Market.  We have not yet been successful in our efforts to become members of the Common Market but nevertheless the same conditions apply because of the fact, as the Taoiseach stated, we will continue to lower our tariff barriers.  We were all agreed during the year that it was essential that grants should be paid to our native industrialists to help them re-equip their factories in order to be able to compete under free trade conditions.  We were also agreed that money should be made available to re-train workers to become more skilled in their work and also to re-train them so that in cases of redundancy, they could take up another type of employment in the same industry.  We were also agreed that it was necessary to provide more money to attract foreign industrialists to set up industries here.  So far as I can remember no voice was raised against the Minister's proposals when he brought in legislation with regard to this matter except perhaps by some Opposition Members who thought that the Minister was not going far enough.  Now when it comes to making the money available to put these <Col N="954" /> proposals into effect, we find the Opposition complaining of the cost. Surely the position is that these changes were necessary, if we were to be able to compete in a free trade. Nobody suggested at any time that they were not necessary.  Now we must pay for them.  As usual, of course, the Opposition want to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The Government have been following an industrial policy for the past five years which has increased the national industrial output by 41 per cent. and has put 20,000 more people into industrial employment than were employed in industry five years ago. I feel that the people are well satisfied with the results achieved from the money expended over the years on improving and developing industry and in providing these extra jobs and output.  I have no doubt they will also be in favour of providing this extra money provided for in the Book of Estimates.  It is agreed, of course, that it is essential to watch taxation and the effect of taxation on the economy generally and on the individual, but on the other hand we should also remember that it is part of the Government's duty to provide the incentives for increased production and increased employment.  That is exactly what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial output, Deputy Sweetman suggested that we were falling behind the European countries.  The actual position is that while our output in 1960 and 1961 was higher than in 1962 nevertheless our output today is as good as the output in practically all the countries in Western Europe.  I will quote now from the <i>Irish Times</i> of yesterday, March 6th; this will be a less biased account, I think, than that of Deputy Sweetman.  It is stated here that the &ldquo;growth in industrial output is most encouraging in spite of the handicap caused by Britain's stagnant economy last year.  The rate is now in line with that of the principal European countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to complain of the high cost of government but, when we come down to trying to see where we can make reductions, we find ourselves <Col N="955" /> up against the main difficulty.  I have noted in the speeches of Opposition Deputies since this debate on the Vote on Account began that at no time have they made any attempt to suggest where a reduction could be made in the Estimates.  I could deal with this under many headings, but there is one matter that has been brought forcibly to my notice to-day which may illustrate the position.  I have here a cutting from to-day's <i>Drogheda Independent</i>.  There is a heading &ldquo;New Industries Starting Soon in Drogheda&rdquo; and underneath that heading, there is an account of three different industries which are expected to start very shortly in Drogheda.  That, by the way, might be a line to the Opposition to show what we are doing regarding new industry and could be taken in the context of the discussion at Question Time to-day about what the Government are doing to provide employment for our people.  Now, I have no doubt that certain people in my constituency will complain about the high cost of Government expenditure to-day.  I should like to ask those people who complain whether they would be willing to have the grants from State funds paid to these industries to come to Drogheda taken away, thereby reducing the Book of Estimates and also, of course, reducing prospects of employment in Drogheda. If that is their suggestion, then they should say so publicly, and not simply refer to the high cost of government.  I should like to say in reply to them that they should bear in mind, when speaking of the weight of taxation, that the difficulties caused to employed people by taxation are nothing as compared with the difficulties facing the unemployed man, particularly if he is an unemployed man with a family, and, so long as I am a member of this House and so long as I can influence industrial policy in any way, I shall advocate more and more spending, spending to the very limit of our capacity, on industrial expansion. I shall advocate providing more money for our national industrial enterprises to increase efficiency and provide more employment, more money to private enterprise so that we will give an <Col N="956" /> opportunity to our industrialists to re-equip their factories and improve their efficiency, again with a view to employing more people, more money to be devoted towards encouraging foreign industrialists to come in here until such time as we have full employment. I do not think anyone can have any objection to the amount being made available for these purposes in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins mentioned the levies.  I did not think they were something he would mention, but he tied them to Jaguar cars and said something about Fianna Fáil sympathy for owners of Jaguar cars.  I do not think I have ever seen a Jaguar.  I do not think there are many in my constituency who have them.  What I remember chiefly about the levies is the fact that in my constituency&mdash;it is highly industrialised&mdash;the levies almost closed down the factories there.  From one end of the country to the other, week after week, there were reports in the local papers of considerable numbers being knocked out of employment. I have in mind particularly an industry in my own parish which employed about 250; week after week tens and twenties were knocked off. To-day that factory employs 900.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also mentioned national loans and suggested that this Party had been opposed to the loan floated by the Coalition Government. There is nothing I need say in reply to that except to state that Deputy de Valera, as he then was, the Leader of the Opposition, supported the loan here and advised the people to support it.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the cost of servicing the national debt.  Here I could not follow his reasoning.  He suggested the cost had to be paid by every taxpayer. Surely part of this national debt is due to the Coalition.  No one on either side of this House opposes national loans provided they are used for <Col N="957" /> capital purposes and I cannot see why any Deputy should come in here and try to make something out of the fact that the interest on these loans would have to be met from taxation. I cannot understand his reasoning. Neither can I grasp what he intended to imply.</P>
      <P>Various groups under the heading of Social Welfare received increases during 1962.  These increases are responsible to a considerable extent for the increase in the Estimate in that particular respect.  I cannot believe that anybody would have any objection to increases to people who are dependent on social welfare.  Of course, judging by the miserly increases given by both Coalition Governments during their terms of office, it is quite possible that certain ultraconservatives in the Opposition might deep down in their hearts have a decided objection to social welfare. Apart from that, I do not believe anyone in this House would object to increasing the amount made available for recipients of social welfare. So far as we are concerned, we have always believed it right that we should allocate to those who are dependent on social welfare the largest possible amount of the national income.  Not only have we advocated that but we have acted on our belief and, during our various terms in office, we have increased very considerably the money made available to these people.  That is only as it should be.  I need not go further because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Malley, went very deeply into it last night.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of Defence, £273,000 has been allocated for the purchase of helicopters.  Almost everyone has advocated the purchase of helicopters.  The reasons why were stated and, in general, the House agreed with the reasons put forward. Provision is now made for buying them.  Again, the Opposition do not appear to be too anxious to want to pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of employment. What always interests me in connection with this question of employment is <Col N="958" /> that, whenever an Opposition Deputy stands up here to talk about the employment position during their term in office, and compares it with ours, he invariably starts with the year 1955.  I cannot understand why the Opposition should take the year 1955 because that was neither a year in which they came into office nor was it a year in which they went out of office.  When I say I cannot understand it, I know what the political reasons for it are.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote what the actual position was.  The Coalition were in office from early 1954 to early 1957. In early 1954, the total employment was 1,185,000, and in early 1957, it was 1,136,000, which was, during these three years, a fall of 49,000.  Between 1958 and 1961, the latest figures available show that employment fell by 3,000.  That was during our term of office.  This fall was very much lower but we are not happy that there was a fall of any description.  We recognise, however, that in keeping with other countries in Europe, we had a fall in the number employed in agriculture and we are hopeful that the figures this year will show that this fall has been arrested.</P>
    <P>As most of the other points I had in mind to raise here have been dealt with by other Deputies, I do not think it is necessary for me to pursue them.  The only thing I would say is that while the Estimates are high, the bulk of the money being made available is designed to improve the economy, to increase production and to improve marketing and, in the long run, to improve the standard of living of our people.  For that reason, it is difficult to see where the Opposition find objection to the various increases that are to be found in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies who have spoken, Deputy Faulkner could not refrain from reverting to the situation which existed and which was dealt with competently by this Government in relation to the crisis which occurred in 1956.  May I deal with it in the space of half a minute by quoting for the Deputy the words of his Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass.  The reference is <Col N="959" /> Column 1150, Volume 161, of the Official Report of 14th May, 1957:</P>
      <P>I do not intend to criticise the previous Government for the action it took in relation to the balance of payment difficulties that arose last year.  We have had our debates upon that in the past and it was the subject of much discussion during the course of the election campaign which brought this Dáil into being. Nobody denies that a problem has arisen there which was critical for the country and one with which the Government in office had to deal.</P>
      <P>  This is the sentence I want to emphasise:</P>
      <P>It was dealt with by the Government of the day.  I did not think they were dealing with it in the right way but we certainly recognised their obligation to do something about it...</P>
      <P>  It would be well if that sentence were firmly and strongly planted in the mind of the Deputy:</P>
      <P>...we certainly recognised their obligation to do something about it and as a result of the measures they took that balance of payments problem was solved for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  That disposes of all the arguments and all the red herrings produced by those who must hark back to the terrible levies.  Of course they did not advert to the fact that, having used that very effectively in the election campaign and having secured office in consequence, their new Minister for Finance turned those levies into permanent taxes for the first time.  If those levies were so detrimental to the well-being of the people employed in industry, why should an incoming Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance avail of them as a revenue-producing medium as he did in his time, in complete contradiction of all the criticism offered at the time the levies were initiated?  It was clearly and emphatically stated by the Minister for Finance at the time, Deputy Sweetman, that as far as he was concerned and as far as his <Col N="960" /> Government were concerned&mdash;and I am quite clear on this even without reference to notes&mdash;they were in every sense temporary measures applied to do a particular corrective job in relation to the balance of payments and for no other purpose and furthermore &mdash;and this can stand up to the scrutiny of anyone who cares to investigate it&mdash;that no single penny which accrued from these levies was to be applied to the relief of a budgetary situation in relation to current expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet Deputies have the nerve to stand up and capitalise on the situation that was not of that Government's making.  This Government cannot point to any external pressures as an excuse for their failure. They must accept full responsibility for the present situation.  What has occurred in any part of the world that has any impact on the terms of trade affecting us?  It could not be the situation in Brunei; it could not be what is happening in South America. There were difficulties in those years to which I have referred and we know what caused them.  There was the Suez crisis, petrol rationing, a reduction of £1 million in the estimated income on petrol, a drop of £1 million in revenue from tobacco as a result of the cancer scare.  Then there was the situation caused by the dumping of Argentinian meat in Britain resulting in a serious drop in the value of our exports to Britain.  All these things occurred in the space of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took action, as the Taoiseach said.  In consequence of the campaign that he and his Party conducted in relation to the levies, he came into office and the first thing he did was to thump his breast and say: &ldquo;<i>Mea culpa</i>.  I have got into office.  I admit that the Government took the necessary action to deal with the balance of payments situation.&rdquo;  Now at the end of six years, there is a record imbalance of trade and a record figure in the Book of Estimates.  However, <Col N="961" /> comparing the figure presented in the Book of Estimates this year with the figure in the Book of Estimates five or six years ago is just not possible because in the interim various Ministers have made their contribution to easing the situation by transferring a whole litany of efforts that were successful in relieving the pressure on the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  There was the increased cost of the stamp.  There was the effort of the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to the bus and rail charges and the increased cost of transporting goods by rail or by any means of public transport.  All these increases have occurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was also £9 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £9 million for <Col N="962" /> the food subsidies and deducting the little increases that were given in social welfare benefits, it was still a saving of £6½ million to the Exchequer.  We were told at the time, as the House will recall clearly, that this was being done to relieve the taxpayer of having to find money to keep down the cost of essential commodities.  We can recall and we can prove that we warned the Government that their action in abolishing food subsidies would result in sections of the people who were in a position to demand increases through negotiation securing these increases to compensate for the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
