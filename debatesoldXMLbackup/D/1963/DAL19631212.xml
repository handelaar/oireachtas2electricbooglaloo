      <P>Nuair a cuireadh an Dáil ar ath-ló aréir, bhí mé ag cur síos ar an laghdú ar líon na scoláire ins na bun-scoileanna i láthair na <Col N="1184" /> huaire.  Dubhairt mé go raibh cúis amháin leis sin, an méadú mór atá ar líon na scoláire atá ag freastal ar na meán-scoileanna agus ar na ceard-scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Is breágh liom a fheiscint gur tugadh méadú breis agus míle scoláireacht dó siúd a bhíonn ar intinn dul isteach ins na meánscoileanna. Dubhairt an Teachta Ó Domhnaill go mba cheart na scoláireachtaí sin do roinnt de réir uimhir na múinteoirí ins na bun-scoileanna, cuir i gcás, roinnt scoláireachtaí do chur ar fáil do na scoileanna ina bhfuil múinteoir nó beirt; roinnt eile dóibh siúd in a bhfuil triúr múinteoirí agus an fuílleach do na scoileanna móra. Dubhairt sé go raibh scéim mar sin acu i nDún na nGall.  Tá an scéim chéanna dhá h-oibriú fé Chomhairle Contae an Chláir agus chomh fada agus is eol domhsa in áiteacha eile chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Do mhol an Teachta Ó Domhnaill don Aire breis tuarastal do thabhairt do na múinteoirí atá ag múineadh ins na hoileáin mor-thimpeall chósta na hÉireann.  Dubhairt an tAire go raibh £60 breise in aghaidh na bliana le fáil acu cheana féin.  Dubhairt an Teachta nár leor £60, go mba cheart dhá incriméid bhreise do thabhairt dóibh. Chomh fada agus is eol domhsa is ionann incriméad agus £19 in aghaidh na bliana.  Dá nglacadh an tAire comhairle an Teachta do chaillfeadh na múinteoirí bochta sin £22 in aghaidh na bliana.  B'fhéidir, ámh, gurb é rud a bhí i gceist aige ná 2/60 nó £150 breise in aghaidh na bliana a thabhairt dóibh.  Más ní é go raibh sin i gceist aige bhéinn ar aon aigne leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dob íonad leis an Teachta Tadhg Ó Loingsigh gur cuireadh scoil ar bun i gCill Ronáin ar Oilean Árainn, d'fhonn ceárd na hiascaireachta do mhúineadh do dhaoine óga.  Shíl sé go mba cheart a leithéid do chur ar bun ar chósta Phortláirge.  Rinne sé tagairt do na bilí móra iasc a thaithíonn an cósta sin agus go raibh iascairí ag teacht ó gach críoch san Eoraip fiú amháin, mar adubhairt sé féin &ldquo;from behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo;.  Ní dóigh liom gur cáll don Roinn Oideachais iarracht a dhéanamh ar theagasc ar a gcuid oibre a thabhairt do na <Col N="1185" /> hiascairí bradacha a thigeas chun creach do thógaint ar chósta Phortláirge agus táim cinnte ná glacfadh na daoine atá taobh thiar den Cuirtín Iarainn teagasc ó Ghael ar bith.</P>
    <P>Cad é an locht atáaige sin nó ag éinne eile sa Teach seo ar Oileán Árainn?  Bhí scoil, léinn agus creideamh san Oileán sin sul ar leag Sasanach cos ar thalamh na hÉireann riamh.  Bíonn gach tosnú lag agus, dar ndó, níl áit is oiriúnaí le tosnú a dhéanamh ar theagasc den tsaghas sin ná ar oileán in Iarthar na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar na Teachtaí ar gach taobh den Teach seo éirí as an gcáineadh agus an imdheargadh a thugann siad do Ghaeilge oifigiúil agus do Ghaeilge éigeantach.  Cuimhnidís ar chuspóirí an Phiarsaigh, an Dáibhisigh agus na laochraí eile go gcoimhéadtar a gcuimhne tré leachtanna sa Teach seo.  Gach aon uair a leagfaidh siad rosc ar cheann de na leachtanna sin cuimhnidis gur fhuiling daoine crólínte an bháis chun an Parlaimint seo do chur ar bun.  Ná ceapadh éinne gurab é a bhí uathu ná Teach eile nó macsamhail de Pharlaimint Shasana do bheith anso againn.  Iarraim go muiníneach orthu focal molta do thabhairt do gach neach atá ag iarraidh ár dteanga uasal ad'aithbheochain agus maran rún leo an focal molta do thabhairt iarraim orthu fanúint ina dtost.</P>
    <P>Do thug mérosc dóibh sa Teach seo anuraidh agus b'fhéidir nár mhiste dhom é do thabhairt dóibh arís.  Seo é:</P>
    <P>Feasta ní foláir gurab é Éire na nGaedheal</P>
    <P>Meirg gach Éireannach sa tír</P>
    <P>Feasta ní foláir dúinn freagairt go soiléir cé acu taobh dínn an le hÉirinn nó le Seán Buí</P>
    <P>Feasta ná bactar le Tadhg an Dá Thaobh</P>
    <P>Scuabtar an scraiste as ár slí</P>
    <P>Mar an té ná beidh linn ní dual gur dínn é</P>
    <P>Pé acu Gaedheal nó Gall-Ghaedheal nó coigríoch.</P>
    <P>Thairg an Teachta giota eile páipéir chuige agus léigh sé sliocht as leabhar gorm na mBreathnach.  Seo é an sliocht: &ldquo;A language cannot be imposed <Col N="1186" /> on a people.  It must be embraced voluntarily.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ní h-éidir go bhfuil dearmad déanta aige ar an gcaoi a dingeadh isteach an Béarla i gcluasa leanaí beaga óga na hÉireann nuair do cuireadh an córas oideachais ar bun sa tír ar a dtugadh an córas oideachais &ldquo;náisiúnta&rdquo;.  Do cosgadh ar na leanaí óga ná raibh oiread agus focal Béarla acu focal Gaeilge do labhairt.  Do cuireadh gaibín le téad faoi mhuinéal gach duine acu agus gach aon uair a chloistí focal Gaeilge uathu dheineadh an múinteoir scian a tharraingt as a phóca agus do cuireadh sé scór faoin gaibín.  Deintí an rud céanna ag baile agus gheibheadh gach leanbh cúpla leidhb den tslait thar cheann gach scóir a bhí faoin ghaibín.</P>
    <P>Is mar sin a cuireadh Béarla éigeantach i bhfeidhm ar na leanaí agus d'fhonn é a dhéanamh go críochnúil cuireadh rann ar an gcéad leathnach de gach téacsleabhar a bhí sna scoileanna náisiúnta nó faoin &ldquo;murder machine&rdquo; mar a thug an Piarsach air. Do thug mé an rann sin díobh breis agus trí bliana ó shoin.  Ní h-aon díobháil é do thabhairt díobh athuair. Seo é:</P>
    <P>I thank the goodness and the grace that on my youth had smiled</P>
    <P>To make me in my early days a happy English child.</P>
    <P>Ná déarfadh éinne nach raibh fios a ngnóthaí ag na Sasanaigh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of complacency about social conditions in this country and that applies to the problem of education. We conveniently forget that less than one-quarter of our children between the ages of 12 and 18 go to secondary school.  We conveniently forget that just about one-third of our children between the ages of 12 and 18 get secondary and vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that post-primary education in this country is totally and deplorably inadequate and the steps taken to improve it have been stumbling and inadequate.  We now find ourselves, 40 years after becoming a free State, in a condition where our educational system is largely based on class considerations.  It is true today that the <Col N="1187" /> educational opportunities for our children are largely reserved for the children of parents who are able to pay for them.  That is a situation of which we should not be proud.  It is a situation calling for urgent and immediate reform.</P>
    <P>Until we have a system of education open to all, irrespective of means, we cannot say we have proper social justice.  We are not doing enough to provide education for our children. The steps we have taken have been mild palliatives when urgent reform is needed.  We are told from time to time when these matters are discussed in the Dáil that there have been increases here and there in the number of scholarships given.  These figures are mere palliatives to ease the conscience of persons who should be more concerned with the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is desirable, of course, that scholarships should be increased, and vastly increased, but we still have only one-quarter of our children going to secondary schools and only one-third going to secondary and vocational schools.  It is quite obvious that the assistance which the State gives to education will have to be vastly increased.</P>
    <P>It is worth while looking at the way in which the Northern Ireland Government treat their educational problem. Figures for 1960-61 show that in this country public expenditure on all scholarships, secondary and university, amounted to £171,000.  In Northern Ireland, the figure was over £2,100,000. Perhaps we have improved, relatively speaking, since 1961.  However, the figures show that the public authorities in Northern Ireland are spending many times more money on scholarships and on education generally than this country, even in absolute figures which show that, <i>per capita,</i> the Northern Ireland authorities are spending much more than we are.</P>
    <P>The average public expenditure for full-time university students in Northern Ireland was £272.2 per university student; here, it was £91.  It is obvious that the amount of financial assistance we are giving in this country <Col N="1188" /> not only to primary but to post-primary education is entirely inadequate.  It is correct that there has been an increase in recent years in the enrolment of pupils at secondary schools.  This increase is to be welcomed but it is entirely inadequate and the steps taken by the State to assist the growth in post-primary education are also inadequate.</P>
    <P>One matter which could dramatically change the whole pattern of our post-primary education is the giving of grants for the building and improvement of secondary schools.  There seems to be an objection in principle to the giving of grants for the building of secondary schools.  Frankly, I do not understand the objection.  It is not put forward on financial grounds.  It has not been suggested that the country could not afford to give grants towards the building of secondary schools.  The grounds put forward have been quoted in an article by Mr. McElligott, an experienced and thoughtful writer on educational problems, in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 4th March, 1963, in which he quoted the Secretary of the Department as saying:</P>
    <P>Unlike national and vocational schools, secondary schools are entirely independent private institutions, many of which were flourishing long before the State took cognisance of them and all of which have the right to sever at any moment their connection with the State.  This right of severance, which the State could not permit in the case of national and vocational schools, for there it has shared directly in the cost of erection, is at once a cause and a result of there being no State grants towards the building of secondary schools.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a principle enshrined in these statements that for one reason or another the provision of grants for the building of secondary schools would impinge on the independence of the schools concerned.  I do not understand and I do not accept that argument.  Are the universities in any way affected by the fact that they take State grants?  Are the national schools less independent because they <Col N="1189" /> obtain State grants towards building and repair costs?  We have here a system of denominational education. It is not going to interfere with that system or with the independence of the secondary schools if grants are provided towards their building.  I should be glad to know whether this principle is still operating in the minds of the Minister and the Government and whether it is proposed to discontinue the application of this principle.  If we are serious about the development of our secondary schools and the development of secondary education, the State must give increased grants towards the building and repair of the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Like many of these principles that seem to become sacred cows, in the course of time inroads have been made on this one.  Already we give grants towards the building of secondary schools in the Gaeltacht areas.  Why not in the city of Dublin?  Why not in other parts of the country where they are so badly needed?  Why does this principle not apply in Donegal and why does it apply in Dublin?  It seems to me that we are failing in our duties and responsibilities if this matter is not discussed and if we do not reach a proper conclusion as to the manner in which the State is to best help secondary education.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he would be glad if there was further development in post-primary education.  It is one thing to use pious words and another thing to put them into effect. It would be a comparatively simple matter dramatically to improve our post-primary education if this principle were put aside and if we accepted the real obligation of the State to provide grants towards the building and repair of secondary schools.  What I have been saying is not to be taken as seeking to interfere with the independence of the secondary schools or in any way to criticise the work, the heroic work, being done by the religious organisations. I should be very surprised if there was not a large degree of agreement with the view that the burden placed on the religious societies in the building and repairing of secondary schools has now become too great and <Col N="1190" /> if the need to assist them in this work is not generally accepted.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a need also to improve the facilities in our primary schools.  Here again there is a tremendous amount of complacency about the position at the present time.  I was talking recently to a social worker who had to visit schools throughout the country and who did visit a great number of them.  Her reports, which must be available to the Minister, indicate the appalling conditions in a great number of our schools.  In some of them, there is no electric light; in some of them there are rats running around which this social worker saw. In some, the children are sitting on the floor because there are not enough rooms for them and in a great many of them the classes are vastly too large and the teachers are required to carry a burden which is not fair to them and not fair to the children.  One of the social revolutions we have to bring about in this country is a revolution in our educational system.  Until we face up to this matter, we cannot say that we have a proper system of social justice here.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate in previous years, I have raised a problem concerning education in which, I am glad to say, there has been an increasing amount of interest in recent years, that is, the problem of our mentally handicapped children.  The amount of State assistance given towards dealing with this problem is pitiably inadequate.  There are a number of voluntary organisations who have established day centres in the city for these children and who are now trying to establish residential centres for them.  I should like to say that these organisations have got nothing but the utmost co-operation and assistance from the Minister and his Department but it seems to me that we must go a deal further.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary fact has been established in the past few years that the establishment of day centres is not a very expensive matter.  It can be done at a comparatively small cost.  The amount of good that can be done, and the return for a comparatively small amount of money is out of all proportion to the money that has to be <Col N="1191" /> put into it.  A few thousand pounds a year will finance a day centre in this city.  The problem is different in country areas because of the dispersed population and the difficulties of transport. The answer seems to be that there should be in rural areas five-day residential centres for the children who would be able to return to their parents for the weekend.  This involves the necessity of providing transport because, just as in the city areas, transport is vitally necessary for the proper working of these centres.</P>
    <P>I should like to make this suggestion to the Minister.  There is a Commission sitting at the moment composed of men of great experience and knowledge in this field, but the fact that this Commission is sitting to deal with the problem should not be used as an excuse for doing nothing.  Undoubtedly the results of this Commission and its report will have an important bearing on the future pattern in the care and treatment of the mentally handicapped, but in the meantime, it would be of considerable assistance if the Minister adopted this simple expedient.  The voluntary organisations that have been established and have started day centres or residential five-day centres, have all had lengthy negotiations with the local authorities, the Department of Health, the Health Authority and the Department of Education and, as I said, as far as I am aware in all instances, a great deal of co-operation and understanding has been forthcoming. A great deal of time, however, is wasted in negotiations and discussions and in inter-Departmental talks and all the time the shadow of the Department of Finance is hanging over the discussions and literally it is years before a decision can be taken whether an association will get £1 or £1 2s. 6d. a week per child per bus.</P>
    <P>It would be a simple matter if this could be rationalised.  It could be done in a month.  If the Minister made a statement and said: &ldquo;Here I have available the following moneys for voluntary organisations which start day centres or residential centres.  The health authority will give them so much <Col N="1192" /> per week per child and we will pay the salaries of national teachers and so much for the cost of transport and so much for school meals.&rdquo;  It would be a simple matter to draw up a short memorandum indicating what help is available to the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now from experience because at this very moment voluntary organisations are starting in Tipperary, Donegal and Wexford, all of whom want to know what assistance they can get and all of whom have local authorities, a health authority and the Department to deal with.  It would be a simple matter for the Minister to inform them: &ldquo;This is our policy; this is the help we will give you.&rdquo;  That of course will only be a stopgap measure. But we are dealing with the lives of children and their future and if you allow two or three years to pass without doing anything, that will be two or three years lost, perhaps irrevocably lost for children suffering from mental handicap who could, as experience has shown, benefit greatly if assistance were available.</P>
    <P>This of course is a national problem and has to be tackled on a national level.  It is only in comparatively recent years that we have taken any steps to deal with the problem of our mentally handicapped children.  Now of course it is becoming obvious that if you do provide special day centres and special residential schools for mentally-handicapped children, as soon as they leave school, you immediately have a new problem on your hands.  The answer is not to put these children, as does happen, into the public wards of our mental hospitals where within a few months they can disimprove and irrevocably lose the benefit of years of schooling.  The answer is now generally regarded as lying in the provision of sheltered workshops where many of these children, after getting the benefit of disciplined teaching and so on, can lead useful lives and develop their lives to the fullest extent to which they can develop.  They are also able to become useful members of the community.  It is a sad and a tragic thing to see the training these children have received being wasted within a couple of <Col N="1193" /> months because there is no suitable employment for them.</P>
    <P>We are in the infancy of development in this field.  We are only now starting to deal with the provision of adequate assistance for our mentally handicapped but it must be realised that this is a different problem from mental illness.  The mentally handicapped person is a different type of case from the mentally ill person.  As I said, this must be treated on a national scale.  I should like to envisage a national service for the mentally handicapped child by which he or she will, from the early years, be adequately assessed and have adequate facilities in day centres or residential schools, and then have the benefit of assessment through the school years, adequate advice for the parents and a sheltered workshop in which the child can lead a useful and full life.</P>
    <P>That is not a chimera, something that is unobtainable.  It is an ordinary fact that must be emphasised over and over again that dealing with moderately handicapped children the expense is not very great.  The numbers of the moderately handicapped would not create such a vast financial burden on the State that we could not carry it.  There is of course a different problem between the moderately handicapped and the mildly handicapped. So far we have done little or nothing for the mildly handicapped.  Teachers and school managers, social workers and anyone with any knowledge of education, are all familiar with the problem of the two or three dull, backward children in every class, with whom the teachers can do nothing because of their responsibility to the other children, who are left at the back of the class to while away the years without getting any proper training and who very frequently suffer from serious psychological strain as a result of the inferior position in which they find themselves.  We will have to try to set up special classes in our school system so that the mildly handicapped can get proper help and assistance from qualified teachers.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to a matter which is discussed every year on this <Col N="1194" /> Estimate, namely, the problem of the Irish language.  In discussing this, it must be clear what we are discussing. We are not discussing the merits of the revival of the Irish language; we are discussing the methods for reviving the Irish language.  It seems to me to be an intellectual weakness on the part of those who oppose us when we say that the methods have failed, to try to attack us by saying we are opposed to the Irish language and by saying we are Sassanach, that we are in fact anti-Irish. That is an emotional reaction, an intellectual weakness.  The debate should take place on this level: have the methods in our schools to revive the Irish language been successful?  It is my view that there is only one answer to that question, that is, that they have not, that it is patently obvious the methods which have been used to attempt to revive the Irish language have failed.</P>
    <P>If the supporters of the present methods put forward arguments on this level, an interesting, useful and fruitful debate could be held.  The unfortunate thing is that the debate does not take place on that level.  It is immediately shifted to a debate on an emotional level.  What we want to discuss here is whether we think the methods being used for the past 40 years in our schools have been successful. I say categorically they have not, and I want to change them, to improve them.  The fact is very frequently forgotten that our present method of reviving the Irish language is, in fact, again a piece of class legislation because it is the poor children who are affected adversely by it &mdash; the poor children who go to school up to the age of 14, who do not get the benefit of secondary education, who have, for so much of their schooling hours, to learn a language and be taught a language which they never use again and which their parents, in many instances, do not wish them to learn. It is the poor children who are affected by the present system.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the person with means who can send his child to a secondary school and then, perhaps, on to university, because he will learn the Irish language but he will also <Col N="1195" /> learn a great deal more; he will have the benefit of secondary education up to the age of 18 and, perhaps, university education after that.  The young child, however, who leaves school at 14, will have spent a great deal of his time, valuable time to him when he should be learning and trying to get the benefit of the knowledge passed on to him by his teachers, learning the Irish language, which he will not use subsequently.  It is this method we must change.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a problem of social justice involved in our present methods.  I believe that we are failing in social justice adequately to look after our children by imposing on them the present system in our national schools.  There is in all this a basic conflict which we have not faced up to; there is a basic conflict between the need for giving the best education to our children, on the one hand, and reviving the Irish language by the present methods, on the other.  If we retain the present methods, then we are not giving our children the best education. If we want to give them the best education we can, then we will change these methods.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt in my own mind where our duty lies.  I have no doubt that it is our duty as a sovereign legislature to see that our children get the best possible education and that we are not deflected from that by emotional considerations.  Of course, teach our children the Irish language, but teach them to love it, teach them to respect it; do not force it on them so that it becomes a drudgery, so that their parents hate it, because that is what is happening in a great many instances.</P>
    <P>I know the sort of reaction there will be to these remarks.  It will be said that I am unpatriotic, that the Irish people love the Irish language. You cannot argue on an emotional plane.  You can make these statements, but there is no dialectic, there is no argument.  All I am saying is what I believe to be demonstrably true.  We have not devised a proper method of reviving the Irish language &mdash;if we had, we should all be speaking <Col N="1196" /> it now&mdash;and, because of the present methods we are using, a great number of our children are suffering, and they are not being taught to love their national language.</P>
    <P>I should like a great deal more discussion on our educational problems. A great deal of work is being done to try to improve our educational facilities and to try to educate public opinion on the need for improving them.  Such organisations as the Federation of Secondary Schools, who have not been treated with a light hand by the Minister and his Department, are, I think, just the type of organisations which should receive our support and our thanks.  There are a number of people who write regularly and speak regularly on these problems. There are teachers' organisations which are forever pointing out the necessity for reform.  All these efforts will, it is hoped, bear fruit in time. Until we get this sense of urgency, until we come to realise in this House, and in the political Parties which constitute this House, that there is need for a social revolution, until we reach that stage we will, I believe, be merely tinkering with the problem.  It is time we stopped tinkering and brought about true conditions of social justice here.</P>

Tá athrú meoin ag teacht ar an bpobal anois faoin aicíd seo.  Tuigeann <Col N="1197" /> an pobal gur ceart cabhrú leis na páistí seo, gur ceart pé oideachas is féidir a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá dualgas orainn sa Teach seo an dearcadh úr seo a neartú i dtreo is go dtuigfidh gach duine sa tír caidé atá i gceist agus go dtiocfaidh fonn níos mó orthu lámh chuidithe a thabhairt san obair.</P>
    <P>Labhair mé cheana sa Dáil faoin méid oibre atá á dhéanamh sa Dáilcheantair 's agamsa ar son na bpáistí seo.  Tá ospidéal i nDrom Carad fé stiúiriú Bráthar Eoin le Dia agus is mór ar fad an obair atá á déanamh acu siúd.  Tá scoileanna i nDúndealgan agus i nDroichead Átha do na páistí seo amháin agus támuid buíoch don Aire siocar is go bhfuil sé ag díol as na múinteoirí ins na scoileanna seo agus gur chuir sé airgead ar fáil leis na páistí atá ina gcónaí i bhfad ón scoil a thabhairt go dtí an scoil gach lá. Tá Coimisiún ina shuí fé láthair ag scrúdú na ceiste seo agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh toradh as a rachaidh chun tairbhe na bpáistí seo, ach is maith liom a rá anois, agus tá sé le tuiscint ón méid atá ráite agam, nach bhfuil sé fíor le rá nach bhfuil a dhath á dhéanamh fé láthair do na páistí seo ná go bhfuil an Rialtas ag fanacht le toradh an Choimisiúin le cabhair a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé den bharúil go mba cheart oiliúint ar leith a bheith ag na dochtúirí a théann thart ar na scoileanna náisiúnta i dtreo is go mbeidh siad ábalta an aicíd seo d'aithint.  De réir na saineolaithe ní féidir leis na páistí seo mórán a fhoghlaim má bhíonn siad sa rang céanna le páistí a bhfuil eagna chinn níos fearr acu, agus tá sé seo le chéill, ach go dtí seo ba bheag a thiocfadh le múinteoir a dhéanamh do pháiste mar é fiú dá n-aithneofaí go raibh an aicíd seo air.  Ach anois tá sé práinneach go n-aithneofaí iad, mar, mar adúirt mé cheana, tá scoileanna ar leith ann dóibh i nDúndealgan agus i nDroichead Átha.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom fosta buíochas a ghabháil leis na coistí i nDroichead Átha agus i nDúndealgan as ucht an méid oibre atá á dhéanamh acu, saor in aisce, ar son na bpáistí seo.  Tá siad ag bailiú airgid leo le scoileanna úra a thógáil agus i láthair na h-uaire tá go <Col N="1198" /> leor airgid bailithe ag an choiste i nDúndealgan leis an scoil úr a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an ní é an deontas a chuir an tAire ar fáil le scoileanna a pheinteáil.  Ba chuidiú mór é, go mór mór do na scoileanna nua agus tá a fhios againn gur fada an saol a bheidh acu dá bhárr.  Rinneadh cuid mhaith scoileanna sa cheantar 's agamsa ar na mallaibh agus tá cuma fíor-mhaith orthu anois.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire ardú a thabhairt ins na deontaisí maidir le téamh agus glanadh na scol.  Tá a fhios aige go ndeachaidh costas na h-oibre seo in airde go mór leis na blianta ach go bhfuil na deontaisí céanna ann leis na blianta.</P>
    <P>Feicim go bhfuil níos mó airgid curtha ar fáil ag an Aire do na h-irisí agus do na páipéirí Gaeilge.  Is maith liom sin a fheiceál.  Is beatha teangain í labhairt ach is buanú teangan í a léamh agus a scríobhadh?  Ag an am céanna, tá gearán agam faoina deontaisí seo.  Tá mé go láidir den bharúil go mba ceart i bhfad níos mó airgid a thabhairt do &ldquo;An tUltach&rdquo;.  Níl chothrom na féinne á fáil aici.  Go dtí i mbliana ní raibh ach ocht bpunta dhéag an eagrán á fháil.  Anois tá a dhá oiread sin agus gidh go bhfuil mé buíoch don Aire as ucht an méid a thug sé tá mé go fóill den bharúil go mba ceart i bhfad níos mó a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Tá cás ar leith ag &ldquo;An tUltach&rdquo;. Clóbhuailtear í i mBéal Feirste.  Scaiptear í ar fud cúige Uladh ar fad agus taobh amuigh de chomh maith, ach go mór mór, ins na Sé Condaethe.  Sí an t-aon iris Ghaeilge amháin atá ag muintir na Sé gCondaethe agus is mór an obair atá á déanamh acu ag coimhéad an Gaeilge beo ansin.  Scaiptear ar na scoileanna ansin í, fosta.  Is iris Comhaltais Uladh í agus tá a fhios ag achan duine an méid atá á dhéanamh ag Comhaltas Uladh ar son cúis na Gaeilge.  Tá cuma agus crut fíor-mhaith uirthi.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil díolachán níos fearr ar an pháipéar sin ná ar pháipéar Gaeilge ar bith eile in Éirinn, taobh amuigh de cheann amháin.  Sílim gurb é an fáth nár tugadh deontas níos fearr don pháipéar seo i dtús ama nó cionnus go raibh an t-ainm &ldquo;An <Col N="1199" /> tUltach&rdquo; air agus gur ceapadh gur páipéar áitiúil agus nach páipéar náisiúnta a bhí ann.  Iarraim ar an Aire aithsmaoineadh a dhéanamh ar an cheist seo agus sílim go n-aithneoidh sé go bhfuil cás ar leith ag an pháipéar seo.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá fá pháipéar Gaeilge eile, &ldquo;Amárach&rdquo;, páipéar atá curtha ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá suim mhór ag achan duine fán tuaith i nuacht áitiúil.  Ní féidir leis an chuid is mó de mhuintir na Gaeltachta an nuacht áitiúil seo a fháil ach amháin sna páipéirí Béarla. Má támuid dáiríre fá aithbheochaint na Gaeilge caithfimid an nuacht seo a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i nGaeilge.  Tá an páipéar &ldquo;Amárach&rdquo; ag déanamh a dhícheall sin a dhéanamh, ach cionnus nach bhfuil go leor airgid ag an choiste ní féidir leo go leor iriseoirí a dhíol leis an nuacht seo a fháil dóibh.  Sílim go mba cheart go dtabharfadh an tAire níos mó airgid leis an aidhm seo a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Táaithne agam ar an eagarthóir atá i mbun an pháipéir seo, agus cé nach n-aontaíom le achan rud atá le rá aige déarfainn seo fá dtaobh dó, gur sár-oibrí é ar son na Gaeilge, agus gur chuir sé íontas orm go minic caidé mar bhí fear amháin ábalta an méid a rinne sé a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil athrú tagtha ar an dóigh in a bhfuil an clár staire do na bunscoileanna athraithe.  Go dtí seo bhí sé íontach doiligh an dara cuid den stair a dhéanamh taobh istigh de bhliain amháin agus ar an dóigh sin is minic nach ndearnadh an chuid sin den stair is giorra don aois ina bhfuilmuid inár gcónaí ann, agus sílim gur tábhachtach an rud é go mbeadh stair ár linne féin go maith ag an aos óg.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of history, it is only right I should mention that there are certain elements in this House who are constantly decrying the teaching of history because of what they describe as the overemphasis placed on certain aspects of it.  They claim that the method of teaching is prejudiced and that we are attempting to stir up anti-British feeling. This, of course, is arrant nonsense. <Col N="1200" /> I know of no anti-British feeling which these people pretend is being stirred up by our teaching of history.</P>
    <P>However, there is a very serious aspect to this matter, that is, that the people in this House to whom I am referring would have us suppress facts of history because they are not palatable to the people of Britain, or perhaps, I should say, to the ruling classes in Britain.  History in our schools is presented as a series of facts.  If there is a slight inclination to over-emphasise the nobility of our people and their great deeds and to play down their shortcomings, this is something common to all peoples.  I have no doubt that, in the teaching of history in English schools, very much greater stress is placed on the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Waterloo than on the Irish Famine and the Black Hole of Calcutta.  Our history has been a troubled history.  We have had to bear persecution, torture and death for both religious and political reasons.  This history has gone to mould and shape the character of our people and to make them the distinctive people they are.  I believe Irish children are entitled to have a knowledge of the factors which went to make them different from other peoples.</P>
    <P>The critics to whom I refer would, I think, learn something if they were to study that very excellent book which was written recently by Mrs. Woodham Smith, &ldquo;The Great Hunger&rdquo;.  In that book the miseries and suffering of our people are very clearly depicted.  The iniquities of the British Government in relation to the Famine are clearly shown, and responsibility is placed definitely on their shoulders.  Is it suggested that Mrs. Woodham Smith wrote this book for the purpose of stirring up anti-British feeling, or that our people should be requested not to read this book because it might make people here dislike Britain?</P>
    <P>The Irish people are an intelligent people.  So far as I know, there is no hatred here, or even dislike, of the people of Great Britain.  In fact, the contrary is true.  But there is a very <Col N="1201" /> definite sense of grievance among our people in relation to the partition of our country, the part the British Government played in it and the responsibility they must accept for it.  If that is what is really annoying this particular element in this House&mdash;and I have no doubt it is&mdash;then I am afraid they are going to be annoyed for a long time in the future until these wrongs have been righted.  It is only right I should refer to this matter because it has been brought up here by a particular element, who always make sure to preface their remarks by saying they will be attacked as shoneens and West Britons.  I am not attacking them either as shoneens or West Britons.  I am simply stating facts.</P>
    <P>Developments all over the world in the educational field have naturally had their impact here.  The recognition by our people of the need for more educational facilities is reflected in the very large increase in the numbers availing of secondary and vocational education over the past few years.  The Minister has taken steps to implement a new programme in education, and I feel it is a very worthwhile step indeed.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with these proposals, would it be too much to ask those people always so anxious to belittle our educational system, and to compare us to our detriment with other countries, to take note of the comparative figures issued by the Minister in his Press statement some time ago when he first mentioned this new plan?  To our people, who have been subjected to this type of propaganda with regard to our so-called backwardness in the educational field, it comes as a pleasant surprise to find that 60 per cent of our children between the ages of 14 and 15 are in full-time attendance at recognised post-primary schools.  This is a higher percentage than in practically any other country in Europe, apart from Britain.  The reason why the British percentage is higher is probably the fact that it is compulsory there to remain at school until the age of 15.  Further, 45 per cent of our children between the ages of 15 and 16 are attending full-time educational courses, and this is an advance even on our neighbours.</P>
    <P>While we take note of these figures <Col N="1202" /> with a certain amount of pleasure, we are by no means satisfied.  The Minister has shown he is not satisfied.  He has set the country on a pattern of further educational development, for which he has the full support of this Party.  He has done a considerable amount in regard to scholarships.  I was very interested to hear Deputy D. Costello suggest that not sufficient money is being spent on education here and that far more scholarships should be available. He compared the amount made available in this country for scholarships with the amount made available in the Six Counties and Britain.  We fully agree that not sufficient money is being made available for scholarships, and we are doing our utmost to see to it that more is provided.  But when we put on the necessary taxes to provide these scholarships, Deputy D. Costello will be one of the first to pass through the Lobbies in opposition to the tax proposals, which must be carried if we are to have further expansion of our scholarship schemes. It is, of course, the usual procedure of the Opposition Parties to oppose all taxation, but to suggest that more and more money be spent on every aspect of our economic life.  It is nothing new to find them suggesting we are not spending nearly enough money on education, but, as I said, it is quite a different matter altogether when they are asked to vote the necessary moneys to provide the extra scholarships.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the idea behind the comprehensive schools was necessary. I had always hoped that post-primary education could have been based on the existing national schools in the areas the Minister has in mind.  I recognise, however, the difficulty of providing the necessary variety of subjects to a very limited number of pupils.  I fully endorse the Minister's view that the eleven-plus examination is now discredited.  I believe he has reached a sensible conclusion in relation to the time when the child's aptitude for a particular type of education should be manifest, that is, at the Intermediate Certificate examination stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister where the primary schools and primary teachers fit into this plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> It was held by a considerable body of educational opinion that one of the main flaws in the eleven-plus system was that it removed the child from the primary school at too young an age. Is it envisaged that the primary teacher will take part in the teaching in these schools?  Has the Minister taken into consideration what effect these new comprehensive schools will have on the numbers on the rolls in the primary schools in the sparsely populated areas?  This problem of the numbers on the rolls is agitating the minds of people not only in the sparsely populated areas but in the more thickly populated areas where there is very rapid development of industry.  Because of the fact that people tend to try to get houses near to where the industry is situated there is a move towards the towns and villages, and this results in the population in the rural areas falling.  For that reason, the same problem more or less is experienced in areas where normally you would not expect to find them.  This can have an effect, as the Minister knows, on the retention of teachers.</P>
    <P>I feel that the change envisaged in the Intermediate Certificate is good. Do I take it that when it is introduced, it will have general application, and does this mean the secondary and vocational schools will in future have the same programme as is envisaged for the comprehensive schools&mdash;will we have the same type of Intermediate Certificate in both types of school, and arising from that, will we have eventually some manual instruction as well as academic subjects in secondary schools?  It is one of the problems which appear to me to arise here.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that at Intermediate Certificate stage, the teachers or parents of a child may decide he would be better in a secondary school or in a vocational school, as the case may be.  If that child happens to be in a secondary school and his teachers or parents decide that the education afforded in a technical school would be much more advantageous for him, the problem is how will he change from the secondary school to the vocational <Col N="1204" /> school?  In my constituency, the vocational schools are packed out, and how a child will be able to make the change at that stage is a problem the Minister will have to consider.</P>
    <P>As a result of tests by experts at the Intermediate stage, the child will be guided on the path he should follow. This is, to a certain extent, career guidance, something for which we have been clamouring for many years, and I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing it into being.  The Minister mentioned that some children would be better off in secondary schools than in technical schools, and vice versa, and this is, of course, very true.  I think this is more applicable to those in secondary schools because there was a certain snob value over the years attached to attendance at a secondary school and many children who were incapable of deriving any advantage from the facilities afforded in these schools had their whole lives ruined because they were more or less forced to go to these schools and later found themselves in blind alley employment.  This outlook, I am glad to say, is changing rapidly and it is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to note that the Minister made particular mention of specialisation and stressed the need for a rounded education.  I submit that great care must be taken on this question of specialisation.  We know it is necessary, but specialisation has resulted in even university graduates leaving colleges without an education in the proper sense of the word: they are sometimes not equipped educationally to take a balanced view because specialisation has been attempted too early and they did not have the opportunity of being given a fully rounded education.</P>
    <P>The idea of a technical school leaving certificate is, of course, an excellent one, and the establishment of technological colleges is extremely important, particularly where industry is developing, as it is now in most parts of the country.  It is of very particular importance in a constituency such as mine.  When industrialists come to my constituency &mdash; many of them have come in the past few years&mdash;one of the <Col N="1205" /> first questions they ask is whether technical instruction is available and whether it is possible to have special training for their employees if they decide to set up an industry.  That is one of the main reasons why industrialists coming here select one area rather than another.</P>
    <P>Two very important events occurred during the year in relation to the Irish language revival.  One of them was the appointment of An tAthair Colm Ó hUallacháin to advise on language teaching techniques, and the other was the Glór na nGael competition under Cumann na Sagart.  The appointment of An tAthair Ó hUallacháin is an important step because through his efforts and his study, we hope to be able to make the latest scientific advantages of language teaching available to our teachers.  We need not expect miracles from this, but I feel that the application of the experience gained in other countries in relation to new language teaching methods, to the teaching of Irish will remove much of the drudgery from the teaching of the language and will make it easier for both children and adults to learn it.</P>
    <P>This process has been more or less described by the Minister in his statement on the Estimate.  It will, of course, take a considerable time and I suggest to the Minister that, where possible, he should make available to the teachers, even piecemeal, some of the new teaching methods so that they can utilise them in the teaching of the language in our schools.</P>
    <P>The Glór na nGael competition, organised by Cumann na Sagart, has proved that the enormous effort put into the teaching of the language in our schools over the years was not wasted, that the people who have always said so were correct.  Some of us have always believed&mdash;I have heard the former Deputy Mulcahy speak here in this vein&mdash;that it was only necessary to get the key to release the language our children, and many of our adults, have already learned, to further the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Glór na nGael competition is, perhaps, that key.  It has shown that where there is the right leadership locally, that is all that is <Col N="1206" /> needed to get our people to make use of the language, and to overcome their initial shyness of using it.  I saw recently the programme on Telefís Éireann about Abbeyfeale, which this year and last year won the Glór na nGael competition.  It was a very heartening experience.  If this work which was done in Abbeyfeale could be repeated in towns and villages all over the country, we would be well on our way towards the revival of the language.  There are many signposts to the progress we have made in the revival of the language but I feel this is perhaps the outstanding signpost.</P>
    <P>One of the faults in our language revival policy was that the revival tended to be confined to schools.  I am sure that was not the intention originally but what is now needed is to get it outside the schools also. Without question, it is absolutely necessary that the language be taught in the schools; otherwise, a revival would be impossible.  It is only nonsense for people to talk, as I heard Deputy Costello talk a short time ago, about loving the language and respecting it, if we do not know the language. We can only know it if we are taught it.  This competition in Abbeyfeale has proved that the enormous effort put into the language teaching over the years has been a very considerable success.</P>
    <P>When we talk of voluntary efforts in regard to the language, it is of course well that voluntary organisations should do their part as they are doing, but unless the language is taught in the schools, the work of the voluntary organisations will be fruitless.  This has also been proved by the Glór na nGael competition.  The competition in the Six Counties has shown that even in the town which won the prize there, the results, to say the least, were extremely poor.  I suggest the Fine Gael Party should reconsider and modify their Irish language policy in the light of experience gained in this competition because it is obvious from the results that unless the language is taught in the schools, it is hopeless to try to revive it.</P>
    <P>When it suited our purpose&mdash;I do not say this was done deliberately to <Col N="1207" /> deceive&mdash;it was easy to say that much more Irish was spoken in the Six Counties than in the Twenty-six, but that was not in fact true.  Because there was opposition to Irish in the Six Counties, the small group who were enthusiastic about the language were perhaps more vocal than they tend to be here where the same opposition does not arise.  Still, the facts are, as shown clearly by the competition, that the people in the Six Counties, whether Orange or Green, except for a small group, have absolutely no knowledge of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these further points regarding the language are important. For many years, the language policy in this House was attacked mainly on two bases.  One was that children were being introduced to the language too young and the other, that it was educationally unsound and mentally harmful to teach children through the medium of the second language.  I think Deputy Dillon spoke on those lines some time ago.  In the past year, there was a meeting of UNESCO psychological and educational experts in Hamburg and they gave as their considered opinion that bi-lingualism causes no mental or educational damage; that the second language should be taught as early as possible; that other subjects should be taught through the medium of the second language not only to the brighter children but also to all pupils; and that children who were taught in this way <Col N="1208" /> not only learn the second language but also benefit educationally.</P>
      <P>I am sure these experts were not even thinking of the Irish language when they reached these conclusions. This appears to me to be a complete vindication of the principles underlying the methods used here for the revival of Irish.  I do not say we can revive the language simply on the basis of the methods used in the past but, from what we are told according to the daily newspaper reports, there is no doubt that the fundamental principles used here are sound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in the primary school, possibly the teachers then had not the competence to teach through the medium of Irish, but in the secondary school and in the training college, we were taught through that medium and personally I never had any difficulty, nor did I ever hear any students with me say they had any difficulty learning the various subjects through Irish.  But because of the deluge of criticism of teaching subjects through Irish since I came to the House, I had a nagging fear that perhaps some students were adversely affected by the system.  My own experience and that of others at school with me was that we never found any difficulty of that kind.  However, because of the criticism and my fear that possibly some students were affected adversely, I should be only too pleased to have a full and frank discussion with members of all Parties regarding the revival of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> Last night Deputy O'Donnell said it had been suggested&mdash;he said by Deputy Dr. Browne but that was an error; it was by Deputy Kennedy&mdash; that a Committee of all Parties should be set up to go into the whole question of revival of Irish.  Deputy O'Donnell agreed with that and I should be delighted if such a Committee were set up.  The language is of the utmost importance to the soul of the country and I should hate to find it involved in politics.  I have always been very careful since I came here&mdash;and I think anybody who reads my speeches on education, on which I have spoken each year, will find this borne out&mdash; never to suggest that this Party alone had a prerogative so far as Irish was concerned.  I was always careful to point out that I had no doubt many members of other Parties were as interested in the Irish language as I was. I felt it would be a good thing if we could have a Committee of this House to thresh out the whole problem and to decide on a policy about the Irish language, which is something which is above all Party issues, which is a national issue.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil on its rising to-day do adjourn until 29th January, 1964.</P>
      <P>The occasion of the Adjournment Debate on the last day of sitting of the Dáil in the year might be regarded as a suitable occasion for a review of the year's work and of the prospects for the year ahead.  I do not propose to do this because we have had an unusual number of debates on general policy during the course of this year and in this session and also because of the arrangement on which we have now agreed to take the Vote on Account for next year at the beginning of the next session and that would be an appropriate occasion for such a review. There are, however, some important matters that I want to refer to before the Dáil adjourns.</P>
      <P>In many respects, as Deputies will, I am sure, agree, this has been a fairly difficult year.  Nevertheless, the rate of national progress picked up again as compared with 1962.  It was a year in which industrial production and industrial employment went ahead fairly strongly and in which the national income expanded in satisfactory measure.  The value of gross national production at current prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At current prices&mdash; increased, it is estimated in 1963, by approximately £48 million as compared with 1962 and increased in volume by slightly over four per cent. That increase of four per cent in the volume of national production is to be compared with an increase of 2½ per cent in 1962 and an average annual rate of increase of one per cent in the years preceding the Government's <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> In the financial year, 1962-63, the average weekly number of persons in <Col N="1211" /> insurable employment increased by 14,700 over the year 1961-62.  In the September quarter of 1963, employment in manufacturing industry was up by 6,600 and the volume of industrial production was higher by 11 per cent than in the corresponding quarter of 1962. The difficulties to which I have referred will pass and will in time be forgotten but these benefits will, we can hope, endure.</P>
      <P>The outlook for 1964 seems fairly good.  Agricultural income should rise and industrial production looks like going ahead quite strongly.  There are good reasons to expect a higher level of activity in the construction and service trades.  Deputies may have noted a statement made at a recent function under the auspices of the Master Builders Association that the amount of building work on offer for the first six months of next year exceeds the total output of the building industry in 1961.  That and other indications of the same kind justify this hope that, assuming no situation, internal or external, will arise to upset the country's progress, 1964 should be a fairly good year.</P>
      <P>Standards of living should also rise. This is, of course, the general aim of economic development but its achievement on an equitable basis can be very seriously jeopardised if, as a national community, we try to do too much at once.  We have seen a situation developing in this regard in which expectations of income increases amongst all sections of our community appear to be running well ahead of realisable possibilities.  The danger of this situation, the danger to the country, to the welfare of its people and to its future progress, is so obvious that I consider it my duty, as head of the Government, to express my concern and to inform the House and the country of the considered views of the Government in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A ninth round of wage and salary increases will take place in 1964.  It will take place either by a process of national agreement or by the old unregulated, haphazard methods of the past.  The advantages of a national <Col N="1212" /> agreement are so obvious that they hardly need to be stressed and I feel sure that in expressing them I will be speaking, not merely for the majority of Deputies here, but for most sensible people in the country.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I considered it to be my duty to urge upon the parties directly concerned&mdash;the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers&mdash;that they should meet together to investigate the possibility of securing an agreement for a national arrangement of that kind.  I did so because I saw in the conclusion of a national agreement a number of advantages.  First, it would minimise the danger of a loss of earnings by workers and a loss of production to the country by reason of trade disputes; secondly, it would introduce a more orderly and sensible procedure for future general wage adjustments; thirdly, it would enable the interests of workers with less bargaining powers than others to be protected; fourthly, it would, and I personally attach considerable importance to this consideration, enable unorganised workers, of whom there are a considerable number, to share the increase.  Finally, it would &mdash;or to be more realistic, I should say could&mdash;enable adjustments to be made on the basis of an intelligent understanding and interpretation of the national interests rather than by procedures of horse-trading or strikes.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate, and I am sure anybody who has had experience of dealing with these matters will also appreciate, the difficulty of securing agreement as to the maximum increases in earned incomes which could be carried by the country during the next two years without danger to the stability of the price level, without danger to the expansion of our export trade on which the country's future economic progress depends, and without danger to the employment of workers in any industrial category. Various opinions by economic experts, men whose professional and academic qualifications entitle them to have their views heard with respect, have been expressed as to the general increase in wages and salaries which the country could carry during these years without <Col N="1213" /> these adverse consequences and they have put it at about eight per cent.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Industries, and the Irish Exporters Association in a very carefully thought out memorandum, a copy of which was submitted to me, said that Irish manufacturers could accept, they considered, without undue danger to the development of our export trade or to the maintenance of employment, an increase of wages of around eight or nine per cent.  It is, I think, clear to people who are familiar with the economic situation in the country that to forecast an increase of total national production over the next two years in excess of eight or nine per cent would be optimistic in the extreme.  We are hoping to bring about an annual average rate of growth of 4½ per cent but we have not, in fact, achieved this over recent years.</P>
    <P>If wage and salary levels and earned incomes should rise faster than the growth of national production then prices will increase.  This is what happened in 1962.  This is a mathematical certainty.  When a gap emerges between the total level of incomes and the total of national production, it is always closed in terms of money.  If incomes rise higher than production prices will rise to close the gap.  If we could envisage a situation in which production would rise higher than incomes, prices would then fall to close the gap.  I am sure I am speaking with the agreement of all shades of opinion when I express the view that a general rise in prices should be avoided, if at all possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal seriously with a serious matter and may I ask that the political clowning be left over until later?  I have urged this because I want to ensure that as wages rise, that rise will not be nullified by a deterioration in the value of money.  My second reason for urging it is that we must seek to avoid any possible danger of a contraction in employment or anything which would <Col N="1214" /> endanger our hopes of bringing about the expansion in employment which the country needs.</P>
      <P>This country depends on its export trade to a degree relatively larger than does any other country in Western Europe.  If employment is to increase, exports must increase.  The effect of the eighth round of wage increases on the competitive position of Irish products was not as serious as I thought it would be.  It was not as serious because in the countries with which we trade, prices were also going up so the competitive position of Irish exports was not seriously undermined. In these countries at the present time, wage adjustments are also being made and Deputies who read the newspapers will have noted the rates of increase under consideration.</P>
      <P>In Britain, the argument is between a 3½ per cent increase which their National Economic Council has suggested as practicable and the five per cent increase which the trade unions are seeking to secure.  In the United States, the annual average rate of increase for some time has been 3½ per cent matching a corresponding increase in productivity so that in America they have had the unusual and desirable experience of having prices stabilised for the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In Germany, recent wage adjustments affected in the type of collective agreements they make there provide for increases at or below five per cent.  I mention these three countries because these are the countries to which the bulk of our exports are consigned.  The rate of growth of national production in these countries for next year will certainly exceed the rate of increase in earnings and consequently there will be no increases in prices there.  This is why we must be concerned to pursue a course which is designed to ensure that we will avoid putting ourselves into a position that we will endanger our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rise in prices here due to an increase in wages not offset by an expansion in output could have serious <Col N="1215" /> consequences on the country's economic development and on the prospects of maintaining or increasing employment, and a much more serious effect in the years immediately ahead of us than the eighth round of wage increases had in 1962.</P>
    <P>This is a very brief summary of the views I expressed in the past two days to the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the Federated Union of Employers.  I hope there will be a national agreement.  I have asked the parties to consider meeting again: I do not know if this will be possible.  I have asked them to consider all these matters I have mentioned. I have also expressed my view that the benefits of a national agreement in the elimination of the danger of industrial strife and in the inauguration of a new procedure by which general wage adjustments might harmoniously be effected in the future, are worth paying some premium for, over and above what an objective examination of our economic situation would appear to justify.</P>
    <P>I believe I have, as head of the Government, a duty to express these views not merely to the people directly concerned in these rather difficult negotiations but also to the community as a whole.  I hope and expect that attention will be paid to them.  I know it is for the parties concerned in these negotiations to try to make such agreement as may be possible and that in these matters economic arguments or even ordinary logic are not always the only factors that have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>If there is no national agreement&mdash; and this is a possibility which certainly exists&mdash;I hope the views I have expressed will receive serious attention from those who will have the responsibility of conducting negotiations for wage adjustments at the level of individual trades and industries. Those engaged in these negotiations have also to consider the problem to which I have already referred of the expectations regarding income increases which prevail amongst the community.  Here again, it seems to me a duty will now devolve upon those who have responsibility for <Col N="1216" /> Government as well as upon those concerned with the conduct of trade unions, and of wage negotiations, and that is to look ahead to make sure that expectations regarding future wage increases will be related in a realistic way to the possibilities that will be presented.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to bring about and maintain a rate of national economic growth of between 4 and 4½ per cent per year.  It is clear, therefore, that future wage negotiations, conducted on a two-yearly basis, should provide&mdash; assuming this rate of growth is maintained&mdash;for increases in wages of about that amount.  I would argue in favour of a slightly lesser amount so as to permit of an improvement of social welfare benefits&mdash;the insurance benefits which are important to workers in these employments and which involve contributions by themselves and their employers.  However, that is a matter of detail.</P>
    <P>I am sure trade union leaders in this country, like members of the Dáil, will have noted the course taken by the British Trade Union Congress during this year in that regard when they told their members that future increases in wages must be less in amount than those to which they have become accustomed in the post-war period.  It is clear that we can hold out to the wage and salary earners this prospect of a continuing expansion in the real value of their earnings as national production expands and that this can be achieved provided the progress of the nation is not upset by any mismanagement of the problem of promoting that growth at this time.</P>
    <P>I found in the Federated Union of Employers, as in the Federation of Irish Industries and amongst the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a genuine concern to fix the level of increases in this ninth round at a point which would bring the maximum benefit to workers in the form of improvement of their real earnings, in stability of prices, in the growth of employment and in the national interest.  I could not do better in this regard than quote from the first paragraph of the joint memorandum, to which I have referred, prepared by <Col N="1217" /> the Federation of Irish Industries and the Irish Exporters' Association:</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Industries and the Irish Exporters' Association recognise that a general increase in wages is appropriate at this time. The interval that has elapsed since the eighth round and the progress currently being made by the industrial sector of the economy ensure that a general wage increase at this stage would be not only socially beneficial but economically appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, these bodies in this very comprehensive memorandum set out their conclusion that they could carry, without loss of competitive advantage, an increase of around eight or nine per cent.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural side, there are also some high ideas of what may be possible by the Government in the form of additional price supports or other subventions to agriculture.  As Deputies are aware because we have reminded them on more occasions than one, the cost of these agricultural supports to the taxpayers in this year exceeds £40,000,000.  It was brought over the £40,000,000 mark by a Supplementary Estimate which the Dáil passed this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all money. This expenditure&mdash;not by the Government but by the taxpayers contributing the money through the Government to make it possible&mdash;is fully justified.  We have defended the increase in these subventions to agriculture on the ground not merely of the need to maintain a proper balance or to get as near to a proper balance as is practicable between the level of incomes in the agicultural sector of our community and in the non-agricultural sector but also on the ground that the national interest as a whole justifies the provision of this support in the circumstances now prevailing <Col N="1218" /> in international trade in agricultural products.</P>
      <P>I said here before that notwithstanding the dimensions of this support to agriculture, notwithstanding the substantial increase in the volume of this support in recent years, the Government were getting very little thanks from the professional spokesmen of farmers' organisations.  I want to make it clear that we are not looking for thanks.  Apart from these professional spokesmen, I have found in my contacts with ordinary farmers in the community a very lively appreciation of what the Government have done and are striving to do to improve the situation for them.  But I want to say that I, and all the members of the Government Party, are becoming completely fed up with the constant propaganda which is being circulated among farmers that these provisions were made, this assistance given, and these new schemes of aid to agriculture devised, not because we wanted to do so but because we were forced into giving them by reason of pressure and agitation. This is not true; it was never true and it never will be.</P>
      <P>Every single item in the whole bill of costs presented to the taxpayer to provide additional aids and additional forms of support to agriculture was decided upon by the Government because we considered it to be justifiable and necessary and we had to take the political burden of arranging the very considerable taxation which makes these price supports and other aids possible.  We did, in considering the form that the aid should take and in the arrangements for operating these schemes, take into account the reasonable views which we got on occasion from representative farmers' organisations but we have never once allowed our decisions to be influenced by any form of agitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I want to refer to a campaign which has developed in County Kilkenny under which some proportion of farmers&mdash;about ten per cent&mdash;have been persuaded not to pay the whole of the rates due by them. A campaign of this kind strikes at the very roots of representative government. The people of this country <Col N="1219" /> fought for many centuries to bring about a situation in which policy decisions affecting them would be made by their own elected representatives. People can agree or disagree with what their elected representatives do but if they disagree, the only thing they can do about it in a democratic society is to change these representatives when the opportunity offers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If agitation of this kind could succeed in any degree whatever, or even seem to succeed, or even so develop as being capable of being misrepresented as having succeeded, it could bring the whole administration of local and central government into disorder. This is the road to anarchy and I want to make the Government's position in this regard clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding. We will not allow it to happen.  We have held our hand, waiting and hoping for commonsense to prevail.  I urge the people concerned in County Kilkenny not to allow themselves to be made scapegoats but I want them to understand that they can succeed in this campaign only at the cost of destroying the Irish State that we are trying to build up.  We will not let this happen easily.</P>
      <P>It is the desire of the Government&mdash; my own keen personal desire as well as that of all my colleagues&mdash;that we should have close and harmonious relationships with the NFA.  I should like to feel that we could meet them regularly to consider, in constructive discussions, plans and ideals for the development of our agriculture.  If the NFA want to take this road, the road towards harmonious relationships with the Government, and of constructive discussion of plans, we will certainly take it with them, but if they are going to be associated with illegalities, if they are going to encourage campaigns of illegalities, that form of association will not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter which I think the Dáil and the people should be informed about.  They should know that the Government are facing a serious Budget problem for 1964. <Col N="1220" /> Increases in remuneration given in this year since the Budget of 1963 was completed, to civic guards, which have already been given, or have now been offered to national teachers, and offered to post office employees, will involve an additional charge upon the revenue next year of something over £4 million.  An eight per cent or a nine per cent increase in the remuneration of other classes of public servants under a general ninth round would increase the charge by a further £6 million.  Other demands for increased Government expenditure, other proposals, many of which are in the Dáil, and all of which we should like to be in a position to implement if it were financially possible to do so&mdash; and some of which I think will have to be implemented&mdash;will bring the total additional charge on the revenue in next year to a figure which it would be far beyond what any possible buoyancy of revenue could cover.</P>
    <P>If the Government have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any demands or proposals which are now being submitted to them, as we will have to say, it will be for this very good reason that the money to meet these demands is not available and could not be made available except by such an increase in taxation as would be regarded by the public as being intolerable and which would in fact impose an undue handicap upon the national economic growth.  If we have to say, as we will have to say, higher expenditures are not possible, to maintain a negative attitude in respect of some of these demands, I do not want it to be interpreted as meaning that we do not recognise that many of these demands have merit. They have, and indeed the Government would wish to be able to meet them, but as I said, we are now forced to consider not merely what is desirable or equitable but also what is financially feasible.  We would wish that all the public servants of the State would participate in the general improvement of remuneration in line with persons employed in the private sectors.</P>
    <P>We are now, however, as I have said, coming up against this problem of financial practicability and this must be, I think, a guiding factor in our <Col N="1221" /> decisions.  These figures which I have quoted, these realities of our situation, make nonsense of the pretence that the turnover tax is not required or could be repealed.  It will also, I hope, finally eliminate, wherever illusions may still be persisting because of misinformed newspaper comment, that the Government will be coming to consider the 1964 Budget with a substantial revenue surplus to dispose of.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation also in which we have to take note of the deficit arising on our international payments. It is estimated now that the deficit on our international payments for 1963 will be somewhere around £20 millions. That is not an insupportable deficit and it need not be a cause for undue concern having regard to the extent to which the effect upon our financial reserves is offset by a strong capital inflow; but if there should be, as there will be in consequence of the 9th round of wage increases, an injection of a considerable amount of additional purchasing power into our economy, and if this leads, as it probably will judging by past experience, to a further expansion of imports, then we could be up against a situation in regard to our external payments of a character which would require remedial action by the Government.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which we see in the future are almost entirely in the field of Government financing.  A high rate of economic growth, of development in industry, and improvement in agriculture are now possible.  All the circumstances internationally are favourable to our economic growth, if we can finance it.  With regard to social progress, the improvement in the social conditions in the country, which we all desire and which is now also possible&mdash;to the extent that it turns upon Government action &mdash; is subject to the same condition, that we are able to finance it.  The improvement of living standards of wage and salary earners in public employment and of persons whose employment is dependent, directly or indirectly, upon support from public funds, is also possible, if we can find the revenue to make the payments and also to finance the consequential adjustments which <Col N="1222" /> will prevent the emergence of fresh disparities between the different elements of our community.</P>
    <P>These are very big &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and I think I must say to the Dáil, and to the country, that it will be difficult, very difficult, to carry through the Government's programme of economic expansion, plus the adjustment of wages and social benefits which will translate the fruits of that programme into better living conditions for our people, in a climate of public opinion generated by political agitation against changes in taxation.  It is a feasible policy for some Government to go to the people or present to the Dáil a policy of having no more taxation increases, even if it means saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to all the many demands and pressures for increased spending of Government funds for one purpose or another.  That is not the policy of this Government.  It would also be a feasible policy for a political Party to go to the country saying that all these demands should be met and all these new undertakings involving expenditure should be begun, and that they intended to propose to the Dáil, and impose upon the people, the taxation required to finance them. Again, that is not the policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>We are trying to take a middle course.  I can say at once that it is exceedingly difficult to do so and that it carries all the political risks.  Those who want more spending, on the one hand, and those who want less taxation, on the other, are both dissatisfied with that course.  Nevertheless, I am certain in my own judgement, and I am certain that it will also be accepted in the judgement of the thinking people of this country, that it is the right course. We all of us recognise, when we deal with this matter sensibly and not in the context of political harangues, that economic progress requires investment, the investment of money, if it is to be realised.  That means devoting tax revenue to it.</P>
    <P>Everything for which we hope, all the aims we have for the country, all the expectations of better living conditions for our people, better educational standards, better public services <Col N="1223" /> of one kind or another, all depend on our capacity to realise economic progress. While national production is building up, as it is now building up, the obligation to pay to our public servants, to those who are employed in the public service and who are paid out of public funds, wage adjustments in line with those secured in private employment, must be accepted.  So must also be accepted the measures which are needed to improve agriculture and, indeed, the conditions of all those who do not directly benefit either from industrial growth or from pay rises for industrial workers.  This can be done only if the public are prepared to accept whatever level of taxation is required to provide the necessary revenue.</P>
    <P>If, because of a failure on our part either to organise national progress properly or to accept the need for taxation to make it possible, the national income should start to fall again, as it did in 1956, then there would be not merely an end to economic progress for the time being but the country would be facing a serious economic slump, escape from which could be achieved neither quickly, easily, nor cheaply.</P>
    <P>All these financial problems and all these taxation problems are presenting themselves at a time when the country never had a better chance of speeding up its rate of progress.  Unless we can resolve these problems, unless we can get public opinion here to understand what the cost of progress is, we will throw this chance away, and we will throw it away, I believe, totally and finally.</P>
    <P>The Opposition Parties, during the course of this year, have been saying they want a general election.  When I took office here after the election of 1961, recognising that I did not have behind me a majority of my own Party to give me a secure tenure of office, which any Head of Government would desire who has a comprehensive programme to fulfil, I said that, in order to make the situation as stable as possible and to give the Government a reasonable opportunity of going ahead with their programme.  I <Col N="1224" /> would seek a dissolution of the Dáil in only two circumstances: one, if the Government were defeated here on a policy issue; and, secondly, if a situation should develop which made it clear that the Government's weakness &mdash;the position of the Government as a minority Government&mdash;would make it impossible for them to cope with the situation and make it desirable, therefore, in the national interest to refer the matter to the people.  Either of these circumstances may arise at any time.  I recognise that.  But I would not, and could not, condemn the country to a period of political chaos, and of ineffectiveness, and the possibility of a serious economic slump. Whatever the effect upon the political future of my Party, or myself, I will not deliberately take the risk that all the good work we have achieved will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition Parties&mdash;either of them&mdash;will do this: define in detail a policy different from that which the Government are applying&mdash;a policy so clearly and so comprehensively expressed that the public will understand its implications in full and be able to make a choice between that policy, thus clearly and comprehensively outlined and the policy of the Government &mdash;that will be a new situation.  But, until they do that, their agitation and pressure for a general election will not influence my decision one iota.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty, which I have to concede exists, as to whether the Government will have the continuing Dáil strength to carry through their economic programme is a serious national handicap.  If it becomes obvious that the difficulties arising from this cause are becoming greater, as they may, I shall have to consider my duty in that situation.  But we can part now at the end of our year's work with some satisfaction in noting the achievements of the year, and indeed the achievements of all our recent years. We see the prospect of still more solid achievements in the future.</P>
    <P>This is partly due to the fact that the foundations for a campaign of national progress have been truly laid, that many of the arrangements have been made, that the public confidence in our <Col N="1225" /> capacity to carry through such a campaign has been generated; and partly to the existence of international circumstances which are favourable to our economic growth at this time.  We have confidence in our capacity, and I am speaking now of the Government and the members of the Dáil who are supporting the Government, in bringing the country to the realisation of these prospects.  This also, I should make clear, is a factor in our thinking in relation to the political situation.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope that in this final debate of the year and the time left for its completion, our discussions will not degenerate into a mere reiteration of Party catchcries and that we can end the year's work in the Dáil on a constructive, if not a harmonious note.  This is a challenge to Deputy Dillon, as it is to the other members of his Party, not to give us the type of rigmarole and ballyhoo we have been hearing during the year, but to come down now and accept my offer.  This is a fair offer.  If he will on behalf of his Party set out a clear, comprehensive national policy, different from the Government's, so clearly and so comprehensively set out that the public will be able to distinguish quite easily between what we are doing and what they would try to do, then I shall think of giving the public a chance.  But I do not think the Deputy will do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will submit the policy of this Party to the judgement of our people as soon as I get the chance when the Taoiseach is prepared to face them.  I want the Taoiseach to come out and face the people tomorrow. But let us be clear on this; the policy of this Party and the hopes of its leaders will not be submitted to the Fianna Fáil Party for their approval before they are submitted to the people of this country.  It is the people of this country who govern Ireland, not the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something rotten creeping into the public life of Ireland.  Its source is the Fianna Fáil Party.  I listened here yesterday with growing horror to the exchange that took place relative to the housing conditions of our people in this city.  When I heard the Taoiseach today triumphing in the <Col N="1226" /> fact that the building industry of this country was now expanding and had expanded to the limit in its capacity, I recalled that yesterday in this House we were talking in the most detached possible way.  Let us quote indeed what the Minister for Finance said here on behalf of the Minister for Health:</P>
    <P>On December 5th there were eight families, eight husbands with their wives and 17 children, in the Island Street premises and there were 19 women and 12 children in Griffith Barracks.</P>
    <P>These are our own neighbours in the city of Dublin who have not a roof over their heads, whose families are disrupted, who are going to be left in institutions over Christmas &mdash; and nobody appears to give a damn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy belive the officials of Dublin Corporation do not care a rap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my case. I listened for an hour to the Taoiseach making his case.  In 1954, when the floods of the Shannon came up and dislocated the domestic conditions of a number of people down around Athlone, we took them into Army barracks.  While they were in the barracks, the Government said to me that this was a matter of considerable daily concern.  I well remember being sent down with Deputy Seán MacEoin to visit these people to see if they were being well looked after and to tell them that all the resources we disposed of were being mobilised to get them back into their homes within the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the joy and satisfaction I had in seeing how the Army treated these people.  In so far as it was humanly possible the Army was in with them&mdash;young soldiers, their own neighbours.  It was like a home for them.  Everything the individual soldier could do to make it like home was done.  I felt the fact that two Ministers of State had come down to them, sat <Col N="1227" /> with them and shared a cup of tea with them reassured them that their own Government were earnestly solicitous for them and aimed to put an end to their suffering.</P>
    <P>I cannot get that atmosphere here today in the detached equanimity of the Government's spokesman, who spoke of the building industry being extended to its limits.  The fact is that that extension took place at a time when, as some Deputy there mentioned, six years ago there were too many houses in the city of Dublin for the available tenants to go into them. Today the houses are falling on the people, and our own people and neighbours are in the Mendicity Institute over Christmas.  That is one thing I feel indicates a queer foreign detachment from our way of life.  I have never seen it before.</P>
    <P>Maybe we were wrong in 1954 when we went down to visit those people, when we went to their houses to show them that their Government were thinking of them and were concerned for the dilemma into which they had fallen.  Maybe we were wrong; maybe we were sentimental.  Maybe it is no longer fashionable, but that is the kind of society I should like to see in this country.  I detest this atmosphere of treating our people as if they were digits in a calculating machine.  That may be suitable for a nation of 180 million or 1,800 million people like China, but it is not suitable here.  It is corrupting and rotting the social life we were brought up in ourselves, in which I hope to be able to bring up my own son and in which I imagine the bulk of the Deputies would wish to bring up their families.</P>
    <P>There is another element of corruption and rottenness creeping into our public life.  It is typified by the jackass laughter of a Deputy like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, a kind of contempt for simple people who are beneath the attention of people who have attained to the dignity of Government employment. Maybe I am wrong but I do not think I am wrong&mdash;and if the truth were told I do not believe the majority of Deputies here belive I am wrong&mdash;in <Col N="1228" /> saying there is another element of rottenness to which I want to refer.  I do this with reluctance because, whether I agree with the Taoiseach or not, whether I ever occupy that position or not, the Taoiseach, whatever Party he belongs to, whether he is Eamon de Valera, John A. Costello, Liam T. Cosgrave, Seán Lemass, James Dillon or anybody else, so long as he is Taoiseach, he is the head of an Irish Government and as such, entitled to the respect and deference of those who see in him not only a man but the representative of an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>There was published to this House last February on the authority of the Irish Government of which he is head, a White Paper bearing the imprint of the Irish Government which was offered to us as a factual, detached statistical record of the then existing economic situation.  On the basis of that, the Taoiseach came to the House and in a long debate which was inaugurated by myself, he defended that paper.  The debate occurred in Volume 200 in which the Taoiseach said about that paper:</P>
    <P>I was not anxious to present it to the House but I felt I had a duty to give it to the House in order that they might know the facts.</P>
    <P>I attacked that paper on the ground that if these were the facts then the proposal to freeze wages was neither equitable nor just.  If these were the facts then a comprehensive incomes policy was indicated in which shareholders, property owners, wage earners and salary earners should all combine to share whatever burden was necessary to put right whatever was wrong.</P>
    <P>This paper was entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i> and we were told that, in order to bring home the nature of the problem to every Deputy, the paper was rounded on a diagram which was set out on Page 4 and described as diagram 1.  The Taoiseach explained in great detail, as does the paper itself, that the gap to which he wanted to direct the attention of the country and the House was the differential that was emerging between average weekly earnings and average output per wage <Col N="1229" /> earner.  He said that formula covered a whole economic complex but it was best expressed in the form of the diagram which was set out and in which he demonstrated the situation to his own satisfaction.  He took 1958 as a base year and on that base year these two figures approximated and, taking that point of departure, for a period output per wage earner in 1959 and 1960 remained above the average weekly earnings but in 1960 they coincided again.  Then he said the gap began to emerge and that whereas the two figures stood at 110 in 1960 and were, therefore, for the purpose of this diagram coinciding, in 1961 weekly earnings had gone to 117 whereas output had gone to only 115.  Then he said weekly earnings went to 128.4 in 1962, whereas output per wage earner had gone to only 117.9.  At that stage he said he felt he must come to the House and place this paper before them, explain the dilemma we were in and call on all Parties to lend a hand. <i>Nota bene:</i> anyone who then accepted his view was making a statesmanlike speech.  Anyone who challenged his view was making a political harangue, a hullabaloo, a demonstration, an unconstructive contribution.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  We are now told there is an entirely new situation and that the hour has struck for a general move forward in wages, increments and so forth because there has been a fundamental change in the economic foundation on which we stand.  We are all conveniently to forget <i>Closing the Gap</i> because on the day we were told that the emergency was so acute that the Taoiseach felt an inescapable duty to bring the facts and figures before the House to warn them of impending danger, there was a gap of 10.5 between the two figures on which he based his calculation.  Today, on the September quarter figures for 1959 the gap between those figures is 14.4.</P>
    <P>I did not believe the Taoiseach when he brought that before the House before but I recoiled from charging him with a desire to deceive our people.  I was prepared to accept that he might have persuaded himself that the logic of that document was coercive <Col N="1230" /> to his mind.  However, if he meant what he said in February, 1963, he could not mean what he says in December, 1963; and if he means what he says here in December, 1963, then that paper was a fraud on our people, which was induced for the purpose of flying a kite and when the kite did not fly, it is repudiated and we are expected to forget it.  When we recall it we are giving political harangues and debasing the coinage of our public life.</P>
    <P>I say the man who published that paper and stood over it as the Taoiseach of our Government and comes brazenly before the House to-day to call on us all to dismiss it from our minds, to forget it, is debasing the whole coinage of public life.  I am now bound to say in public, on the evidence I have presented here, no rational man could believe the Gospel from the Taoiseach's lips.  That is a grave thing to say of the head of an Irish Government and the public life of Ireland is the poorer for the fact that it is my considered duty to make that allegation.</P>
    <P>I believe a great many Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House got a sorry shock when they heard the Taoiseach describe the budgetary and fiduciary problems he would have to meet next March.  I want to remind the House that every Fianna Fáil Budget I remember has always been presented to the country in November as an immense and insoluble problem involving burdens on the Exchequer that surpass the capacity of human minds to contemplate.  That is the softening-up process carried on by a Party who want to persuade the people to steel themselves to unprecedented suffering in the hope that when no further burdens are piled upon them they will thank God they have escaped with the burdens they have already been called upon to bear.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach.  He is no longer entitled to bespeak any credence in the announcements he makes to this House, but I want to warn the House that the Taoiseach has developed quite a skilful technique, and that is, anything he is concerned ultimately to destroy he begins by <Col N="1231" /> referring to casually with a pejorative word.</P>
    <P>We were told today that he hopes everybody will accept a national basis for wage negotiations because, he says, by that means we can avoid horse-trading. Suddenly the normal function of the trade unions in this country has become equated with that of the horse tangler, the horse fixer, with the disedifying scene of the horse dealer trying to fool the purchaser and the purchaser trying to best the horse dealer&mdash;in fact, with horse-trading.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this: let us make up our minds on it.  Do we want a society without trade unions?  I have been an employer all my life and I want to say on my own behalf and on behalf of the Party of which I am the Leader that we do not want a society in this country without free, independent trade unions functioning in it. Second to Parliament itself, we believe that a free, independent trade union movement is the most important element in a free democratic society, and we do not regard the normal functioning of such a movement as horse-trading, or fraud, or any other activity to which a pejorative word can properly be attached.</P>
    <P>That is a very important thing to get clear in our minds.  Nobody wants industrial disputes if they can be avoided.  At least 90 per cent of our people now realise that in this country there are no class distinctions and no classes, simply people who have to live together.  But let us be on our guard against a tendency to undermine existing institutions which constitute a very important part of our society by beginning to adopt the pejorative approach, by suggesting there is something discreditable about them and that the sooner we get rid of them the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is the same detestable mentality as you find among certain people who have begun to describe Dáil Éireann as a talking shop.  Of course Dáil Éireann is a talking shop.  That is what we are here for&mdash;to hear what the Government's proposals are, promptly to expose them to informed criticism so that the people may make a fair <Col N="1232" /> and informed judgement.  But &ldquo;talking shop&rdquo; is a pejorative phrase, and those who want to see parliamentary institutions swept away would reduce our people to the concept of referring to Dáil Éireann as a talking shop.</P>
    <P>It is the same process when we refer to the trade union movement as engaging in horse-trading.  Of course they are bargaining.  Is not that what they are there for?  Is there anything wrong with that any more than there is in talking here in Dáil Éireann? Even that is coming in for its share of criticism by the head of the Government, because any speech made here critical of the Government is a harangue and any speech made in support of the Government is an edifying oration.</P>
    <P>In reference to what the Taoiseach chose to end his speech with today, I should say that we will have two by-elections when we come back, in both of which I think the people will record their grave dissatisfaction with the Government.  After three such reverses, I believe this Government must go.  I believe they will go; I believe they will face a general election because they cannot function any longer as soon as it is manifest that the people do not trust them; and I believe that in the ensuing general election, they will be decisively defeated.  When we come to that general election, we will do then as we did in the last general election&mdash;place our policy in black and white before our people, but we will not do it by let or licence from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word or two to the House on the existing situation in which we find ourselves in relation to our gross national product.  Deputies may have noticed that when the Taoiseach started furnishing us with the statistics, he thought it right at one stage to speak of the gross national product at current prices.  I intervened to ask whether it was at current market prices and he said: &ldquo;Yes, at current market prices.&rdquo;  A very interesting lesson can be learned from the national income and expenditure for 1962, compiled by the Central Statistics Office, page 7424, <Col N="1233" /> recently published and furnished to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware these figures are extremely difficult to follow and their significance very often escapes people not accustomed to perusing them. Nevertheless, it is my duty to bring this aspect of these figures before Dáil Éireann so that those who want to understand them will see the road we are travelling at the moment.  I shall take the figure of gross national product at current prices, in Table A3, and compare it at constant market prices in Table A4.</P>
    <P>In 1953 the figure stood at £525 million approximately.  In 1954, the expenditure at current market prices actually reached a lower figure than expenditure on gross national product at constant 1953 market prices.  Then, an interesting gap begins to open. Perhaps the Taoiseach's next White Paper might be devoted to examining this gap.  In 1955, expenditure on gross national product at current market prices was £10 million more than was reached at constant market prices. Prices were beginning to rise.  The Government of which I was then a member were fighting that rise with all the resources at their disposal for the purpose of preserving stability for reasons which I propose to expound. But in 1956 the gap had grown to £24 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that. We were struggling hard and with considerable success to avoid a gap opening between these two for that gap is measured by the increased cost of living and in 1957 it was about six per cent of the expenditure on gross national product at constant market prices.  In 1958 the gap became £74 million, 15 per cent, consequent on Government policy of increasing the cost of living.  It remained at £87 million in 1959, £92 million in 1960 and £111 million in 1961, and the gap was £151 million, or 25 per cent of the expenditure on the gross national product at constant market prices in 1963. That gap is continuing to widen.  As it widens, the fact emerges that the value of money declined.  The national income expressed in current market prices can rise to any height we care to raise it.  The more we devalue our currency, the higher the national income will go at current market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Go down to the foot of that column and see what the national income was at current prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the increase there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not to be deterred from pursuing the line I am at present travelling.  Expenditure on gross national produce at current market prices can be doubled, trebled or quadrupled as we devalue our currency and we may do that by promoting an increase in cost of everything people have to buy or we may declare a devaluation of currency and reduce its value by a predetermined percentage but the thing that is significant <Col N="1235" /> and important is the expenditure of gross national product at constant market prices.  But it is the difference between these two figures that indicates the decline in the value of money.</P>
      <P>Why is the decline in the value of money a significant and important matter for our consideration?  First, because it imposes a cruel burden on all those living on fixed incomes, notably the old age pensioners and social service beneficiaries, and the House should open its eyes to the fact that in the past month we have fixed the rate of old age pensions at 35/- and we are all sitting back and feeling we have not done so badly for them. The fact is that in terms of purchasing power we are giving the old age pensioners today 11/8, the worth of 11/8 in pre-war money.  Before the war, they were getting 10/- The old age pensioner, in real purchasing power, is today 1/8 better off than in 1939, 24 years ago.</P>
      <P>That is the consequence of forcing up prices and it is the consequence we sought to avoid when we constantly campaigned to keep those prices down. When I heard the Taoiseach talking today about stability of prices and his desire to preserve them and, we must, he said &ldquo;avoid contraction of employment at all costs&rdquo;, I could not help feeling that he looked to me like a fireman called to a fire who discovered his hose was full of petrol because while exhorting everybody to lend a hand to the common task of keeping down costs and preserving a competitive position in international markets, he announced that the cost of government is going up and up and that all the taxes he has put on, including the turnover tax, will not be sufficient to meet the charges that he contemplates will come in course of payment next year, never mind the years thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke of stability of prices in the United Kingdom and the United States despite, he said, the stiffly increasing costs.  I implore Deputies to wake up before it is too late to the significance of that and I rest for my authority for this warning on George Meaney, President of the AFL-CIO in the USA. George Meaney, recently speaking in <Col N="1236" /> New York, said that while there was stability in prices in the US despite rising costs, that stability was purchased by automation and the driving into the ranks of the unemployed of growing multitudes of men and, George Meaney said: &ldquo;I am beginning to ask myself if automation should not be prohibited by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the US, automation is producing this extraordinary phenomenon of five per cent unemployed, five million people without jobs, but I believe that is remediable and I believe the Americans will get around it because what is happening is that all unskilled labour is becoming unemployable and they will train them.  Sooner or later they will tackle that problem, pay these people wages, train them for skilled employment and accept automation with all its economy and reduction in costs as part of their economic life.</P>
    <P>Britain will do the same thing but I challenge the Taoiseach to tell us that we have at our disposal that escape valve because he knows full well we have not.  It is perfectly true that this policy, with the considerable inflationary pressure operating in the US and in Britain, in view of the fact that they both have general elections in the next 12 months and are building up the most favourable picture they can for voters in those countries, means we are getting a considerable backwash of surplus purchasing power from both these great markets.  The danger is that it will not last for ever and the irresponsible thing to do is to proceed on the basis that it will, and not to remember that our concern should be not only to provide employment for our people but permanent employment of a character that we can confidently look forward to maintaining for years ahead.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Taoiseach talking about employment and so on here, I want to ask the House have they allowed themselves to be blinded to the facts.  What are the employment statistics? We have 50,000 unemployed and signing at unemployment bureaux but I have always believed that a much more important statistic is the number of people working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> In 1953, there were 570,000 persons working in this country either in agriculture or industry.  I refer to tables 7 and 8 of the Economic Statistics issued prior to the Budget of 1963 and to the confirmatory paragraph of those figures appearing on page 18 of the same publication: 1953, 570,000 people; 1955, 574,000 people; 1957, 548,000 people; 1959, 542,000 people; 1961, 550,000 people; 1962, 530,000 people and, in 1963, the nearest approximation I can get to the total employment in this country is 525,000 people.  That is 50,000 fewer people working in this country today than there were in 1955.</P>
    <P>Let us keep these fundamental figures in mind because they are profoundly relevant to our present problems.  The truth of it is that there are fewer people working in this country than there were eight years ago and that reduction in employment is represented largely by the 250,000 to 300,000 boys and girls whom we exported from this country to Great Britain during that period.</P>
    <P>I want to say this: We desire to state in the most categorical way possible our opposition to the Fianna Fáil turnover tax which is at present operating in this country.  I want also at this stage emphatically to repudiate the cheap and fraudulent misrepresentation by some of the Government spokesmen that Parties other than the Fianna Fáil Party in this House are opposed to the improved social service payments that are provided for in this year.  The suggestion is that because we opposed and voted against the turnover tax, and would again, we voted against the provision of money for those purposes.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the purchase tax has already resulted in an increase of 2d. on the pint of beer, 2d. on 20 cigarettes, 2d. on a glass of whiskey and 1½d. on a gallon of petrol.  Twopence on a pint of beer produces £2,800,000; 2d. on 20 cigarettes produces £2,170,000; 2d. on a glass of whiskey produces £720,000; 1½d. on a gallon of petrol produces £600,000, giving a total of £6,290,000&mdash;substantially more than the entire cost of all the increased <Col N="1238" /> social service benefits contemplated in this year.  If those taxes had been put on without any reference to any tax on food, fuel or the essential clothing of the people, all the money necessary to pay the increased social service benefits would have been available and there would have been no corresponding increase in the cost of living of the people who are going to get the increases.</P>
    <P>I want to put this case: We are opposed to this tax for the very reason that the steep increase in the cost of living that it has precipitated has launched us into the critical situation which it was the Taoiseach's purpose to describe in his opening observations today.  He told us today he was going to give us a few introductory observations and conclude the debate in an hour's speech.  He has talked for 50 minutes and talked for 50 minutes as a very frightened man.  He need not have been a bit frightened if he did not bring all this trouble on his own head. We told him when he first proposed the turnover tax that this tax would spark off an increase in the cost of living which will initiate an economic dialectic, the end of which may put us in the gravest jeopardy and the Taoiseach's reply at that time was that there was no reason to believe that there would be any rise in the cost of living, that it was quite probable the whole thing would be absorbed by the retail distributive trade without any increase but that if there was an increase, it could not possibly exceed 2½ per cent and that that would be insignificant.</P>
    <P>Who was right?  Are the facts not there staring everybody in the face? Now the Taoiseach says that this is not the fault of the Government at all; this is the fault of the wicked shopkeepers who have availed of this to grow rich.</P>
    <P>Well now, if this were the straight road to riches for the shopkeepers of this country, why were they parading in the streets to oppose it?  Why were they threatened with bloody noses by the Taoiseach on the ground that their opposition to this tax had reached a stage which was almost impermissible under the law?</P>

      <P>Both stories cannot be true any more than the White Paper and his statement today can be true, but they would give enough pabulum for his own supporters.  When the tax was under discussion and he wanted to persuade the people that it was a universal blessing, then the shopkeepers who opposed it were engaged in political harangues and he was going to give them a bloody nose if they persisted in it and he carried the tax in spite of them and he assured Deputy Sherwin, who trotted like a lamb after him into the Lobby&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking now of the miserable, corrupt and unscrupulous attempt on the part of the Government, faced with the consequences of their own policy, of which we forewarned them, and frightened by the public reaction, seeking to shuffle off their responsibility on to the shopkeepers of this country.  I want to tell <Col N="1240" /> the Taoiseach the shopkeepers never wanted this tax.  They do not want it now and, if we get into office&mdash;perhaps the Taoiseach will question this part of our policy?&mdash;we intend to repeal it. Perhaps the Taoiseach will write that down and see if he understands it.  I will tell it to him again in words of one syllable for fear polysyllabic diction might distress him: We mean to end it.  Anytime he wants to come to the country to argue that issue, or that case, if he prefers a monosyllabic word, we will be glad to meet him.</P>
      <P>We oppose it on a second ground, not only because it has raised the cost of living with all the consequent dynamic of economic problems that that has given rise to.  We oppose it on the ground that it has raised the cost of living to those who have no means of protecting themselves, that is, the people with fixed incomes, notably the old age pensioners.  But they are not the only people with fixed incomes. There are a lot of decent respectable people in this country who have given a lifetime of service and who are now living on pensions and people with little savings who have no one to speak for them and are normally forgotten but there is no reason why we should treat them like dirt under the wheels of a monarch's carriage because they are not as vocal as better organised groups.</P>
      <P>We oppose this tax because the whole dialectic of increased cost of living that it has touched off is going to reduce our capacity to compete in foreign markets.  The Taoiseach knows as well as I know that the rising costs that may be temporarily the case in Great Britain and the United States of America or the inflationary pressures there that may create a false facility in merchandising there will not indefinitely endure and we have not got the safety valve that Great Britain and the United States of America have that if our costs rise too high, we can slam them down with automation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our market is not of a character which permits that recourse and the only way in which it could be implemented here would be by throwing hundreds of thousands of industrial workers into emigration.  Even if it <Col N="1241" /> were possible for us to do it, that, in my opinion, would be socially an undesirable development in this country.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that if we fail to maintain our competitive capacity in foreign markets what concerns me primarily is not the profits of those who are engaged in that business, but the fact that they will no longer be able to employ the men and women, and that these jobs will be permanently lost.  The whole business of building up employment in this country, as the Taoiseach has very rightly said, depends on our capacity to export.  He knows as well as I do that it depends on our ability to compete, and he knows as well as I know it that if the cost of living continues to rise and is not stabilised, industry in this country will not be able to compete with other countries wherein we must sell the exportable surplus of our work.</P>
    <P>I would hope and believe that the future of this country is, in many respects, full of hope.  I honestly believe that these hopes cannot be realised unless the gambling mentality of the Taoiseach is dismissed from the Government of this country.  I believe he is a gambler and that he is prepared to make any bluff that comes to his mind in the confident belief that he can rely confidently on the shortness of public memory to get away with it. He made that bluff with the White Paper but he did not get away with it because his hand has been pinned to the table by the printed record of what he professed to be his own belief as a responsible Prime Minister of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a great economic future for this country.  I want again to draw the attention of the House to the continuous use by the Taoiseach of the pejorative word.  I was watching the faces of the Fianna Fáil Deputies when the Taoiseach came to speak of agriculture. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, when they pressed their claims on him, were a very responsible and respectable body of men, influential men whose activities he admired and who made their case and pressed it hard.  When he came to speak of the Federated Union of Employers he was <Col N="1242" /> grateful to them for the efficient way in which they had placed their views before him.  He quoted from their communication to the public and said he was edified by the strength and forcefulness of what they had to say.</P>
    <P>Then his face changed and he said: &ldquo;I want to tell the farmers that if they think they can blackmail me they will have to think again.&rdquo;  What have the farmers done or said that makes them blackmailers?  When the Taoiseach speaks of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions they are sensible negotiators; when he speaks of the Federated Union of Employers they are reasonable and resolute public servants.  What kind of warp is in the Taoiseach's mind?  What is wrong in the farmers' organisations making claims for their people?  Why is it wrong for an organisation that is representing farmers living on 10, 15, 20 or 25 acres of land to come to the Taoiseach and say: &ldquo;If you think that the increase in the cost of living for which you yourself claim responsibility demands a ninth round of wage increases despite your assertion in the White Paper about closing the gap we ask that some increase be granted to the small farmers to enable them to meet the increase in the cost of living for which compensation is being granted to employees in the other branches of our economy&rdquo;?  Where is the blackmail if the farmers make that case?</P>
    <P>Why do we hear again and again that we give £40 million a year to sustain agriculture, that we inject into agriculture half the land annuities and that we further inject the first £25 of rates on the rateable valuation?  Are we to ignore the fact of the tremendous relief given in the 1956 Finance Act by way of income tax and corporation profits tax to our manufacturers?  If we calculate all that how much of an increase does it represent for those who manufacture for that most desirable end of increasing our exports. If you are to judge by what industrialists who are coming in here and industrialists who are in operation here have to say that is the greatest inducement industry ever got.  I do not grudge it to them.  I think it is a good thing to encourage industry but why is <Col N="1243" /> every penny thrown in the teeth of the agricultural community?</P>
    <P>Here again we have the calculated use of the pejorative word, the implication that the farmers are a burden on the nation, that they are a charge of £40 million a year on the nation.  There is no reference to the fact that it is the agricultural industry that is carrying the baby at the present time despite the importance of our industrial exports. If our agricultural exports finished in the morning this country would fold up like a pack of cards.  There would neither be revenue for the Government nor employment for men.</P>
    <P>The only contribution the Taoiseach has made to the farmers is to tell them that they are blackmailers and that he will not be blackmailed.  Why is it blackmail for the farmers to make their case while it is respectable and necessary for other organisations to make the case for their sectors of the community?  I do not want to deter the trade unions from doing their job or to deter the Federated Union of Employers from doing theirs but I claim the right of the farmers' organisations to do, not more, but certainly not less for their members.</P>

      <P>I believe that if we proceed on rational grounds, if we realise that we cannot pile up taxation indefinitely on the economic life of the country without the consequences to which the Taoiseach has just referred, if we try to keep the cost of living reasonably stable and avoid the upset which must ensue if the value of money were to collapse with all the deplorable consequences that would follow, if we realise that what we want in this country is a balance of payments based on competitive trading and not on an effort to conceal temporarily the consequences of an insidious policy which throws our balance of trade into a fundamental imbalance, if we recognise the great potential of the agricultural industry and take the measures necessary to release that potential for the benefit of the country, I believe <Col N="1244" /> this country has a chance.  When I speak of releasing that potential for our country, I mean that we should bring to the farmers now on the land knowledge and know-how as to how best to use it and to get from it the maximum output of which the land is capable.  Our objective should be the maximum in livestock that the land is capable of carrying.  There is no use in giving advice to small farmers, if they cannot afford to take it.  It is desirable to make available to our small farmers credit at terms they can afford to pay and to make loans up to £1,000 free of interest available for schemes to increase production carried out in consultation with the advisory services we intend to provide.</P>
      <P>For that full development of agriculture in this country, the housing of small farmers must be dealt with.  I see that Fianna Fáil have adopted that proposal and intend to give effect to it in a left-handed kind of way.  Whether we or the present Government do it does not matter so long as it is done.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of extra taxation if that is necessary to provide adequate education for all our children because, without it, we fall back into the state of a country the majority of whose people are graded as unskilled workers looking for work in a world where there is no work left for unskilled people to do.  Accordingly, the ideal I set before myself and the Party of which I am Leader is that we should realise a situation in which every boy and girl born into an Irish home will have made available to him or to her the best we can offer in primary, secondary, vocational and university education according to their abilities and their capacity to avail of it and not according to the economic circumstances of the family into which they are born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not underestimate the magnitude of the task in terms of money, teachers or accommodation.  However, in the words of a very great man, at least let the world know that that is now our goal.  It is a goal towards which we can go with great advantage, bearing in mind that at this time there are classrooms in national schools in Dublin city with from 70 to 80 pupils <Col N="1245" /> who are trying to get instruction from one distracted teacher.  Let us never forget when talking about secondary schools, vocational schools and universities that in the last analysis the foundation on which they all rest is the national school.</P>
    <P>When it comes to providing the kind of education we want, let us be sure that we do not spend all our money in order to get golden buildings to contain wooden teachers.  It would be far better to spend the bulk of our money on training golden teachers to man wooden schools until we can afford, bit by bit, to build up the schools and match them to the quality of the teachers.  We have plenty to do and the means to do it but we ought to make up our mind what kind of society and life we want.  I think we have something to teach the world.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think the Taoiseach has come to the conclusion that everything Irish is old-fashioned and bad.  It is a view I do not share.  I prefer a Government so near the people whom they are meant to serve that their members cannot rest while their neighbours are suffering, to a Government who believe that if their neighbours are in a public institute and off the streets it is not reasonable to expect the Government to do much more.</P>
    <P>I thank God for the kind of society into which I was born and reared and in which I hope that I and mine will have the right to live.  I want to see a growing income from which we can provide a higher standard of living for all our people.  I am very conscious of the fact that if we are to have all that income only in terms of money without any regard to real value, the day may come when we shall take our place with the countries of South America where incomes are expressed in terms of millions of cruzeiros but the millionaires are walking the streets in rags.  It is a danger we ought to watch.</P>
    <P>I want an Irish £ in the hands of our people to be able to buy £1 worth of goods.  I want to see our society more and more a society where we have no rich and no poor: substantially, <Col N="1246" /> that is the kind of society we have.  I should like to keep it that way. There is one thing that can disrupt it. Inflation, out of control, is the prince of thieves.  It robs the poor.  It robs the defenceless.  But the mobile speculator is always sound and secure.</P>
    <P>The great danger is that we shall content ourselves with handing illusory benefits to those sections of the community which it is our duty to protect while, as the value of money is quietly eroded, the poor grow poorer and the rich grow richer until Ireland comes to look like Bolivia or Ecuador.  That would be a horrible destiny for this country and it is one against which I confidently call upon the Deputies of this House to set their faces.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Taoiseach feels ready to bring Deputy Sherwin to the ordeal of a discussion of the issues on the hustings of Dublin city, I shall be glad and happy to meet him there.  He may find the argument we have to submit difficult to understand.  He may find the printed policy which we shall circulate to every voter difficult to read for he has never favoured them with a similar attention himself.  I think the people will understand the issues very well and will give us their votes. Whatever their verdict, we shall accept it cheerfully.  If it is what we anticipate it will be, we shall take over the Taoiseach's responsibility after the next election without panic, without fraud but with a modest steadfast confidence in the capacity of the country and of our people to survive.</P>

      <P>It has indeed been a very eventful year.  Whilst I did not expect that the Taoiseach would or could, even in an hour or one and a half hours, touch on all the events which we consider to be important, there were some notable omissions&mdash; whether by design or otherwise, I do not know.  I listed, anyway, what, to my mind, were important events during the present calendar year.  There was, first, the refusal of Britain's application for membership of the Common Market, and of course the consequent effect on Ireland's application; second, the document which was debated in <Col N="1247" /> this House, <i>Closing the Gap;</i> third, the turnover tax on which we had many major debates; fourth, something which did not arrive in the Dáil at all, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion;</i> and fifth, the ninth round of wage and salary increases to which the Taoiseach devoted a substantial part of his speech today. Might I say in passing that one of the most important events was the visit and the inspiring words of the late President Kennedy who addressed the members of the Dáil and Seanad on 28th June.</P>
      <P>I propose to talk about these matters for the purpose of eliciting a little more information from the Taoiseach when he replies.  I must confess that listening to the speeches of the Taoiseach and his Ministers during the year, I was slightly confused because I still have to make up my mind whether or not the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party have decided whether we are in a period of boom or of gloom.  The Taoiseach's speech today was interspersed with boom and gloom.  Of course we have exaggerated claims by Ministers as to the progress of the country.  We have distorted figures with regard to employment, unemployment and emigration.  I try to be as factual as I can when I talk about figures for employment, unemployment and emigration.  I think it is wrong that people like the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance should put an entirely wrong complexion on employment, unemployment and emigration figures.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach in reply to a question gave us the real figures for emigration.  The figure for the nine months ending September of this year is something like 14,000.  I checked the figure and got a figure of 14,200. Then we have the stupidity of the Minister for Transport and Power telling us that up to August the net emigration was 5,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just let me explain. The figure changes from month to month.  The only reliable figure is at the end of February.</P>

    <Col N="1248" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to say is that the Minister should not attempt to paint a wrong picture because during that month there were many thousands of emigrants at home who had not returned.  The summer months never provide a true figure for the position.  I am not going to comment on the figure of 14,000 because we could wax eloquent on the emigration position and make comparisons with 1947, 1956, 1960 and so on.  It is deplorable that these people should still have to emigrate.  The Minister for Finance in a recent speech boasted of the fact that at the end of June or July, only 30,000 were registered as unemployed and that when the inter-Party Government left office, the number was 100,000.  He must know that it is entirely dishonest to compare January with the summer months, especially those summer months in which the Employment Period Order operates.  If the Taoiseach and his Ministers want to paint a picture, they should not give distorted figures like that.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that unemployment still stands at 50,000.  I do not think that a figure of 50,000 represents a great deal of progress.  It seems to me that the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> which has been described by the Taoiseach as being successful, cannot be deemed to have been successful when one reminds oneself that after five years of that Programme, we still have a figure of 50,000 unemployed which will, as it does every year, mount up to February and March and possibly to April.  The Taoiseach should be a little clearer if he wants to give the picture to the people.  I know he cannot stand up and announce that there is a period of boom because the whole House will agree with him that so far as achievements are concerned, we are still very far off the target and that we cannot afford to be too optimistic, but at least we should have the true picture so that the people will know the task that confronts them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused at one notable omission from the Taoiseach's speech &mdash;and I could make the same comment in regard to the speech by the <Col N="1249" /> Leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash; because this time last year, and for the past two years, all of our general discussions centred around the Common Market.  Where has the Common Market gone?  Where is our enthusiasm to join Europe?  Where is the talk about our cultural relations with Europe, the military and social obligations, and the industrial advantages to be gained from the Common Market?  The Taoiseach will have to describe what exactly the Government's attitude and their feelings are now with regard to the Common Market.  I do not know what contact he has with the British Government on their application and what its future is.  It seems to me that there has been a lessening of enthusiasm, even within the Conservative Party, for association with the Six Common Market countries, maybe because of their rejection, maybe because they have evolved a different policy of trying to build up trade with other countries, particularly in the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should not discount the possibility, or the certainty, of a different Government in Britain within the next six months.  It must be obvious to everyone from the speeches of the leaders of the British Labour Party that they are not nearly so enthusiastic about entry into the Common Market, on the terms laid down, as even the Tory Government were.  It might also be said that the Common Market, especially on the subject of agriculture, does not seem to have harmonious discussions.  Whether or not the British Government are going to be influenced by that, we do not know, but what is perturbing to me is that so far as the protection of Irish industry is concerned, we are proceeding on the assumption that we will be members before 1970.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assured us last year, maybe not in the month of December, that we would be members of the European Economic Community by January, 1963.  It is not his fault that we were not.  I suppose it is the fault of President de Gaulle and the French Government, but I should like to pose <Col N="1250" /> the question posed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the late Deputy Norton some four or five weeks ago: Is it wise for us to strip ourselves of the protection of Irish industry at the rate of ten per cent per year in the beginning and 15 per cent thereafter, as if we were to become members of the Common Market in 1970, while, in that very hard exercise, Irish industry and Irish workers obtain no advantage whatsoever?  The House will readily admit, I think, that we had a policy of protection up to about three or four years ago and it seemed as if we were going to continue that policy for a very long time.  Then came the Treaty of Rome and the establishment of the Common Market and we had to decide, because of our close association economically with Britain, to make application for membership of the Common Market.  Is it too much of a gamble now?  Are we gambling unduly on the assumption that we will become members of EEC by 1970?</P>
    <P>Everybody has agreed, and the evidence is there, that the reduction by the first ten per cent did not have any appreciable effect on Irish industry and on the employment of workers in industry.  The second, third and fourth will have very serious repercussions as far as industry and as far as employment are concerned.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will have to examine the position very closely.  The Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach will have to make a reappraisal of the position to see whether or not it is worth our while to engage in this exercise, on the chance, and I believe it now could be a chance, that Britain and we will become members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>This time last year, and for 12 months before that, all of us were concerned about the effect of the dismantling of the tariffs on employment. CIO committees were established.  They were charged with finding out the effect on production and on employment of the stripping of these industries of protection.  Certain recommendations were made.  I should like the Taoiseach, when he replies to the debate, to give us a broad outline as to what <Col N="1251" /> these industries are doing to rationalise, to provide for greater co-operation, and generally to safeguard industry and enable it to compete in a better way, taking appropriate measures to ensure there will be the minimum of redundancy.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think we have forgotten all this since General de Gaulle gave his famous refusal to the British application last year.  I know the Minister for External Affairs had some talks in Brussels recently, but the communiqué conveyed nothing, of course, to those of us who questioned him here in the House.  I should like the Taoiseach to say now if our application and our entry into EEC are still dependent on the admission of Great Britain.  If we fail, has the Taoiseach considered some form of association? I ask that knowing full well the disadvantages there are in association as against full membership.  A great many people believe we should have some association with Europe.</P>
    <P>The publication of the White Paper on incomes in February provided, of course, the first shock.  It also provided the material for the first major debate in this House in this year.  I do not know why the Taoiseach or the Government decided to publish this particular document.  It seemed to the members of the Labour Party and to the members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the Government were once more attempting to interfere in the fixing of wages.  These allegations were, of course, denied, but a responsible body like the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which could not be deemed to have any political motives in their dealings with the Taoiseach, were, I think, in a better position than anybody else to judge whether or not this White Paper was another attempt to interfere with the fixing of wages.</P>
    <P>There was also an inference in that particular document, and allegations by Ministers and the Government, outside this House of course, that the eighth round of increases was responsible for this imaginary gap.  At that particular time, peculiarly enough, there was no talk at all about a ninth <Col N="1252" /> round of wage increases but this reference to wages in the publication of this document got both the Congress and the workers contemplating on and talking about a ninth round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in recent weeks has, I think, tried to be helpful but his whole record in the past 12 months, as far as wages and salaries are concerned, has been one of blunder.  He has blundered badly in all this.  I do not think he should have interfered to the extent he did because, whilst people may have certain views about the eighth round of wage increases, and while people may talk about all the strikes that ensued, by and large, the trade unions of this country, particularly the main body, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the employers have ironed out their difficulties and produced what may not have been a mathematical formula but was certainly a broad agreement as to what the increases should be from time to time.  The publication of the White Paper and the speeches made in this House caused the trade unions to become antagonised.  I shall come back later to this question of wage increases, the effect on the economy, and the justification for a certain type of increase.</P>
    <P>The next notable event was the introduction of the turnover tax.  I do not want in this debate to reiterate all the arguments we in the Labour Party have against the turnover tax but we retain the original view we expressed on the day the Budget proposals were announced and the views we expressed in the subsequent debate on the Finance Bill.  Mark you, not alone were the members of the Labour Party astonished by the introduction of this tax but members of the Government Party were astounded at the idea of a tax on foodstuffs, on the necessaries of life, and particularly on medicines.  On that occasion, we pointed out the effect on the lower paid workers, on those on fixed incomes, on those in receipt of pensions. Despite the increases granted in the Budget to the social welfare groups, the majority of them are worse off now than they were prior to the Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> All the arguments that were made from the Government benches, and particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, were based on the assumption that the cost of living would increase by 2½ per cent. Indeed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce on one occasion described what that would be in terms of spending by a man with a wife and four children, and balanced against that the children's allowances granted from 1st November; he broke just lineball. That was on the assumption, of course, that the increase in the cost of living would be 2½ per cent.  Because it is more than 2½ per cent&mdash;I should not like to put a figure on it, but it is certainly more than four per cent&mdash; these people have lost out.  It may only be a matter of pennies in the case of old age pensioners.  But pennies are very important.  Sixpence or a shilling is very important to somebody in receipt of 35/- a week, or somebody on unemployment assistance who has even less.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Taoiseach, although it has not been said directly by Government spokesmen, that this is to be a permanent tax.  I also gather from the Taoiseach's remarks, although it has not been said explicitly, that if the Government feel next year that more money is needed, the turnover tax will be jacked up.  The Taoiseach will have to think again, especially in respect of foodstuffs.  Is it not dastardly that to pay for better health services, better education and future economic progress, it is necessary to tax bread?</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party strenuously objected to taxing foodstuffs, medicines and certain types of clothing, we admitted during these debates that we would not object to a tax on articles not strictly necessary to individuals or families.  In particular, we would not object to a tax on luxury items.  The Taoiseach would be right in telling me that relatively little can be got from these items.  But, nevertheless, some money can be got from them.  My criticism of the Government is that, when you suggest a tax that may bring in only a small amount of money, you are told it would not be worth while. <Col N="1254" /> Yet all these things add up.  Every effort should be made to ensure that foodstuffs are not taxed.</P>
    <P>The only defence the Taoiseach has for the turnover tax is the cry: &ldquo;What would you do?  How would you raise the money?&rdquo; That is pretty good when you are standing on the ditch asking a theoretical question.  On many occasions, when the present Taoiseach was in opposition, he said that the business of the Opposition was to criticise, and that it was the Government's responsibility to provide plans for the raising of money.  He is a little too nave.  We are only four months away from the next Budget, and according to the speeches of Ministers, we are going to engage in more ventures which will cost money.  Is the Taoiseach prepared now, four months before the Budget, to tell the people what new taxes and new increases there will be?  It is not unreasonable to ask him that question&mdash;to say now, even before the by-elections, what new taxes he will introduce to pay for the projects spoken of.  It is nave for him to suggest that we should provide in specific terms proposals for him for the raising of money.  Mr. Harold Wilson, who expects to be the next Prime Minister in Britain, is not telling the British people how he is going to tax them.  I do not remember the former Taoiseach, now the President, telling the people prior to the election of 1957 that he was going to withdraw the food subsidies.  In October, 1961, the present Taoiseach did not say he was contemplating a purchase tax, a turnover tax or a sales tax.</P>
    <P>One of the differences between the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party and, I suppose, the Fine Gael Party is that we believe there has been too much emphasis on indirect taxation here in recent years.  I quoted to the Taoiseach some time ago the proportion of direct as against indirect taxation in this country, compared with other countries.  I accept to some extent that we would never be able to secure by way of direct taxation the proportion secured in countries such as Germany, France and Great Britain.  But there is money to be got there.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in describing the turnover tax as a lazy tax.  It was too <Col N="1255" /> simple.  If it is such a good tax and such an equitable tax, why did the Taoiseach not think of it before?  I think the Government got a fit of laziness before the last Budget and did not explore all the possibilities of raising extra money.  They did what a child would do if asked to get money&mdash;they taxed everything.  This is not good enough.  Much more is demanded of the Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In his Budget the Minister for Finance said and many people believed him, that the traditional sources of revenue had been exhausted, that if he put any more on cigarettes, beer and tobacco, there would be a diminishing return.  But what has happened now? Cigarettes have gone up by 2d.; petrol by 1½d.; the bottle of stout by 1d.; the pint by 1d.; whiskey, I understand, by 2d. per glass.  I have no figures to show whether the consumption has been less since 1st November.  But I would bet that for the next 12 months the consumption of these commodities will not go down, and the possibility is that it may go up.  On that the Government have thrown away £6½ million.  They will get about 2½ per cent of that on the turnover tax.  The public are paying the extra 2d., but who is getting it?  The Government are getting only 2½ per cent on the turnover.</P>
    <P>The Government also threw away money in the reduction of surtax and the various adjustments which provide that now fewer people are paying surtax than there were three years ago. There used to be about 10,000, but now it has gone down to a few thousand.  It may be small money but over the past few years millions of pounds have been collected in that way.  Yet the Fianna Fáil Government have said: &ldquo;We do not want it; we will throw it away.&rdquo;  They abolished the tax on dances&mdash;a booming business now.  These are all sources of revenue that certainly should have been considered carefully before it was decided to tax tea, bread, butter, sugar, meat and so on.  As I said, the difference between the Labour Party and the other Parties is that we believe there <Col N="1256" /> has been too much emphasis on indirect taxation, which, as shown by the turnover tax, falls more heavily on those least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>We had conflicting speeches from Ministers on the turnover tax.  I do not blame them, because they did not know what the effect of the tax would be.  Some of them said prices would go down; others said they would reach their own level; and still others said the increase would be only 2½ per cent.  As time went on, even the members of the Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party became rather afraid of the effect of the tax on prices.  I do not know if it was in anticipation of the Cork by-election or not, but in the newspapers it was said the Taoiseach had given the green light.  Nobody wanted the green light at all.  The trade unions were not waiting for any green light from the Taoiseach or any member of the Government.  Ever since the proposal was announced, the trade unions had been preparing their demands.  It was obvious that prices would rise and that the cost of living index figure would go up to such an extent as to warrant their preparing and serving demands for increasing wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>I took exception to the term the Taoiseach used when he spoke about the past negotiations between the trade unions and the employers.  He described these negotiations as horse-trading and he also pretended that during all these negotiations, especially on the eighth round, we had very many strikes all over the country.  That is incorrect and if the Taoiseach were to seek the information from the various trade unions or through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, he would see the incidence of strikes during that period was very low indeed.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. S. Dunne</b> asked the Minister for Health what improvements have been made in the accommodation provided by the Dublin Health Authority for the homeless families living at Griffith Barracks in order to bring that accommodation up to accepted reasonable living conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the building which was maintained by the health authority at Island Street for homeless and destitute persons had to be evacuated recently because of its structural condition and alternative accommodation was obtained at Griffith Barracks.  At present this accommodation is being availed of by 32 persons&mdash;comprising 18 women and 14 children.</P>
      <P>The accommodation being used by the health authority at Griffith Barracks consists of a three-storey army block and a single storey canteen situated a few yards away from the block.  There are five separate dormitories in the army block and on the ground floor there are two medium sized rooms previously used for storage purposes by the Defence Forces and now being adapted for the provision of laundry and washing facilities.  The following improvements to the building have been effected by the health authority:</P>
      <P> (a) a Kosangas cooker has been installed;</P>
      <P>(b) a Kosangas ring for the heating of babies' bottles has been made available;</P>
      <P>(c) two water heaters have been provided to supply hot water to wash-hand basins;</P>
      <P>(d) plastic baths have been supplied for the bathing of children;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> (e) the central heating, which previously went off at 5 p.m., has been extended to 24 hours daily;</P>
    <P>(f) two substantial sinks and drainers have been provided and, to improve laundry facilities further, a multi-point Kosangas heater to supply running hot water will be installed within the next few days.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the accommodation now being used is to provide temporary shelter and maintenance for persons who cannot provide such shelter and maintenance by other means.  It is not intended that it should be used to provide permanent living accommodation for families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say how much I welcome the improvements made by the health authority in this case.  However, is the Minister aware that the main grievance of the people up there is of the break-up of family life, the husband and wife being separated and also the husband being separated from the children except for a short period and that is likely to go on for some time until alternative housing accommodation is provided?  Is there any possibility that the health authority could provide some form of cubicle accommodation so that these families could have some kind of privacy while they are waiting for the housing accommodation which I understand the housing department intends to provide for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that this was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, one made to deal with an entirely unexpected situation in which the Dublin Health Authority have had to improvise accommodation. Having regard to their resources and the unexpectedness of the situation which caused the evacuation of the premises in which these people normally live, they have dealt with the situation very well.  I understand they are endeavouring to provide cubicle accommodation, but the main point we must bear in mind in this regard is that this accommodation is intended to be temporary only and that the Dublin housing authority cannot accept responsibility for immediately <Col N="1261" /> providing houses for these people to the detriment of others who have been on the regular waiting list for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is universally admitted to be an emergency situation, does the Minister not think it would be a suitable thing if the appropriate Department would inform the health authority that, if there was any exceptional cost involved in temporary structural alterations which would permit the reunion of these families at this time even for a limited period, the Government would see them indemnified? Would the Minister not agree it would be a desirable gesture that we should make an exceptional move to help the Dublin Health Authority after they have done their best to give them shelter and warmth and that we should ask them to go further at the Government's expense in order to provide facilities which would reunite the family?</P>

But there is one grave difficulty on which I believe all the Minister's colleagues will join with me in deploring&mdash;that the families are broken up.  I think it is in our power to reunite these families.  Would it not be worthwhile, in these special circumstances, to incur some small additional expenditure as a human gesture to reunite the families and as recognition of the fact that there is more than a roof and heat involved?

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the letter referred to and another letter from the same person published shortly before that.  The author has not communicated with me at any stage and I had not heard of him before the publication of his first letter.</P>
      <P>From inquiries I have made, I understand that the gentleman in question was a patient in the hospital more than three years ago and has not since been a patient there.  After so long a lapse of time, it would be difficult to confirm or to refute any information which he may be in a position to supply, based on his personal experience.</P>
      <P>The holding of a sworn inquiry is an expensive procedure but if the author of the letters furnishes me with a statement on oath confirming his allegations and if confirmatory statements, also on oath, from not less than six persons who had been patients in the hospital within the past 12 months are forthcoming, I would be prepared to submit these statements to the Dublin Health Authority for their observations and, in the light of such observations, to consider whether a sworn inquiry should now be held.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the health authority and to the staff of the hospital, I feel that I should say that over the last few years I have on many occasions heard of tributes paid by ex-patients and their relatives to the high standard of treatment and care afforded to patients while in this hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  I would point out that the law as contained in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1961, provides that where, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, property has passed into the beneficial ownership, possession, occupation or control of any person in consequence of an arrangement designed <Col N="1266" /> to avoid or reduce liability to stamp duty at the £25 per cent rate, the Revenue Commissioners may requisition a statement containing such particulars of the passing as they may require.  The statement in question is chargeable with stamp duty at the £25 per cent rate as if it were a conveyance on sale of the property for a consideration in money equal to the value of the fee simple interest free from all incumbrances.  Appropriate action under the section in question is already being taken in certain cases which have come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The voting power of the shares is frozen by requiring that at least two persons would be a show of hands when a vote is called for and, therefore, if there is only one Irish shareholder, he is not able to get two people to vote without calling on the assistance of a foreigner.</P>

      <P>It is hoped that some allotments on these two estates will be feasible by next spring.  Completion of resale proposals was deferred in expectation of further acquisitions in the locality but these did not prove practicable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the Town Clerk in Portlaoise has made representations to the Land Commission on two occasions on behalf of Portlaoise Town Commissioners in regard to the payment of fair tolls in Portlaoise; and that he has not received any reply to these representations; and if he will cause immediate inquiries to be made as to why the Commissioners have been ignored in regard to their inquiries.</P>

      <P>A full reply to the Town Clerk's letter of 14th November, 1963, issued on 2nd instant.  His second letter&mdash;by way of reminder&mdash;was dated 27th November, 1963, but was not received in the Land Commission until 3rd December, 1963.  In fact the information sought by the Town Clerk had been previously conveyed to him in 1951 within two days of his asking for it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of established civil servants in his Department who retired over the last ten years for health reasons with less than 30 years' service, and the pension payable to each; if he is aware that temporary servants who receive old age pensions are in receipt of much larger pensions; and if, in the light of this, he will take steps to have this position put right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past ten years 70 established civil servants who <Col N="1281" /> had less than 30 years' service retired on health grounds from my Department. Thirty-two of these had not sufficient service to qualify under the Superannuation Acts for a pension but they received short service gratuities which ranged from £25 3s. 4d. to £557 14s. 1d. Ten of the 38 pensioners have since died.  Particulars of the pensions payable to the remaining 28 are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.  The pensions payable to established civil servants who retire on health grounds are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Superannuation Acts (1834 to 1963).  The question of making any amendment to these Acts is one for initiation by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Particulars of the pensions currently being paid to 28 established civil servants of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who retired for health reasons since 1st January, 1954, with less than 30 years' service and the lump sum gratuities which were paid to them on retiral.</P>

      <P>When speaking earlier, I referred to the accommodation provided for the families in connection with the housing problems which we have been discussing.  Inadvertently, I mentioned some who were accommodated in the Mendicity Institute.  I should have mentioned the Night Shelter.  Perhaps the Chair will allow me to say in that connection that the Mendicity Institute is not an institution which provides accommodation at all but is one of the oldest and most respected charities in the city, concerned with providing meals for poor people which they do to the admiration of all their neighbours.  It is an institution of whose voluntary and beneficial activities all good citizens of this State are deeply cognisant.</P>

      <P>Above all the subjects <Col N="1300" /> with which the Taoiseach dealt this morning he appeared to express more concern about the ninth round of wage increases than any other matter. The Taoiseach must take his fair share of responsibility, not alone for the ninth round of wage increases but for the impasse which has now arisen in the negotiations.  He is responsible for the introduction of the turnover tax which caused prices to increase even, to use his own figure, by three or four per cent up to the beginning of November. I do not know what the Taoiseach's motives were in the past 12 months in appearing to try to fix wages or to determine wage patterns but it seems that all his efforts were blunders from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, from the time he introduced the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> up to the time he sent a directive to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with regard to the possibility of wage increases.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's message to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was described in some newspaper as &ldquo;giving the green light&rdquo;.  The trade unions, the workers generally and especially the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did not need any green light from the Taoiseach.  In anticipation of the turnover tax and having regard to other factors they had been preparing wage claims for months before the Taoiseach gave his famous green light.  The trade unions are not fooled by him.  It is an impertinence on the part of the Taoiseach to try to pretend to the workers and other members that he alone determines when workers should seek an increase in wages or salary.</P>
      <P>In November last, the Taoiseach wrote to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is obvious from the second paragraph of his letter that he intended to fix the rate of wage increase at about 7 or 8 per cent.  Here is what he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the confident expectation that the country's present rate of economic growth will be maintained, and in conformity with the Government's policy that its benefits should be fairly distributed amongst the whole community, a further upward revision of wages and salaries might <Col N="1301" /> now be safely envisaged on a scale which would provide compensation to all wage and salary earners for whatever rise in the general price level may follow on the introduc-of the Turnover Tax, and also to such further extent as would represent their fair share of the estimated expansion of national resources in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach confirmed this to me this morning when he stated that the increase should be around 8 per cent. He reckons that the turnover tax in itself would provide for an increase in price to the extent of 3 to 4 per cent and that the anticipated increase in gross national product would be 3 to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach, in this, is committing a very grave blunder because by suggesting that the unions should compensate themselves to the extent of 8 per cent, he hamstrung them immediately before they had entered into negotiations with the employers. We must remember that it was the Taoiseach who encouraged the trade unions and the employers to get together to try to come to some agreement as to what the ninth round of wage and salary increases should be.  Here, on 11th November, before they started to discuss increases, he suggested that the increase should be from 7 to 8 per cent.  It was a major blunder on his part and to some extent it was an impertinence.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointed out to him in very clear language that they resented his interference.</P>
    <P>In February last, when discussing the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>, the Taoiseach was told the trade unions would never agree to that sort of interference where it appeared that the Taoiseach or any Minister or the Government as a whole were attempting to determine what wages should be, and so on.  It must be remembered as well, that around that time some employers had offered as much as ten per cent in preliminary discussions on wage increases.  The Taoiseach&mdash;the man who wanted to appear as the one who directed when wage increases be given&mdash;wanted to confine it to eight <Col N="1302" /> per cent.  It appears to me that he has tried to be all things to all men.  On the one hand, he tells the workers they can go ahead now and compensate themselves for an increase in the gross national product and in prices, while, on the other hand, he intimates to employers that eight per cent is the figure.  I think a seven to eight per cent increase is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Last February, the Taoiseach expressed his opinion as to how wage and salary increases should be calculated.  He said workers were entitled to compensate themselves for any increase in production and also that they would be entitled to compensate themselves for price increases. In the past two years, the gross national product has increased and it is two years ago since the eighth round of wage increases was negotiated.  It has been suggested that the eighth round was responsible for the gap, the mythical gap, talked about in this White Paper, a gap that it was subsequently admitted, by inference, by the Taoiseach did not exist even at the time he was talking about it. The gross national product increased by 2½ per cent and it is fairly certain that it will have increased by from 4 per cent in 1963.  That is a total of 6½ per cent in the two years.  Prices since the end of 1961, since the eighth round of wage increases, increased to the tune of some 5½ per cent to six per cent.  Therefore on the Taoiseach's formula, wage and salary earners who are now trying to negotiate increases will surely be entitled to at least 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seems to have some passion for controlling wages.  He did it, and I suppose we must admit successfully in that he had the force of law behind him, with the Wages Standstill order and he attempted it again in 1947 when he had legislation prepared to introduce a wage freeze.  The Taoiseach may have tried to be helpful in recent times but he has blundered around and has upset the relationship that I am sure there would have been between workers and employers if he had not attempted to hamstring them by suggesting that seven per cent or eight per cent was a sufficient increase, <Col N="1303" /> when one has regard to increases in prices and the increase in gross national product.  I am sure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions do not object to his assistance in matters like this but as far as I can see it has not been assistance but an attempt at dictation and the trade unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are certainly not going to stand for that.</P>
    <P>The last item I mentioned as being an outstanding event during the year was the publication by the Government of their <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I do not know whether this Programme has been received with a lot of enthusiasm. Certainly I do not know of any sections who have been enthusiastic about it.  The first Programme, I suppose, was to some extent an experiment in the idea of having a programme at all.  It was not a revolutionary Programme which contained any major changes in behaviour by the Government.  Neither did it suggest any new methods but there is this to be said about it, that the forecast that was made, as far as an increase in the gross national product was concerned, was fairly accurate but it was not very difficult to be accurate in regard to that because it was merely the forecast of of any normal economist, having regard to the circumstances not alone in this country but in the world generally.  No matter what we say about policies of one side or the other, they are influenced greatly by outside events and they are particularly influenced by the State of the economy in Great Britain.  I must say that as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, when they look back to 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957 they did not accept, but I am sure they will accept now, that our economy is dependent to a large extent on and influenced by outstanding economic factors, particularly in Britain.</P>
    <P>If there had been anything revolutionary in this new Programme, people would have been talking about it, but the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Irish Industries, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and all major associations including Macra na <Col N="1304" /> Feirme and the National Farmers' Association did not seem to be particularly inspired by it.  It is not that it was not a good Programme; it was again merely a forecast of what was going to happen.  It is a forecast which any economist could make.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we do not regard it as being too ambitious. It provides for an extra 78,000 jobs by 1970, compared with 1960.  This represents an increase of 8,000 new jobs per year.  That will not be spectacular progress by 1970 and I wonder why the Government did not set their targets higher.</P>
    <P>The provision of an extra 8,000 jobs per year, or 7,800 to be exact, will not provide for the difficulties with regard to unemployment when one remembers not alone the flight from the land but the natural increase in population and our desire to see emigration cut to a minimum.  It will mean that by 1970 we will have an unemployment rate of about 3½ per cent.  I cannot remember what it is now but I suppose it would be in the region of five per cent or six per cent for the whole year on average and I would not regard it as spectacular progress to say that after ten years our unemployment rate would be cut to 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>In fact, in this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> there are no new policy proposals as such.  There are objectives and I suppose we should be grateful for even the expression of objectives.  A lot has been said about agricultural policy and the state of agriculture over the years.  I do not speak as an expert on agriculture&mdash; quite the contrary&mdash;but it seems to me that we have had no progress whatever in agriculture when one realises that there were 40 odd years during which an Irish Parliament had responsibility for agricultural affairs.  Surely there must be something new and revolutionary that could be done for the agricultural industry to put it on the footing on which people on both sides of the House would like to see it?</P>
    <P>As far as industry is concerned, there is no new policy.  There is a continuation of encouragement of foreign industrialists, a continuation of the <Col N="1305" /> financial incentive by way of grant, loan, tax remission, and so on.  That is purely a continuation of things to which all of us subscribed, many of which were formulated, not by a Fianna Fáil Government but by an inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any radical advance or any radical improvement in unemployment and the provision of new jobs, there will have to be, I believe, a different approach to agriculture and to industry.  We have often stated from these benches that whilst we believe that, as long as private enterprise can do the job, it should be allowed to do it, nevertheless where private enterprise either refuses to or is unable to do the job, then the State should take a hand.  That is being done to some extent by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was done by the inter-Party Government in the limited time during which they were in government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not I should say I was impressed when the Taoiseach said about this time last year that the time had come for a move to the left.  He just made that statement.  There was subsequently no action, but he has shown his &ldquo;leftishness&rdquo; on occasions, the &ldquo;leftishness&rdquo; of the establishment of many of the State and semi-State companies, semi-State companies that were established under a Cumann na nGaedheal Government as well.  In my opinion, these have been successful ventures.  There are perhaps some that can be shown to be incapable of paying for themselves, some that can be shown to be a burden on the taxpayers; but, by and large, the major ones of these 57 or 60 odd semi-State industries have been successful.</P>
    <P>If we have a situation, therefore, wherein we want more jobs for our people, wherein we want to cut down on unemployment and stop emigration, then surely, if private enterprise cannot do the job, it is legitimate to expect the Government to do it, to expect the Government to take a stronger hand in the promotion of industry.  Let me quote once more the example of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  On the closure of the Great Northern Railway <Col N="1306" /> shops at Dundalk, Dundalk was confronted with a situation in which 1,000 people would be rendered unemployed. The Government took action, but they were somehow ashamed to say it was Government action.  They tried to pretend it was private enterprise.  But the Government provided all the money.  They appointed the directors. Confronted with a situation in which 1,000 people would be unemployed, the Government stepped in and did the job.  There are pockets in the country where we have not, perhaps, thousands, but certainly hundreds and I suggest seriously that, because private enterprise does not provide for these people, it is the bounden duty of the State and the moral responsibility of the Government to act.</P>
    <P>I do not see in this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> any evidence at all of a shift to the left.  I do not know whether the Tánaiste would approve of anybody talking about the left but, in any case, the Taoiseach announced recently that the time had come for a shift to the left. There is no evidence of that in this Programme.  There is all the encouragement in the world for the Government to go somewhat to the left in the establishment of ways and means to provide employment and to help the economy further.  The Programme states that the Government can only assist, guide and persuade.</P>
    <P>I freely concede at once that, as far as the previous Government were concerned and as far as this Government are concerned, they have continued and introduced policies of generous assistance to industry, generous assistance to private enterprise but, with all that generous ssistance, we have not got the results we should.  They have assisted, but we have not got the results.  They can guide and persuade.  I do not know how they can persuade.  They may guide in their advisory services not alone in relation to industry but in relation to agriculture also, but they seem to be reluctant to persuade.</P>
    <P>When we asked what would be done in respect of industry which refuses to face up to the realities of our possible membership of the European Economic <Col N="1307" /> Community, we got no satisfaction from the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Government showed a complete reluctance to do anything.  They invoked private enterprise and the rights of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I believe in private enterprise so long as it does the job.  I believe more especially in a combination of private enterprise and Government co-operation. Where you cannot get that, surely it is the bounden duty of the Government to ensure that the objectives contained in this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will be achieved.  The Programme envisages an increase in the proportion of taxation to national income.  We recognise that to do all the things that need to be done, all the things we demand, needs money.  We are prepared to face up to the raising of money.  We have shown that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, when we are satisfied that the money which we are expected to vote will be devoted towards the proper objectives.  We voted in the Budget for all the money necessary to pay all the increases in social welfare benefits.  We refused to vote for the turnover tax because that tax involved what we knew would be a heavy imposition on ordinary people. We thought it was wrong.  We thought it was immoral to tax foodstuffs.  We refused to believe that the Second <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was dependent upon the exacting of a tax on bread, on butter, on tea and on sugar.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat what I said this morning: as far as we are concerned, if taxation is to be raised, if there are to be increases in prices because of taxation on certain items which we regard as non-essential, then the Labour Party will give their support; but we want to ensure, above all, that those who are able to pay most will pay most.  We want to ensure that there will be less emphasis in future on indirect taxation and more emphasis on direct taxation.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave us this morning a very comprehensive review of the magnificent progress made in every phrase of our economic life in 1963. The position now is that there is much more money available for each and every one of the Estimates.  I should like to deal with a few of these, in particular with those that impinge on my own constituency, especially the housing of our people.  This Party are very proud of the progress achieved in housing.  We have instituted loans and grants to enable almost all sections of the community to provide themselves with better houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be put off what I want to say.  We have provided the most essential ingredients for better housing&mdash;the finance.  We have given every encouragement, both at Government and local authority level, to help people provide better houses for themselves and their families.  I want to contrast that with the disastrous position which obtained in 1957 when our people were fleeing from the country, when there were 1,800 vacant houses in Dublin because the people had to leave since no work was available.  In my own constituency of Cavan, the housing grants were stopped by the local authority in midwinter because no money was available in the Local Loans Fund.  It is all very well for Deputy O'Higgins to interrupt, but he was a Minister in that Coalition Government which left that trail of misery and woe behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the then Minister for Finance who presided at the meeting in Dublin to which the county managers were summoned.  He took the chair, not the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government was put on the wee stool and was left one <Col N="1309" /> side looking on.  The then Minister for Finance told his Department that they must cut out grants and not undertake any new commitments, that the position was serious.  We in Cavan did not know how serious it was.  We knew it before the middle of 1957 when, even though they had an overall majority of 14, the Coalition broke up, not because of anything happening outside but because of what was happening inside.  They were following the unsound principle of trying to provide services without providing the money&mdash;a policy doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> of December, 1956, it is reported that the local authority directed the stopping of housing grants.  Again in February, 1957, we had the heading that the banks were refusing to provide money. That was the deplorable position in which the people found themselves in 1957.  Unfortunate small farmers trying to erect much needed dwelling-houses could not get grants or loans.  All this is very quickly forgotten by the people because of the present great housing drive.  Our county council had since then to pay the new housing grants not paid in 1956 and are now paying all grants.  The Government are to increase housing grants for farmers up to £25 valuation by 50 per cent, and on a graded basis afterwards.  That is a welcome change from the position that obtained in 1956.</P>
    <P>This picture may be depressing for the Deputies opposite, but it represents the facts.  These facts cannot be contradicted; the evidence is there to see. Today houses are being built in every county and every town in Ireland. Our towns and villages are expanding. He must be a very blind Deputy indeed, who will travel the country today and not see the progress being made in housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is going even further and encouraging by way of grant the installation of water and sewerage in every house to give the people the modern amenities to which we feel they are entitled.  I mention all this not in a boastful manner but so that our people, as an intelligent people, will understand the <Col N="1310" /> difference it makes to each of them individually, in their homes and on their farms, whether a Fianna Fáil Government are in power or a Government composed of various units clinging together for the purpose of ousting Fianna Fáil, trying to hoodwink the people by making false promises, staying in office for two or two and a half years and then, even though they have an overall majority, running out and leaving a legacy of bad debts when things are not working out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it.  It is very important for the future of the country.  Everybody realises that the turnover tax is necessary because of what the Taoiseach told us here today. The people are intelligent enough to know that a responsible Government will see to it that the necessary taxation is imposed to pay for the various institutions and services of the State. We never believed in the kind of destructive criticism we hear from Fine Gael.  We always believed in balancing our Budgets and meeting our commitments, and we always handed over a credit balance sheet to our successors. When the Opposition Parties clamour for a general election, the people should know exactly what that entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard all this tommyrot from the other side regarding the amount of money that could be provided for building schools, houses and so forth but we know exactly what happened during their terms in office. We know, too, that the Leader of the Opposition has promised the small farmers £1,000 interest-free loans, moryah. That is a very nice carrot to dangle in front of anybody but the small farmers are not as foolish as he might think they are.  They know quite well that it is not easy for any Government to provide money without taxation.  He has been afraid to tell us what he is going to tax to provide these loans.  If I went further, I could comment on references he himself made in this House in days gone by to what loans were and the unsound policy it is for <Col N="1311" /> any small farmer to enter into any type of loan.</P>
    <P>I will just refer to Volume 106 of the Official Report in which the Leader of the Opposition had this to say regarding this front plank now in his platform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a very enlightening bit of reading and I would commend it to Deputies on the other side who are now so fond of dangling this carrot in front of the electorate in the hope that they may hoodwink them into believing that there was any truth whatever in their programme of providing interest-free loans for farmers. Indeed, were anything necessary to be added about it, I would remind the people in general of the time these people when in office themselves floated a loan.  I distinctly remember the time when they were looking for £12 million and the whole thing was <Col N="1312" /> a financial flop.  I think I can say correctly that all they succeeded in getting from the people was £2 million. That shows that the people had not sufficient confidence in them.  It was small wonder that when they got a chance in 1957 without putting any policy whatever in front of the people, a Fianna Fáil Government were put straight back into power.  That was the greatest condemnation of that Coalition outfit that anybody could ask.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that, in my opinion and in the opinion of most people who want to see the position as it is, the country is making tremendous progress under the dynamic leadership of the Taoiseach, who was responsible for the great achievements we have obtained in industry when the products of our magnificent workers can compete with the best on the world market.  There is no doubt that we have been straight and honest all along the line with the people.  We have actually published another blueprint which further points the way to progress.  It is not something we are ashamed or afraid of or want to hide from the people, unlike the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition.  We believe in telling the people what we intend to do.  It is in printed form for anybody who wants to see it.  What is more, and very important, we will in the future as in the past always impose the taxation necessary to pay for the full programme. That is an honest approach to the public and we will not attempt, like the Coalition, to leave office without having honoured all our commitments.</P>

      <P>I do not think that flowery speeches indicating how good the economy in the country is or the publication of White Papers for the purpose of closing the gap or for economic expansion are going to give us the prosperity that some of the misguided Fianna Fáil Deputies, such as the last speaker, think.  I personally took some of the Taoiseach's speech this morning as meaning that everyone should hand over his money to the Government and let them do the spending.  That is, in a nutshell, what the Taoiseach said.  The talk of <Col N="1313" /> economic expansion and of prosperity round the corner&mdash;I have been listening to the Taoiseach making this sort of speech ever since I came into Dáil Éireann 13 years ago.</P>
      <P>I wonder if anybody in his wildest stretch of imagination thinks that we have prosperity here in this country today.  I do not know whether prosperity exists in Dublin or not, but from what I have heard and the remarks relative to housing conditions generally, I imagine that there is far from prosperity in Dublin.  I can speak only for my own part of the country and perhaps for rural Ireland generally. There is certainly not prosperity there&mdash;certainly not among the business houses&mdash;nor in their employment. In fact it is well known that anyone who leaves school today, even if he has got the higher school qualifications, has the greatest difficulty in getting a job.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Taoiseach that making this sort of speech here is not going to give us prosperity.  It was not a particularly cheerful speech the Taoiseach made today, but of course at this time of year he always makes the same speech.  He always talks about the need for getting money, the financial difficulties the country is facing, and so on.  Then of course when the Budget comes round, if there is extra taxation people may be prepared for it and if there is not, well, everyone says: &ldquo;It is not quite as bad as we thought it was going to be.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach makes different speeches in Dáil Éireann from the speeches he and Ministers make at chambers of commerce.  When they make speeches to chambers of commerce, we hear the most roseate pictures painted of the future and all that is going ahead in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to talk on the turnover tax or other domestic items.  I propose to refer to foreign affairs.  The Taoiseach is the particular custodian of the Government and of the section dealing with our relations with European integration and our application to the Common Market.  On Thursday of last week after the Minister for External Affairs had returned <Col N="1314" /> from Brussels&mdash;I might say here that I personally was very glad to see that a Minister had at long last gone to discuss European affairs at Ministerial level and that perhaps we have got away from the stage at which top level negotiations are carried out by civil servants: in future I hope they will be carried out by Ministers&mdash;one would have thought that, when he returned and when the Taoiseach was questioned in the House, he would have been able to give Dáil Éireann slightly more information than he gave in the official communiqué issued after the Minister's return.</P>
    <P>In that communiqué, it is suggested that European integration and agriculture were both discussed.  Is it not fair that the Irish Parliament should be the place that should get more information as to what stage these negotiations or discussions have reached? It is not clear to me, having read this question, having read the supplementary questions and the answers made to the Leader of my Party, Deputy Dillon, and to the supplementary questions put by Deputy Dr. Browne and myself, where exactly we are going and what our relations with regard to the European Economic Community are.</P>
    <P>About two years ago, a group of journalists came to Ireland and after specifically questioning the leaders of the Parties as to their policy in relation to our application to the European Economic Community, they all issued a statement afterwards and said the difference in the reply of the Taoiseach and that of the Leader of the Opposition was this: the Taoiseach said that whether the United Kingdom goes into the Common Market or not, we will pursue our application and we will join the Common Market; Deputy Dillon said that as the greater part of our trade is with the United Kingdom, he did not think it would be realistic for us to enter the Common Market unless the United Kingdom did so.</P>
    <P>What is the present position?  Are we trying to get into the Common Market?  Are we trying to get in as full members and, if so, have we been refused?  Have we been told we are not yet economically strong enough to <Col N="1315" /> enter the Common Market?  Have we been told it is not possible for us to be considered as a full member and to wait until 1970?  It does not seem to me there is anything very secret about that one way or the other.  When the British were negotiating, and for all we know they may be still negotiating, they were open and above board. Everybody knew they were making an application to join the Common Market. Nobody in this country is quite clear what our official policy is.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach last Thursday, by way of supplementary to Deputy Corish's question, if he considered that the application by this country for external association might be the road into the Common Market, whether it might be more beneficial to us in that we would still be able to maintain our trading relations with the United Kingdom while preparing ourselves for entry and, at the same time, get some benefit from such association. He disagreed with that.  I should like the Taoiseach when replying to this debate, if he intends to refer at all to European integration, which is a vital issue affecting us all, to tell us what exactly the position is.</P>
    <P>The communiqué to which I have referred said M. Jean Rey and Mr. Mansholt were parties to the discussions with the Minister for External Affairs.  Mr. Mansholt is responsible for the EEC Commission in relation to agricultural questions.  Did we have any discussions in regard to agricultural produce?  Apparently we did because in the Taoiseach's answer to a question he says so.  Could he give any indication to the House what the discussions were about?</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the improvement in the economy of the Six has led to much greater demand for meat which is one of the products we export.  It is one of the many facets of our agricultural economy. Did we have any negotiations on that point and did we secure any trade agreements?  Did the representative of the Government there make any endeavour to get further expansion of our agricultural trade with the area of <Col N="1316" /> the Common Market to try to offset our existing heavy adverse trade balance?  These are important things that this Parliament is entitled to know.  Every country in Europe is negotiating at the moment.</P>
    <P>We were originally classed with five nations which belonged to OECD and the Council of Europe, except Spain, and which were described as countries that were not fully developed.  As such, these countries seemed to have a particular problem and to be in a position that they should negotiate in some way before making themselves part of the pattern of European integration. Turkey has already done so. Greece has already done so.  Iceland is somewhat different from us and other countries in that her economy is almost entirely dependent on fish and is tied up to a large extent with the United States.  Portugal has become a member of EFTA.  I understand Spain has been negotiating practically continuously with the Common Market countries.  That brings us back to Ireland.  Is she doing anything?</P>
    <P>I may be maligning the Taoiseach and the Government.  They may be conducting the most active negotiations. I notice that at the end of the communiqué which was issued, it says there are to be further meetings with officials in January in which technical matters are to be discussed.  What are those technical matters?  Was some form of agreement reached about which we know nothing?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave me the impression from his speech today that he was rather sorry he had given so much money to agriculture.  I should like to direct his attention to the fact that we are getting for our agricultural produce practically the lowest price in Europe for almost every commodity.  Is it not possible to look for an expansion of agricultural markets?  Recently at the FAO conference in Rome at which the American Minister for Agriculture, the French Minister for Agriculture and the British Minister for Agriculture spoke, two of them forecast an increasing demand for agricultural produce.  In fact, the American Minister for Agriculture went so far as to say that by 1970, the date by which <Col N="1317" /> we are supposed to be in the Common Market, according to the Taoiseach, there would be an increasing demand for agricultural produce; there would be better prices and there would be a shortage of those commodities even in the highly developed countries.  The French Minister for Agriculture also forecast an increase in agricultural prices, although the great difficulty at the moment is that within the Common Market, the French are trying to keep prices as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach finished up his speech, as he always does, talking about stability.  Does the Taoiseach really believe there is stability in the country?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the Government who, one might say, are hanging on by a thread are providing stable government?  Does he believe, with the great volume of opinion that is growing against him in the country generally, that he is able to offer stable government?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach concluded on the note that there would be no stability if Fianna Fáil were put out of office. He told us this morning that in no circumstances would there be a general election unless he is forced out of office.  I do not think he is doing a service to the country by adopting that attitude.  There is obviously, throughout the length and breadth of the country, a desire for a general election.  Wherever I go people ask me one question: is there any chance of having a general election so that we may get rid of the Government?  I do not see how the Taoiseach can conceive that he is the head of a stable administration when that is my impression from everybody I meet.  I am perfectly certain quite a number of my friends on the other side of the House are asking if there is any chance of a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reported that a famous statesman some years ago, when describing a predecessor of the present Taoiseach, said that dealing with him was as difficult as trying to lift quicksilver with a fork.  I think that description is a very apt one also when applied to his pupil here in the House, the Taoiseach.  He has proved <Col N="1318" /> a very apt pupil indeed when it comes to this particular quality.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks today, and in the course of his speech later, the Taoiseach contradicted statements he has made during the past 12 months. In my opinion, he is prepared to make any type of statement any day of the week, without as much as a blush, contradicting one he has already made. Apparently he has no regard or respect for the intelligence of the public.  His statements are so contradictory and so evasive that he does not seem to have any long-term policy whatsoever. Any policy he has can be described only as a pragmatic one.</P>
      <P>If we could agree on that, we would have a basis for discussion.  I am convinced that the Taoiseach is prepared to change from day to day, to adapt himself, and when you have that type of behaviour from the head of a Government, it is very dangerous thing for the country.  Today, he began by saying Fianna Fáil were under attack from the right and the left, and he described himself as being in the middle of the road.  During the past 12 months, on more than one occasion, he has sought to emphasise that Fianna Fáil are a Party of the left. Has he backed out of that into the middle of the road?</P>

Are we to believe him when he says Fianna Fáil are a Party of the left or are we to believe his statement today that they have gone to the middle of the road? We know what happens when one goes to the middle of the road.  It is the most dangerous part.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>One is liable to crash into oncoming traffic.  It is the most dangerous place any Party could get to; it is an avenue likely to cause disaster in a country like Ireland in its present state of development.  Can we expect the Taoiseach to say whether it is to be the middle of the road or <Col N="1319" /> the left for Fianna Fáil?  I believe his Party have taken the view that they should travel right of centre, that all this talk about going to the left was a gimmick of the Taoiseach to attract support from the workers.  That did not wash; it did not gather any support; and consequently the Taoiseach is on his way back to the original position held by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Another of the Taoiseach's statements was in connection with the general election.  He has been emphasising for months that Fianna Fáil will not go to the country unless they lose the support of the majority of this House: unless he is beaten here, there will be no general election.  Today we had an addendum to that.  He retained the first part about not going to the country unless they were beaten in the House, but he added a phrase to the effect that if he lost confidence outside the House, he was prepared to go to the country.</P>
      <P>Has he changed ground there, too? Heretofore, there was no question of going to the country if Fianna Fáil were beaten in a by-election.  Now it is quite clear that he is leaving the back door open, that if he is beaten in the two by-elections to be held next February, he will go to the country in a general election.  That is my analysis of what the Taoiseach said today and I think it is highly desirable we should clear the air on that.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Taoiseach asked the Opposition Parties, he asked the Labour Party, what their policy would be in case of a general election.  The Taoiseach has a good idea from his years in office of the impossibility of a political Party deciding what type of tax, or the amount of such tax, is necessary at any given time, but I have no hesitation in suggesting to him that as far as the Labour Party are concerned, the turnover tax must go; it must be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the most savage and unfair taxes ever thought up by an individual, a Minister, a Government. The turnover tax has not got a recommendation from any economist. The only reason it was imposed in its <Col N="1320" /> present form was that it was a simple tax which suited a lazy and inefficient Government; it was a lazy man's way of collecting money without thought to the consequences it would wreak on the community.  Therefore, the Taoiseach is quite right in saying that if he loses the support of the people in the two by-elections, he will go to the country.</P>
    <P>In fact, this Government's credit is gone.  This Government are deeply in the red as far as the public are concerned. I have listened to the remarks made here in recent months about the affluent society Fianna Fáil claim exists in Ireland.  Of course, nobody believes such affluence exists except the limited few who have done so well over the years through the various aids given to them by this Government, the various escape routes offered to them from paying just taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not think you could describe as an affluent society one in which the houses are falling in on the people in the capital city, where mothers of families are on hunger strike, where husbands are separated from their families and must sleep in mendicity institutions.  Are those the signs of an affluent society?  Is it a sign of affluence that in rural Ireland at the present time there are hundreds of families drawing unemployment benefit or on the dole because there is no work available for them?  Is that another sign of an affluent society?  Is it a sign of an affluent society that where you have a surplus of labour, machinery is brought in to do the work while able-bodied men stand by with their hands in their pockets, drawing unemployment assistance or the dole? Is that an affluent society or a lunatic one?</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it in rural Ireland today.  Of course, we have an affluent society if we examine some of the records of the people who have done so well through their loyal support of the Fianna Fáil Party over the years.  Five years ago, we had a figure of 10,500 in the surtax bracket in this country.  According to the Taoiseach, the country is flourishing; incomes have increased year after year and the standard of living and wages, <Col N="1321" /> salaries and emoluments have gone up by a tremenodus amount in the past five years.  If that were so, instead of 10,500 surtax payers, we should have at least 10,000 more.  But the position is that the 10,500 paying surtax five years ago have been reduced to 4,500. Is that not an indication of where the Government interest lies?  Whom do they like best, the poor or the wealthy?  Whose interest is being protected when you find the number of surtax payers reduced at a time when money is needed.  According to the Government, nothing can be done, no expansion can take place in the future, no plans for educational development can be put into effect unless this turnover tax is allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government not taxing those who can pay?  Why do they say to the surtax payers: &ldquo;`You were paying too much; we are going to reduce not alone your numbers but also the amount we are asking you to pay and at the same time, tax bread, butter, tea and sugar for the very poor.&rdquo;  The Government cannot have it both ways: they cannot protect the rich and pretend they are looking after the poor.  I do not think anybody now swallows the argument that Fianna Fáil trot out, that unless the turnover tax is imposed, the country is doomed.  When I came here first, I had read statements that if Fianna Fáil were put out, the sun would never shine again.  Doom and disaster were promised if the Taoiseach's predecessor were booted out of Government.</P>

I never heard a more arrogant suggestion. Whatever was the standard of credulity of the people 15 years ago when some of them swallowed the hairshirt policy of Fianna Fáil and believed they were sincere and that good times were just around the corner, those people and their sons and daughters today no longer swallow that.  They will not accept government by gimmick, a Government afraid even to go on television when challenged, and explain why this turnover tax was put on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;against the advice of the experts who sat on the Commission.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the view that expansion in agriculture and industry, provision of education and health services can be contemplated without money or taxation but we suggest the type of taxation imposed by this Government is a disastrous type and that the money they are seeking can be got otherwise.  This form of taxation is a wasteful one.  In order to collect 6d in the £, the public will be charged anything from 6d to 2/6d.  It is no use to suggest that social welfare recipients will be compensated for any increase in the cost of living because prior to the operation of the turnover tax, the former friends of Fianna Fáil increased prices of commodities so that they would have it both ways and, in fact, the value of social welfare benefits was swallowed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are hopping about on a different tack every day.  They have gone Left for the past few months; they are middle of the road today; there would be no general election, according to the Taoiseach, a few months ago unless the Government were beaten in this House. Today, he said that if the people do not want Fianna Fáil outside&mdash;by implication, that means the two by-elections&mdash;he has the back door ready and out that back door he is going. But he is warning the public that if they put out Deputy Seán Lemass, God help Ireland.  A just retribution <Col N="1323" /> for that arrogant and audacious claim will descend on the heads of the Taoiseach and his Party.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal in detail with the Common Market but even on that issue, back in 1955 the matter was raised here particularly by the former Deputy Russell, and by Deputy Dr. Browne and myself up to 18 months ago, and there was no talk about the Common Market.  The Government did not even know about the Treaty of Rome.  There was not even a copy of the Treaty available in the Library but suddenly the Taoiseach decided: &ldquo;We are going into the Common Market; we will make our application.&rdquo; He beat the British by a week or ten days in applying.  Where do we stand today?  There is no word about it in the Taoiseach's contribution.  It is a good thing for the small farmers and those in rural Ireland that we were not accepted as full members of the Common Market two years ago.  The small farmers have been saved from that disaster.  The Taoiseach personally knows nothing about rural Ireland except the odd trip down to fish when he calmly sits waiting for the trout to rise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying nothing derogatory about the Taoiseach but that, apart from his occasional trip to the country, he has no experience of the needs of rural Ireland.  I feel that the members of Fianna Fáil from rural Ireland must not have the ear of the Taoiseach, if we are to judge by conditions obtaining west of the Shannon and in other rural areas.  We must judge by results and the results are disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see Deputy Lenihan here from my own constituency and I should like him to say why it is that from the constituency we represent, over the past 20 years, 20,000 people have gone, at the rate of 1,000 a year.  How long can that drain of emigration from a country like Roscommon continue? What steps are the Government taking and what steps is the Parliamentary <Col N="1324" /> Secretary as a junior Minister taking to see that even those who are left are given an opportunity to live in that county?</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk solely about my own constituency here.  What I have said about Roscommon applies to Galway, Mayo, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal and all these counties.  Where is the affluent society in these counties that we hear about from Fianna Fáil? Where is the affluent society where local authorities bring in machinery to carry out road works, to carry out drainage works&mdash;the limited amount that is done&mdash;and displace men?  What steps are being taken by the Fianna Fáil Party to ensure that alternative employment is made available to workers and small farmers in these areas who are ousted from their work by the use of the mammoth machine?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil preach modernisation but what they practise is completely unchristian and savage.  They practise the use of machinery and drive out the human being.  I do not object to the use of machinery.  I cannot be described as one who wants to retard progress or to resist the use of machinery.  The more automation and machinery we have, the better, provided the labour disrupted in the particular industry or operation concerned is compensated, retrained and placed in alternative employment.  Only in those circumstances do I subscribe to the idea of allowing the machine to replace men. This Government, to their eternal shame, have allowed the machine into areas where it has resulted in families being left without a means of subsistence. Can we get any hope for the future while this Government are in office that they will change their tune about the rest of Ireland outside the cities?</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view of the Taoiseach and his Government as far as the adaptation council is concerned for those who lose their employment in industries which are trying to prepare themselves for competition in world markets.  I subscribe to the idea that the workers who are displaced must be given an opportunity to be retrained and must be compensated for their loss of employment.  I am behind any <Col N="1325" /> plans the Government may have in that respect but I want to see the very same type of plans operated outside the cities, in the rural areas.  I want to see the same compensation or aid or guidance given to workers in rural Ireland and to small farmers.</P>
    <P>In one sense, it is a terrible commentary on Governments in Ireland that after 40 years of native government, small farmers at this stage should still be dependent on local authorities or the Board of Works or other Government or semi-Government concerns for part-time employment. No attempt has been made to organise and unite the small farmers into co-ops, into employment that would give them strength through unity.  The only attempt made is through the activities of the Sugar Company and here, to my mind, is where the difference stands out between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties. Both of these major Parties admire the work of the Sugar Company because it is successful but neither of them fundamentally believe that the Sugar Company is a proper concern.  Neither of them believe that the State should engage in industry or farming.  In that respect they are both alike.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we believe in the absolute extension of the State into all spheres of agriculture.  Fianna Fáil, who said they were moving to the left for the past six months, are now back in the middle of the road.  Can we get from them any indication of their policy from now on, any indication that they are not going to sabotage the State companies which have been functioning successfully up to the present?</P>
    <P>It is only 12 months since the Minister for Finance came into this House and declared that the Government were going to get rid of a number of State companies.  When I say &ldquo;get rid of them&rdquo;, I mean that they were going to offer them on the Stock Exchange and allow every Tom, Dick and Harry to buy shares in a successful State company.  Did that indicate a Party moving to the left?  Did it not show the most conservative Tory mentality <Col N="1326" /> that there could possibly be, that because a company was successful, every greedy <i>entrepreneur</i> outside who has his eye on the Stock Exchange was pressing the Government to put the shares on the market on the basis: &ldquo;We have a right to make money out of a successful State company.&rdquo;  So far, I am glad to say, that proposal of the Minister for Finance has not seen the light of day.  There has not been any Bill introduced to the House to get rid of a State company.</P>
    <P>What do we need in the rural areas? We do not need doles.  The farming community and workers in rural Ireland do not want to be looked down upon or to be given lectures by the Taoiseach.  They do not want to be treated as a pauper society, taking gifts from a Government on the basis that they should be very thankful for them.  What they want is a fair crack of the whip.  What the farmer, and the small farmer in particular, wants is stability and guaranteed genuine prices for his products over a long-term period, and not to be subject, as he is, to exploitation all the way up the line to the point at which his produce reaches the consumer.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear on a matter of policy where the difference exists between the Labour Party and the two major Parties.  Let us take a look at the bacon industry.  The farmer gets approximately 1/7 per lb. for his pig and the processed article comes on the table at 5/- to 6/- per lb.  Who makes the money in between?  Where is the profit going in between 1/7 to the farmer and the farmer's wife who pays ? for that pig in the form of bacon?</P>
    <P>The bacon factories have been working for the past 40 years.  They are a most conservative group, unwilling to move into European competition, unwilling to move in and to try the American market, but quite willing to exploit the Irish farmer on every fair day or every market day.  In respect of the pig that was bought in a small town in the west of Ireland for the factory, the farmer got a grade B price but the pig came on the table as grade A bacon as far as the consumer was concerned.  There is a limited attempt being made now to <Col N="1327" /> move into the British market at this late stage.  Let me put it this way: The bacon industry should be put on the very same lines as the lines on which the Sugar Company has been operating, so that the interest of the producer is guaranteed and promoted and the interest of the consumer is looked after, while at the same time every possible attempt is made to get into the various world markets, irrespective of where they may be.</P>
    <P>As far as the policy that was pursued is concerned, I want to point out that when an attempt was made by way of motion in the House to nationalise the bacon industry, the two leaders, the Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of Fianna Fáil, said that in no circumstances should the State be allowed to intervene in this.  So that, in my honest opinion, there is no difference between them on a major issue of that nature.  Neither of them has taken any steps against the bacon factories who have exploited the farmer and the consumer over the years.  Both have threatened all sorts of dire punishment but neither took any action, with the exception, of course, that Fianna Fáil, instead of punishing these people by, shall we say, putting the bacon industry into the hands of a company like the Sugar Company, have given big modernisation grants to those very factories which were sabotaging the bacon industry.</P>
    <P>I know factories at the present time where pigs are brought 100 miles and two lorries pass each other going in opposite ways bringing pigs to different factories.  There is nothing sensible even about the present-day arrangement. It is criminal, in my opinion, to give the Irish people's money, whether it is obtained through the ordinary taxation system or through the turnover tax, to these people who have been allowed to batten on the public over the years.</P>
    <P>If real proof is ever needed of the interest which Fianna Fáil have in the small farmer and in the working man, let us see where the biggest adaptation grant ever was given.  It was given in Cork Street, to Donnelly's Bacon Factory, <Col N="1328" /> a grant of £200,000.  What assistance was that to the small farmers down the country, but what assistance it would have been if it had been spent in Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo of Kerry to help the small farmers in pig rearing and to give them a central finishing station from which their product would go all over the world?</P>
    <P>Only 12 years ago, the Dutch started in on the canned ham process for the American market.  Our Irish bacon manufacturers were asked to get into that business but they would not do so.  The Dutch are now able to sell from £25 million to £30 million worth of canned ham in America while we cannot sell sixpenceworth.  That is where the State must step in.  The Sugar Company can do things like that and the Minister must step in with an organisation like the Sugar Company to find markets abroad for our bacon products.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned the pig industry on which the small farmer is dependent but he is not getting much help from the Government.  Instead the Government want to produce more cattle and now there is a grant of £15 per head for every additional heifer that a farmer can put on his land. What small farmer will benefit by that? It is the big rancher who will be helped by it and not the small farmer of under £20 valuation.  Is it not a fact that only the wealthy farmer will make money out of that scheme while the people in the cities and towns will be given to think that the ordinary small farmer is getting something for nothing? This scheme is going to expedite the extinction of the smaller man because the aim will be to have larger units all over the place.  That is in line with Government policy, with the Taoiseach's own view and with the EEC policy to extinguish 8,000,000 holdings in EEC countries.  They are not going to get away with it.  There is still an influential section of Church and State who believe that the small farmer can make a reasonable living on his holding, if given reasonable support, guidance and security.</P>
    <P>In the barley industry, the same thing applies.  All over the years we have had the State subsidising the distillers <Col N="1329" /> so that they might sell their whiskey but these distillers made no attempt to provide an annual cash crop for the small farmers and the Government did not insist that they do it.  All we get from the Government is a wheat-growing policy that benefits the ranchers and the small farmer could not last long when that competition started.</P>
    <P>This Government have stated that they are out to expand industrial development in the undeveloped areas but what is the position?  I want to quote an extract from an economist, Mr. Garret Fitzgerald in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 30th October, 1963.  Dealing with the grants from An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Grants Board, he states:</P>
    <P>A notable feature of grant approvals in recent years has been the drift away from the so-called undeveloped areas in favour of the eastern part of the country.  Thus whereas up to 1959/60 the grants approved for the undeveloped areas were consistently higher than those approved for the rest of the country since that time despite the enlargement of the undeveloped areas this situation has been reversed.  In the year ended March last new grant approvals in the east of the country were 80 per cent greater than the approvals in respect of the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose the Government will challenge the statement that in the last financial year the grants made outside the undeveloped areas were 80 per cent higher than those in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>We all know that no private capitalist wants to go any further than a stone's throw from Nelson Pillar to site his undertaking if he can get away with it.  It is not my suggestion that any private industrialist should be forced to go here, there or elsewhere but it is not right to depend on that type of chancy private enterprise to develop the West of Ireland and save it from extinction.  That type of industrial development is not sufficient for the undeveloped areas and the proof of that is that last year the drift was away from those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The people in rural Ireland are being told that the Government are willing and anxious to see industries brough into their areas.  They are told that grants are available for the establishment of these industries and that they should get together and work hard to bring home any foreign industrialists into their districts.  The fact is that such people are not prepared to go into the rural areas unless they want to buy half the countryside, and we do not want that. What do the Government intend to do about that?  Do they intend to sit on their backsides and say that they have done all they can do by making these grants available?</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty, where private enterprise has obviously failed as it has in this respect, to take the initiative by starting an organisation such as the Irish Sugar Company to do this work.  They have the money to do it and a State development of that nature would do much to solve the problem of the undeveloped areas. The Sugar Company and organisations like it must be encouraged in any such attempt they make and any attempt to limit the work of the Sugar Company in this or any other respect must be treated with severity.</P>
    <P>Every attempt is being made to sabotage the work of the Sugar Company. A number of people in this country are interested in preventing the Sugar Company from selling its products on the home market and to that attempt the Government have given approval by legislation.  They are endeavouring to prevent the Sugar Company, by legislation, from selling all its products on the home market. I think that is a deplorable comment on an Irish Government dealing with an Irish company employing Irish workers and built on Irish money. It shows the type of influence that can be brought to bear on this Government by people behind the scenes who are interested in an operation which does not have its headquarters in this country.  We can have no confidence in a Government who allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they have lost the confidence of the <Col N="1331" /> people of rural Ireland which they previously had.  They are in the red: their credit is gone.  The proper step for Fianna Fáil to take at this stage is to go to the country, to be honest and say to the people: &ldquo;We believe this turnover tax is the right one&rdquo;, and then let the people decide.</P>
    <P>Taxation is at all times unpopular and whatever Government come into office will have to tax the people.  As far as the present tax is concerned, all Parties in this House have declared it iniquitous, with the exception of Fianna Fáil.  So far as we can know what the general public are thinking, they are almost unanimously opposed to it.  On that basis, there is every justification for allowing the public to express their feelings in a general election.  I hope the Government will have the courage to go to the country.</P>

      <P>This debate has gone the usual way of recent debates on national policy in this House in which the groups opposed to the Government engage in destructive rather than constructive comment on the economic situation. There has been no attempt to present for examination a constructive alternative policy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael pose to the public as the alternative to the Fianna Fáil Party at present in Government.  The public are rightly entitled to some indication by Fine Gael of the policy lines they would take if charged with the responsibility of administration.  That information has not been forthcoming. That is the most complete indictment of the criticism which has been forthcoming in particular from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>No member of the Labour Party could claim, in the present political climate, that the Labour Party could seriously be considered as an alternative Government.  The issue before the public at all times is the question of Government and what group can present itself to the public as that best equipped to govern.  In that situation, at the moment no alternative is before the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> The only possible claim to an alternative Government is made by the Fine Gael Party but it is not sustained by any alternative policy which can be examined by the public.  Therefore, the public are not presented with that choice which the public in any democratic society in the world are given. On that rests the strength of the Government's case.</P>
    <P>There has been a welter of carping, destructive criticism in various key debates here in the past nine months but nowhere from this torrent of abuse, destructive comment and carping criticism has emerged any semblance of of a policy, particularly from the second major Party in the House who claim to be an alternative Government in embryo.  On that basis, this Government are entitled to the confidence of the people.  Whenever the chips are down, in the event of a general election, that view will be taken by the people also.  Fianna Fáil, on their record, their present approach and their future plans represent responsible Government and the people know that no alternative Government presents itself.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads in regard to economic development.  The first sign of a fresh approach to our economic problems came in 1958 with the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Fianna Fáil came into office on the basis of a complete lack of public confidence in the administration which foundered in the early months of 1957. There was a total rejection of the administration of that day.  There were partically 100,000 people out of work.  Emigration stood at 60,000 to 70,000.  National Loans were not being subscribed.  Banks, insurance corporations and such institutions were not advancing the credit and accommodation necessary to sustain economic advancement.</P>
    <P>The total rejection by the public of the then administration in March, 1957, resulted in Fianna Fáil being handed the reins of Government which they had held so ably in previous periods from 1932.  Within 12 months, the First <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published.  We had an example of an administration which was taking the people out of the trough <Col N="1333" /> of depression and showing them the way ahead and the future which could be attained, provided various sectors co-operated in the achievement of targets.  They did so&mdash;particularly the trade union section.</P>
    <P>Various Irish trade unions, in consultation with the Government since the Programme of 1958, recently fixed wage and salary increases which fitted into the pattern of economic growth. Since this co-operation, particularly from Irish trade unions, we have had economic growth without the sort of insidious economic inflation which bedevilled our economy in 1956.  We had rising industrial employment.  We had expanding exports.  We had a rising standard of living.  They all went hand in hand with a balanced economy.  From the point of view of the balance of payments and balanced Budgets, this was a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State, we got out of the eternal cycle of boom and slump&mdash;the cycle which reached a disastrous low during the latter years of the Coalition Government between 1954 and 1957. There is no need to emphasise the success of the programme.  The first five years have just been completed. We are aware that the targets set in that Programme have been more than doubled.  A rate of growth of two per cent per annum in the national income has been exceeded to a figure of slightly over four per cent per annum &mdash;a rate of growth in which industrial employment has risen steadily so that the latest figure in regard to employment shows that while in 1961-62 the weekly average of insurance stamps was 484,000, in 1962-63 the figure was 498,000, a rise in employment of 14,000 per year.  This trend which was envisaged in the first Programme will, in our opinion, continue.  The targets have been set for 1970 which will allow for the creation of over 100,000 new jobs in the decade of the 1960s.</P>

This progress has largely resulted from the forward planning which the Government undertook in their first Programme in 1958. The second Programme has now been undertaken and the board lines have been published with the same objectives in view.  I hope the economic growth target of four per cent per annum set in the second Programme will be more than doubled, as was the economic growth target in the first Programme.  It is an ambitious target and is in line with the targets set in other countries in Western Europe.  I feel it can be achieved and will be achieved.</P>

      <P>This particular point is of great importance at this crossroad stage in our development. The broad plans of the second Programme have been published and the details are now being prepared by each particular sector in industry, agriculture and so on, and will be published <Col N="1335" /> in the New Year.  These detailed proposals are being worked out in consultation with the various voluntary organisations, trade unions, farmers' associations and so on, but it is imperative that there should be an appreciation of the importance of the national interest, the importance of the community interest rather than sectional interest.  I feel that if the same support is accorded the second Programme as was accorded the first, this will be achieved.  It will be achieved in spite of the hysterical criticism and the pressure which is being engendered and engineered by various Oppoisition Parties.</P>
      <P>We have had an hysterical political atmosphere being whipped up in the past few months which is not having a good effect on the community as a whole.  It is not good that we should have an atmosphere of hysteria whipped up in which it is difficult to make progress.  This atmosphere is being whipped up on the basis that the Government are in some way endangering the national interest by reason of their taxation proposals.  In fact, the Government are facing up to their responsibilities and devising a broadly-based system of taxation which can provide the revenue which can sustain economic development not alone next year and the following year but in the years ahead.  If no such system of broadly-based taxation were introduced, either this Government or some other Government would be faced with the problem of devising a system which would provide the revenue necessary to sustain the development which we all desire and, in particular, the economic development to which the Labour Party subscribed on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to enumerate the fields that are so important.  The field of education is particularly important. I have said previously, and I repeat now, that the total revenue from the turnover tax could very well be spent in this field alone.  It is the field in which Russia, the United States of America and recently Britain, with the publication of the Robbins Report, are <Col N="1336" /> concerning themselves vitally.  It is the field which is going to be of vital importance in this technical and technological age.  It is the field in which the Minister for Education has announced specific proposals designed to ensure a comprehensive educational scheme with a bias towards the technical and technological aspects.  We need a system of education here and this is the objective, that every man's child will have the opportunity to utilise his talents to the fullest extent. We need a system of education in which a range of scholarships and opportunity will be available to every man's child, whatever his means.  This will require a rising level of State investment in this sphere in which there has been a rise of 25 per cent in State investment over the past four years. That will have to be accelerated.</P>
    <P>We have introduced a broadly-based system of taxation which will enable revenue to be channelled in this direction. The Minister for Education has emphasised that technical and technological facilities in the form of new buildings and technological institutions in key centres through the country will have to be established.  He has emphasised that we will have to provide a system of education which will enable a boy or girl to move into the technical or technological field and secure the maximum education to equip him for whichever profession or trade he may aspire to.  In the field of science, engineering, electrical development and so on, this is important.</P>
    <P>Apart from education, it is quite obvious that in the years ahead there must be a steady rise in social services commensurate with the overall growth targets for economic development.  It is quite obvious that in agriculture the present range of investment by the State, substantial as it is, will have to be maintained.  It is quite obvious that in the field of industrial development a similar range of State assistance will have to be maintained.  In all these fields, there cannot be any cutting back in expenditure and the only result of any attempt to undermine the taxation proposals would be to cut back in developments in these fields.  The present range of State investment in agriculture <Col N="1337" /> comes to over £40 million.  That can be defended on every side.  Deputy McQuillan was critical in regard to this investment; yet in the past 12 months in the field of milk production alone, positive steps have been taken by the Government to encourage creamery development in the west of Ireland.  That positive assistance has resulted in creameries being established in Galway, Roscommon, Mayo and Leitrim, which are designed to ensure that the small farmer will have a cash income derived from the sale of milk to creameries based reasonably near him.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke about the subsidy of £15 for each in-calf heifer over and above the herd limit of last year as if that were something that would not benefit the small farmer.</P>

      <P>If the cow population is increased, there will be a greater export of live cattle and beef products and of dairy products.  The latter is tied in with pig production because of skim milk feed for pigs.  The fundamental need in order to make progress in agriculture is to increase the cow <Col N="1338" /> population.  From that increase will flow an expansion in dairying and pig production and in agriculture generally. The most effective way to increase the cow population is by providing incentive grants to encourage farmers, irrespective of valuation, into breeding heifers to ensure that our cattle output will reach the target set for 1970.  This is an integral part of the overall agricultural plan and the side effects will be of benefit not only to beef and cattle but to the pig and dairying industry as well.  This incentive scheme will promote agricultural expansion on all fronts.</P>
      <P>This particular target has been scoffed at, in particular by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  Not alone have we set a target but we have provided the incentive. When the target was first announced, Deputy Dillon rushed into print to condemn it as unreal and unattainable. We maintain that we can increase the cattle population by 43 per cent by 1970.  Following Deputy Dillon's premature comments, we produced exactly the incentive designed to achieve the figure at which we aim. Side by side with that there are the incentives towards improved grass productivity, fertiliser and lime subsidy schemes.</P>
      <P>In industry the rate of employment in manufacturing, building and construction has been rising steadily.  For the year 1962-63, insurance stamps showed an increase of 14,000 on the previous year.  We must maintain the tempo of progress.  Inevitably, there will always be people in our society leaving the land and our objective is to absorb them into industrial employment, building and construction.  Never before in the history of this State has the tempo of economic activity and employment been so high and so consistent in building and construction. That position compares more than favourably with the disastrous position that obtained in the slump that occurred in late 1956 and early 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest single indicator of economic prosperity is employment in building and construction, and that holds good not only here but in every economy in every country.  This is the <Col N="1339" /> field that suffers whenever there is a cut back or a slow down in the economy.  This is the field providing full employment at the moment, the field in which there is a growing need for more tradesmen.  Vocational committees all over the country can plan for the training of boys, secure in the knowledge that they will get employment. Building and construction are the greatest single indicator of economic prosperity.</P>

      <P>As I stated initially, we now stand at a crossroads.  Progress has been made since the initiation of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The Second Programme has now been published.  We must have faith in the future development along the lines already followed. Political parties and groups, and the people generally, will have to accept this situation.  Do we want to follow the signpost to further progress and rising employment or do we want to follow the signpost that points to depression and slump?  If we want to follow the signpost to rising employment and an expanding economy, then we must accept responsibility for walking down that particular road.</P>
      <P>This Government have accepted responsibility, that responsibility which is the price of progress, and no progress can be achieved without paying a price.  This Government, following the signpost towards economic expansion, have accepted the major responsibility of devising the taxation measures necessary to carry the country along the road to progress. If the political Parties here and the various groups outside accept that that is the signpost we must follow, then the people as a whole will accept the fact that the major responsibility in travelling that road is the responsibility of following a rational taxation system designed to yield the revenue necessary for development in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly and unequivocally, we have made our position clear.  Fine Gael have offered no alternative means of raising taxation for further expansion. They have not even offered a policy <Col N="1340" /> of expansion.  The Labour Party have a policy of expansion very much on the lines of our policy, but the Labour Party have not gone the whole way and accepted the responsibility implicit in following the road to economic expansion.  We still await from the Labour Party some alternative system of raising the revenue necessary to secure the expansion we desire. Those who make the choice of progress and expansion will accept the responsibility associated with it.  No alternative has been proffered to the community for public examination. No other policy of expansion, or of taxation designed to secure that expansion, has been published.</P>
    <P>We believe that when this issue is fully spelled out, the people will see that we have acted as a responsible administration in adopting the course of action we have adopted.  Not alone would any other alternative be negative but any other alternative would lead to anarchy and slump.  That is a situation we want to avoid.  We want to avoid a situation of political instability and successive general elections for that would lead only to a loss of confidence, the kind of loss of confidence there was in 1956 and 1957, shown in the failure of National Loans and lack of initiative on the part of banks and lending institutions to expand credit accommodation.  The basic need of the economy is an injection of confidence, especially in the finance sector.</P>
    <P>The public are coming now to a realisation that this is the alternative to the present administration.  The alternative can be spelled out, even though it has not been spelled out in constructive policy on the part of either the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  The alternative is that, in the event of a period of political instability resulting from the agitation of the Opposition the result will be instability not only in the political sphere but in financial and business spheres and in the whole economy. The steady, brick for brick foundation which we have been building up since 1958 may be shattered.  We do not want that to happen.  The country realises this, despite the temporary agitation and excitement being whipped up <Col N="1341" /> by destructive politicians, concerned not with responsibilities of power but with power itself.  This sort of temporary excitement is already disappearing before the realisation by the people that they are faced with the alternative of complete political chaos, and indeed, anarchy, in the event of the present administration being disturbed by the Opposition group.  This issue is being borne in on the people and will be reflected in a positive way in the outcome of the by-elections in Kildare and Cork.</P>
    <P>When the chips are down, people look at things in a very sensible light. The basic issue in any democracy is the question of Government.  You can strip off the various non-essentials; when the people are faced with the choice which faces democratic electors at regular intervals, it comes down to the question of who can govern the community.  On our record since 1957, on our present record and on our future plans, which have been spelled out and will be spelled out in greater detail, we offer ourselves to the public as a Government and a political organisation that can command a wide measure of support both inside and outside this House to sustain Government. When the issue is spelled out, the futility and weakness of the various opposing groups can be seen clearly.  The Deputies opposite know in their heart of hearts that the alternative does not exist either in the form of policy, personnel or from the practical point of view of achieving the necessary majority.  In particular, the alternative does not exist in the Fine Gael Party, who profess to be the alternative Party.  Indeed, in the present context of things, the Fine Gael Party are rapidly becoming a surplus and irrelevant Party in Irish politics.</P>

This has not been forthcoming from either Fine Gael or Labour.  We wish they would grow up and follow on positive lines.  We pointed the way in the publication of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and we set the targets in the second Programme. We have spelled out the way economic development can take place. No alternative has been presented so that the public can make a rational choice as to whether the administration is following the right lines of development or whether some alternative line of development would be more favourable. The public have not been presented with a logical choice.

He came in for the first time in October, 1961, a neophyte in Irish politics.  One thing he decided to do was to model himself in his speaking on the Taoiseach.  I can bear hearing the Taoiseach speak, but I must say I find it extremely aggravating to find the Taoiseach's speech and his voice being repeated by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said we await an alternative Government. In that respect he is in the same position as the majority of the people in the country.  They are also awaiting an alternative Government. The Parliamentary Secretary points across here and says that in the Opposition benches, in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, there is a lack of personnel.  Who does he think he is?  I should like to know where conceit carries one?  We have been told there can be no leader in this country but the present Taoiseach. God be with the days when we were told the same about the then Deputy de Valera.  Are we to be led to believe now there can be no Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in charge of Fisheries but Deputy Brian Lenihan from Roscommon, who never saw the sea?</P>
      <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party think that only they have the personnel, the policy and the brains, they have another think coming.  Outside this House, the vast majority of the people have long seen through the pretence and fraud of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the chips being down.  That is an appropriate phrase.  The chips are down when eventually one's bluff is called.  One's bluff is called frequently at a poker table.  There are too many people trying to play poker at the moment with the national interests.  I suggest that the greatest collection of poker players are sitting opposite in the Government benches at the moment.  So well they may talk about the chips being down.  The chips are <Col N="1344" /> down.  They will be found carrying a small pair of twos when we on this side will have a full house.  Let there be no double thinking in regard to that.</P>

      <P>I suppose that all of us have harboured ambitions when we look at our lives and think of what we might have been.  I saw in the <i>Sunday Press</i> the other day that the Parliamentary Secretary who has just spoken was looking back to what he might have been and he said that he would like to have been a journalist. Other people would like to be engine drivers, and I have one young son who would like to be a Pope, but the Parliamentary Secretary wants to be a journalist.  He believes in short simple words.  I suppose it was in pursuance of that belief that in the early part of this year down in the constituency of Roscommon when his constituents met him and said: &ldquo;Deputy, will you ever tell us what is this new tax that they are all talking about going to be&mdash;this new turnover tax?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary had an answer in simple words: &ldquo;Do not bother about this turnover tax.  It is going to be on fur coats, expensive cars, on luxuries, speed boats and all the rest of it.&rdquo;  That was what the turnover tax was to be on, the plain words and the direct answer to a plain question. He has used in his speech here this evening &ldquo;we so felt&rdquo; and I am beginning to assume that he must now be a member of the Government or at least privy in and party to the counsels of the Government.  It is very strange, if that is so, that in the spring of this year he did not know that the turnover tax which was to apply to speed boats, expensive cars, fur coats and luxuries, was in fact a tax aimed at bread, <Col N="1345" /> butter, tea, sugar and the necessaries of life of ordinary people.  Why did he not know it?  Was it because it was too bitter a pill to give to the people or was it because at the time he spoke there was a by-election pending in North-East Dublin and the chips were not yet down, and this talk about surplus political Parties would have to go before the electorate for test as to who was surplus?  Was it because that situation was there that in Boyle and in the North-East Dublin constituency the people were to be told that this turnover tax was only to affect the millionaire classes in this country?  It was to affect those expensive cars, fur coats and luxuries, and no one was to hearken to the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party or anyone else who suggested that the contrary might be true?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he is still in this House in ten years' time, he will be a member of a very small political Party if it is still called by the label Fianna Fail. He will find very quickly which is the surplus political Party in this country. This Fine Gael party was not surplus in 1922 when the State was built up, and it will continue playing its part in the political life of the country long before the Parliamentary Secretary will have achieved political maturity.</P>
      <P>I have been diverted to some extent from what I intended to say, but I am glad that I have got what I did say off my chest.  It has done me good.  I do not know if it has done anybody else good.</P>
      <P>This debate is a useful debate and it comes at the end of a calendar year. It can be fairly said that it has come this year at the end of a most disturbing year for the country.  This time last year in the Adjournment Debate the Taoiseach and the Government speakers who took part in it were pointing across the seas to Europe and telling everyone: &ldquo;Forget about the aches and pains of the economy.  Here is a ship coming in.&rdquo;  The ship was Europe and our ship was to come into port and everything was to be lovely. That was only 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year started with a douche of cold water for the Taoiseach and the <Col N="1346" /> Government and for all those who believed that no matter what the current difficulties might be, everything would be right on the night.  At the beginning of this year so far as we were concerned the Common Market blew up.  A strange thing happened.  After the complete disappearance and destruction of the Common Market notion at the start of this year, the Taoiseach and his Government had to look back inside this country.  They had to have regard to the fact that things were not going as well as they had been saying.  Then of course we had panicky action taken.  A White Paper on wages and incomes was issued without notice to anyone.  It was called <i>Closing the Gap</i> and it appealed for, in effect, a freezing of wages and incomes and all the rest of it.  That White Paper did not receive the support that apparently had been hoped for.  In fact it aroused considerable indignation, and then we had the spectacle of the Taoiseach who issued it availing of the first opportunity of disowning it and telling the people: &ldquo;Pay no attention to it.  It does not mean what it says.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That White Paper was debated in this House, and indeed the day after the division on it, a Deputy died&mdash;the late Deputy Jack Belton.  It is interesting to recall that the week after Deputy Jack Belton's death the Taoiseach made the speech to which Deputy McQuillan has made reference.  He said that the time had come for the Government and his Party to shift firmly to the left.  What the Taoiseach was doing was hoping by that speech not to bring about any different emphasis in Government policy but to attract a short-term political advantage by obtaining labour No. 2 preferences in the then pending by-election in North-East Dublin.  That was the idea behind it.  There was no broad philosophy involved in that particular statement. He was appealing to the people of North-East Dublin to shift firmly to the left, but the workers in North-East Dublin remembered well what he and his Party meant by wage control in the past and what the abolition of food subsidies had meant.</P>
    <P>Well, it did not succeed.  Not only did it not succeed but quite emphatically 90 per cent of the Labour <Col N="1347" /> preferences went to the Fine Gael candidate.  He would not have needed them because he was going to win in any event.  After that effort failed, we had these turnover tax details announced and, of course, it became apparent that this was an idea that must have been sold to the Government by the most conservative of financial advisers.  Here was a tax based on expenditure which could not be avoided and which would keep the Government out of the range of fire because the Government would be enabled to say: &ldquo;We are imposing a tax on nothing.&rdquo;  If you are imposing a tax on nothing in particular, the argument will go forth that you are not taxing anything.</P>
    <P>The basic idea behind the turnover tax was that it had to fall on essential articles.  I do not want to go over the debate we had on that tax.  Suffice it to say that it was entered into by the Government because they believed it was a cute political gimmick.  It was an easy way of raising the taxation they felt had to be raised and it was hard to attack because no one could say that any particular article was being taxed.  We pointed out at the time and in all the debates since that this tax would have the effect of raising living costs very steeply.  Our views in that respect were opposed by the Government, but argument ceased on this matter immediately after the introduction of the tax on 1st November.  After the operation of the turnover tax at the beginning of November, every section of the community knew as a certainty&mdash;they had not to be convinced any more by rhetoric or by argument&mdash;that the cost of living was going up.</P>
    <P>It is in those circumstances that the Taoiseach again panicked and for the first time ever he issued a statement calling for a ninth round of wage increases.  As the Leader of the Labour Party very correctly stated, he had the impertinence in that statement to say to trade union leaders and others that they should seek such increases as would compensate them for the 2½ per cent turnover tax effect on prices.  I do not know what the Taoiseach expected <Col N="1348" /> to result from such an appeal.  It was grossly impertinent to all sections.  It was like somebody who spills over a jug of milk and says to somebody else: &ldquo;Go and mop it up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the outcome will be but let there be no doubt about this: if as a result of the situation created by the Government in the past two months, we are now entering a period of economic instability, the fault is clearly that of the Leader of this Government.  It is he who created the situation.  It is he who brought it about by trying to play poker with the national interest, by trying to bluff his way out of a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The ninth round is now starting and even now, having brought about the situation, the Taoiseach is beginning to run away from the consequences of what he did, saying in his speech here today that everybody should have regard to the limits of the economy.  Of course, they should but who started this?  It is a bit late after you tie a tin can to the bull's tail to be trying to get it off, and I hope the Taoiseach has not tied a tin can to the bull's tail in this instance.</P>
    <P>We are now at the end of a disturbing year, a year in which a lot of things happened in this country which, perhaps, should not have happened.  However, beyond the confines of argument has emerged the fact that the Government now in office are a very weak Government indeed.  They are a Government who react in a panicky manner to any difficulty that arises, a Government particularly prone to hearken to pressure groups.  They are a Government dependent for their continuance in office on Independent Deputies here who look outside for the effect of their actions and immediately try to alleviate those effects in case further political complications should arise.  I wonder how many Deputies would agree with these sentiments spoken by a leader of a political Party, indeed the leader of the country at the time when he said:</P>
    <P>I have no faith in Independents and I would not like to be the Taoiseach depending on Independents to support me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Fine words, great words, spoken by a person who is Leader of a national Party and the then outgoing Taoiseach. Those words were spoken on 29th September, 1961, and the speaker was not the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party but the present leader, Deputy Seán Lemass, who in Monaghan was reported in the <i>Northern Standard</i> as expressing those sentiments:</P>
    <P>I have no faith in Independents&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where is Deputy Sherwin?</P>
    <P>&mdash;and I would not like to be the Taoiseach depending on Independents to support me.</P>
    <P>He swallowed his pride and he is there now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Collins hopes.  He is there now depending on Independents for support. I am sure he does not like it and I want to let him into a secret: the country does not like it either and I can assure the Taoiseach that whenever the opportunity is afforded, the people will express their dislike in no uncertain way.  They will remove from the Taoiseach the obligation of heading a Government depending on Independent support.  Indeed they will send the Taoiseach to a part of this House where he can view with equanimity the actions of whatever Independent Deputies happen to come back.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House very much longer except to ask a question. What of the future?  Members of the Government and of the Fianna Fáil Party are great spinners of wordy fabrics.  The Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;We spell it out.&rdquo;  Of course they do.  There is a whole torrent of verbiage let loose on the people from time to time.  There is talk about plans for education, plans for health, and so on, but what are they?  Where are they?  What of the future?  Plans for better education&mdash;some day.  Plans for a better health service&mdash;when?  That is like saying: live horse and you will get grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> But what is the future going to hold in store in relation to the country?  Are we going into the Common Market? Is the Common Market going to be there?  It almost appears now as if the Common Market is breaking into bits. Are we still tied, in the Government's belief, to working towards what may be a mirage?  By the time we are ready to get into the Common Market there may be nothing there.  If the situation has its difficulties we should at least expect from the Taoiseach at the end of a year like this some realistic assessment of where this country is likely to go in the coming year.  Are we to go into EFTA or join NATO?  Are we still going to follow the Common Market idea or are we going to abandon it and believe and practise the words that used to mean a lot in this country, Sinn Féin?  Are we just going to try to build up our own country by our own resources without looking for somebody else to carry the baby?</P>
    <P>These are the questions the people, the general public, are asking.  They are questions that will have to be answered in any event by the Government when they face the people of two constituencies in the near future.  I do not wish to arrogate to myself the right of nominating any dates or anything like that because it is no right of mine or of my Party, but I have no doubt that in the very early weeks of the next calendar year the people of two constituencies at least will be afforded an opportunity of expressing their view of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach today drew attention to the fact that this may be considered an examination of the Government's work during the past 12 months.  The Parliamentary Secretary reiterated the Taoiseach's challenge and asked Opposition Parties what their programmes would be.  Apparently we at this stage are expected to put our programmes in black and white and publish them in the newspapers. Unless we do that, the Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary will not be satisfied.</P>
      <P>Let me say as a member of the Labour Party that at least, thanks be to God, we have no intention of being so dishonest as the people opposite.  I am very glad the Minister for Transport and Power is here now.  When they were in Opposition, they published a programme which claimed that in five years they would have 100,000 extra people in employment and when they got into power, the present Minister for Transport and Power made perfectly clear to all and sundry that that was only a blueprint of their policy.  Apparently Fianna Fáil may publish something which they can term a policy to be put into operation when it suits them and in the next breath tell us it is but a blueprint.</P>
      <P>All I am sorry for is that their blueprint did not give more satisfaction.  It would be much better for all concerned, irrespective of Party, if it were true that their policy put 100,000 people into employment.  The tragedy is that that is hypocrisy of the worst type.  It helped Fianna Fáil to get the votes they wanted to get them into the position they are in today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> The Parliamentary Secretary is a young member of this House.  Indeed, I have no intention of attacking anyone or of speaking in his absence, but I cannot help it if he is not present.  He spoke of democracy and castigated members of the Opposition because of their lack of understanding of democracy. Strange, is it not, from a Party who wanted to abolish PR a couple of years ago?  Democracy moryah.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the inter-Party Government's failure in the matter of National Loans.  Of course he did, but he did not remind us&mdash;maybe he did not know as he was not here then or did not remember&mdash;that the present Tánaiste used the expression &ldquo;pawn-broker's sign&rdquo; when the inter-Party Government looked for money in the way of National Loans.  Let it be said in favour of the members of the Opposition Parties at present that whatever our personal opinions on the amount of interest to be paid on loans and so on, none of us has ever belittled the Government or attempted to make loans a failure.  That cannot be said of Fianna Fáil.  When any loan was launched by Governments before them, members of those Governments were attacked in the most disgraceful manner.  Deputy Carter knows, because he was here then, that no one was so offensive, so personal and so vindictive to the Minister for Finance between 1948 and 1951, Deputy McGilligan, as the present Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>It is well that these facts should be brought to light.  If young members of the Government believe in democracy they will think that we should be constructive.  I want to be, and I have always tried to be, constructive. Let them remember that nobody in a glass house should throw stones.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of banks and, God save us all, he spoke of insurance companies.  There is sorrow to some of us in his insurance companies.  I will say no more than that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked us to examine the work of the past 12 months.  As far as that is concerned, the Government have set a record which I hope <Col N="1353" /> will never be achieved by another Government in the future.  We are now finishing the old year and will not be coming back until the end of January; yet six Estimates, relating to the work of the most important Departments, have not come before us for debate and constructive criticism.  These Estimates include that for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It counts, all right. The Estimate for the Department of Education came before us only last night.  We have had to postpone consideration of it, and now we may never get an opportunity of considering it.  There is the Department of Justice.  There is a lot we could have said on that and on the injustice of Fianna Fáil, but now we will not have the opportunity.  We must forget about these important Estimates, and the people must forget about them.  But let us not for the moment forget about the Tánaiste and the Estimate for the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>That was an Estimate on which it was most important that we would offer our constructive views.  That Estimate will not now come before us. Instead of attempting to get it before the House, the Tánaiste has gone back into orbit, back to denouncing everyone he does not like.  He should come back from orbit and put his Estimate before us.  Estimates for the Taoiseach's Department and for the Department of Finance have not been put before us.  There have been Bills on the Order Paper since October. Compared with the business I have been referring to, these Bills were only twopence-halfpenny matters, put there as a stratagem to avoid having the House debate the Estimates to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the House has not had the opportunity of considering these Estimates, Deputies or the general public have not been able to consider properly such vital matters as Transport and Power, for instance, and the activities of An Bord Fáilte.  We are still awaiting from the Minister for <Col N="1354" /> Health a report on the health services. Of course if that Estimate had been before us we would have had an opportunity of challenging the Minister for Health on this question.  Deputies are being denied that right, and the public are being denied the right of hearing about these things.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been speaking about our possible entry to the Common Market.  I shall not go over any ground already covered, but I feel I must allude to the fact that 12 months ago, when some of us expressed doubts about our entry to the EEC, we were branded as being various colours, including red, not alone by the Government but by the so-called experts outside. The Taoiseach today said people have no right to throw their weight about and claim they are in a position to force the Government to do this or that, but he did not say this when the so-called experts were branding us as red because we had the audacity to cast doubts on our ability to get into the Common Market last year.</P>
    <P>Our reasons for so expressing ourselves at that time were that we had not got the information made available to us and we were afraid the small farmers would suffer by our entry. Now we have in the House the Government statistician, the Minister who tells us everything is grand.  Will he now tell us why Fianna Fáil claim an El Dorado for Irish farmers on entry to the EEC, at a time when Germany and France are fighting like dogs on the agricultural issue?  They have told us every small farmer in the country will be a rich man in his own right when, by 1970, he will be able to sell his produce in Italy, Germany, France and elsewhere.  Will the small farmers be there then to enjoy all these grand benefits?</P>
    <P>Last Sunday a newspaper not unknown to the Government Party published an article by a writer who knows his job and on whose ability I do not cast any doubts.  He told us that the ultimate aim of the EEC was for political integration and unity.  We hear a lot about the Treaty of Rome, about Geneva, Brussels and the rest, but today the Taoiseach was silent on this subject.  I read a report in the <Col N="1355" /><i>Cork Examiner</i> the other day&mdash;it was published in all the other newspapers at the same time&mdash;giving the views of a survey team set up by the Government to examine the effects of EEC membership on the various industries.  This affects me very much, as it does many of my constituents, because at Carrigaline we have a pottery.  There are not many such factories in the country. The report stated that even though the managements of such factories would come up to scratch in the matter of preparing themselves for the new competition that will arise with EEC membership, the question of employment was a difficult one.  The survey team went further, and said if such managements did not come up to scratch, even though they might do a fair job, more than 700 employees would be out of work in the pottery industry.</P>
    <P>That is the prospect for the boys and girls in the Carrigaline area, the people who were told by the Minister for Transport and Power that everything would be grand when we joined the Common Market.  There are people there of 40, 45 and 50 years of age who have spent a lifetime working in that factory.  The Minister for Transport and Power tells us they can be retrained.  How are people of that age to be retrained?  They will find themselves on the scrapheap.  The Minister should realise we are dealing with human beings, not with numbers.  The sooner we realise how all this will affect our industries, the sooner we will afford generous protection to our people.</P>
    <P>We are giving them benefits.  Industrialists from other countries apparently will, over the years, find it easier for them to send their manufactured goods to Ireland.  For instance, in the worsted industry, tariffs are being reduced annually and again I am concerned because in my constituency we have many workers in that industry.  What will it benefit these people if they find that by a continuing reduction in tariffs, goods may come in at a cheap rate and they may find themselves unemployed?</P>
    <P>What benefit do we get from some of the countries to which we are giving <Col N="1356" /> advantages?  I fear the present Government think they should play host to every country, whether it is China or Japan and want to help them all to sell goods here.  We know by the imbalance in the returns that we are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  We are importing but what we export is hardly worth while.  Apparently, that satisfies Fianna Fáil since we are in the international market.  As the late Deputy Norton said, a sheik in Kuwait can get butter for 1/11 a pound but that does not happen in north-west Dublin, Cork or Kildare.  The Italians probably buy it for 2/-.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we must export but surely we do not have to continue subsidising butter and such items that our own people need in greater abundance and at a lower price.  Yet, that is Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>I was as critical of conditions&mdash;and I owe no apology to anyone for it&mdash;in 1957 as anyone but tragic as they were they still did not reach the peak unemployment under Fianna Fáil on one occasion and if the Minister for Transport and Power has not got the figures for that I suggest he should check up. Even this year when we are told of all the new factories that have opened, of industries that have come from God knows where&mdash;some have got grants and walked out and others have stayed and are all right&mdash;there are more people unemployed.  We are told how employment has mounted in new factories to so many thousand and that sounds good but why, then, should the number employed at present be fewer by 2,000 approximately than it was this time last year?  Who are employed in these factories?  We hear of the number of stamps sold but that is codology because we know the change that was brought about when the ceiling for social insurance purposes was raised from £600 to £800.  Will anybody in the Government explain why there are more unemployed now than in 1962?</P>
    <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without commenting on what might be described as a threat by the Taoiseach. Certainly, his attitude was anything but pleasant when he spoke of the wage increases being sought at present. The turnover tax has brought all this <Col N="1357" /> to a head.  Everybody knew that was coming.  Even if the Taoiseach closed his eyes I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power knew it would come and that he was not in favour of the tax but he probably had no say in it.  The Taoiseach has pontificated about the wonderful economists who are able to show that eight per cent. is the maximum increase that can be given without interfering with the economy of the country, although the employers were, apparently, prepared to go to 10 per cent.  The Taoiseach is accepting the experts; I do not want to mention one man's name but we have an idea who one of them is.  The Taoiseach made no attempt, in examining all the circumstances leading up to this, to make a comparison between production at present and the increased production last year&mdash;which is a very important factor&mdash;and the increased dividends and bonus issues over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make things difficult but I say to the Taoiseach and his Ministers: there is one thing they must do&mdash;keep their hands out of the trade union movement.  Connolly and Larkin fought for what the trade unions have today and anyone who wishes to interfere with the rights of that movement to bargain on behalf of their members will learn a sad lesson.  That is all I have to say on that.  If the Taoiseach now realises the truth about the tax it is too late for him.  If, by introducing a 2½ per cent tax the cost of living has been increased to such an extent that these workers, through their accredited trade unions, are insisting on a fair return, then let that be fixed between them and the employers but do not let the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers dabble in politics and try as they did in the past &mdash;and, unfortunately, succeeded to some extent&mdash;to bring politics into trade unionism.</P>
    <P>Last week there was a monster advertisement for the Fianna Fáil Party in the Press, probably the first advertisement by the public relations officer.  It looked very well when you saw all that they were going to do with the income from the 2½ per cent tax. Apparently, anyone who opposed the <Col N="1358" /> tax is a traitor to the economic advancement of the country and anyone who even attempted to do so was against housing, hospitalisation and all the wonderful items in the Fianna Fáil programme.  My first reaction to this was: what happened before the 2½ per cent tax?  Strangely, the various Governments tackled housing problems. Perhaps, they did not get 100 per cent of what they hoped for but housing went on.  Let nobody forget that in 1948 a hospital programme was introduced here the like of which was never heard of before.  That programme saved the lives of thousands suffering from tuberculosis and there was no 2½ per cent tax.</P>
    <P>Apparently, all is now changed.  We hear of the necessity for this 2½ per cent tax and of indirect taxation.  I would call it direct taxation on the homes of the workers when you impose increased charges on bread, butter, tea, sugar, clothing and so on.  They want us to forget that, in addition to the 2½ per cent tax, they have collected £25 million by way of loan.  What are they going to do with that £25 million? At the same time, they are raking in what I believe will amount to over £19 million from the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  What are they going to do with it all?</P>
    <P>Governments in the past have tried to do the best they could and we may have been critical of them, whether we were supporting them or opposing them, but take the Department of Local Government at the present time. It is interesting to read in the newspapers about the amount spent on housing between 1958 and 1963.  That looks all right on paper but those of us who are members of local authorities and who have been held up for over 12 months in trying to get sanction for housing projects know that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, so far as the Custom House is concerned.  The Minister at present in the House may be in favour of giving hundreds of thousands of pounds for the building of palatial hotels but it is a different matter when it comes to the building of houses for the people.</P>
    <P>When we hear of how difficult it is <Col N="1359" /> to get tradesmen, we should not forget that some of the biggest contracts going on in the country at the moment are not what they should be for&mdash;they are not for the building of houses for our people.  They are for the building of big hotels and large business premises. That is the lopsided approach of the Government to policy activity within the past 12 months.  We were told that the 2½ per cent turnover tax must not be opposed in order that we should have better health services.  It is now a long time since the Tánaiste and Minister for Health told us that he was going to present us with a report on the health services but we have seen no sign of that either.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government when they speak of opposition that they should examine, individually and collectively, their own political conscience.  There was no Party more vindictive, more abusive and more personal in their criticism of the Government than were the members of the present Government when they were sitting on the left-hand side of the House.  The records of the House will show that one member of that Party who is now a Minister had to apologise more times for his conduct than any other member of the House.  If we praise them, we are grand people but if we criticise them, we are all wrong.</P>
    <P>I shall be just and fair in my criticism and I believe there is an obligation and responsibility on members of the Labour Party when they can see that the policy of the Government is detrimental to the welfare of the ordinary people, whether it be by the imposition of a vicious taxation system, or by refusal to give sanction for the building of houses, or by their refusal to give the people the benefits of the improvements promised by the Minister for Health, and as long as we are being denied the right to discuss the various important Estimates for Departments of State, to be critical of the Government.  So long as these grievances exist, so long may the Taoiseach and the Government expect us to be critical of their activities and inactivities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going back in my mind and recalling the times in our political history when we have had discussions on taxation and on the efforts made by Fianna Fáil to expand our national economy.  It is a very interesting fact that we have heard all this before from Fine Gael but it is just as well that we should look back on the history of the propaganda campaigns against the Fianna Fáil Party when questions in relation to the cost of living became of interest to the general public.  It is interesting to see what happened on each occasion when the Fine Gael and Labour Parties concentrated the interest of the people on the question of increases in the cost of living or increases in taxation with a view to catching as many votes as they could.</P>
      <P>The history of all this is pretty dismal from their point of view.  In 1948 we had an election campaign in which, apart from political abuse of the Government and allegations of widespread corruption of which there was no evidence and which were never proved, on every side the people were told that the cost of living had gone up scandalously during the war.  They were told that the whole country was being exploited by rich profiteers who were running around in enormous motor cars at the expense of the people and who were giving large grants and subventions to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government were elected after this scandalous campaign but there was no case of profiteering found or proved.  A tribunal to inquire into the prices of flour and wheat was established and reported back to the Government that there was no evidence of profiteering.  The Ministers appointed then had access to all the Departments but not a word was said.  There then settled on the country a deathly silence in relation to all the allegations of extravagance, corruption and excessive prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition proceeded to borrow millions of American money and throw it into circulation, to spend it on consumer goods and in 1952 we had an <Col N="1361" /> unbalanced Budget to the amount of about £8 million and in 1951 an adverse trade balance of £61 million. The Coalition Government went scuttling out of office, being unable to manage their affairs, and Fianna Fáil came back in and found the money for the unbalanced Budget.  Fianna Fáil also proceeded to deal with the very serious imbalance of payments position caused by the fact that the country had been buying more goods from abroad than it had exports to pay for.</P>
    <P>We corrected the situation, raised the necessary taxation to balance the Budget and re-established our economic policy.  The whole of the next three years in which we retained office uneasily was spent in futile recriminations in this House with regard to the increase in the cost of living that took place as a result of our taxation.</P>
    <P>By 1954, we had corrected the position left to us by the Coalition Government.  Everything was moving steadily forward in the right direction. The country's agricultural and industrial production were increasing.  Wage increases had taken place.  Farmers had gained increases in incomes which more than compensated for such increases in the cost of living as were made inevitable by the corrected Budget of 1952.  Then we had a general election.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the general election was cast in exactly the same pattern as Fine Gael would now cast one if they had the opportunity.  Every other matter of importance was forgotten and neglected so far as they were concerned. The fact that we had ended a period of prosperity that had grown automatically because we passed from wartime conditions to peacetime conditions and were facing greater competition was not adverted to.  The fact that the people would have to make all the effort of which they were capable in order to help to expand the economy was not adverted to.  We had a perfect example of the Fine Gael attitude towards exploiting short-term interests solely in order to gain votes.</P>
    <P>About 1,000,000 blue leaflets were spread all over the country accompanied, in the case of a Cork by-election, <Col N="1362" /> by loaves of bread in the windows with the 1952 price and the 1954 price.  The increased wages of Cork workers were not put on the printed cards beside the loaves of bread.  All that was indicated was the increase in the price of the loaf.  However, these blue leaflets clearly indicated a promise by Fine Gael that if returned to office these taxes would come down.  Then there was this terribly trite, vulgar phrase &ldquo;A good time will be had by all if you vote Fine Gael&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was no question of a challenge to the future or of dealing with important fundamental matters or of how we would advance the national economy and the national income. There was no question about the fact that competition was growing all round and about the necessity for new steps to stimulate industry.  It was a campaign designed solely to get votes from people who in spite of whatever propaganda Fianna Fáil could make simply for the moment and temporarily thought perhaps of their present interest and looked at the fact that certain prices had increased, forgetting in most cases that their wages had increased by a greater amount than what was represented by the increase in the cost of living and the tax.  Being human, a certain proportion of them, a certain floating vote, largely in the cities, decided to give the Government a skelp, to give some punishment to the Fianna Fáil Government for it. They elected a Coalition Government. They never could have secured office if they had not circulated those dreadful little blue leaflets all over the country. Millions of them were distributed and put into the door of every house.</P>
    <P>They got in.  What happened in the next three years?  Not a tax was reduced.  The cost of all those commodities whose price had increased in the previous three years did not go down.  By the beginning of 1957, and just before the Fianna Fáil Government came in, the cost of living had gone up by eight per cent in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country had seen since the war, created solely by the mismanagement of the Coalition Government.  It was a crisis <Col N="1363" /> that could be seen nowhere else in Northern Europe.  We were the only country in Northern Europe where the national income at constant price was either declining or stable for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>I challenge the members of the then Coalition Government.  I shall not quote figures: they can look them up and see how the national incomes of all the countries in Northern Europe&mdash; countries devastated by war, countries which were neutral, Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, in spite of Suez&mdash;were steadily rising during all that period while we lingered behind. We had record unemployment.  We had emigration.  There was a feeling of despair amongst our people during those three years.</P>
    <P>We have had this story before.  We are quite familiar with a situation in which Fine Gael exploits a short-term interest and draws the attention of people to a particular segment of Fianna Fáil policy without having regard to the long-term interest of the country.  They make all sorts of promises but never fulfil them and they go out of office leaving a terrible mess for us to clean up after them.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways of dealing with this situation would be to redistribute the blue leaflets of 1954: let everybody in the country have them &mdash;with a few simple statements about what happened afterwards.  What was the result of this kind of publicity and the gaining of a few votes.  We have seen all this before.  In fact, it is too easy to appeal to a certain floating vote.  I refer to people who, perhaps, have not time to read the newspapers or to study facts.  It is too easy to give them the impression that they, individually, are being exploited by the Government in comparison with other groups. It is too easy to encourage envy and competition among various sectors of the community, each trying to see how much they can get out of the common pool without seeing how it affects the nation.  It is easy to do that but the result can be very serious for the nation.</P>
    <P>On every single occasion when we <Col N="1364" /> had to take more money from the central pool of income or to increase taxation or to take any other action which had a short-term effect on prices, within a comparatively short period the incomes of the people as a whole had increased sufficiently more than to offset the contributions we asked for. It happened between 1952 and 1954. It happened in 1957 when we were forced to impose some taxation because of an unbalanced Budget left to us.  In that period&mdash;from then until today&mdash; the wage packets, the earnings of the community, have grown to about double the increase in the cost of living that has taken place in that time. The income <i>per capita</i> in the case of agriculture, equally, has grown to meet these increased costs.  On every occasion on which we had to take this kind of action and to ask the people to contribute more to the pool of Government expenditure the position has been more than corrected and the national economy has advanced.</P>
    <P>When it became perfectly clear that if we were to be able to progress still further in developing the economy, we believed that in order to secure sufficient funds&mdash;largely for agriculture and education and, in turn, for social services&mdash;we decided to impose this turnover tax.  I have no doubt if the people regard this intelligently and take an intelligent attitude towards it, that with the growth of economy that has taken place in the past five years and the growth that is taking place this year&mdash;when we anticipate a growth in the national income of some £30 million to £40 million compared with 1962&mdash;we will be able to say that there has been constructive use of these funds, that they have helped advance the national economy and, above all, that we have established a form of taxation in which we can be certain that if in future the national economy expands on a reasonable basis, and if no section of the community seeks too much reward for itself, we will be able to see a net advantage to everyone.</P>
    <P>That is what we in Fianna Fáil believe.  We get no suggestions whatever from the Opposition as to how this money is to be found or in what way expenses can be reduced.  I have <Col N="1365" /> no doubt that in the Cork by-election when it takes place we will get this sort of propaganda from the Opposition. I saw it beginning and I must be fair to some Deputies in Fine Gael. Deputy Flanagan seems to be the leader in this propaganda.  It is the sort of thing that will be used in the by-election and which was used in the 1954 election.  The emphasis is put on certain Government expenditure and there is the usual catchcry &ldquo;why do they spend so many millions on this when they could increase the old age pension by 5/- a week?&rdquo; or some such slogan.  Again, coming to the kind of thing we can expect in the Cork by-election I notice in a speech which Deputy Flanagan made somewhere in the country that he is starting off again. He said the Government are raising £10 million by the turnover tax and that the Government are spending £7 million on aeroplanes and was it not scandalous that the Minister for Transport and Power was making use of his position to put this unbearable weight of taxation on the people by buying such aeroplanes, and surely there must be something more important that could be done to assist the people, or the social welfare services. It is typical propaganda and we heard it multiplied and exaggerated a hundred times in the 1954 and the 1958 elections.  The answer is simple.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, we are spending £10 million on aircraft and on a new electronic reservation system for Aer Lingus and a building in which they can concentrate their activities instead of having them spread around 20 or 30 offices in Dublin.  Of that amount, the air company are raising £7¾ million and we are finding £2¼ million.  The £2¼ million is part of the capital plan of the Government and if one looks at the general growth of the national debt and the way that money is paid, the interest is six per cent on the capital.  When it is all spent, which will not be this year, but part of it will be spent next year and part in the following year, the total amount the taxpayer will have to pay, indirectly in interest at six per cent, will be <Col N="1366" /> £133,000.  We can imagine how difficult it is going to be for the average person coming home at night after a hard day's work to work out that little calculation.  It is not £7 million; it is £133,000, which the taxpayer at the end of three years will be asked to pay as interest on that part of the capital expenditure on the aircraft which we envisage are essential to the tourist trade and which will bring money and employment to the people.</P>
      <P>Some foolish people will not listen to the story.  Perhaps they will be too busy and so you will get that kind of low-down propaganda going around the country and some people will ask: &ldquo;What are the Fianna Fáil Government doing, imposing current taxation to the tune of £7 million?&rdquo; when, as I have indicated, it will be much more like £133,000, a lot of which will not be required next year but in the two or three successive years.  As I said, we have heard all this before but we stand forthright on the statement that we have to impose taxation and we have asked the people to contribute more.  The national income has grown sufficiently in the last five years to prove our ability to order the finances of the nation properly and to ensure that workers, steadily and progressively over a period, are properly remunerated for any increase in living costs that may arise as a result of any of our policies.  We have seen exports increase massively since that period; we have seen emigration go down to the lowest figure for a very long period, and above all we see around us tremendous confidence in the future; evidence on every hand that the people and those who come with capital from abroad are working together and going ahead with plans for expansion, on a scale that we never could have envisaged five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I want to speak about is certain observations made by Deputy Corish in connection with the Taoiseach's suggestion as to the increase in remuneration that would be advisable.  The Taoiseach, of course, is not attempting to dictate to anybody. There is no dictatorial system in this country to dictate what wages should be.  We are able now to ascertain the <Col N="1367" /> various factors in the country's economy from which some conclusions can be drawn as to what kind of increase in remuneration can take place and which will have the maximum beneficial effect and the least harmful effect.  The Taoiseach on many occasions has said that one of the most certain things in the world is that if this country is to prosper wages and earnings must increase steadily and we all know that there must be a greater demand for all our goods and services if we are to have lively exports.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is basing this statement on calculations that are now accepted&mdash;I do not think there are any of what you might call conservative Governments left in Northern Europe, in the old sense&mdash;by right of centre Governments or left of centre Governments throughout Europe, whatever their complexion is.  There are methods of making this calculation which are accepted abroad, accepted by socialists, by social democratic governments in Scandinavian countries, by mixed coalition forms of government in the Netherlands, by the Swiss form of federal government.  They are accepted everywhere, and by the vast majority of economists.  There are very few economists who disagree with the general principles on which these calculations are made.  They are based on the past growth of production in industry and agriculture, estimated growth of production in industry and agriculture in the future, growth of output per worker, growth of output by farmers and industrialists.  They are based on the increases in wages that have taken place over a period and which are likely to take place in those countries with which we are in competition.</P>
    <P>Equally, profits can be determined in the same kind of way.  There are some industries where the profit is very high but which pay very high rates of wages because of the particular character of the industry.  There are some industries where profits are very, very low, and wages are low, because the industry is either subject to the stress of extreme competition or else is not well managed.  High profits do not <Col N="1368" /> necessarily mean low wages.  One can foresee, however, in a given period that one needs a rate of profit which will, first of all, attract more capital to private enterprise to build up other activities or expand a given industry. One can see that profits should be such that the company concerned has sufficient new machinery, renewed old machinery, adopted new methods in order to increase production and, incidentally, employ more people and expand exports.</P>
    <P>Equally, the company must have regard to some reserves to deal with sudden changes in costs or perhaps a temporary recession in its particular field of activity.  It must align its profits to any reduction in tariffs it anticipates as a result of a general move towards a free trade world. Whatever its profits will be they certainly must not be those which will inhibit an increase in wages.  Directors of modern companies are now so subject to the pressure of trade unions in this modern world that, if the increases in profits over a period are examined and compared with the increases in wages, the growth of earnings and wages in a great many of the most successful firms has often far outstripped over a period the increase in the growth in profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this country is concerned, the reductions in tariffs this year and next year will have an effect which, one can see, will at least induce manufacturers to invest a great deal of money in new plant so that they can face free trade conditions and go ahead with a programme of expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke on this, he was not suggesting that any particular figure was something of an absolutely rigid character in relation to any particular industry.  There are industries in which there have been some increases already because, for some reason or another, there was a lag in some previous wage round.  The Taoiseach mentioned this by way of guidance to the community, guidance of a kind which is now commonplace <Col N="1369" /> throughout Europe.  Whatever the special conditions may be here, and whatever the forces social and economic operating, guidance of this kind is completely normal and understood by trade unions and employer organisations in a great many countries in Northern Europe.  I could quote from the reports in relation to Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium where this kind of thing occurs year after year.</P>
    <P>It is not a perfect process.  Mistakes are made.  In one year, there will be a drift, an inevitable drift from the actual plan, due to a very sudden growth in prosperity or to the fact that groups representing the workers may feel the need to compensate them for some particular reason.  In the next year then the arrangements level off again.</P>
    <P>It is not a perfect process.  I do not suppose it ever will be perfect here either, but at least it works in a general way, and it has proved to be fairly reliable.  It is not bogus.  It is a genuine method of trying to calculate what the profits of the whole nation will be and how they should be shared out over a period.  It was that kind of proposal, or suggestion, the Taoiseach was making.  One of the objects behind it is, of course, if one can possibly do it, that it is a good thing to have an increase in remuneration which will have the least possible effect on prices so that as much as possible can be kept and will not be reflected in an increase in prices.  Again, one must be practicable about that.  It is not possible, even in Europe, to make it operate as perfectly as that and there has been a steady increase in the cost of living in Northern Europe, even in the well regulated countries where they do not permit runaway inflation.</P>
    <P>Ever since the war, the value of money has been declining in most parts of the world.  It is declining in the United States.  As I say, it is not a perfect method and some allowance must be made for the fact that the value of money declines.  All we want to ensure here is that the value of our money does not decline faster than the value of the money of the countries <Col N="1370" /> with which we compete for foreign trade.  We want to preserve that balance so that we can match the competition and preserve the competitive character of our prices.  Taking things by and large, and looking back over the past ten years, increases in remuneration have operated fairly successfully without the application of the kind of principles that are now established in Northern Europe.  There may have been three occasions when the increase was temporarily more than was justified. On the other occasions, negotiations were successful, although they were carried out more or less by simple bargaining and without taking the advice that is now taken by this country in regard to growth and changes in the national economy.</P>
    <P>All we hope for is to see the kind of advance taking place which will have the least possible adverse results and which will expand the purchasing power of the people while enabling the nation to go ahead.  I hope I have dispelled now some of the darker suggestions made here of some kind of plot.  It was stated the Taoiseach was trying to act as a dictator to the trade unions.  Nothing of the kind.  This can be worked out intelligently and to the advantage of everybody concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  He merely recommended it.  With regard to social welfare services, although we have sometimes linked a growth in social welfare services partly to an increase that has taken place in taxation, the growth in social welfare services has enormously outstripped the cost of living since the Government took office in 1957.  In 1956 a widow, with three children, and a non-contributory pension received £2 3s. 2d., including children's allowances.  She is now receiving £3 10s. 8d., an increase of 64 per cent.  The cost of <Col N="1371" /> living has increased since 1956 by something between 18 and 20 per cent. If she has five children, the increase is 81 per cent.  I am speaking now of the January, 1964, increases.  Non-contributory old age pensions have gone up by 46 per cent since 1956.  A man in receipt of unemployment benefit, with a wife and three children, got £3 7s. 8d. in 1956.  He will get in January, 1964, £5 18s. 8d., an increase of 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches speak of the social welfare benefits and imply they only just cover the effect of the 2½ per cent, that the increases have all been of that kind&mdash;very grand to talk about but in fact not doing much good.  As I look down through the list of the various social services of one kind or another, I find the increases&mdash;I shall not give them in detail &mdash;are: 75 per cent, 97 per cent, 72 per cent, 73 per cent, 64 per cent and 81 per cent for six different combinations of social services with different numbers of children, since 1956.</P>
      <P>That is not to say we would not like to increase the social welfare services still more, but considerable progress has been made.  If you take any £20 million increase in social welfare payments over any period since the war, you can be certain Fianna Fáil provided £18 million of it.  That has been our record.  In the Second Programme for Economic Expansion we have written down quite frankly in the statement an increase in the current expenditure by the State over the next seven years.  We have put in that increase partly because we are not highly taxed as a nation compared with other nations in northern Europe. We think that with only a very fractional increase in the percentage taken by the State in relation to people's incomes in the turnover tax, we ought in ensuing years to be more certain of distributing some of the proceeds for greater social welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of central taxation in 1962 was something over 10 per cent of the gross national production.  That is recognised by economists all over northern Europe as the best method of comparing the incidence of taxation <Col N="1372" /> with that of other countries.  In a great many countries in northern Europe&mdash; partly, admittedly, because of defence commitments and partly because of very elaborate social services &mdash; the figures are anything from 12 per cent to 14 per cent.  We do not believe we need take that.  We believe that, if the economy grows as much in 1964 as it has grown in 1963, at the end of that period, even with the turnover tax collected, the percentage of money taken from the people in relation to what they produce and to their incomes will bear the same sort of relationship within a fractional amount as it bore in the dark days of 1956, when the incomes of the people were lower and the total amount of money collected in taxation was lower.</P>
    <P>We do not believe there will be any striking change.  Even if you add the rates to central taxation, the total percentage of State and local taxation in 1956 in relation to the gross national production was of the order of 22 per cent and the figure for 1962-63 was something like 23 per cent.  When Deputy Dillon talks about our collecting £65 million more in taxation, he is suggesting apparently that we can develop the economy, pay social services and live in a unique world in northern Europe as the only country that finds it possible not to increase the amount collected in taxes and still enable the nation to develop, whereas in every other country in Europe modern states habitually find themselves having to collect well over a quarter of the total income of the people in taxation.  Yet, for some strange reason we are supposed to have some wizard method of progressing. The statement made by Deputy Dillon that the amount collected in taxes has gone up by £65 million means nothing in the general context of the nation's progress, because every country everywhere is collecting more in taxation for various purposes.</P>
    <P>We have been all through this before.  We have had three elections in which these arguments of short-term interests, these immediate appeals and panic wild talk about taxation have been the major theme.  In every case we in Fianna Fáil have eventually <Col N="1373" /> triumphed.  In every case when the Coalition Government gained temporary advantage, they neither justified their promises nor were they able to maintain a stable Government financially. In 1957, when they went out of office, they had broken every single promise they made in those wonderful little blue leaflets circulated throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's speech this morning, which is unusual, and I also waited to hear Deputy Dillon.  I make it a practice of going home for my dinner, but I remained here for my dinner until Deputy Dillon finished.  In the finale, he mentioned my name.  I told him I had been listening to him and had heard nothing.  That is true.  I heard nothing.  The Taoiseach made a very objective and realistic speech.  He covered the major problems affecting the country.  As usual, Deputy Dillon devoted his speech to trivial things&mdash; at least things that should be dealt with at local level.  He commenced, as usual, by referring to houses falling down and to the people up in Griffith Barracks.  I do not want to devote much time to that, because this is not a housing debate, but I certainly will give a couple of minutes to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said the national conscience should be affected by the plight of certain people in Griffith Barracks. But, while Deputy Dillon was shedding tears in the House, I had to shed my sweat trying to get the worst off family there housed.  I give all my time to Corporation work, while most of the other people are away at their jobs.  While they are earning from £20 to £50 a week, I am earning nothing, but devoting my time to the Corporation Housing Department.  Therefore, when problems of this nature arise, I usually &mdash; not always &mdash; do the hard work.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Dillon was shedding his tears, I was doing the running around to get this family of ten housed. It was no easy job.  There are always snags.  One of the snags was that this was the family of a serving soldier. It would appear that his wife had a house in the Curragh.  He left the Army and his wife lost the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> It appears this family had a row with their own family &mdash; the family put them out.  This is the history.  Unfortunately, this large family were put out by their blood relations at a period when we had a very serious emergency. I mention that only because it was mentioned by Deputy Dillon as a trivial matter.  It is not a trivial matter but one of a local authority nature.</P>
    <P>Some time ago he shed further tears here about people being put out on the streets.  It was due to hard work on my part that most of the old people were got off the streets, because there is a rule that they only get certain offers.  I had to bring forward a proposal at the council to get these people off the streets one way or another.  It was carried by one miserable vote.  I refer to those things only because Deputy Dillon spoke about them but it is other people, not of his Party, who do most of the hard work.</P>
    <P>Now, again because he referred to housing, and this has something to do with the matter on the Adjournment, I will quote some figures from page 156 of the council minutes, 1957.  The number of men employed on housing in 1954, which was the year the Coalition came into power, was 2,378.  In the early months of 1957, the number employed was 925.  If we want to go into housing, I am prepared at any time to take on anyone and I can assure you I will make my case.  But Deputy Dillon has a habit of referring to those things about which he knows little or nothing.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the council minutes that there were 2,643 dwellings under construction in 1954.  In July, 1957&mdash; just after the present Government got in&mdash;there were 963 houses under construction. This tells a story.  The number of men employed on site development in 1955 was 230 but early in 1957 there were only 134, which means that the number of men who should have been preparing the sites for future housing development was reduced by 40 per cent.  That should give a picture.  They are facts; I am not just inventing them; they are there to be disputed.  As I said, I did not mean to go into the housing problem but it is the practice of Deputy Dillon, every time he gets up here, to talk <Col N="1375" /> about houses falling down.  If I wanted to go into that I could prove his friends helped to make them fall down.  I had a motion on the Corporation order paper in 1957 that we should construct dwellings for ones and twos but it was turned down, largely by those who supported the Coalition.  It was because there was no housing construction for ones and twos that the tenements were falling down on the old people.  I would not have gone into this only Deputy Dillon spoke about something he knows nothing about.</P>
    <P>Little has been said about the turnover tax today.  I am satisfied it is dead.  Only yesterday a shopkeeper in my area told me they have overcome their worries, things are working smoothly and the people have stopped complaining.  I have a large family and I can speak with authority. I am not like some people going along the streets with one child.  I have nine children and half of them are still going to school.  I am no better off than an ordinary worker.  I am nothing else except a TD.  I have certain commitments and my means are certainly no better than an ordinary worker, certainly no better than an ordinary tradesman.  I make out the turnover tax costs me 7/- per week but my wife gets back 5/- per week Children's Allowances.  It costs me about the same as a tradesman, 2/- a week.  It is all right saying certain things are gone up by 12 per cent but you have to compare that with other things which have not gone up at all.  Some of the big stores, like Cummiskey's and Powers' are charging no tax on a lot of things and very little on others.  If you go into Clery's bar in O'Connell Street the beer is even cheaper than it was before the turnover tax came into operation.</P>
    <P>In the beginning, some traders tried to put on a higher increase.  It must be remembered most of the business houses were in league with the Opposition.  We know that from the marchers through Dublin some months ago.  It was for spite some of them shoved on the tax.  If people really wanted to help, they should go around <Col N="1376" /> boycotting those shops instead of parading through the streets.  I am satisfied, as the tax is working out, it is only costing an extra one per cent more than the 2½ per cent; it is not four per cent.  I got my pencil and paper and worked it out.  It is between 3½ per cent and four per cent.  In other words, it is costing my wife about 2/- more than the value of the children's allowance she is getting.  If that is the position with my wife&mdash;I have a lot of children &mdash;it must be the same in every other case.  It may cost people with no children a little more but if somebody has to pay the tax, surely it is the people without responsibility who should do so?</P>
    <P>If we moan, we usually moan about all the children, and Deputy Dillon sheds tears.  When you moan about all the children, you must take into account the Children's Allowances and you must compare what they are getting with what they are being charged.  People now are shopping here and there and know where they are being overcharged.  The increase has gradually gone down to between 3½ per cent and four per cent, taking good with bad.  The turnover tax is not so terrible at all except for the big spenders or the people with no children; it may cost them 5/-.  When we moan about the children we cannot moan on both sides.  People with no children should have to pay more.  If you talk about people with children you have to take into consideration the £4½ million which is being shared out.</P>
    <P>I admit there is some increase but I believe it is not what is was and all this campaigning is dying off.  It is my opinion that if the Opposition were any way honest and told the people what they would do there would never have been any campaign; there would be no point in campaigning.  These simple people were led to believe that if the Opposition were in power there would be no tax and they would get children's allowances for nothing.  We know that is a lie.</P>
    <P>We heard the Taoiseach's speech today and we know, in fact, things will be worse than we thought.  We know the teachers, the Garda and the Post <Col N="1377" /> Office people are getting an increase and those are additional increases.  It does not matter who is in power, money has to be got from somewhere to pay those people.  You cannot pay those people on promises.  Once you get into power, you have to get the dough and that is all about it.  You would have in fact to forget the extravagant promises you made to the country and you would have to get as much as the present Government have to get.  When the Opposition expect a man like me to vote for them and against the Government, they must realise I am not a simpleton.  I have come up the hard way, the realistic way, and I could not accept speeches like Deputy Dillon's which conveyed nothing to me.  I accept that if we have to pay out, we must get the money.</P>
    <P>I compare the Government with the head of a family.  They are the parents of the State and they are in the same position as the parents of a family.  If some of the family work and some do not work, then if those who are working get an increase, they have to give something extra to the mother or the wife to pay for the needs of those who are not working.  In other words, the employed member is not supposed to think that it goes to himself altogether. He has to make a contribution on that basis and the State has to be generous also with whatever benefits are given. Things have to be provided for the children and you must have something for the old man who has to be kept, too.</P>
    <P>In other words, when all the employees of private industry get increases, at the same time all the people depending on the State expect increases, and as the Government are like the parents of a family, naturally the Government will expect to get a bit to help them to spread it over the people depending on them.  That is common sense.  What we are asked to accept is that if all the employees in industry get an increase, they ought not to contribute towards those depending on the Government.  In the old days, we had that sort of thing in this country&mdash;families letting their parents go to the poorhouse or starve on the streets.  Lots of them did that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> They deliberately let their families go to asylums, and the State stepped in as that was happening and saw that it would have to provide some form of independent means.  That is the principle on which this whole business of benefits is based.  Now the State has to come along to get a cut from those who are getting increases.  That makes sense to me.  It might not to people outside but it would, if they could only figure it out.</P>
    <P>The big difference between us politicians and lots of ordinary people is that they do not figure it out.  They have their little home and their pub and their own circle.  I do not say that they are mean or selfish but there is a selfish strain, of course, in the lot of us, but if they could figure things out, they would accept what the Government are asking them to do.  They think that the Government have a big hole in the Park and that any time they want money, they can go there for it.  We have the hard facts and we know today from the Taoiseach that not only do we need the money asked for but we need more.</P>
    <P>We in the Corporation have a differential rent system and to an extent State affairs should be based on that system.  We charge those with the highest income a rent which is much more than for those who have no income. We can only do it as long as those with the most income pay more money.  If those with the high income did not pay more money, then we could not give our modern houses to the unemployed man.  We would have to leave him in the slums.  If a man became unemployed and could not pay the 25/- or 30/- rent, he would have to be evicted.  So we devised the system under which no matter what your means are, you will not lose your home.  The poor man, the unemployed man, has for six shillings a week a house for which the ordinary house purchaser is paying £3 10s. a week, because we devised a system whereby the State helps and those with the big incomes pay the maximum.  Then there is fair play all around.  There is no other way.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of agitation when this differential rent system came into <Col N="1379" /> force, and those who were asked to pay more asked: &ldquo;Why should I pay for that fellow who is unemployed?&rdquo; That is the attitude the Opposition are trying to inculcate into the minds of the people, that they should not have to pay for the unfortunate depending on the Government.  They are asking the people to object to paying a contribution towards all those people about whom they are shedding all the tears. If we are to get away from the old days of having dependants walled up in the workhouses, we must agree to a system by which those with the money, in proportion to the money they have, give a cut to the parents, to the State, to spread it over those who have nothing.  We must accept that, and there is no need for all this business about the purchase tax.  The sooner we stop talking about the purchase tax the better, because now the Taoiseach has told us that we need more money and when the people realise it as well, they will realise that this agitation was all a fraud.</P>
    <P>I admit, of course, that it is a Party game, and I will not throw too many bricks at the Opposition because all Parties play that game.  I admit that, but if Parties think they are justified in playing that game, I do not have to play it.  I am not in a Party.  If I feel that what the Government are doing is right, that it is the only thing to do, it is up to me to support the Government. I could take a mean attitude and say to the poor people who do not understand that I am going on their side.  I could have done that and I could have been a great big fellow. But I studied the whole thing and I can get back on my own efforts.  I do not need to be under an obligation on that sort of thing.  If I act the way I do, it is with confidence in myself and knowing the hard work that I do that you know nothing about.  Do not forget that.  I hold that the Government should be supported.  They are realistic. They face the facts.  They have a difficult job to do, as all Governments have.</P>
    <P>I was reading recently the life of Lincoln.  I have been reading stuff <Col N="1380" /> like that.  On his second term of office, the last year of the Civil War, he realised that he had to bring in conscription and he was told by half his Cabinet that if he did, he would not be re-elected.  In fact, there were riots throughout the whole of North America.  Thousands were killed in these riots and funnily enough, it was Irishmen who led the riots in New York against conscription.  But the situation had become so serious that actually the South were beginning to show signs of victory and there were all sorts of campaigns against Lincoln to give in to the South.  He would not give in.  He said: &ldquo;I want men. Men alone will save America.&rdquo;  He was told: &ldquo;If you do not give in, you will lose the election&rdquo;, and he said: &ldquo;I will take a chance on that. There will be no point in being President if there is no country to be President of.&rdquo;  That was his answer and he won out, but only against tremendous opposition from all quarters, even his own Cabinet.  These are the difficulties of all people in power.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I do not want to say that they are rogues in the Opposition.  I have no doubt that if Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, they would attack the Government at every opportunity.  When it comes to my vote, I certainly am not going to vote against the Government.  I realise that the country has a better chance of stability with a large group than with a number of small groups, because it is common sense that with small groups, there are a lot of politically ambitious people blackmailing the Government in power.  Here is a large group and certainly we are not blackmailing them.  We do not give them any advice and have little or nothing to say to them.  We just vote for them. We accept the Government the country needs at present as we accept the guards in the street.  We accept that that Government are on the job and that there is plenty of money floating around.  But the weakness of the Government is that like the parents of a family, they have to get more money. It is unpopular, naturally, to be looking for money and any Government in the same boat would be unpopular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> However, it has to be done and they are doing the honest thing.  They are not unfair at all.  The tax works out at something like a shilling or two for the likes of me and maybe five or six shillings for the person with no responsibilities.  If anybody has to pay, he ought to pay.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a Corporation official yesterday and I asked him: &ldquo;How much did you get in the eighth round increase?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I got 50 shillings.&rdquo; I asked how much did the tax cost and he said about nine shillings. Then I asked: &ldquo;What are you complaining about?&rdquo; I was told here that the eighth round increase was not due to an increase in the cost of living. I was told by a Labour Deputy that there was very little increase in the cost of living at that time, although there may have been an increase following it.  Surely that person should not mind handling back ten shillings or fifteen shillings out of the 50 shillings but he does not like it, as he told me. There is neither sense nor justice in that attitude.  At the same time, it is a great lobby for anybody who does not care for the country, for anybody who is looking for power.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether the Opposition like it or not&mdash;I am referring to Oppositions in general&mdash;but Oppositions take advantage of every opportunity and the State does not come into it.  If things are not miserable it is to their advantage to create misery or to invent it.  If anybody wants to know why I voted for the Government it was because I believe they are responsible for whatever economic progress there is, that they have faced up to realities and, if nothing more, have saved the country from collapse.  While no Utopia need result from Government planning there could be a collapse and if their efforts will ward off collapse that in itself deserves the maximum support.  There are Common Market, automation and other worries for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the Labour Party because it has been said here that the Taoiseach is interfering with the unions.  I have always supported the trade unions.  In the Corporation, <Col N="1382" /> I am always on the side of the workers anytime they want a rise. However, I put this to an official only last week.  People may not like it but I am fond of putting questions to them. I said: &ldquo;How do you feel about getting a substantial increase which causes a large amount of unemployment? Naturally if employers have to pay out more they will strive further for automation and that means less work.&rdquo;  He admitted that and I asked: &ldquo;What do you think of having frequent increases?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I am not in love with it at all.  We have to be careful.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Some people never give that a thought&rdquo; to which he replied: &ldquo;Some of them are politicians and they believe they will get more kudos by looking for substantial increases for certain people without caring two hoots what the result will be.  The trade unions would be better off if there were not so many politicians in them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention that without any reflection on the Labour Party.  They are entitled to be in the House and to have a shot at the Government of this country.  I am not anti-union.  I am only a worker.  All my family are workers.  My father was a carter.  I am concerned about action being taken which might result in many of our people finding themselves out of jobs and having to go to England.  As we all know automation means and will mean in the future that if a person is sacked from his job he has little chance of another one.  We are told there is little hope for manual workers in this or in any other country.  Therefore, it should be the policy of any responsible authority to ensure that, while aiming at the best possible wage, it does not mean that men who otherwise would have a working wage would have only about one-third or one-fifth of that out on the dole.</P>
    <P>Let me say before I sit down &mdash; I want to give the Opposition a chance to speak; I know they are waiting for it&mdash;I support the Government and will continue to do so as long as I am satisfied they are making progress. They do not have to make progress to get my support.  If I believe they are up against it through world events <Col N="1383" /> or other conditions created through no fault of theirs and they are striving to ward off some certain defeat or tragedy here, I shall still support them. When I am satisfied they are making a hames of things, that is the time I will turn against them and not until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Minister for Transport and Power speaking here.  I wonder when I hear the Minister for Transport and Power why the Government do not make a real Minister of him, give him some responsibility, let him come in here and talk about CIE and other things, instead of giving us an economic lecture to show that everything is rosy in the country, that the people are better off than they have been in years and that they are going ahead with progress.  He founded that on the Taoiseach's speech this evening which Deputy Corish correctly described as a mixture of boom and gloom with the gloom predominating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the gloom was particularly evident in his speech when he came to talk about the increases which people deserve in their wages and salaries in <Col N="1386" /> order to make up for the extra taxation which he and his Government have imposed on the country.  The Minister for Transport and Power talked about broken promises.  He also talked about the scandalous propaganda there was about 100,000 jobs.  He said there never was any such promise.  I wish that this could be beaten out in an argument.  Surely 100,000 jobs were mentioned on some occasion or another in the past ten years.  The figure 100,000 was mentioned and the term of five years to get them into operation was surely mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have here a leaflet issued when the late Deputy Galvin was standing in a by-election before he made his first appearance in the House.  &ldquo;Quick action needed to avert national disaster&rdquo; is the big headline.  The second big headline is &ldquo;Fianna Fáil plans the end of emigration.&rdquo;  Then there is a bleat about the spate of emigration and the leaflet continues:</P>
    <P>In contrast to the inaction of the present Coalition, Fianna Fáil has been preparing plans for the day when the Party will again take up the reins of Government.</P>
    <P>The full employment proposals recently announced by Fianna Fáil show how the Party intends to deal with the problem of emigration by providing work for our own people at home.</P>
    <P>Again, bigger headlines:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000.</P>
    <P>If that is not a promise, it was intended to be taken as a promise.  I agree that there were never 100,000 jobs in contemplation.  The Taoiseach never thought there would be 100,000 jobs.  That was a deceitful piece of propaganda intended to delude the people's minds and having deluded the people's minds, it was intended to direct their activities to voting Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We heard today one of the gloom speeches.  I went back to my records and I have a record of a speech by the Taoiseach in Letterkenny in September, <Col N="1387" /> 1947.  It is too long to quote here in detail but there was this phrase, the real phrase to which he was working up:</P>
    <P>If there is an idea that we are facing an easy time in which we can have more pay and less work, it is very desirable to kill that idea quickly.  We are entering four years of most acute difficulty in which economic disaster will threaten on every side and our only weapon of defence is the capacity to work hard.  If that weapon fails us we are finished.</P>
    <P>Is that not the speech of this morning? &ldquo;Our only weapon is hard work&rdquo;&mdash;and not too much pay for hard work.  &ldquo;Economic disaster threatens.&rdquo;  The bright future the Taoiseach pictured at the start of his speech is overclouded by fears that if people press on for more wages and salaries, the future is a gamble.</P>
    <P>In fact, if we go back to the Letterkenny speech, disaster threatens us on every side.  That was September, 1947.  There were several by-elections and the Government went to a general election where they were beaten and the Coalition Government came in. By the time I came to my first Budget in 1948, we had remitted the greater part of all the taxes that were then on beer, tobacco and entertainments.  We had remitted the greater part of those. The Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce backed by the then Taoiseach was arguing up and down the country: &ldquo;If you want our subsidies, you must keep all our taxes.&rdquo; We kept the subsidies and remitted the taxes.  What happened?  In two Budgets we had remission of taxes amounting to £8½ million and we had extra subventions for old age pensioners, civil servants and the Army. We had a new subsidy for a new ration of tea.  We injected into the spending power of the community over £15 million.</P>
    <P>We were told that if we gave any extra subventions, it would lead to inflation. Of course all the banks and, in particular, the Central Bank were <Col N="1388" /> out in full cry about the danger to the community if the spending power of the populace were increased.  In 1947, 1948 and 1949, we actually brought about a social revolution in this country.  There was no such thing as arbitration.  It had been steadily refused. Workers were entitled to go for increases to the Labour Court but we know that the present Taoiseach had in his desk a new standstill order saying that wages were not being increased.</P>
    <P>Against all the advice of the Central Bank and all the other banks, we pumped money into circulation in the country.  If anybody says to me that we reduced the value of the currency and increased the cost of living, I want to know where that comes from because in 27 months we put £1,000 a month into new employment. We got greater production and there were no inflationary bad effects or the bogeys that the Taoiseach this morning tried to create as he did before and which were found out as events proceeded to be as unsubstantial as they were prejudiced.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Tánaiste come into the House.  Many years ago, I proposed to Dáil Éireann that we should have a little device, as I called it, in order to get after tax evaders.  I proposed that we should allow the Revenue Commissioners to demand from the banks a statement of moneys which they knew to bear interest and on which tax had not been paid.  I read that proposal on 1st May, 1952, and Deputy MacEntee said this:</P>
    <P>It is reputed that the ex-Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was myself</P>
    <P>and the ex-Minister for External Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was Deputy MacBride</P>
    <P>were the two members of the Coalition who were closest together.  What a thrill then Deputy McGilligan's word must have given to the founder of Saor Éire.  With what joy his heart leaped as he learned of this new convert.</P>

      <P>If this is the manner in which the contest between us is to be conducted, Deputy Dillon will be a clear winner.  I will concede victory straight away because I will not be a contestant.  I asked for a constructive and intelligent debate and all I evoked was this torrent of abusive adjectives. It is only right and appropriate that the last Fine Gael speech here in this year should be that which we have just heard from Deputy McGilligan. This is Fine Gael's contribution to constructive thinking in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon expressed supreme confidence that a general election would make him Taoiseach&mdash;apparently believing he is assured already of the support of the Labour Party. I think it was King Charles II who said: &ldquo;They will not cut off my head, Jamsie, to make you king.&rdquo;  History has a way of repeating itself.</P>
      <P>I invited Deputy Dillon to set out a clear and comprehensive programme, different from that which the Government are operating, and in such form that the ordinary man in the street would be able to distinguish between what the Government are doing and what a Fine Gael Government would propose to do, so that he could make a clear choice between them.  I told him if he would do this, which would seem to me to be a normal natural exercise for a Party aspiring to power, I would consider giving the public the opportunity of making the choice between the programme of the Government and this alternative programme, if there was one, of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>He did not take up that challenge. I did not ask him to give that programme to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I asked him to reveal it to the public. He said he would publish a programme when an election is in progress, which reminds me of the man who had a new pair of boots and said he would not be able to get them on until he had worn them for a day or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rest of his speech was so vague, so unrelated to reality, so full of meaningless cliches and phrases, that at that <Col N="1391" /> stage I ceased to make notes and do not profess to remember anything he said.  I recall that he did refer, as did Deputy Corish, to the White Paper which the Government published at the beginning of the year entitled <i>Closing the Gap.</i> It is easy to say at this stage that this White Paper should never have been published at all, or that it should not have been published at that time, or that it should have been published in a different manner or in different form.  I consider it to be the duty of the Government to express their views on matters of that kind whenever a situation exists which appears to require it or to call for it.  Indeed I have been, I confess, sensitive to the criticism which was offered to me by both representatives of employers and representatives of trade unions that we did not fully discharge this duty during the period that the eighth round of wage increases was in progress.</P>
    <P>I believe that those who are dealing with matters of adjusting incomes and conditions in private employment are entitled to get from the Government of the country, those who have the information available to a Government, a fairly accurate forecast about the trend of future events, and advice of that kind.  We ask no more from them than that our advice should get careful attention.  That is the kind of democracy that I believe in and it is, in my view, absurd to suggest that in a democratic country like ours, a Government should fail in that duty, that they should offer no advice at all on matters of this kind which are of such vital importance to the country's welfare, that they should not have views or if they have views, that they should not express them.</P>
    <P>There was a gap which emerged between workers' earnings and workers' output, during 1962, and that was a gap in real terms.  I said earlier today that a gap of that kind always closes in terms of money, that when it emerges prices will rise to close it, and our post-war experience has always been of prices rising.  This gap emerged in real terms, and it was indeed the view of the Government, <Col N="1392" /> which we expressed as fully as we could in the interest of the workers of the country as well as in the interests of the whole community, that the gap should be closed.  It was closed in September.  Making the same calculation as was mentioned in the White Paper, between September, 1958, and September, 1963, real earnings of workers increased by 22.7 per cent. During the same period, output per wage earner increased by 24 per cent. When these figures emerged from our statistics, we knew the objective of the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap</i> had been realised.  The White Paper served its purpose.  We entitled it <i>Closing the Gap</i> and the gap has been closed. That is the end of the story.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon went through an elaborate statistical calculation this afternoon to show that the cost of living has increased since 1953.  Why he had to do all these sums in mental arithmetic to establish that I do not know.  We publish a cost-of-living index number every quarter and send a copy to the Deputy.  We do that work for him.  That index number is a far more reliable indication of the trend of prices than any calculations he can make from national income statistics.</P>
    <P>At a time of economic expansion, it is the usual experience in all countries that prices tend to rise.  Indeed, there are economists who contend that a steady rise in prices is a necessary spur to expansion.  I am not sure I agree with that but it is certainly a view held and strongly advanced by people who are entitled to be regarded as experts in economic science.  This is certainly true: a fall in prices always precedes the development of an economic slump.  It may be that stability of prices may not be permanently realisable in any free economy but it certainly should be the consistent aim of policy to work towards stability as best we may.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked me was the country in a boom or in a slump.  I do not think it is in either.  I hope and believe that it will be possible to maintain the present average annual rate of economic growth of 4 per cent <Col N="1393" /> per annum and perhaps even to do a little better, but not much better, in the years ahead.  This, in itself, is a considerable achievement.  I remind the Dáil again that in the whole decade before the publication of the Government's economic programme the average annual rate of growth was one per cent and if we can achieve a 4 per cent rate of growth, this is as good as most countries in the world, the very strongest in the world, are able to realise.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, one year in the ten which upsets the value of the average, a year when the national income fell.  That was the &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; year 1956 in which the Coalition Government finally achieved their aim in relation to this country.  I hope this present rate of growth&mdash;the indications are that it will be 4 per cent in this year&mdash;will be maintained and that this will be the normal experience and that we will not think of it as a boom but as something we can maintain.</P>
    <P>There are dangers ahead.  Any man who studies our circumstances objectively with his eyes open and with the intention of making some intelligent judgment in regard to them will see these dangers but they are dangers we avoid if we take sufficient care.  I think it is my duty as head of the Government, captain of the ship, if I may so describe it, to point to the existence of these dangers so that care will be taken to avoid them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that Ministers tend to exaggerate the country's rate of economic progress.  I do not think that is strictly true.  I admit that exaggeration has its legitimate place in political propaganda but it is far from my intention and the intention of the Government, to overstate our rate of progress or overstate our achievements because they are still not good enough. If we are to attain the targets we have set ourselves, we shall have to do better still.  We are not likely to spur our people to the effort required to do that by telling them they are doing enough already.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also asked some fair and legitimate questions regarding the Government's policy in relation to the <Col N="1394" /> reduction of industrial protection.  I suppose that I can speak in this matter with a recollection of how this apparatus of industrial protection was built up because I was personally responsible for by far the greater part of it. The advantages which we see at this time in carrying through a downward revision of our protection rates are, first, that it will help us to exert the pressures which we must exert on the protected industrialists in order to get them to modernise their factories and rationalise their industries.  Whether we join the European Economic Community or not, the whole world is moving into the era of freer trade. All nations of the world will be meeting next year in GATT to negotiate on a proposal for a 50 per cent across-the-board reduction of tariffs. This is the world we must prepare for and we cannot do that by maintaining here, in any part of our industrial organisation, defects which can be remedied by those who are in charge of our industries and whose job it is to remedy them.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the advantage of carrying through this reduction&mdash;and indeed the primary reason we started on it&mdash; is that it will make the process of eliminating industrial protection less severe if, as we expect, membership of the European Economic Community opens up for us before 1970.  We made an across-the-board cut in our industrial tariffs on 1st January last and there will be another similar 10 per cent across-the-board cut on 1st January next.  There will be some further reductions of tariffs but they will be made on a more selective basis.  This will be the end of reductions made comprehensively across the whole range of our tariffs, unless, of course, we are effecting further reductions in the context of membership of EEC or some other international arrangement involving us in that obligation. If this situation does not arise in 1965 or 1966, then the only consideration that would justify the reduction of tariffs would be the internal advantage that would be gained by the stimulation of greater efficiency in industry.  It would be effected otherwise only in circumstances where some <Col N="1395" /> compensatory advantage was secured by international agreement with some one or a number of countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Esmonde inquired as to the position regarding our application for membership of EEC.  It is quite true that this time 12 months ago&mdash;it does not seem so long now&mdash;we were confident that by now we would have completed negotiations and signed the agreement and be on the eve of membership.  Everybody knows the circumstances in which that expectation was ended.  Deputies cannot be unaware that events are now taking place, took place yesterday and will take place tomorrow, the outcome of which, either in relation to the arrangements of the EEC or even the future of the Community, it is not yet possible and certainly not desirable to comment on.</P>
    <P>I was asked if our application is dependent on the British application. Deputies must, by now, have begun to understand the realities in this regard.  Our application for membership of EEC depends on a political decision in Europe to open up again the opportunity of membership of the Community to additional countries but particularly in the case of Great Britain because it was in respect of Britain that political problems arose and it is on her application that political decisions are required.</P>
    <P>As to the prospects in this regard, I can say that the opinion which we expressed in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and upon which that Programme is based that we would become a member of EEC before 1970 is based on the conversations we had with many Governments and on the information secured in these conversations.  Deputies will notice the optimistic views which were expressed in this regard in Dublin only last week by M. Rey who, as is well known, is an important member of the Commission of the Community.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was disgusted with Deputy Dillon's blatant attempt to make Party political capital out of exceptional difficulties of the Dublin Corporation in trying to effect the <Col N="1396" /> rehousing of many families who had to be removed from their houses by the Corporation because these houses were unsafe.  To suggest that officials of the Dublin Corporation dealing with the matter are acting inhumanly is unworthy and irresponsible.</P>

It is not inappropriate to suggest that the abnormal weather conditions which obtained last winter produced this extraordinary situation in which houses that had previously been regarded as safe collapsed.  It is absurd to blame that on the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>Whatever the cause of the structural weakness of these houses, the Corporation took effective action when they proceeded to carry out a close inspection of all doubtful houses in the city and removed from them the families living in them whenever they believed that if the families remained in them, their lives would be in danger.  Then they were faced with the problem of providing these displaced families with new dwellings.  We know that those in charge of this effort on the part of the Corporation have been doing their duty with the utmost humanity and with the greatest feeling of sympathy, as great a feeling of sympathy as we all here have.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> In order to compile an annual estimate of employee income in agriculture it is first necessary to estimate the number of such employees at work each year.  The procedure adopted in the period 1951-1961 was to use as bench mark the data from the 1951 Census of Population and to base the annual estimates on the changes recorded in the number of males at work in agriculture as returned at the annual Agricultural Statistics Enumeration.</P>
    <P>However, when the 1961 Census of Population figure became available it was found that the figures originally adopted for employees at work considerably underestimated the decline which took place between 1951 and 1961.  For this reason, the estimates had to be adjusted downwards to link up with the 1961 Census of Population figure.  These revised estimates of the numbers of employees at work in Agriculture are used in compiling the figures in column (4) of the table.</P>

Consequently the reply to that question contains all the information available on agricultural employers classified according to size of farm.</P>
      <P>The definition of employer in Table 105 of Pr. 4511 corresponds to that used on pages 162 and 167 of Pr. 7415 except that persons temporarily in hospitals were excluded in 1951 but were included in the 1961 figures.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos 63 and 64 <Col N="1297" /> together.  The methods of estimation adopted in compiling the distribution of farm wages and salaries in 1960 as given in the reply to Question No. 83 of 10 April, 1962, and as given in column 11 on page 13 of the publication <i>Irish County Incomes in 1960</i> were somewhat different, but the results obtained were virtually the same.  I do not intend to ask the Central Statistics Office to revise the estimates published in <i>Irish County Incomes in</i> 1960.  The estimated distribution of employee income by counties in 1961, based on the methods used in compiling the figures for Question No. 83 of 10 April, 1962, is shown in the following table where the figures quoted do not include the employers' contribution to social insurance. Since the total of employee remuneration in 1960 was practically the same as in 1961 it is not considered necessary to repeat the calculation for 1960.  It would not be appropriate to use the data on pages 30-33 of Pr. 7415 in the estimation, since the figures in that document include persons out of work on Census date.  The appropriate measure of the relative remuneration per head of agricultural employees is the relevant average minimum rate of agricultural wages in the different counties.</P>
