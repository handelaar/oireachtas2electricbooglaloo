I shall be moving a motion on Wednesday for the termination of that discussion on Thursday afternoon involving a half-hour each to spokesmen of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to reply.

      <P>Deputy Sweetman approached me about 6.30 yesterday evening and told me that his Party had decided to put down a motion in respect of the White Paper. He said that he had been in my office to see my Private Secretary but, as he was not there, he could not give notice, and that he came to me personally to give notice.  That was at 6.20.</P>

      <P>If anybody wants amplification of what occurred, the Government Chief Whip approached me while our central committee was in session and I sent word to that effect. I came downstairs and found that the Whip of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach were downstairs.  I told them I would notify them as soon as the meeting finished.  I came downstairs to notify the Parliamentary Secretary's office and notified the Labour Chief Whip at his tea in the restaurant.  I went to your office.  Sir, to look for your Private Secretary, found he was not available and came straight down to you, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>We got an intimation from the Taoiseach that a discussion would be allowed next week and at 4.15 yesterday our Chief Whip met the Government Chief Whip and intimated to him that we wanted time for the discussion next week.  Subsequently, should I say at five minutes to seven, we handed a motion into the office and as far as we are aware, that was the first motion that was received by the office.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 24, after &ldquo;means&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the negative and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I must apologise to the Minister for handing in the amendment very late last night.  There was such a flood of amendments that I thought I had included it.  I am informed that people interested in this Bill have been given legal advice that there is grave doubt that the definition of a photograph contained in Section 2 includes the negative of that photograph.  The Minister will agree that he intended to include the negative as well as the positive print.  In the Industrial and Commercial Property Act of 1927, the making of the negative was the crucial matter from the copyright point of view.  It would be wrong if we did not make the definition beyond all question. None of us would like to have interested parties having to go to court to make certain that the definition set out in the Bill does include the negative. I think the Minister will agree that the House should add the words &ldquo;the negative and&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I took what advice I could about this matter.  As the Deputy has said, the term of the copyright previously extended from the time of the making of the negative. Under this Bill, it extends from the time of the making of the print which is in favour of the owner of the photograph. I have been advised that the definition is wide enough to include the word &ldquo;negative&rdquo;.  I have not been able in the time available to get advice as to what the implications might be of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;negative&rdquo; but I would suggest that <Col N="1419" /> the matter could be considered between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 13, line 40, to delete &ldquo;or in a broadcast&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill re-enacts provisions which are in existing legislation for exceptions from protection of literary, dramatic or musical work and, generally speaking, the legislation which has existed up to the present time has been based on sound principles of common sense and, as provided in this section, fair dealing in, say, a literary <Col N="1421" /> or dramatic work for the purpose of research or private study or for criticism or review will not amount to a breach of copyright.  There is, however, in this section as drafted a provision that the reading or recitation in public of a reasonable extract of a published literary or dramatic work shall not constitute an infringement of a copyright, if it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment.  That seems to be a reasonable provision but the subsection also provides that the protection is also given where the reading or recitation is given on a broadcast. The purpose of this amendment is to draw attention to that fact and to suggest that if the work of an author is broadcast, either by means of television or by sound radio, the ordinary copyright law should apply to it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that an argument can be made that the broadcasting of a work and its acknowledgement is in fact an advertisement of the work for the author concerned, but, whilst that argument is there, I feel that it is overborne by the stronger argument, namely, that this is a matter of property right with which we are concerned and if a broadcasting corporation, either by sound radio or television, wishes to utilise the work of an author, the ordinary copyright law should apply.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that this should be done.  That is the object of this amendment.</P>

      <P>The 1927 Act did not specifically provide for the using of a reasonable extract in a broadcast but in this Bill public performance and broadcasting of a work are separately designated as matters within the control of the copyright owner.  The intention was at all times that reasonable extracts, with due acknowledgment, should be permitted, notwithstanding copyright, and I think it is not unreasonable to ensure that reasonable user is extended to broadcasts as well as to ordinary performances.  I think, Sir, it would be a reversal rather than anything else to exclude reasonable user from broadcasts.  It is, in fact, very likely that under the existing law reasonable user would extend <Col N="1422" /> to broadcasts even though not specifically provided for in the 1927 Act. Therefore, I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In subsection (7), page 14, line 28, after &ldquo;of it&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the form of a record or cinematograph film&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to what are known as ephemeral broadcasts.  These apply in the case of broadcasting companies who, for the purpose of later presentation, take a recording and maintain that recording, pending the publication through the ordinary means of broadcast or telecast.  In the meantime, the recording as taken for the purpose of subsequent broadcast is an ephemeral broadcast.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the ephemeral broadcast in the form of a record or cinematograph film will be covered by the section. The three amendments, Nos. 6, 7 and 8, are really drafting amendments and I submit them to the House as reasonable.</P>

      <P>On this matter of ephemeral broadcasts, ephemeral records, it is true, as I understand it, that the theory that the ephemeral recordings should be permitted has in fact been accepted in the Brussels revision of the International Copyright Convention and it has been left to individual countries to determine the manner in which these ephemeral recordings will be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make on this subsection, however, and arising out of the Minister's amendments, is that in fact the time limit of six months is rather long and, secondly, I would suggest that the Minister should consider some method of informing the person concerned of the existence of the recording and also of the fact that it has been destroyed.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the existing authority, Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann, will deliberately infringe copyright but I do suggest that the danger does exist of, perhaps, a change in administration or, alternatively, a <Col N="1423" /> danger may exist arising from error or accident.  In such circumstances, it would be better to safeguard the author of the work concerned.  If there were written into this section a provision by which the author would be informed of the time the recording was made and was informed of the time that it was destroyed, the whole concept of the ephemeral recording would be met.  The word &ldquo;ephemeral&rdquo; is being stretched rather far by this subsection.  I feel that if the Minister would implement this suggestion by an appropriate amendment at a later stage the dangers involved in the subsection would be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the practice in fact removes the danger, not only the practice but the economics of the thing.  In the first place, the maintenance of the vehicle for retaining these ephemeral recordings is a very expensive thing.  Apparently, the type of tape or electronic device that retains the recording is very expensive and one that in the ordinary way the broadcasting authority would not want to have tied up.  In any event, the Performing Rights Society apparently give licences for the making of these recorded broadcasts, and in the case of Radio Éireann and, I presume, in the case of other authorities who take such recordings, they make comprehensive weekly returns to the organisations looking after the interest of the copyright owner.  Therefore, in the event of the ephemeral recording being retained up to a period of six months, in respect of which there would be no charge, the organisation looking after the interests of the copyright owner will be fully informed week by week of the condition of the recording. When the six months are up, of course, it will either have to be destroyed or put into the archives.  All along the line, there will be a full disclosure of the condition of the recording.  I think the practice which is applied will overcome the point raised by Deputy Costello.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remarks may apply in respect of a <Col N="1424" /> musical work, where an organisation such as the Performing Rights Society is concerned, but it would not apply to a literary or dramatic work, where an individual author is concerned.  No such organisation exists.  I presume there would not be any system of giving such an individual regular information.  Therefore, it would seem to me that, if in fact the present practice is to give this regular information to the Performing Rights Society or any large organisation looking after the interests of composers and authors, it would be no harm to extend that practice to individuals also, so that they would get the benefit of what is now the practice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 15, line 27, after &ldquo;royalty&rdquo; to add &ldquo;which shall be deemed to be at the rate of five per centum of the retail selling price of each record unless and until otherwise determined under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment on the following grounds.  The existing law prescribes a royalty of five per cent., but this Bill proposes to introduce a degree of flexibility, which I think is welcome, in regard to assessing the amount of the royalty.  If there should be any dispute between the copyright owner and the recording manufacturer as to what is fair royalty, the matter has to be, in effect, referred to arbitration under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the situation which would arise in the interval between the making of the record and the assessment of the rate under subsection (2).  I am informed by experts that this investigation could very easily take six months or perhaps even longer, that in some circumstances it can take a very elaborate investigation and that very elaborate evidence has to be produced.  I understand that even the record manufacturers are not happy about the prospect of a long period elapsing during which the copyright owner might get nothing.  For that reason, I am suggesting that the rate of five per cent. be laid down as a guide pending the determination otherwise under subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that a contract between the copyright owner and the manufacturer can cover this point.  In the first place, it probably will not do so for some years, because heretofore these contracts have not had any such provision at all since the rate was laid down by statute.  Apart from that, the Minister might consider, if he thought there was something substantial in the amendment, the feasibility of accepting the principle but to insert in it a proviso that the rate payable would <Col N="1426" /> be five per cent. or whatever was fixed by contract, subject to determination. under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>There is one further point which may arise on the amendment and which the Minister might consider, that is, whether it is possible to have a contract between the copyright owner and the manufacturer which would lay down a rate of royalty and which would, in effect, exclude the provision in this Bill about a fair royalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Section is to enable record companies to have copies made of musical works which have once been recorded.  The usual practice is that the second, third and so on recording companies are expected to pay a royalty related to the value of the recording for this facility.  In general, the amount of royalty is settled by agreement between the parties.  In the British Act of 1956, the royalty has been fixed at six and a quarter per cent., subject to certain regulations.  It was not inserted in this Bill because it was not intended to intrude officially in these matters, but only where the parties did not agree.  If, however, the House feels there is some merit in having a rate inserted below which the royalty will not go, then I shall consider the feasibility of bringing in a suitable amendment on Report Stage.

      <P>I want to raise a point on this section, but it is a point <Col N="1428" /> which probably arises also on other sections.  I want to find out whether there is power to control the charges fixed by a body such as the Performing Rights Society.  I have received representations that, in the case of parochial halls, or other halls running functions for charitable or other lawful purposes, in recent years the Performing Rights Society have raised their fees very substantially.  In one specific case, the fee paid for a recording or performance was fixed for a number of years at £11 13s. 9d.  That continued through the years 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954; for the years 1955 to 1961, the annual fee stood at the same figure of £11 13s. 9d. Then for the same performance, for the year ending 1962, it was raised to £35 17s. 9d.  It is the same figure for this year.  As I understand it, the general arrangement whereby fees are charged in these cases is based on the seating capacity of the hall, or some notional arrangement of that sort.  In the case of the seating capacity, it can be ascertained.  In the case of a hall of a certain size a fee is fixed.</P>
      <P>Representations have, as I said, been made to me that where parochial halls, or other halls, avail of these recordings, in the case of a dispute as to the amount charged, those concerned&mdash;either the parish priest or a committee&mdash;have no redress.  Apparently the Performing Rights Society have the power freely to alter the basis of charge.  No one wants to deny an equitable or reasonable charge being made, but in this case the charge has been trebled in a comparatively short space of time.  Has the Minister any power under this, or any other section, to prescribe regulations regulating the charge, or is it a fact that a body such as the Performing Rights Society has an absolute right to impose whatever charge they decide upon?</P>

    <P>Even though this amendment looks fairly formidable, it is in fact a drafting amendment.

      <P>In subsection (4) (b) page 20, line 34, before &ldquo;payment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;consent of and the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable a broadcast to be made only with the consent of the person who has the copyright in the work and for the payment of equitable remuneration to that person.  One of the difficulties in this matter is that records may be made and performed in the cases we have just referred to almost to an unlimited extent and artists and others who make these recordings can, to a very considerable extent, suffer from the continued rebroadcasting or reuse of these records, without either their consent or equitable remuneration or payment being made to them.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that if the words in this amendment are included, the consent of the person who made the recording would be necessary and also the diffusion company would be required to make payment of adequate remuneration to the artists concerned. As I understand it, many persons who make recordings do not object to a reproduction, because naturally one of the objects in making the records is to ensure they will be reproduced and rebroadcast.  However, if with the large-scale development these days of broadcasting and rediffusion, the consent of a person is not secured or some arrangements made to provide that he will be adequately remunerated, then the whole livelihood and the consequent possibility of a person remaining in business as an artist or a musician may be jeopardised.  This, therefore, is a serious question from the point of view of persons engaged in this sort of work and some such provision should be made to safeguard their remuneration and their livelihood. I would accordingly urge on the Minister the desirability, in the interests of fair and equitable treatment for artists and musicians and others of that sort, to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When a person makes a record, say, a musician, and makes it available to the public, then I <Col N="1433" /> think the public ought to have access to it, subject to the obligation to pay equitable remuneration for its user.  If a person makes a record and does not want to make it available to the public, he has a perfect right not to make it available, to keep it for himself, but once having made it available in circumstances in which he will be paid for it, it is only reasonable that the public should have access to it, subject, of course, to the continued right of the owner of copyright to remuneration.</P>
      <P>Record companies naturally make available records to a radio service or to any other public performance proprietors on the basis of receiving reasonable remuneration, but I do not think it should be left to those record companies to say when and where such a record will be played.  I do not think it is fair the public should be denied the right of hearing these records on television or an any other medium by a decree of the record company or by a withdrawal of the right by the company, so long as the company is getting fair remuneration for the playing of that record.  Subsection (4) provides for the payment of equitable remuneration to the owner of the copyright.  I therefore regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where, by virtue of an assignment or licence or otherwise, Radio Éireann is authorised to broadcast a sound recording, but (apart from this subsection) would not be entitled to make a record of it, the copyright in the recording is not infringed if Radio Éireann by means of its own facilities makes a record of the recording for the purpose of the authorised broadcast.</P>

      <P>(a) the record or any copy thereof is used for any purpose except that of making the broadcast in accordance with the authorisation, if any, or,</P>
      <P>(b) the record or any copy thereof is not destroyed before the end of the period of six months next following the making of the record, or such longer period as may be agreed between Radio Éireann and the person who, in relation to the making of records of the description in question, is the owner of the copyright subsisting in the recording.</P>

    <P>( ) Any record of a recording made under subsection (11) of this section which is of an exceptional documentary character may be preserved in the archives of Radio Éireann, which are hereby designated official archives for the purpose, but, subject to the provisions of this Act, shall not be used for broadcasting or for any other purpose without the <Col N="1435" /> consent of the owner of the relevant rights in the recording.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendments submitted by Deputies Cosgrave and Coughlan are met by this amendment which is to insert three new subsections.  The first of these subsections is merely a redrafting of subsection (11), which authorises Radio Éireann to make its own records.  The other two subsections deal with the destruction methods of ephemeral recordings or their preservation in official archives on the same lines as provision has already been made in Sections 12 and 14 relating to ephemeral recordings of literary, musical and artistic work.</P>

      <P>Representations, I know, have been made arising out of the provisions of subsections (8) and (9), and the effect of these subsections will be that copyright will not be infringed where a sound recording is made, for example, in any hotel or any holiday camp.  The Bill, when enacted, will permit these records to be played on any premises where persons reside or sleep as part of the amenities provided exclusively or mainly for residents or inmates therein.  Of course at holiday camps, it is not at all unusual to have records played as part of the amenities for which people pay an inclusive charge when they go to the camp.  The same can apply indeed in hotels and it does not seem to me that there is a case to be made in favour of not giving this protection in such a wide way.  In fact, a great deal of the remuneration which would be obtained from the owners of the copyright might be obtained from such performances, which are tantamount to performances in public.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the advisability of giving <Col N="1436" /> this protection in such places as holiday camps and hotels.</P>

      <P>The performances referred to by Deputy Costello are not performances for payments specifically. They form part of the general amenities of the hotel, or the holiday camp involved.  I would suggest that there is no point in excluding hotels from this section.  I think there might be even less point if we were considering excluding holiday camps.  They vary in size and vary in the kind of amenities they offer.  The bigger ones usually employ live performers to a considerable extent and I think actors, dance bands and other types of performers benefit greatly from the availability of engagements in these large holiday camps.  I would suggest that a holiday camp that relied on recordings as a means of entertainment for its patrons would not last very long and I would suggest that the live performers regard very highly the outlet for their talents that holiday camps provide.</P>
      <P>I would not agree in any circumstances to deny the right of hotels to play records like these.  Holiday camps, as I said, vary in size and while small hotels where 30 or 40 people are accommodated might rely on recordings of music and other works to entertain their patrons, it would be difficult to exclude the larger holiday camps if we wanted to include the small ones and hotels as well.  By and large, the fears expressed by Deputy Costello are not serious enough to warrant the exclusion of hotels and holiday camps from the benefits of the section.</P>

      <P>The objection to this subsection has been somewhat met by the amendments which the Minister has provided for and which have been accepted.  The position actually, as envisaged in the Bill as it was drafted, was that where a film was made and where the copyright only existed for 25 years, then the other Copyright Acts that might be associated with the film, for example, the rights in the musical works involved in the film, would also cease.  It seems to me that part of the objection to this subsection is now gone as a result of the fact that the copyright period has been extended to 50 years.  The position would have been that the right to a musical work in the sound track of a film would have gone after a period of 25 years and there was, I think, some injustice involved to authors generally in the subsection.  I think that has been met to some considerable extent by the amendments which have been made.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where television or sound broadcasts are made by Radio Éireann, Radio Éireann shall pay either to the performer or such body as may be authorised to receive such payments on behalf of a group of performers collectively, fair and equitable remuneration. Because of the way the section is drafted, I am not certain whether there is provision for equitable remuneration. Quite a number of broadcasts, such as broadcasts of sporting events, may have a very limited life or interest and reproduction would be of interest only while the event was fresh in the memory or for a short period afterwards, but in the case of an artistic or musical performance, or something of that nature, the question is obviously different.  In that case, I suggest a single equitable payment should be made by Radio Éireann either to the performer or in the case of a group of performers, to the body authorised to act on behalf of the group.</P>

In fact, the purpose of the amendment is not appropriate to this Bill.  There is a separate performers Bill in course of preparation and I suggest we should take care of the problem in that way. It is not proper to this Bill and therefore I suggest the amendments might be withdrawn and consideration given to them when the performers Bill is introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1) In any action for infringement of copyright commenced and heard in the High Court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) where any relief (other than damages) claimed is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and, if damages are claimed, the amount of the damages recovered by the plaintiff is not more than six hundred pounds, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to recover more costs than he would have been entitled to recover if the action had been brought in the Circuit Court, unless the judge hearing the action grants a special certificate under this section, and</P>
      <P>(b) where the only relief claimed is damages and the amount of the damages recovered by the plaintiff is not more than fifty pounds, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to recover more costs than he would have been entitled to recover if the action had been brought in the District Court unless the judge hearing the action grants a special certificate under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In any action referred to in subsection (1) of this section the judge hearing the action may, on the application of the plaintiff, grant a special certificate in writing that, in the opinion of the judge, it was reasonable, owing to the substantial or important nature of the action or the importance of any question of law involved therein that the action <Col N="1441" /> should have been commenced in the High Court.</P>
    <P>(3) The reference in subsection (3) of section 12 (which limits the amount of plaintiffs' costs in certain actions in the High Court) of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, to a restriction imposed by that section shall be construed as including a reference to the restrictions imposed by this section on the amount of costs recoverable by plaintiffs in the actions referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>This amendment introduces a new section, the purpose of which is to make provision regarding the level of costs recoverable in copyright actions which are not governed by the Courts of Justice Act of 1936.  Under existing law, that is, the Act of 1927, the court in which copyright actions had to be commenced is defined as the High Court and this arose from the fact that the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; was defined in the 1927 Act as meaning the High Court for the purposes of the Act as a whole and accordingly governed the copyright provisions which are Parts VI and VII of that Act.  The word &ldquo;court&rdquo; is not defined in this Bill and therefore an infringement of copyright may be prosecuted in any court which would have jurisdiction.  As is well known, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction in civil cases for claims up to £600.  The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction and the District Court, I think, has jurisdiction up to £50.</P>
    <P>Objection has been taken from time to time that all these infringement actions were taken only in the High Court and usually I think High Court costs were given.  This section is to ensure that costs of an infringement case would be given in relation only to the value of the case, so that if a case is taken in the High Court and the jurisdiction value of the case is proper to the Circuit Court, then costs on the appropriate Circuit Court scale would be given rather than the High Court scale.  Similarly, if an infringement value is within the jurisdiction of the District Court, the costs on that scale will apply.  While it is still open to bring such cases to the High Court, <Col N="1442" /> the tendency would probably be in future to bring such cases in courts of appropriate jurisdiction.  I think this is in ease of persons charged with infringements by such organisations as the Performing Rights Society and I think there has been pressure for that in a number of cases for some years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are difficulties involved in these copyright actions to which special consideration should be given in regard to the Minister's proposals.  As the Minister said, this new section is in ease of the infringers but the question is whether we should legislate in ease of infringers. Persons who infringe a copyright may do so either with full knowledge of what they are doing or innocently.  In the former case, which is not at all uncommon where musical works are concerned, the person who deliberately infringes a copyright might decide it would be worth his while to do so and take the consequences of an action being taken against him.  If an action is taken against him for such infringement, he might find himself in the position of having to pay only quite a small sum in damages and quite a small sum in costs.  In certain circumstances, it might pay the infringer not to take out, for example, the licence of the Performing Rights Society and allow himself to be sued and pay up on the costs and damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider very carefully the proposals in this section before they are adopted.  A case in which I was personally involved not so long ago concerned infringement of copyright in a musical publication. The High Court had to consider the damages sustained by the owner of the copyright.  The owner proved quite clearly that there was a flagrant breach of copyright, that the defendant must have deliberately taken his work and, although a defence was put in to the claim, denying that the plaintiff had the copyright in the work, that defence was subsequently withdrawn and it was left to the court to decide on the measure of damages.  In fact, the measure of damages allowed by the court was comparatively small, but, because the action was brought in the <Col N="1443" /> High Court, High Court costs were obtained against the infringer.  It is in the light of such serious consequences to the infringer that many people submit to the legal obligations with regard to copyright.  In this case, we are legislating in ease of infringers if the benefit contained in this amendments is proceeded with.  We should carefully consider whether this should be done.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of the difficulties involved in this matter of copyright law involves the difficulty of proof in such an action.  Not infrequently, the defendant puts the plaintiff's entitlement to a copyright in issue. It may be an extremely difficult thing to prove, according to the law of evidence, that the plaintiff is entitled to the copyright in the work. It may involve bringing witnesses from abroad and it seems to me reasonable in such cases that an action in the High Court should be brought.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to carefully consider the advisability of pursuing this section.  In principle, all actions should follow the general provisions of our Courts of Justice Acts and the recent legislation passed here, following the setting up of our new courts. In cases brought in the District Courts and the Circuit Courts, special costs should not be awarded except in special circumstances.  We are dealing with a special type of law and I strongly apprehend that if this amendment is insisted upon, many people will prefer deliberately to infringe copyright.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Performing Rights Society.  I can see cases of people throughout the country deciding to take a chance and not take out the licence, deciding to wait until they are caught out and then, when small damages and small costs are given against them, finding that the amount they have to pay might be less than the licence they should have taken out in the first place.  I feel that more consideration should be given to the amendment.  If the Minister wishes to press it, I would ask him to reconsider the circumstances in which the special certification for High Court <Col N="1444" /> costs would be granted.  As the amendment is drafted at present, the judge may grant a special certificate for High Court costs, if in his opinion it was reasonable, owing to the important nature of the case or because of the points of law involved, that the action should have been commenced in the High Court.  I would ask the Minister to consider giving the court a wider discretion in this regard if he decides to press for this section.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is that it might be reasonable for the court to grant High Court costs, if the court is satisfied that a deliberate infringement had occurred.  If the infringement were an accidental one, it might not be reasonable to grant High Court costs. I would also suggest that the High Court should have power to grant High Court costs, if it decided that the defendant had put in issue unreasonably the plaintiff's entitlement to the copyright.  What I means is that if, prior to the proceedings, the copyright owner were to write to the defendant asking him to admit that he was the owner of the copyright without formal proof and if this admission were not forthcoming, it might be extraordinarily difficult for the owner to prove his case and it would not be unreasonable for him to institute proceedings in the High Court.</P>
    <P>If an infringement takes place in a remote part of the country, it might be necessary to bring witnesses great distances to prove what is a formal matter.  In such circumstances, I think the court should be given a much wider jurisdiction with regard to giving the special certificate envisaged in the amendment.  I would suggest that if the Minister is to press the amendment, this new section should be so widened that the court would have a general discretion to give costs according to the circumstances of any given case.</P>
    <P>We should not legislate lightly to benefit an infringer and that is what we are doing here.  I can see where an innocent infringement can occur and a person can innocently perform a play without realising that copyright exists or may do a musical work <Col N="1445" /> without realising that copyright exists. In such a case, it would be unfair for that person to find himself involved in an action in the High Courts.  It would be easy to cover such circumstances but we are legislating here for the other type of circumstances.  We are legislating to protect the infringer and I do not think we should do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not meet the case.  I can refer the Minister to a typical case which occurred in the courts only a few months ago, where exemplary damages were given.  The actual pecuniary loss to the owner of the copyright was in the region of £5 and the exemplary damages given were £50, which was not bad when dealing with exemplary damages.  That was then just barely outside the District Court jurisdiction.  It was in at the lowest scale in the Circuit Court jurisdiction. If this subsection is passed, the wilful infringer, against whom exemplary damages are given, will only have to pay £55 and quite a small sum for costs.</P>

      <P>These are matters that I am sure Deputy Costello would always argue should be left in the discretion of the court.  I think the attitude of members of the main Opposition Party is that the courts should have freedom of action within their jurisdiction, that they should have power to deal with cases as they see them, impose damages or penalties as <Col N="1446" /> they see fit, according to the facts of the case.</P>
      <P>This section and the previous one, Section 22, which provides for flagrant breaches, give the court very ample powers to deal with all kinds of cases. I, personally, have no practical experience of copyright cases.  I understand Deputy Costello has.  He knows much more about the law in practice than I do.  I am given to understand that many of the cases are comparatively innocent infringements, involving, perhaps, dancehall proprietors in remote parts of the country.</P>
      <P>While this legislation right through runs in favour of the copyright owner, here is a case in which we should have some regard for the infringer, particularly for the small man like a dancehall owner in the west of Ireland who commits an infringement, innocently perhaps, or maybe not so innocently.  If it is not so innocently, the courts have ample powers to deal with him under Section 22.  If it is innocently, then it is unfair that any organised body of copyright protectors should bring that man from the west of Ireland to the High Court and have damages assessed against him in a comparatively small amount, notwithstanding that all the other attendant costs would be involved of bringing whatever witnesses he had, his solicitor and everybody else involved, to the High Court.</P>
      <P>The new section as drafted provides adequately for such cases.  It provides for the certificate that is to be given by the presiding judge if the matter is so serious as to merit High Court costs, even though the amount of the damages would not so merit High Court costs, and Section 22 deals with flagrant breaches.  Therefore, I submit, Sir that the interests of both parties are adequately met and the person who flagrantly disregards copyright law is very well taken care of under Section 22.</P>

      <P>I must press my objection to this draft.  We should bear in mind what we are trying to do.  We should punish the deliberate infringer. If a person innocently infringes copyright, he should be given leniency.  It <Col N="1447" /> would be quite a simple matter to legislate for the innocent infringer.  It could be provided that if the court were satisfied that the infringement was innocent, the court would have jurisdiction to grant a limited sum for costs.  I am in complete agreement with the Minister that the innocent infringer in the west of Ireland should not be put to great expense if, in fact, he proves that.  I can say from my own personal knowledge with regard to matters affecting performing rights societies that that has not occurred.</P>
      <P>We are not merely concerned with performing rights societies.  We are concerned principally with plays and we are concerned with infringement of copyright in publication of musical works in printed form.  It is quite obvious at the present time that many people will decide that it will be worth their while deliberately to infringe copyright, decide that they will deny the right of the claimant to the copyright and decide to let him prove his case.</P>
      <P>Take the author of, for example, an English work or the Irish author who has gone abroad or the widow of an Irish author who is entitled to copyright and who may find it extremely expensive and inconvenient to travel to Galway, Donegal or Kerry, wherever the infringement may have taken place.  How is that person to be assisted by providing that he must go in the District Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that the court has power to grant damages for flagrant breach. As I understand the position, there have been very few cases where exemplary damages have been awarded. The one to which I have referred, which came before the courts quite recently, was a very exceptional case and I do not think there have been any others in this country.  There has been one fairly recently in England in the English Reports where very high exemplary damages were given in a very flagrant case, but, by and large, the number of times when exemplary damages will be given for flagrant breach will be, perhaps, one in 30 years.  That has been the record <Col N="1448" /> to date.  If that is so and if the damages which are awarded as exemplary are in the region of £50 or so, then it is quite clear that the deliberate infringer will find himself better off taking a chance and deciding deliberately to infringe if this section stands.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the court has jurisdiction and discretion in the matter.  I agree the court has, under Section 22, when dealing with damages in the case of a flagrant breach but the court's jurisdiction is very limited in this new subsection with regard to giving a certificate for costs.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to press this, I would ask him to reconsider the power of the court to grant costs in these cases.  The jurisdiction of the court and the discretion of the court to grant costs are severely circumscribed. What it says is that it was &ldquo;reasonable owing to the substantial or important nature of the action.&rdquo; An action where £5 damages and £50 exemplary damages were awarded might not be regarded as a substantial or important action, where there was no important question of law involved, where the defendant admits that he has flagrantly broken the plaintiff's copyright.  In those circumstances, the court would have no alternative but to grant District Court or Circuit Court costs.  It would have no discretion to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that if the Minister is going to press this section, a much wider discretion should be given and that one of the grounds on which High Court costs would be awarded would be where the defendant unjustifiably puts into issue the plaintiff's entitlement to the copyright or, alternatively, where there has been a deliberate infringement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little experience of copyright.  I am not so thoroughly acquainted with the Bill. I have followed the line of argument here.  I have been in the dance business most of my life.  Dancehall proprietors are hounded by representatives of copyright owners.  The vast majority of people engaged in the dance business are innocent in this matter.  They do not know whether what is being <Col N="1449" /> played by the band is copyright or not. The musicians play the music.  The fellow who runs the dance does not know what they are playing and does not care.  He does not know whether he is infringing the law or not, and I doubt if a lot of the musicians know either.</P>
      <P>Copyright should be levied at the source&mdash;the producer, the publisher, the seller of the music or record.  It is ridiculous that the performer should be asked to pay, when 99 times out of 100, he is innocent of any infringement of the law.  It was impossible in practice to collect the dance tax from the small people.  That is why it was given up.  It will also be found impossible to get the small people to pay copyright fees.  Very often it may be only a one-night-a-year dance or one night a week.  What they would make in the year, the copyright people would want.  I was asked on a number of occasions for £40 a year for my band to play certain music.  It was a period when things were bad with me.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Costello fears most in this case is the deliberate infringer of copyright, who will regard it as worth his while to deliberately infringe copyright, take a chance on an action in any court and have damages with costs awarded against him.  There is, however, a well-known procedure in law, which I presume applies to copyright actions as well as to others.  In the case of the deliberate infringer, who puts the plaintiff to the highest possible degree of proof as regards ownership of copyright and perhaps other matters, the procedure is that a motion is served to admit facts.  Usually the facts referred to are facts that may be expensive to prove, but facts that could not be as a general rule disproved by the defendant.  If a defendant realises that the plaintiff has a <Col N="1450" /> right to prove certain facts and is well able to prove them, he admits these facts formally in a document which appears before the court at hearing. If he refuses to do so, then according to the plaintiff's motion, application would be made to the court to have appropriate costs and expenses fixed against the defendant.  If the people who have to put forward the proof have to be brought to court at considerable expense, a motion to admit facts in such cases will ensure that in the case of a flagrant infringer the question of ownership of copyright will not entirely be in issue and will be no help when he is fixed with the costs.</P>
      <P>I should have perhaps mentioned earlier on that there is another section, Section 26, which I think is a deterrent. Under this, he may be brought before a court and fined or put in prison.  I suggest, with the wide powers given to the court here to cover the flagrant infringer as it might affect the innocent infringer, it is better that the section should be left like that.  We should not tie the court down by trying to define what is a flagrant or what is an innocent breach.  The courts are well able to decide for themselves having regard to their experience, the measure of culpability in these matters.  I submit that the amended section as it stands covers very adequately in relation to the other sections the matters likely to cause concern to Deputy Costello.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I have made very clear the point I am making.  The Minister seems to think the court has wide jurisdiction.  My complaint is that the court's jurisdiction is severely circumscribed.  I would ask the Minister to read again the power given under subsection (2) of this new section to the courts to grant a certificate for High Court costs.  It will in fact only be in very exceptional circumstances that that would be done.  My suggestion is that, if this section is being maintained, then this subsection (2) should be considerably broadened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point I have raised about the cost and difficulty of proof in copyright actions, I do not <Col N="1451" /> think the Minister's arguments answers the point I made.  For a start, there is no procedure for serving notices to admit facts in the District Court.  If in fact the matter is one of the District Court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff will have to prove his case.  Secondly, in the District Court, there is no pleading as such and the plaintiff will have, in any case brought to the District Court, automatically to prove his entitlement to the copyright.  The third point is that if a notice to admit facts is brought in a case that may have been started in the Circuit Court or High Court, it is by far the more usual thing for the defendant to admit the facts.  In such circumstances, the plaintiff is put to the expense of bringing witnesses from abroad or from remote parts of the country to prove the facts not admitted.</P>
    <P>I do not think the fact that the defendant may realise he may have to pay the costs of producing such witnesses will deter him from not accepting the notice to admit facts.  My experience, for what it is worth, has been that the defendant will not admit the facts and may put the plaintiff in the position of having to pay the cost of witnesses.  There is a further difficulty. It may be extremely difficult to prove the particular facts, although undoubtedly the copyright is vested in the plaintiff.  When I say &ldquo;prove,&rdquo; I mean prove according to the rules of evidence.  Persons may in fact be abroad or witnesses of the assignments may not be available.  All these matters will be made extremely difficult of proof in the operation of this section.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we are agreed in principle that the deliberate infringer should be punished and that the innocent infringer should get leniency from this legislation.  If we agree on that principle, it is merely a question of working it out in practice.  I feel the way it has been worked out in this section has been to make it extremely easy for the deliberate infringer to get away with his deliberate infringement and to make it very difficult to operate copyright protection.</P>
    <P>The troubles raised by Deputy <Col N="1452" /> Sherwin are well known.  The fact is that copyright is a property right and the methods used to obtain remuneration for this property right are, of course, not very popular with those who have to pay it.  The people concerned are Irish, as well as foreigners; they are Irish people who have composed musical, literary or dramatic works, and I do not think we should lightly legislate away any rights they might have.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello says we are close enough now to come to some agreement on this.  While he wants the section deleted altogether he would not, I take it, object if subsection (2) were not so restrictive as to matters in which High Court costs would be given.  These matters are restricted to cases where the action is of a substantial nature or the question of law involved is one of importance. Deputy Costello is concerned still apparently, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22, that a flagrant breach case might not be covered here. I shall consider a provision to cover that on the Report Stage, if that will satisfy the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Not completely, but half a loaf is better than none.  I ask the Minister to consider two possibilities. I ask him to consider either leaving wide jurisdiction to the court with regard to a certificate or indicating the circumstances in a wider way than at present in which the certificate would be granted.  I have in mind an indication to the court that, if the defendant has unreasonably put the copyright owner's title in issue, then costs might be awarded.  I also have in mind the possibility of providing that if there is a flagrant breach, or a deliberate breach&mdash;I think the word &ldquo;flagrant&rdquo; is, perhaps, the wrong word here&mdash;the matter would be at the discretion similarly of the court.  I <Col N="1453" /> fully appreciate the force of the situation where a person has innocently committed a breach and is damnified in high costs, but I think the situation might be met by the suggestions I have made.</P>

I have been listening very attentively and, while we are in this Bill attempting to give leniency, a leniency with which I agree, there is also the fact that the plaintiff may be in the position, usually is in the position, to bring very expensive evidence or witnesses, and could litigate very strongly against even an innocent defendant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carroll has a point there&mdash;it is covered in a later amendment&mdash;because what he says is quite true; to prove a case very expensive costs may be involved.  That would not arise, of course, where the innocent infringer does not put the plaintiff's title in issue.  If he does put it in issue, then very substantial proofs may be involved.  Deputy Carroll has a point.  It is one of the matters which are referred to in a later section; there may be some much simpler way by which the plaintiff's apparent copyright title is accepted without going to the necessity of very expensive proofs.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to give effect to the point raised by Deputy Carroll.  This section provides for proof of facts in copyright actions. Under subsection (6) it is provided that certain presumptions will be made where the author is dead.  I suggest these presumptions will also be made in respect of any action brought for infringement in regard to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.  Such a presumption would not, I think, be contrary to the general practice of the courts.  It would not involve any great injustice and if, in fact, a person wrongfully claimed to be entitled to the copyright and wrongfully claimed he was the owner, that matter could be litigated fairly in court by the defendant raising the issue.  Until he does, I think the presumptions I suggest would be a way out of the expensive matters of proof which very frequently work injustice, very frequently mean that copyright owners cannot prove their claim and, therefore, do not bring actions, and very frequently suffer loss as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, I am afraid, resist this amendment.  It is obvious that if a man is alive and can prove his title, he should do so if it is put in dispute.  As a rule, he does so only when the defendant to an action puts it in issue.  Again, I suggest that a defendant will not lightly put that matter in issue because he must realise he will have to pay the costs of whatever proofs are necessary, even if they involve bringing people long distances overseas.  I think he will be careful not to put the authorship of a work in issue in a case of infringement brought against him, knowing he cannot dispute the author's title, and knowing that, if he does, it will cost him extra money by way of costs and expenses of his action.  It is only <Col N="1455" /> fair, I think, that the presumption should be there in favour of an author or in favour of an action of infringement in respect of works of an author who is dead.  I might point out, too, that the provision proposed by Deputy Costello does not appear in the British 1956 Act.  I do not see any good reason why we should make such provision in our legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Minister's view that the defendant will admit the plaintiff's claim.  There have not been many copyright actions in the courts, but the general experience has been that the copyright is put in dispute as an automatic matter of pleading.  In the action to which I have referred, an action heard quite recently in the High Court, this was in fact done and only on the morning of the hearing was the plaintiff's entitlement to the copyright admitted. It did not, in fact, arise in this case, but the circumstances might have been such that it might have been impossible to prove the plaintiff's entitlement according to the laws of evidence. These facts exist to such an extent that many actions for breach of copyright are not taken because of the difficulty of proof.  I submit my suggestion would bring about economies of time, economies of cost, and I do not think it is an unreasonable one.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (4) in page 32, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The District Court, upon the application of the owner of the copyright in any work, may act as follows: If satisfied by evidence that there is reasonable ground for believing that infringing copies of the work are being hawked, carried about, sold, or offered for sale, may by order authorise a member of the Garda Síochána to seize the copies without warrant and to bring them before the court, and the court, on <Col N="1456" /> proof that the copies are infringing copies, may order them to be destroyed, or to be delivered up to the owner of the copyright or otherwise dealt with as the court may think fit.</P>
    <P>( ) If the District Court is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section is being committed on any premises, the court may grant a search warrant authorising a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána as that member thinks proper, to enter the premises between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., if need be by force, and to seize any copies of any work or any plates in respect of which he has reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under any of the said subsections is being committed.</P>
    <P>( ) All copies of any work and plates seized under subsection (5) of this section shall be brought before the District Court, and if proved to be infringing copies or plates intended to be used for the printing or reproduction of infringing copies shall be destroyed or delivered up to the owner of the copyright in question or otherwise dealt with as the court thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>

In the 1927 Act, powers could be given to the Garda Síochána for the seizure of pirated copies of musical works.

      <P>I just want to say, and it is with some diffidence I raise it on Section 29 because I do not wish that anything I say should be regarded as reflecting on the Controller or his predecessors, that we are here setting up a system of arbitration of disputes which is tantamount to compulsory arbitration, automatic arbitration, and I question the wisdom of providing that an individual should be appointed as arbitrator.  The English legislation in this respect makes provision for a board of three and I think it would be preferable to establish here a board such as that provided in the English legislation rather than leave the matter to the discretion of an individual.</P>
      <P>I do not wish these remarks to be taken in any way as reflecting on the person who is immediately concerned, but I do think that a question of principle is involved here.  These are very important matters which will be referred to the arbitrator.  He will be a single person and he will have to act on many occasions and I feel that, generally speaking, a board of three is a preferable method of determining those matters than an individual person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, in fact, legislating in respect of property rights.  We are going to provide a system of automatic arbitration <Col N="1460" /> by which one indvidual will have to determine the prices to be paid in respect of property rights.  I feel the English precedent is a better one, namely, a board of three persons.  I do not know why this was not followed, unless it was for reasons of economy.  If for reasons of economy it was decided to utilise the Controller of Patents rather than establish an outside board&mdash;which of course would not be in permanent session and would only meet regularly and when required&mdash;I do not think that would be a sound reason for doing so and I would suggest that the Minister should give consideration to this suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised in this connection that the British system operating in England is considered unnecessary in our circumstances.  It is perhaps more expensive and as well as that, the Controller has somewhat similar powers in respect of other commercial property such as trade marks, and I do not think we need have any fears&mdash;and I know Deputy Costello has no fears except that he prefers the British system&mdash;that any injustice would be done by the single Controller we have in making decisions on subjects of this nature.  The British system is rather too expensive for our circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I did perhaps think that it was expense that was the reason for this and if it is a question of expense, I should like the Minister to re-consider it because there will not be a great deal of expense involved in convening a board from time to time, nor do I think it would be cumbersome. I think it would be easier to operate a board in a country like Ireland which is much smaller and where distances are so much less than in England. The objective is one of principle and not in any way applicable to individual circumstances.  We have all had experience of persons who are in a position of arbitrator over a great number of years and very frequently patterns evolve from a single arbitrator which may not be desirable and, generally speaking, it is better for an arbitrator who will be concerned regularly with the matter that <Col N="1461" /> such arbitration should take place with three persons who are appointed to deal with the matter to which reference to him has been made.</P>
      <P>I think this is a matter of very considerable importance.  These disputes are matters that will fairly regularly be brought before the arbitrator whom we will appoint and I think the general experience has been rather in favour of an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration board of three persons than maintaining an individual person who would over a number of years perhaps set a pattern which might not generally be regarded as desirable. I would ask the Minister to give consideration to the suggestions I have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I should like to make one comment before I pass on from this.  The points raised by the Deputy have not been raised before.  We have not received representations on these &mdash;not meaning that the Deputy is not entitled to make representations on this section.  I think the main argument he makes is that the single arbitrator, even with the best will in the world, with the greatest degree of objectivity that he can bring to bear on his hearings, might evolve a pattern of decision on schemes that would be undesirable.  If that happens, I think again we have means whereby it can be controlled and changed where necessary, because in Section 39&mdash;&ldquo;an appeal shall lie to the High Court from any order or decision of the Controller..&rdquo;, so that if his pattern of decisions evolves in an undesirable way, then there is power of having them checked in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>What I want to say is this, while I am not convinced that we should have a tribunal on the British lines, since I had no opportunity of giving it advance consideration, I shall do so on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I need not reiterate what I said earlier on Section 13.  Is it <Col N="1462" /> a fact that the Controller has power under Section 30 to fix charges imposed, say, by a body similar to, or the Performing Rights Society?  Can the Minister say if, in fact, in the past any such control has been exercised by the Controller?</P>

      <P>The existing position is that the rate of royalties is fixed at five per cent.  It was intended that in this legislation we should leave that rate unmentioned so that it could be a matter of negotiation between the parties concerned, but it is only when they are in dispute that the Controller comes in.  They can then take the dispute to the Controller for his decision.  The Controller, if he sees fit, may not decide to make a decision himself but refer it to an arbitrator, so that the Controller has not initially the power to fix these rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the case I have in mind and which was brought to my notice was limited to five per cent. or not, but I assume, because of the fact that it is the same hall and the same body who are running these shows, that the fees increased very substantially over a period of years.  As I mentioned, it was a rise from £11 13s. 9d. to £35 17s. 9d.  If of course the particular matter which was reproduced, or whatever form of record was made, referred to a different or substantially different thing then, naturally, the increase might be passed as five per cent. of the cost of the thing.  As I understand it, the persons involved in running this hall feel that the charges were raised without due regard to the size of the hall and indeed were considered in all the circumstances quite excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they can.  I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 36, to delete subsection (5) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Subject to the immediately preceding subsection of this section the Controller, on any reference under this section, shall consider the matter in dispute, and after giving to the parties to the reference an opportunity to present their cases respectively, shall decide whether or not the licensing body concerned has monopoly powers and, if so, if it has abused its monopoly powers by establishing the scheme referred to him and if he so decides he shall make such order varying the scheme in so far as it relates to cases of the class to which the reference relates as the Controller may determine to be reasonable in the circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it may be taken as characteristic of human nature that people do not like paying money and they do not like paying it in the form of tax if they run dances.  They do not like paying money to the Performing Rights Society if they run dances and if they put on a play they do not like paying money for the right to perform the play or if they reproduce works of authors, similarly, they do not like the obligation to pay for the copyright. For these reasons there are objections from time to time to the charges that have been made by organisations protecting the authors or composers of musical works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the position, organisations such as the Performing Rights Society do not object to the principle of arbitration and it is reasonable that where a dispute arises the matter could be put to arbitration and the parties' cases would be fairly ventilated and an independent tribunal can adjudicate on the disputes.  But I think there is a matter of principle involved and the object of the amendment which I have put down is to give effect to that principle.  I feel that arbitration should arise where there has in fact, been an abuse of a monopoly. Undoubtedly, some such organisations as the Performing Rights Society are <Col N="1464" /> in a position of quasi-monopoly. The organisations protecting certain authors' rights may be in a similar position but I feel what is important to safeguard is the right to negotiate these contracts to which reference has been made and the right to arbitrate where there has been any abuse such as has been suggested here today by Deputy Cosgrave.  But, apart from the existence of an abuse, I feel it is rather dangerous to legislate for a system of what I imagine would be automatic arbitration.</P>
    <P>The existence of copyright tribunals to arbitrate in disputes is, of course, internationally recognised but the general principle is that these tribunals are there where there has been an allegation of abuse of their position by a monopoly or a quasi-monopoly.  In regard to the Performing Rights Society I understand that they and similar organisations have willingly accepted this principle and it is one which should be incorporated in our legislation.  I very much doubt if dancehall proprietors are as innocent as Deputy Sherwin indicates.  I think it is generally known to all of them that the performing rights of dance music have, as a matter of convenience, become vested in an incorporated body such as the Performing Rights Society and it is generally known throughout the country that it is an infringement of copyright to perform these works in public without the licence system that has been operated.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that this licence system is, in fact, for the benefit of the composers of the music.  It is regrettable that much of the dance-music performed in our halls should not be composed by Irish nationals and has, perhaps, a rather foreign and alien atmosphere about it, but that is a matter of public taste and it is very hard to go against the tide.  In fact, many of the works that have been performed in public have been composed by Irish authors and we are actually helping to remunerate them when these works are performed in public.  This is a property right which we should not lightly throw away.  For these reasons, I suggest we should devise a system of arbitration which <Col N="1465" /> would come into operation where it is established that any monopoly or quasi-monopoly has abused its position. It is not at all unusual to provide for monopolies in different forms of property rights and legislation concerning the registration of patents and trade marks, and rights of redress are given where there has been any breach of monopoly powers.  I think the principle ought to be applied also, in different circumstances but by an analogy, when dealing with matters of copyright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify one point, 90 per cent of the dances run in the country are run by promoters, not by ballroom proprietors.  The word &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; means the owner of a ballroom but the owner rarely runs a dance.  He simply lets the hall and so 90 per cent. of the dances or at least a great many of them are run by people who know nothing about copyright. They book the hall and book the band and they do not know anything about the performing rights licence.  The owner would probably know but very few owners run dances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Sherwin but at all events the letting the dancehall owner makes is the subject matter of a contract of some nature and I do not see that it would be impossible to have written into that contract some right of action, or rather some form of indemnity, for the proprietor of the dancehall in the event of an infringement of copyright.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we have to go after the other people.  In regard to Deputy Costello's amendment, this <Col N="1466" /> is a matter that was taken up by the British Government during the Brussels revision of the Berne Convention.  They wanted to secure from the Convention some means whereby they could insert some such provision in their own law. Nevertheless, they did not proceed with it in their own law in 1956.  There are obvious reasons why.  In the first place, an abuse of monopoly powers would have to be defined and this, I think, would be rather difficult.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment, as I understand it, would be that disputes between the organisation of the copyright owners and a representative body of users would be brought before the Controller only when there would be an abuse of monopoly rights.  Licence schemes operated by an organisation of copyright-owners may concern the terms of user as well as monopoly powers.  For example, Deputy Cosgrave asked me a while ago if the users would have some rights in respect of the financial terms of user and I said they would and that this would be the section.  It is only right that users should have the right to come before the Controller in the event of a dispute about financial involvements, whether the copyright owners or the organisations are charging too much to the owners.  With Deputy Costello's amendment, a case could be brought only where there was an abuse of monopoly powers and abuse of monopoly powers is not defined anywhere. I understand that the performance of practically all modern music is within the control of one group representing the copyright owners. Where there is a reasonable dispute between the group representing the copyright owners and the users about the terms of a scheme, common sense requires that the dispute be determined by the Controller on the basis of what he considers reasonable.  There should be no limit on the right to bring such matters before the Controller and in drafting the section, we are following, in effect, the British law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I am given to understand that at the time of the British enactment, it was clearly understood that the object of <Col N="1467" /> the Act was to deal with abuse of monopoly rights.  As I understand the Minister, he states that what I suggest might in some way be in breach of the Brussels Convention.  I do not think that is so.  As I understand the provisions of the Brussels Convention, it does not in any way bind this country to set up a tribunal to deal with all disputes.  To set up a tribunal to deal with disputes arising from abuse of monopoly rights would be well within the terms of the Convention. I understand that such a tribunal has operated in Switzerland for a number of years past.</P>

      <P>It seems to me it may be apprehended that there might be difficulties in working out equitable remuneration which will cover the different types of films, the different types of programmes, the different circumstances of the individual cinema proprietors. This difficulty arises particularly, and perhaps solely, in the case where music is incorporated in the programme, either by means of the sound track or by records.

Apart from this question that there should not be retrospection in the provisions of the section, I understand the main concern arises from the inclusion of musical works in it and the danger that subsection (1) (d) of Section 47 as worded might encroach too far on the rights of copyright owners.  I think Deputy Costello is right, that this matter might be reconsidered. If the House thinks fit, I shall have it further considered and, after examination, will bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>Before section 54, page 51, to insert the following new section :</P>
      <P>(1) It shall be the duty of the proprietor of every theatre, hall, room or other place, in which dramatic works are performed to keep or cause to be kept in such theatre, hall, room, or place a register, in the form prescribed by the Minister by rules, of all dramatic works performed in such theatre, hall, room, or place, and within twelve hours after each performance to enter or cause to be entered in such register such particulars of the work and of the person presenting it as shall be prescribed by rules made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every register kept in pursuance of this section may be inspected at all reasonable times by any person who is the author of or owner of the copyright in any published work and copies of the register or of any part thereof may be made by the person.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may make regulations prescribing all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the form of the register to be kept in pursuance of this section,</P>
      <P>(b)  the particulars to be entered in the register in respect of dramatic works, and of the person presenting them,</P>
      <P>(c)  defining the person who is to be deemed, in respect of any particular dramatic work, to be presenting it.</P>
      <P>(4)  If any person who is required by this section to keep, or cause to be kept, a register&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  fails to keep the register or to cause it to be kept, or</P>
      <P>(b)  fails to make or cause to be made in the register within the time prescribed by this section any entry required by or under this section to be made therein, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> (c)  fails to produce the register for the inspection of any person entitled under this section to inspect it or obstructs or impedes any such person in making such inspection, or</P>

    <P>he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is being introduced as a result of representations made by dramatists, mainly.  A register was required to be kept of dramatic works performed in halls and was inspected as long as the entertainment duty was charged in respect of performances in these halls.  There was an inspection system by the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose, mainly, of entertainment duty, but when the entertainment duty was taken off, there then remained no inspection system which could also be used for the inspection of records of performances in these halls of dramatic works.  Playwrights and others felt we should, nevertheless, continue to have a register maintained.  It was pointed out to them that since there were not inspectors available for inspecting these registers, there would be no purpose in it, but they have undertaken that inspection of the registers will be carried out in any event.  Therefore, in response to the representations made, I am continuing what was, in fact, previous law.</P>

      <P>I am not certain. The point I wish to raise on this is: Would the Minister consider giving this protection in respect of musical entertainments also?  The section as drafted is in protection of dramatic <Col N="1474" /> works and protection of authors, so that they will know, where registers are bound to be kept by law, whether or not their works are being performed. It might be difficult to provide that every musical work performed in a hall would be kept in a register but would you not keep a register of musical entertainments?  What I have in mind is that it would merely be stated that a musical entertainment was held either in the form of a concert or a dance, and then it would be a matter subsequently to ascertain whether or not an infringement might or might not have occurred.  This would be of help also with regard to the licences that would be granted by an authors' organisation and it might be a help to the Controller in determining the amount of fees to be charged in respect of such licences because it would be a comparatively simple matter if a register were kept, to ascertain the number of functions, musical entertainments, that were held.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of inserting &ldquo;musical entertainments&rdquo; in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only after considerable thought that I acceded to the representations made by authors in respect of dramatic works.  A dramatic work is something very special, which can easily be recorded, but musical entertainments are different matters.  It would be difficult. It would be rather an imposition to require a register to be kept.  I am afraid I should not like to go any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be very difficult for a proprietor of a hall to write down every musical work that was performed on every occasion and I am not suggesting that.  All I am suggesting is that if we are providing for a register, which, I understand, was provided for in existing legislation, there would also be a register merely stating a musical entertainment was held on 31st January, 2nd February, or whatever date it was.  That would be a great help in seeing that the law was enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered whether this section is not, as at present drafted, an unduly onerous one on small printing and publishing companies?  This matter was adverted to on Second Stage.  It was decided that in principle it was desirable to retain this obligation on publishers to supply copies to certain specified libraries: the National Library, the Library of Trinity College, the National University, Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the British Museum.</P>
      <P>As I understand this section, it imposes an obligation on publishers to supply a certain number of copies to each of these specified libraries.  It has been suggested that on small publishing and printing companies the obligation to furnish so many copies is an onerous one.  It is different in the case of a wealthy company, where a company is engaged in very large publishing business, has not merely considerable resources but publishes annually a large number of books.  The obligation placed on a company of that sort is not, relative to their business, any serious burden.  But because of the number of small publishing companies in this country, a number of them feel that the provisions of the section are unduly onerous.</P>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would consider whether some alteration might not be made in the section which, while preserving the obligation on publishers to supply copies of books&mdash;and I think it probably would be deemed desirable to do so&mdash; the number of copies might be reduced in the case of certain publishing firms and certainly in the case of firms where the number of copies published of a particular book is of a restricted nature.</P>

I think it is now past the time, if they do not have to do so, that we relieve Irish firms of this obligation.  This dates back to a time when the British Government had control over us.  It is time we got rid of that obligation, no matter what it costs.  We have now reached the stage when it is time to get rid of these silly obligations, imposed on us by an alien Government at a time when we were not able to defend ourselves.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Leneghan, this arrangement works so much in our favour that it is worth while retaining. The number of copies publishing companies would be required to make available free under this section is eleven.  There is a corresponding obligation on British publishing firms to make available a copy to Trinity College, Dublin.  While I agree that that obligation does not extend to the libraries mentioned by Deputy Leneghan, nevertheless the arrangement is so much in our favour that it is worth while continuing it.  I should not like to interfere with it in any case.</P>

      <P>On reconsideration, I am satisfied it is not necessary to proceed with Deputy Sweetman's amendment.  The section as it stands refers to a day which is specified by the rules as an excluded day and not one defined by the rules.  The provision of Section 6 of the Bill closely follows the existing provision in Section 148 of the 1927 Act.  It is intended to prescribe rules governing days and hours of business and excluded days on the general lines of the existing relevant rules.  These are as follows: Days and hours of business at the Office: the Office shall be opened to the public every weekday, except Saturday, between the hours of 10 and 4 and, on Saturday, between the hours of 10 and 1, except on the days <Col N="1480" /> following, and then they specify Christmas Day, bank holidays, Good Friday, etc., and the rules also include under excluded days &ldquo;whenever the last day fixed by the Act or by these rules shall fall on a day when the Office is not open, or on a Saturday, which days shall be excluded days for the purpose of the Act and it shall be lawful to do any such thing on the day following such excluded day or days, if two or more of them occur consecutively.&rdquo; I am advised this takes care of Deputy Sweetman's point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 10 and 11, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section shall not apply to a trade mark which is shown to the satisfaction of the Controller to have been used in the State for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of the application.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a much more vital matter.  For a considerable number of years Part B of the register has been used for the purpose of having a part of the register applicable to marks which had the benefit of user.  Under the Bill the Minister is providing that Part B in future will not be as it has been hitherto but will be a second-class Part A.  I suggest that is wholly undesirable.  Where it has been tried elsewhere, it has proved to be wholly unsatisfactory.  Let me make this confession. When the Minister and I were discussing this on Committee Stage, I did not understand the implications quite as clearly as I do now, and I venture to suggest that the Minister did not fully understand the implications then, either, because his &ldquo;night <Col N="1482" /> and day&rdquo; reference, when considered in the context of the report itself, could not possibly hold water in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The position is that for the past 44 years traders have had an opportunity under Part B of registering, without disclaimer, marks they had used for at least two years.  The purpose of my amendment is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in that respect.  There have been no ill-effects whatever, except perhaps that Part B was not as useful as it might have been because it was limited entirely to the use of marks.  The purpose of this section is to allow registration in Part B, without disclaimer in certain instances, but in respect of used marks, the disclaimer facility, or method, shall we say, would not be available.  Registration in Part B of a composite trade mark does not give protection for the individual parts of the mark.  It is nonsense, therefore, with all due respect, to say that by registering a mark that has the words &ldquo;night and day&rdquo; excluded as part of the mark, there was any attempt to register the words &ldquo;night and day&rdquo; as such.  That might arise if the registration were in Part A.  In Part B registrations, which do not have to have any essential particulars, it would be an invalid argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred me to Kerly.  I would refer the Minister to the 8th edition, page 263.  As pointed out by Mr. Justice Meredith, to whose judgment we referred each other the other day, the right conferred by registration in Part B is a continuing privilege.  The alleged infringer has a complete defence if he can show that the use is not calculated to deceive.  No claim to excessive use of the &ldquo;night and day&rdquo; words, which the Minister used on the last occasion, would stand for a moment and a disclaimer would be entirely superfluous.</P>
    <P>To suggest that a person could arrogate to himself a proprietary interest in such words by including them in a Part B registration would not hold water.  Apart from that, I suggest to the Minister that Section 16&mdash;it was Section 15 before it was amended&mdash; provides a full safeguard for the probable use of such words.  I want <Col N="1483" /> to suggest to the Minister that it is essential in the interests of everyone&mdash; consumers, public, owners of trade marks and everybody else&mdash;that there should be some radical new thinking by the Controller in his approach to these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given certain information in reply to questions which, in my submission, disclose a sorry state of affairs.  When we discussed the rejection of trade marks at an earlier stage, the Minister very properly made the point that what was done in one year might not be referable to that year at all, and accordingly he took three years together.  On 5th of this month, in answer to Question 28 on the Order Paper, the Minister gave the average percentage of acceptance of applications for the registration of trade marks in each period.  For the three years ending on 31st March, 1953, the percentage accepted was 97.2; in 1956, it was 87.6; in 1958, it was 75.4; in 1959, it was 76.2; in 1960, it was 77; in 1961, it was 69.7; and up to last March it was 60.  In other words, the percentage of accepted applications has dropped in a three-year average period by one-third.</P>
    <P>May I also refer the Minister to the number of hearings that have been held under the relevant section of the Act under which we are now operating?  In 1953, there were three such hearings to deal with objections by the Controller of Trade Marks. In 1954, there were two; in 1955, none; in 1956, five; in 1957, four; in 1958, 13; in 1959, 18; in 1960, 16; and in 1961, 42.  I have not got the figure for 1962, but I am told it will be of the same order.</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously to the Minister that the combination of those two sets of figures, quite apart from the arguments on the section itself, disclose a state of mind that requires radically to be changed.  I suggest further to the Minister that he can get abundant evidence and that if he considers it desirable, before this Bill goes to the Seanad, to have such evidence, he can receive a deputation of people concerned in this matter and they will <Col N="1484" /> provide him with abundant evidence of the great dissatisfaction that exists in relation to this method.  He will be told that the use of the disclaimer provision in Part B of the Bill, where there has been two years' continuous user, will virtually mean that the system in relation to trade marks will be so unsatisfactory that nobody will be concerned with it and that ordinary commercial practice will be completely hamstrung.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment.  The system which operated here for a great number of years provided that registration under Part B could be obtained after a <i>bona fide</i> user of two years' standing or where the trade mark was capable of becoming distinguishable.  This is now being changed.  It is proposed that all trade marks will be on the same basis, whether or not there has been two years' user.  It is further proposed that disclaimer will be permitted for registration under Part B.  I want to support the amendments for the reasons given by Deputy Sweetman.</P>
      <P>We are of the view that if in fact a person can show he has been <i>bona fide</i> using a mark for two years, he should be entitled to registration under Part B without the proposed disclaimer. There was no system of disclaimer in respect of Part B up to the present time.  We are in fact adopting the British system which, I understand, has not proved to be satisfactory.  We anticipate and apprehend that a great many disclaimers will come to be operated under Part B if our system is not adopted.  If it is adopted, then when a person can show a <i>bona fide</i> use for two years of a mark, and when he can show it is a genuine trade mark, he will be entitled to register without disclaimer.  We anticipate there will be considerable difficulties out of the operation of Part B as provided in this section&mdash;that there will be a great number of disclaimers&mdash;and we believe this will involve a considerable amount of commercial confusion, that in many instances it may discourage the operation of legitimate trading practices and that it would be worth while to give a trial period to the proposals we have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> As I have stated, the experience in Great Britain has not been a particularly happy one, and we suggest the Minister should accept this amendment. If he does not wholeheartedly agree with it, I suggest he should at least give it a trial period and see how it works out in practice.  While we are here undoubtedly doing something that is of some benefit commercially, we are taking away the advantages we give in Part B by reason of the possible number of disclaimers that will come in.  I would therefore suggest again that our amendment should be accepted and given a trial period.</P>

      <P>From the discussion on the last occasion, and from what I have heard here today, I must say I cannot do otherwise than resist the amendment.  In the first place, I do not know whether Deputy Sweetman implied that there was automatic registration in Part B, after two years' user.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is that the mark distinguishes the goods for a period of two years and that the mark is capable of distinguishing the goods for that period.  It is possible that user of a mark can extend for two years, by containing words or other matter in ordinary usage, that should not be employed by the trader or manufacturer concerned.  That is the main reason for my resisting these amendments&mdash;that this two year user might otherwise give an automatic right to persons to get on to Part A of the Register in circumstances that would not be desirable in the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt but the Minister surely overlooks the fact that it is the composite trade mark that is registered.  The individual items in it are not.  It is those individual items that are the words in common use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, my argument applies.  I object to the <Col N="1486" /> amendment.  It does not impose any obligation on the owner of the trade mark to accept a disclaimer.  I want to say in reply to Deputy Sweetman's suggestion that things have gone too far so far as the Controller's office is concerned, that that is not the case, I am assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They would seem to do so but the percentage of decisions against applications made are in a specific period&mdash;the Deputy says a three-year period.  Applications are increasing all the time.  In a ten year period, the average has increased from 990: in March, 1958, the average was 990 and for the year ended 31st March, 1962, the number of applications received was 1,413.  With the passage of time, it is obvious that trade marks submitted will tend to lose their distinctiveness.  In so far as it is a juggle with words and lines as depicted on marks, I wish to make them at all times distinctive.  Therefore, it stands to reason the more applications that are made, the more likely it is similarity will occur.  As well as that we have a limited staff available for this purpose.  Staff are not easy to train, and it takes some time, so that there are some arrears of work involved in this, which, in the event, is inevitable.  Therefore, the increasing number of applications, and the greater difficulty in achieving distinctiveness and the difficulty in recruiting quickly the type of staff necessary, all add up to this difference in percentages of acceptances over the past number of years.  I am afraid I cannot elaborate more, as I said on Committee Stage, and I must continue to resist the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When this was tabled on Committee Stage, the Minister gave as his objection to it that the trade mark had been operative from the date of the application and that accordingly if the matter were to affect the date, it would mean that registration as of the date of the application could be made by a person who was not in fact the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While amendment No. 5 is exactly the same as it was before on Committee Stage, amendment No. 10 deals with the objection that is being made by the Minister.  I cannot see for the life of me what the objection is to ensuring that a trade mark can be properly assigned during the period of pending application.  I am not suggesting that perhaps I may not have fully drafted everything that is necessary, but it seems to me that it is quite a simple matter and that it requires only a little drafting thought.  There is a very genuine difficulty, when, during the currency of an application before acceptance, there has been a change in owner.  It may very well be that insistence by the Minister on the stand he has taken so far would delay entirely the liquidation of a company which had gone out of business, but in respect of which an application was pending. <Col N="1488" /> The liquidator would have to consider that, even though the whole business of the company is being taken over by the new company.  I do not in any way pretend that I have made my draft complete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the case is strengthened by what the Minister has said already, the unfortunate delays which exist due to the shortage of staff.  In fact, if these delays are going to be unavoidable in the future, the case is strengthened for permitting assignment, if that becomes necessary. There cannot be any objection to such an assignment.  If it is only a question of drafting legislation to permit it, then I think it should be done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have nothing to add to what I said on the last day.  I am advised strongly I ought to continue my resistance to this amendment.  If I may advance any reason, I think the main argument against it on the last day was that the trade mark is registered as of the date of the application made and in the name of the person who is owner on that date.  Apparently, that goes to the very root of trade mark law and in subsequent proceedings, the actual date of registration may be the deciding factor.  A further point arises that was not mentioned in the course of the former Stages, that is, where an assignment occurs, if it is a partial one, that is, an assignment without goodwill, the provisions of Section 30, subsections (4), (5) and (6), dealing with the restrictions on assignment and transmission, apply.  I understand that no difficulty whatever, to the knowledge of the Controller, or my own knowledge, has occurred.  It has not been brought to our knowledge.</P>

    <P>This is the section which is taken exactly from the other Act.  I think there is a misprint here.  It refers to the Act of 1928 while, of course, it is the Act of 1938.  I think it is a good <Col N="1491" /> subsection, a good proviso.  On the last occasion, the Minister referred to the Official Secrets Act as being operative. That would, of course, be operative in respect of any unauthorised disclosure but this is not an unauthorised disclosure that I am referring to.  I want to make it quite clear that only information that is not confidential and is not secret will be disclosed to rivals in trade.  The absence of such a provision in the Minister's Bill here, when he follows the other Acts so carefully in other respects, highlights this and has caused some considerable uneasiness in the profession.</P>

It is something in favour of the person <Col N="1494" /> whose name might be otherwise removed to give him an opportunity to be heard.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the statement contained in paragraph 21 of the White Paper on Incomes and Output that the Government deem it necessary that Departments and State-sponsored organisations should not accede for the present to any claims for increases in wages and salaries, or for changes in conditions of work having the same effect, and in view of his statement of 10th February that the Government's White Paper did not envisage or forecast any action to enforce a standstill on wages, he will make a statement to the House clarifying what action in fact is contemplated by the Government following on the publication of the White Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record in this House the comment which I made on the 10th instant regarding the statement issued on the previous day by the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I said :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have a clear and obvious duty to inform the public of the state of the national economy and to advise on the courses of action which will promote its progress or which could endanger it. This duty is paramount and could not be made subject to the concurrence of other bodies.  The Government have, while preserving&mdash;as they must&mdash;their own final function <Col N="1497" /> of decision, constantly followed the practice of regular consultations with all organisations&mdash;including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash; which can speak for important economic interests.  There is, in fact, little in the White Paper which has not been frequently said before in statements made on behalf of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot usefully add to this statement except to direct the Deputy's attention to Paragraph 19 of the White Paper which states that the Government contemplate discussions with representatives of workers and employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Congress did not ask that they should concur in the views expressed in the White Paper but that they should have been consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is there any good reason why, if he had these notions in his mind, he would not send for the Executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and say: &ldquo;Look.  The Government are thinking in the following terms&rdquo;, and indicate to the Executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions what the terms were, the reasons for them and, generally, endeavour to get from Congress a reasoned view as to what, in the opinion of an experienced body like Congress, should be done in the circumstances with which the Taoiseach was dealing?  Congress did not ask for its agreement.  The indignation of Congress is that it ought to be consulted and had a point of view to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on the occasion when I made the statement which I have already quoted, there is little in the White Paper that has not been previously said on many occasions in statements made on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason why Congress should not be consulted? The Taoiseach has certainly succeeded in irritating them and blunting their <Col N="1498" /> enthusiasm for what everybody desires, namely, the promotion of harmony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For my part, since I first became a member of a Government, 30 years ago, I have never once refused to meet representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the Trade Union Congress.  Whenever they wished to express views to me, I have always been available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that on previous occasions over the last few years, particularly when our entry into EEC was being considered, Congress was asked for and gave full co-operation and, out of common courtesy, would it not have been more reasonable if the Taoiseach had invited Congress to discuss the matter and then had made his own statement about it after he had heard their views?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, further to replies of 7th February on the subject of decreases in infectious diseases maintenance allowance, corresponding to increases in disability benefit, he is aware that the operation of these decreases, even in cases where there have been previous increases in infectious diseases allowances, has meant that those with infectious diseases have received considerably smaller overall increases than other disability benefit recipients; and if he will take steps to rectify this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inherent in the scheme of Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowances that individual allowances will vary within the permitted maxima according to the income of the recipient.  Where income from other sources, including social welfare benefits, is increased an adjustment is ordinarily made in the rate of allowance but health authorities have a discretion to disregard such an increase, in whole or in part, if they consider that undue hardship would otherwise result.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that notwithstanding the recent increase in the disability benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowances are still, in general, in advance of Social Welfare Benefits having regard to the fact that personal and dependants' allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations may be supplemented by a rent allowance and a domestic help allowance in appropriate cases.  In the circumstances, I see no reason to alter the basis of the scheme of allowances as at present administered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is made clear at several points in the White Paper that the Government's concern relates to the damage to the national economy which would occur if money incomes generally were further increased before national production had risen sufficiently.  There is no suggestion that restraint should be exercised only in relation to increases in wages and salaries.  On the contrary, it is emphasised that &ldquo;general restraint is essential&rdquo;.  It would not be reasonable to expect this general and voluntary restraint if the Government were itself to acquiesce at present in any claims for increases in wages and salaries in State or semi-State employments which would arouse expectations of similar increases in the private sector.  This is why Departments and State-sponsored organisations have been advised not to accede for the present to claims which might have this effect.  The restraint is clearly intended to be merely temporary until income increases can be applied without danger of a further rise in prices, curtailment of employment or damage to national economic progress.  It is hoped that the proposed objective assessment of the economic position and potentialities referred to in paragraph 19 of the White Paper will assist those who have responsibilities in settling wage and salary rates in private employment <Col N="1505" /> in establishing a more orderly relationship between income increases and the growth of national production.</P>
    <P>In regard to profits, attention may be drawn to the following paragraph (No. 15) of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Profits, industrial and other, form a much smaller proportion of national income than do wages and salaries.  Higher profit distributions not associated with higher production or sales have, however, even if on a smaller scale, the same consequences as higher incomes not related to output.  There is a special obligation on industrial managements to set, in this respect, an example to the community.  Industrialists are now under pressure, through reduction of protection and higher costs, to increase efficiency; growth of profits is becoming dependent on expansion of sales in more competitive conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that a further general reduction of our industrial protective tariffs will take place on 1 January, 1964, and an indication has been given by the Taoiseach that it would be desirable to achieve a reduction of the order of one-third by 1 January, 1965.  The reduction of industrial tariffs on this basis will provide increased competition and thus impose an effective check on price levels.</P>
    <P>So far as stabilisation of the cost of living is concerned, this will be most effectively ensured if the general level of incomes does not rise faster than output.  Experience in the period 1958 to 1960, as recorded in paragraph 3 of the White Paper, bears this out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the direction from the Government, to which the Minister referred, is in fact a direction to restrict any increase in wages in State bodies or State-sponsored bodies?  In effect, this restricts any needed increase to meet the rise in the cost of living from the present onwards, while there is no such restriction in relation to profits, in so far as profit distribution is merely an annual event and in that way would <Col N="1506" /> not be affected by the present White Paper?  It can take place subsequent to the publication of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Secondly, could I ask the Minister how does he suggest that somebody working in a non-productive type of employment, such as a civil servant, a CIE worker or a road worker, can increase production?</P>
      <P>Thirdly, is it not a fact that the lack of increased productivity has been disclosed in the CIO reports as being due to under capitalisation, lack of mechanisation or development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As already announced the Government decided in July, 1960, to accede to the request of the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann for the return to them of the entire premises of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, the greater part of which is used as the headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare.  In order to provide alternative accommodation for the staff of the Department, it was decided to erect a new building on part of the site of the former Beggar's Bush military barracks.  The projected building which would be 20 storeys in height and would contain accommodation for about 1,400 heads of staff would house the Department of Health in addition to the Department of Social Welfare.

    <P>Aer Lingus have, for some time, been considering the acquisition of jet aircraft for operation on their continental services and the company have submitted certain proposals to me in regard to the financial arrangements <Col N="1513" /> which are at present under consideration. As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the 28th June, 1962, a decision to purchase such aircraft would necessitate an increase in the capital of the company and the enabling legislation would afford the Oireachtas an opportunity to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The selection of the type of aircraft most suitable for their purposes is a matter for the company.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers.  The factory at Tuam was facilitated by a grant from An Foras Tionscal, a new manufacture licence and duty-free licences for the importation of raw materials required for production for export.  As indicated by me in reply to a question on 11th December last, the firm's main problem appears to have been one of difficulty in obtaining export markets for their products.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have, I understand, with the firm's agreement brought the closing of the factory to the notice of certain external interests who, it is thought, might be interested in taking it over.  There have been no positive developments in any of these contacts to date, but I can assure the Deputy that any sound proposals submitted to me for the reopening of the factory will receive my most sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the remarks of the spokesman of the company saying certain things could be done if the Department changed their attitude.  I can apply that only to an application by this company for an amendment of their New Manufacture Licence.  As I <Col N="1516" /> said, this company got many facilities, including a substantial grant and a New Manufacture Licence in respect of other goods which enabled them to produce these for sale on the Irish market.  Before I can grant, or extend, a New Manufacture Licence, I must be satisfied that the goods proposed to be manufactured are not already being manufactured to an adequate extent by existing concerns.  In this case the application for a New Manufacture Licence referred to cloths that were already being manufactured by existing private Irish concerns which were in no way assisted by grants when they were set up.  If the licence were amended, as proposed by the company, it would mean that that company could make goods for sale on the Irish market and would thereby affect the mills already producing similar goods.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts of the Land Commission are kept in accordance with the requirements under Section 10 (3), Land Act, 1923, and Rule 36 of Land (Finance) Rules, 1925, and they are not made out on a localised basis.  For the country as a whole, land settlement transactions are quite numerous; not all items of income and expenditure are readily apportionable according <Col N="1525" /> to separate properties as originally acquired.  For example, adjacent lands acquired from different owners sometimes have to be amalgamated for convenience of access, water, etc., leading to bulk rentals.  Profit and loss accounting by individual estates is quite impracticable. Perhaps the annexed statement&mdash;which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report&mdash;for the year 1961/62 in respect of the whole country may be of interest.  The appropriated profit of £8,000 for the whole country was quite insignificant by comparison with the total voted from taxation to the Lands Vote for the same year, viz., £2,327,880.</P>

      <P>The detection and prosecution of cases of unlicensed haulage is one of the duties which are carried out by the Force as a whole, <Col N="1534" /> and there are no Gardaí or police cars engaged exclusively on this work.  No separate cost figures are kept in relation to these detections or prosecutions, and it is not possible to make an estimate.</P>
      <P>A separate record is not kept of fines imposed for haulage offences, and I do not consider that the amount of work involved in ascertaining this particular information would be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The only claims awaiting decision under the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme are (a) a claim for improved pensions for widows of deceased members, and (b) pay claims on behalf of (i) Chief Superintendents and Superintendents, (ii) Inspectors, Station Sergeants and Sergeants, and (iii) Gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim for improved widows' pensions was received on the 29th April, 1961.  It was discussed at a meeting of the Conciliation Council on 24th October, 1961, when consideration of it was adjourned.  The Official <Col N="1535" /> Side intimated its willingness to discuss the claim further at a meeting fixed for 30th October, 1962, but it was then ascertained that the Garda side was not then in a position to discuss it.  Since that date it has been open to the Garda side to have the claim placed on the agenda for a meeting of the Council.</P>
    <P>Particulars of the three Garda pay claims, the cost of which, if conceded, would amount to approximately £1,600,000 per annum, are as follows:</P>
    <P>The claim on behalf of Chief Superintendents and Superintendents is, in the case of Chief Superintendents, for a new salary scale of £2,070 at the minimum to £2,510 at the maximum instead of the present scale of £1,620 (minimum) to £1,960 (maximum); and, in the case of Superintendents, for a new salary scale of £1,475 at the minimum to £1,885 at the maximum, instead of the present scale of £1,125 (minimum) to £1,535 (maximum).  This claim was received on 25th September last and was discussed at a meeting of the Conciliation Council on 30th October when disagreement was recorded.  Since that date it has been open to the Garda side to submit the claim for consideration by the Arbitration Board.</P>
    <P>The pay claim by the inspectors, station sergeants and sergeants, is for new salary scales as follows :</P>
    <P>Inspectors&mdash;£1,380 (minimum) to £1,530 (maximum).  The present scale is £920 (minimum) to £1,020 (maximum).</P>
    <P>Station Sergeants&mdash;£1,250 (minimum) to £1,310 (maximum).  The present scale is £834 to £873.</P>
    <P>Sergeant (man)&mdash;£1,150 (minimum) to £1,230 (maximum).  The present scale is £769 to £821.</P>
    <P>Sergeant (woman)&mdash; £990 (minimum) to £1,070 (maximum).  The present scale is £657 to £709.</P>
    <P>This claim was received on the 16th of last month and will be discussed at a meeting of the Conciliation Council which has been provisionally arranged for the 26th of this month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> The pay claim on behalf of Gardaí is as follows:</P>
    <P>Garda (man)&mdash;£10 (minimum) to £18 10s. a week (maximum).  The present scale is £8 15s. to £14 a week.</P>
    <P>Garda (woman)&mdash;£8 15s. a week (minimum) to £16 a week (maximum). The present scale is £7 12s. 6d. to £12 3s. a week.</P>
    <P>This claim was received on the 10th of last month and will be discussed at a meeting of the Conciliation Council which has been arranged for the 19th of this month.</P>
    <P>For obvious reasons, I am unable to say when decisions will be reached on these claims.  There will, however, so far as Government Departments are concerned, be no avoidable delay on their part.  I cannot anticipate what the outcome of the Conciliation and Arbitration proceedings will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to the Government's White Paper entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  That document states that it is not envisaged that conciliation and arbitration schemes should be put in suspense, and all claims made by the Garda representatives under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.  The findings will, of course, fall to be considered in accordance with Government policy as set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
