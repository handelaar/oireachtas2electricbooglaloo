      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has recently received complaints regarding the quality and service of food in St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin; and what action he has taken in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a complaint in July last concerning the quality and service of food in St. Kevin's Hospital.  It alleged that</P>
      <P>(a)  dinners were served cold and burned up;</P>
      <P>(b)  the bread was not eaten;</P>
      <P>(c)  patients were forced to provide their own food;</P>
      <P>(d)  all dinners served in Hospital 5 on 26th July last were returned uneaten;</P>
      <P>and it requested that clean and qualified personnel should be employed to cook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> I directed that the Dublin Health Authority be asked to investigate and furnish a report on these allegations. A thorough investigation was made by officers of the Health Authority and the report subsequently submitted to me stated that:</P>
    <P>(a)  Meals leave the kitchen hot, the food boxes having been given a booster heat in steamers and, as the time in the transit of the trolleys to the wards has been reduced to a minimum, there is no question of dinners being served cold and burned up.</P>
    <P>(b)  Bread is wrapped, sliced and delivered fresh daily by a reputable firm.</P>
    <P>(c)  There is no evidence that patients are forced to provide food for themselves but some visitors bring in food on visiting days regardless of the quality of the food served; this practice has been discouraged for a long time.</P>
    <P>(d)  The investigation showed that no dinner was returned on 26th July.</P>
    <P>The supervisory staff in charge of cooking arrangements at St. Kevin's includes a catering superintendent and two assistant superintendents.  The superintendent and one of the latter are qualified dieticians.</P>
    <P>I might add that I am advised by my Chief Medical Adviser that when he visited the kitchen serving Hospital 5 some time previously he saw the preparation and dispatch of a meal and was impressed by the work of the chef and his assistants; the food was excellent, the equipment was good and the kitchen was spotlessly clean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the number of homes in the State in which incapacitated and old persons are kept for private profit, and the total number of persons so kept in these homes; (b) the number of homes in which such persons are kept by charitable institutions, and the number of persons kept in such homes; and (c) the number of homes in which such persons are <Col N="1217" /> kept (i) by health or other local authorities, and (ii) by State authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy, in referring to homes in which incapacitated and old persons are kept, has in mind homes which cater mainly for long-stay cases and not nursing homes which deal mainly with cases of acute illness although they may care for a small number of long-stay incapacitated and elderly patients.</P>
      <P>On that assumption, I am aware of the existence of 17 institutions of this type in which incapacitated and old persons are kept for private profit.  The total number of beds in 14 of these institutions is 174 but I have no information regarding the bed complement in the remaining three.  Six of the homes have been inspected and approved for the provision of services under Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.  There may be other homes, and I believe there are, run for private profit concerning which I have no information.</P>
      <P>While I have not comprehensive information about homes run by charitable organisations in which incapacitated and old persons are maintained, I am aware of over thirty organisations which do work in this field.  The organisations I know of have about 2,600 places at their disposal.</P>
      <P>Accommodation in local authority institutions for incapacitated and old persons is mainly provided in the 34 county homes or county home type institutions.  In addition, large sections in six other health authority institutions which are not county homes are set aside for such persons and practically all the district mental hospitals include among their patients persons who are in the category mentioned. There are, in addition, three institutions run by voluntary organisations which, by special arrangement, cater almost entirely for health authority patients who are incapacitated and old.</P>
      <P>There are no homes run by State authorities for incapacitated and old persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a recent publication of the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in which an alarming increase in the use of tobacco by juveniles in Cork city is disclosed; and if he will take any steps to publicise the dangers to health involved in smoking by juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in the November issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association on a survey of the smoking habits of children in Cork city.  The report indicates the numbers of cigarettes smoked by boys and girls between 11 and 14 years of age in April and May, 1962.  It contains no figures to show that there was an increase in smoking among Cork juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the publicising of the dangers to health, I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to a question by Deputy Barron on the 7th instant.  In this connection, the Cork survey to which the Deputy refers shows that over 90 per cent of the children questioned were aware of the connection between smoking and bad health and over 75 per cent knew that smoking <Col N="1219" /> was connected with the incidence of lung cancer.  This seems to indicate that the measures taken to publicise the danger to health of cigarette smoking are effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply to the question by Deputy Barron to which he has referred, the Minister indicated that leaflets are distributed to those whom he described as of school-leaving age, pointing out the dangers of smoking. Would the Minister say what is the age group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody of the age at which they leave school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include schoolchildren from the age of seven up to 14?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Children do not leave school until they are 14 and I assume those responsible for the care of the children referred to in the supplementary question take care to impress upon them the dangers of smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the danger of smoking is impressed on children between the ages of seven and 14?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume it is.  I am not going to believe that parents and teachers are so negligent of the children under their care that they will not impress upon them the dangers to which he is referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking if the danger to which the Minister has referred is impressed upon the children at school?</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1220" /> for Health if his attention has been drawn to a recent publication of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association in which the incidence of heart complaints is related to the use of tobacco; and if he will take steps similar to those already in operation in the United States and in Great Britain calculated to focus public attention on the dangers of the use of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the article to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Arising out of it, I should refer the Deputy to the editorial on page 170 of the same issue of the Journal, in which it is stated that &ldquo;there is no evidence that pipe or cigar smoking constitute an important threat to the public health&rdquo;.  Consequently, the reference to &ldquo;tobacco&rdquo; in the question is misleading.  The references in the article to which the Deputy refers are to cigarette smoking, particularly heavy cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>Further, it is pointed out in that article that:</P>
      <P>We do not yet have proof that the association between heavy cigarette smoking and coronary heart disease is a causative one,</P>
      <P>though the statement does go on to say that &ldquo;there is no reasonable alternative theory to explain the association&rdquo;. On the other hand, the Report of the Royal College of Physicians which was published last year holds that it is not possible to assert that the association between coronary disease and smoking is causal, and further states that various other factors such as mental strain, sedentary occupation and indulgence in fatty foods, which are thought to increase liability to coronary thrombosis, are also commonly associated with heavy smoking and that it is possible that factors such as these may be responsible as much as smoking itself for increased mortality from this disease among smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not, however, the association between cigarette smoking and heart disease is a causal one, as I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions&mdash;the most recent <Col N="1221" /> being in reply to a question by Deputy Barron on the 7th instant&mdash;I have taken and will continue to take steps to publicise the danger to health of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider taking time on Radio Éireann and Telefis Éireann to point out the dangers of smoking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I might, but I do not think there is any point in preaching to people who already appreciate the fact that excessive cigarette smoking is dangerous to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So you will not do anything about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any expenditure other than that already charged against Vote 18 (Law Charges) arose in his Department by reason of the unsuccessful proceedings brought in the High Court by Mrs. Gladys Ryan to have the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960 declared to be repugnant to the Constitution; and, if such expenditure has arisen, if he will state the amount thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure by my Department, in addition to the expenditure of £20,000 approximately charged against Vote 18 (Law Charges), in connection with the unsuccessful proceedings in the High Court, brought by Mrs. Gladys Ryan to have the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, declared to be repugnant to the Constitution is estimated at approximately £8,000.  The learned Judge, having held that the fluoridation of public water supplies, as provided for under the Act, does not infringe any of the plaintiff's constitutional rights, dismissed the action and awarded costs covering 64 days hearings, out of a total of 66 days, against the plaintiff.  Details of the expenditure incurred by my Department are being <Col N="1222" /> furnished to the Chief State Solicitor for inclusion in the bill of costs to be recovered in accordance with the judge's order.</P>

One other deputation was received on 14/12/60.  The members of the first deputation, which represented Counties Tipperary and Limerick were:&mdash; Deputies R. Ryan, D. Ó Briain, G.C. Bennett, D. Bourke, M. J. Keyes, M. Colbert, J. Reidy; D. Breen, F. Loughman, R. Mulcahy, Mrs. Ryan, A. Fogarty, D. Morrissey, W. F. O'Donnell; Senators D.J. Madden and T. Crowley; Fr. J. Hayes, C.C., Mr. P.J.

      <P>The Mulcaire catchment was listed number 17 in the original priority list of major catchment areas and its position on that list has not been changed.  I stated in reply to a question in this House on 15th November, 1961, that it was proposed to have the survey of the Mulcaire catchment commenced in 1963.  I am glad to be able to tell the House now that the engineering survey has in fact been started and we will continue with the preparatory work with a view to commencing the actual work on the ground as soon as possible.  I am not going to give an exact date as there is an enormous amount of investigation and planning to be done before the best scheme can be designed and the actual construction work begins but I can say that no time will be wasted in getting the works under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution, Ireland has accepted the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.  The immunity of diplomatic agents from the criminal, and subject to certain exceptions, from the civil jurisdiction of the receiving State is a particularly well-established rule.  Members of the diplomatic corps who have motor cars are, however, requested to keep themselves insured and insurance companies in this country have agreed not to insist on immunity being claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While fully accepting our reciprocal obligation to conform to accepted diplomatic practice, does the Minister not consider it to be a very great hardship if a citizen of this State should suffer civil damage as a result of an accident in which a diplomat is involved?  Would he not consider consulting his colleagues as to whether some device might not be evolved where diplomatic immunity is invoked against an individual's civil claim, so that he might nominate even a fictitious person who would stand as defendant in an appropriate suit to <Col N="1231" /> determine what compensation should equitably be paid to our citizen and so that arrangements could be made to have that compensation met?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not consider the present rule very satisfactory and, as a matter of fact, we supported an amendment to it when the Diplomatic Privileges Agreement was being made in Vienna a couple of years ago.  That amendment got very little support; it was beaten two, or three, to one.  With regard to the danger of a diplomat having a non-insured car, or an insured car in regard to which the insurance company claims immunity, we approached insurance companies and they have agreed not to claim immunity in the event of a diplomatic car being involved in an accident.  On the whole, I think, the arrangement has worked satisfactorily and I hope that some difficulties that have arisen will be ironed out.</P>

      <P>It was only natural that the Commission, as a result of the report of the survey team and the rejection of some of its vital recommendations by the study group, would proceed to examine into the many questions affecting the industry.  The fact that they carry out this examination and the fact that they have consultations with the curers and the farming organisations does not mean that they have made up their minds to effect any changes.  There is nothing wrong in examination and consultation. Indeed, it would be a neglect of duty on their part if they did not examine problems in the industry in the hope of finding a solution.  They have not submitted any proposals to me and I do not think they have any fixed mind on any of these matters.  They are merely investigating and, before they can do anything about the outcome of such investigation, they will have to consult me and my Department.  I believe I can be trusted to take the necessary steps to ensure that a sensible decision is reached.</P>

      <P>As far as I know, they have made no decision as to what steps, if any, they will take.  I do not know what their legal powers may be in regard to any scheme they might be discussing or contemplating.  If they were thinking in terms of some action not provided for by law, then, of <Col N="1235" /> course, I would have to consult the House, if I approved of what they were proposing to do.  The law is there.  I do not know exactly what powers it gives them.  It all depends, of course, on what they propose to do.  Anyhow, I think it can safely be left as it is because the work is merely exploratory.They may decide to make no proposals at all.  If they decide to make proposals, these will have to be submitted to me.  I am sure the House will see to it that Deputies and the public will know all about it, apart altogether from any obligation on me as Minister to keep the House and country informed.</P>

      <P>This year, difficulty in making the allocation of the voted provision has arisen, because of delay on the part of some game councils in lodging schemes with my Department.  Not all schemes have yet been received.  Approximately one-third of the schemes already lodged were only received within the past fortnight.  Consultations with nationally organised interested bodies are pending as a matter of urgency and I hope to announce the over-all allocation of grants next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week, I was complaining that Dublin city and county are not being fairly treated in the allocation of grants from the Road Fund.  Less than half of the amount contributed by motor vehicle owners in this city and county is being given back for road construction and improvement.  In other parts of the country, £3 for every £1 subscribed in the form of motor taxation is given back, in spite of the fact that the traffic density in those counties is negligible compared with the density and weight of traffic carried on the roads in Dublin city and county.  The day is past when moneys from the Road Fund should be allocated on the basis of mileage.  We consider they should be allocated on the basis of the density, weight and frequency of traffic which the roads must carry.</P>
      <P>It is painful for the people of Dublin city and county to see tragic accidents occurring in which people are killed or maimed just because the money they subscribed in the form of motor taxation is not being spent to make the roads safe.  Instead, the remainder of the money&mdash;it is over £1 million&mdash;is being spent in areas over 100 miles from Dublin.  The vehicle owners of Dublin city and county will never see the places where their money is being spent.  It is being spent on tourist roads in remote places.  The Dublin vehicle owners are subscribing heavily towards this programme.  That is not appreciated.  Priority in this matter should be given to the city and county of Dublin, where so many accidents happen because the road scheme is not sufficiently modern to ensure that the roads are capable of coping with the dense traffic in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> If the Government are determined to continue the system of allocating grants from the Road Fund on the basis of mileage, which includes many remote areas, at least they should suspend that operation for a few years until the road scheme in the city and county of Dublin is made capable of dealing with the ever-increasing traffic.</P>
    <P>The newspapers make a very valuable contribution to road safety by the publicity given to tragic road accidents which serve as a warning to road users and persons who may be inclined to drive carelessly, recklessly or furiously, without regard for the rights of other persons on the road.  But for this publicity, there would be a still more tragic tale to tell so far as the city and county of Dublin are concerned.</P>
    <P>The fact must be faced that most of the serious road accidents occur after daylight.  The causes of these accidents must be investigated.  Wild charges will be made that such accidents are due to drunkenness or to carelessness on the part of people returning from dances.  The cause of every accident which occurs after daylight should be investigated.  It would then be possible to collate the results and to take measures to reduce the risk of such accidents occurring.  In some cases it may be found that accidents are due to road-lighting standards.  It may be that a better scheme of road signs is required.  The problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The white guiding lines and cats' eyes make a valuable contribution to the regulation of traffic, reducing the danger of accidents.  There always will be roadhogs but such persons are not inclined to ignore the white lines and to hog the road as they are when there are no guiding lines.  Every penny spent on white paint for road marking is well spent.  The system of road marking should be extended. Wherever these white lines and road signs are used, the danger of accidents is reduced.  That is a valuable service to the citizens.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour of the provision of an increased number of &ldquo;stop&rdquo; signs.  The &ldquo;stop&rdquo; sign is a most important sign wherever there is a crossroad or junction road coming out <Col N="1269" /> onto a main road.  In conditions of bad visibility or through lack of familiarity with the road, a person may come out at speed onto a main road and a very serious accident may result.  I do hope there will be an extension of the use of these signs so that it may be clear to road users who has right of way.</P>
    <P>The statistics collected at various times in regard to traffic conditions should be used by the Department of Local Government so as to ensure that those roads which carry the greatest density of traffic will receive priority in the matter of improvement.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Department and the engineers on the decision to remove many of the high banks and hedges on the Dublin-Belfast road.  I can assure the persons concerned that they have made a very valuable contribution to road safety on the road from Dublin through Swords, which is regarded as being a very bad stretch of road and on which there have been numerous accidents as a result of passing out when there was not a clear view.  The removal of high banks and hedges has enabled very heavy traffic to travel safely.  I should say that on the road through Swords approximately 8,000 vehicles travel per day and on Sunday the number is well over 10,000.  Therefore, anything that is done to increase safety on that road will be appreciated by the thousands of people who use it daily and at weekends.</P>
    <P>The rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles means that the question of having only one-way traffic on trunk roads must be considered.  There have been complaints that straight roads represent a danger, particularly at night, as a result of drivers being blinded by approaching headlights. That danger could be avoided by having one-way traffic on trunk roads. With the use of modern machinery, it would not be too difficult to give priority to these roads.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that at present the canals in Dublin are serving no useful purpose.  If it is possible to transform them and make use of them, a decision to do so should be taken. It has been suggested, for instance, that the Grand Canal be used to carry a main drainage scheme which is <Col N="1270" /> essential for south Dublin.  Some people have spoken in favour of keeping the canals open, but those of us who know them must admit they are serving no useful purpose at present.  On the contrary, they are death-traps for children playing around them in the summer.</P>
    <P>Outside the city boundary, I believe the canals could be kept open and could be developed as a tourist amenity.  The Grand Canal could be diverted somewhere outside the city into one of the other city rivers or streams.  The usefulness of the Grand Canal for carrying the main drainage schemes could then be examined.  That might prove a very good and practical scheme.  The canal might also be used as a one-way road to relieve traffic congestion, particularly across the canal bridges.  People wishing to sail on the canal would, I believe, gladly sail outside the city boundary and would have no desire to sail inside it. I suggested previously in regard to the closed railway line from Harcourt Street that it be used for the construction of a road to carry through traffic out of the city.</P>
    <P>Those who conceived and promoted the Tidy Towns competition deserve our commendation.  It certainly has created pride amongst the people in their villages and towns.  Various communities have joined together and have done a lot for their towns because of this competition.  It struck me that possibly we might be able to devise some kind of tidy streets competition for our cities and towns.  I believe such a competition would encourage the residents of streets to become proud of their property and to improve it.  All over the city, we have signs urging people to keep the streets clean.  I feel that a tidy streets competition would be just as successful as the Tidy Towns competition.</P>
    <P>There is still a certain amount of agitation regarding the speed limits. Some people consider a limit of 30 m.p.h. too fast and most drivers consider it too slow, having regard to the fact that a modern motor vehicle is capable of stopping suddenly within its own length, if necessary.  I know that next year, when the speed limits have <Col N="1271" /> been 12 months in force, Dublin Corporation and the various county councils will be in a position to revise the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are streets in Dublin, mainly outside the centre, on which, having regard to the amount of traffic, cars could safely travel at 40 m.p.h. Obviously, that speed would be too fast in the city centre.  Car drivers find it difficult to keep modern cars down to 30 m.p.h.  Cars do not function properly at that speed, particularly if they are fitted with overdrive.  The cruising gear will not keep a car at 30 m.p.h.; you must get into a lower gear.  If there is dense traffic, the driver will naturally get into a lower gear; but it is difficult to drive a car in a lower gear when there is no traffic in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one particular place, the road in from Finglas.  The speed limit of 30 m.p.h. at Finglas continues along the Merville Road and past Glasnevin Cemetery, where there is no traffic except at morning time.  A number of road users have suggested that the speed limit should be relaxed between de Courcy Square and the bottom of the hill at Finglas.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion, in view of the fact that 40 m.p.h. is permitted between Santry and Griffith Avenue. There is also a 40 mile an hour limit on other roads on which there is much more traffic than on the portion of the road which I have mentioned and which in fact is about two miles long. It is a hardship on vehicle drivers to keep down to the 30 miles an hour limit in a modern vehicle when there is obviously no need to do so.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, I suggested that the Road Fund should be used to provide car parks here in Dublin city. It would be a service to the motor vehicle owners of Dublin city and county to use some of the money which they contribute to the Road Fund to provide parking accommodation for them.  I feel they are entitled to this accommodation and that the cost should be met from the Road Fund.  A number of open spaces have already been provided by Dublin Corporation but, very often, the space <Col N="1272" /> provided is too far away from the motorist's destination.  A walk of three or four minutes from the parking place to his destination is the most that should be expected from a car owner.  There are in London, and in other big cities, well organised parking places for a very large number of vehicles and I feel, since so many motor vehicle owners here are trying to park in the city centre, when the city centre is their destination, something should be done to provide such parking space.  I believe that just ground floor space, or street level space, is not sufficient to cater for the very large number of cars normally around the city centre at the present time and action will have to be taken to provide parking space, with perhaps one or two floors to which the cars can be lifted, while the owners are doing their business in the city centre.</P>
    <P>There is, as everybody knows, a considerable amount of congestion on Butt Bridge at the moment.  For vehicle drivers coming from the Sandymount area, or eastern portion of the city, and going to the north side of the city, the nearest crossing point is Butt Bridge. The result is that there are very long delays now in the movement of traffic across Butt Bridge, either from the north or from the south.  It is essential to provide as soon as possible another bridge across the Liffey, somewhere below Butt Bridge.  Suggestions have been made that a tunnel should be provided under the Liffey, but it might interfere with shipping and perhaps it would be possible to provide a bridge across the Liffey which would relieve the situation so far as Butt Bridge is concerned.  It is becoming a hopeless position.  If motorists cannot cross Butt Bridge, they have to try to cross O'Connell Bridge and the result is great difficulty for people in crossing either O'Connell Bridge or Butt Bridge at the busy times.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion during this debate regarding driving tests. Most of us are in favour of these driving tests because thereby an awareness will be created amongst motor vehicle drivers that they are only entitled to share the road and that they should not take more of the road than they are entitled to, because the other fellow is <Col N="1273" /> also entitled to his share.  We have a situation at the present time in which no questions are asked.  A person merely goes in with a £1 note and fills up a driving licence application form. He says his eyesight, hearing and limbs are not defective.  If he is not under 21 years, he is not asked for the date and year of birth and, having paid the £1, he gets a driving licence, whether he is able to drive a motor vehicle or not.</P>
    <P>In these modern times, with such dense traffic, these driving tests should be brought in, particularly for people who previously have not held a licence. It would be a start, and then at a later stage, perhaps, people who are disqualified from driving, or have had their licences withdrawn for one reason or other could be compelled to undergo a driving test before the licence is restored.I am not in favour of the suggestion that persons who are accused of being under the influence of drink when driving should be submitted to a blood test.  I feel it is an assault forcibly to take a sample of blood from a person when, in fact, it is merely sought to prove that that person is intoxicated. I am very much in favour of the breath test where a person is compelled to breathe into a container and it is then subjected to a test to decide the measure of intoxication and whether the driver who was under the influence of drink was, in fact, also incapable of driving.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention is that the new regulations in relation to the lighting of vehicles are very useful and I am glad to see that a regulation has now been made to ensure that the rear lights on bicycles will be visible to motorists.  Motorists have the experience that a cyclist cannot be picked out in the dark, even by the headlights of a car, if there is any mud or dust on the reflector of the machine.  The result is the cyclist is at a very great disadvantage if he is not noticed by a motorist.  The provision of these rear lights will certainly make driving safer for motorists and will also make the position safer for the cyclists themselves.  Very strict action should be taken against persons on the road, whether cyclists or vehicle owners, for breaches of the lighting <Col N="1274" /> regulations.  Only too often do we see groups of cyclists moving nonchalantly through the streets without lights on their bicycles and in some cases without even their hands on the handlebars.  If more serious action were taken regarding lights on bicycles, I think it would reduce the number of accidents.</P>
    <P>I feel that something will have to be done about the provision of a main traffic line further up from O'Connell Bridge.  There seems to be a very urgent need for a traffic line below Butt Bridge in order to ease the situation there.  I feel also we shall have to have a good main traffic line above Butt Bridge.  The narrow Capel Street is not capable of coping with the heavy volume of traffic going across that bridge.  We shall have to make an arrangement whereby traffic will be diverted to cross further up through the city.</P>
    <P>I have been in a number of continental cities.  What struck me most was the very orderly traffic there.  One explanation, as far as I could see, was that there was a very good scheme of one-way traffic.  Vehicles were not meeting on the narrower streets when there was one-way traffic.  It may be possible in Dublin city to devise a scheme of one-way traffic, particularly in our smaller streets, which will make traffic easier and certainly safer for the people on the footpaths or crossing streets because they will know that the vehicles are coming from only one direction.</P>
    <P>The recent Road Traffic Act will make a very valuable contribution towards road safety.  However, it will be useless if the regulations are not imposed by the authorities and adhered to by those for whom they were designed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the repeated flooding in my constituency. We all admit that the recent flooding was exceptional.  We were told that nothing could have been done to prevent it.  Many of my constituents disagree with that outlook completely. They believe that, with proper planing, a good deal of the flooding could have been prevented and that if the <Col N="1275" /> maintenance of the water disposal service was properly carried out a great deal of the damage suffered by citizens could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>If we had a better sense of citizenship from those who carelessly add to the difficulty by throwing litter on the road, thereby choking up the gullies, it would help enormously.  The gullies and gully traps round my constituency have been very badly neglected over the years.  There is no improvement whatever, as far as I can observe, even from what I saw this morning.</P>
      <P>It is known by people living in many of these districts that if any heavy rainfall occurs some of the houses will again be flooded.  So much is that in the minds of these people that many of them keep a supply of sandbags in order to prevent the water from entering their houses.  It is deplorable that these people&mdash;the best of citizens&mdash;who have invested their life savings in their property should find, after a short period of residence, that the house they purchased is a very bad investment indeed from the point of comfort and health.</P>
      <P>The time has come when drastic steps must be taken to deal with the problem of litter.  The condition of our roads in Dublin city and county is a national disgrace and it is becoming very much worse.  Without question, this year it is worse than it has ever been.  A very serious effort must be made to cope with this problem.  It is not sufficient to make an ordinary appeal to good citizenship.  Legislation will have to be introduced to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Then, again, we have an antiquated system of refuse collection.  If it happens to be a windy day, the litter being delivered from the bins into the refuse cars is blown around the place. Every time the litter is collected the condition of the roads is disgusting.  It involves additional hardship also on the men employed on this work.  I was glad to see the other day that some kind of a new van is being inspected. That will be a great improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the refuse lorry, there is the question of the bins themselves.  I was standing at a bus stop on the <Col N="1276" /> quays not so long ago on a windy day. The procedure was that one man came along and lifted the lids of the bins so as to have them ready for the man who would carry them to the refuse lorry.  The moment the lids were lifted the streets were littered with the contents of the bins.  This matter should be considered very carefully.  I doubt if it is beyond the genius of the men in the various Departments to find a better means of transferring the refuse from houses to the lorries.  I appeal to the Minister to bring this matter once more to the notice of the local authorities to get all to make a genuine effort to put an end to this very serious complaint.</P>
    <P>Within recent years, I notice the increase in the number of houses being erected on sites below the road level. Why this is tolerated I do not know.  I think the town planning authorities should prohibit the building of houses where the entrance is at a serious incline because these houses are the first to be flooded.  People who have purchased such houses told me that their condition is so bad that they constantly have to lift the floorboards and in many cases do not nail them back because they know they are going to suffer a recurrence of the flooding. Again, I would ask the Minister to draw the attention of the town planning officers to this problem of houses which are nicely built and very costly but not fit for people to occupy.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the question of the roads and footpaths around Dublin.  I do not know of a single road or a footpath that is in proper condition. Vast sums of moneys are being spent on these services and the concrete is hardly set when the local authority begin to rip it up again.  Even in Dún Laoghaire, the gateway to Ireland, complaints have been made to me of beautiful footpaths being made with concrete slabs, which a few months later are ripped up, not taken up.  I thought that when footpaths were laid with slabs, we would not have the spectacle of the solid footpaths being ripped up and then being replaced by concrete patchwork or strips of tarred gravel.</P>
    <P>In these cases where the concrete slabs are torn up, the footpaths will <Col N="1277" /> never be right again.  As an instance of this, we need go no further than Kildare Street where, at the present time, those concrete slabs are being ripped up and utterly destroyed.  I brought these points to the attention of the Minister before and I would ask him as earnestly as possible to convey them to those responsible in the local authorities so that in future such complaints will not have to be raised in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been discussed and debated here over these past few weeks that it is very difficult, not only to reply to the many points raised, but to remember some of the things said.  In some cases it might be a good thing if they were not remembered.The first thing I wish to do is to put myself on record as condemning the attack made by Deputy Hogan on the Secretary of my Department in connection with a charge that should never have been made.  If that attack were to be made, it should have been made on me and not on the chief officer of my Department.  Mine is the responsibility and it is on my head only that members should thrust their condemnation.</P>
      <P>So far as the complaint itself is concerned, I can find no basis for it.  I know the Secretary of my Department did not himself receive any such letter personally from Deputy Hogan nor can we find in any of the sections of the Department that normally deal with such matters any record whatever of any such letter, let alone two or three letters.  I think Deputy Hogan's conduct in attacking the Secretary of my Department was disorderly in the extreme and that it was impertinent for him to do so.  I wish to emphasise very strongly that when Deputy Hogan, or any other Deputy, has a complaint to make, he should refrain from making that complaint by attacking the head of my Department or any of my staff as such.  Any such complaint or attack should be directed at me as the running of the Department is my responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am completely satisfied that all the charges made against the Secretary of <Col N="1278" /> the Department were unfounded and I want to go on record as asserting that that official is one of the finest officers in the Civil Service, and that he has given excellent service not only to me and to this Government but to any other Government with whom he was concerned.  I am satisfied that he will continue to do this, despite the disorderly conduct of Deputy Hogan who is probably only a bird of passage through this House and a bird of very short passage at that.</P>
    <P>I also want to place on record my regret at omitting, in my rather lengthy introductory speech, any reference to the library service.  I am afraid it got knocked out in the welter of other figures and statistics.  Let me say now that the Library Council was reconstituted on 1st January last and that so far as I am aware, the newly-constituted Council is doing good work and looks as if it will do a really good job. That is my experience and my hope. Grants are now available for major library improvements and they can also be devoted towards augmenting the book stocks in so far as scientific and industrial works are concerned. The demand under this head is not expected to be very great this year but no doubt there will be a growing demand for assistance by way of the new grants which will be available from my Department, on the recommendation of the Library Council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones raised the matter of the payments of grants to tenants for repair and reconstruction.  These grants are, in fact, payable at present and the only requirement is the consent of the landlord.  That is a normal, reasonable requirement.  Associated with this is the question of whether or not grants should be available to local authorities in respect of certain works on their own housing.  I had already indicated to the National Building Agency some weeks ago that it was my intention to have the necessary action taken to enable such grants to be paid to local authorities in respect of their houses just as in respect of other houses.  It is still my intention to do this in the immediate future.</P>

I think one of the circulars in question was dated 10th December, 1962 and in that case the authorities were requested specifically to make the relevant extracts available to their elected members.  So far as I am concerned, those extracts were made available but if Deputy Tully or any other Deputy knows of any local authority which did not do so and if he lets me know, I shall take appropriate steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The Minister would not consider suspending them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not even Deputy Tully would suggest suspension in this case.  Deputy Desmond suggests it is essential to have a housing inspector in every centre and he said that if we had, it would be very convenient for people to call on him and make their cases.  No doubt it would be convenient, but on the other hand, we have 14 county areas divided for administrative purposes under the inspectorial scheme.  The inspectors, as every Deputy knows, spend by far the greater part of their time travelling from house to house and inspecting the various jobs.  They would not normally be available at any fixed address if they were doing the job intended to be done by them and so the suggestion would not work out, as, <Col N="1280" /> most often if you went to the address where the inspector should be, you would be unlikely to find him.  Also, the volume of work fluctuates from time to time and from district to district.When that happens, it is essential to move an inspector into another area where there is an unusual upswing.This process occurs periodically and frequently.  If we had fixed centres, which I do not think are feasible for the reasons stated, the inspectors would be absent at times when they were moved to other areas temporarily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also complains about estimates for reconstruction and repair based on out-of-date prices. There has been a complete overhaul of pricing for reconstruction work and the present list was prepared as recently as May, 1962.  As Deputies know, if and when an estimate exceeds £420, it does not matter so far as the grant element is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is out-of-date grants he was talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it was reconstruction estimates.  He complained of the method of pricing and arriving at estimates which had an adverse affect on the amount of the grant.  He mentioned a job of £400-£500 being priced at £700 but once the total estimated cost goes to £420 or higher, no greater grant can be obtained as the maximum is already earned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I do not concede the prices are wrong.  I say that on the basis of the arguments made if the example given by Deputy Desmond had any validity, the pricing does not affect the grant, which is what he complained about.  In fact, these pricings are as recent as 1962.  Prior to that, they were probably operating a list that was to some extent out of date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; unless I grow old where I am at the moment, they will <Col N="1281" /> hardly run as far as they did prior to 1962.  I take it the Deputy understands what I am conveying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not satisfied even on the basis that they are as recent as 1962, that the prices are equal to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assert they are equal to the cost but I agree that they are far from being contract prices.  They are nearer the cost than the contract prices obtainable at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones referred to the need for investigation and research into methods of roadbuilding.  My engineering advisers and those concerned with roads on the technical side constantly keep in touch with all the latest developments and research elsewhere in regard to road construction and related matters.  Recently, I am sure the Deputy noted with satisfaction that the question of undertaking a programme of independent Irish road research has become a live issue and that as announced, the Institute for Industrial Research, helped by the very generous offer of the Dunlop Company, supported by Shell and BP, is about to tackle the many problems that we have been aware of for a considerable time. That, together with the normal approach and keeping our eyes and ears open and being fully documented on all developments elsewhere, should ensure that we are kept up-to-date in the matter of roadmaking for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P. Brennan and others raised the matter of blizzard conditions and what we were proposing to do about them so that we might be better prepared in the future.  For a considerable time past, my Department, and the officers of other Departments directly concerned in this matter, have been considering what might be done.  They have drawn up certain recommendations and these have been incorporated in a circular letter from my Department to the various local authorities advising them as to what steps they should take and promising them all the guidance and help my Department and other Departments may be able to give them.  I trust that <Col N="1282" /> information now will allay any fears that we are not prepared, in so far as it is possible to prepare, for unusual conditions.  The various steps are outlined and, if the advice is followed, there is no reason why we should not be fairly well prepared.  We hope, of course, that the need to use the advice will not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond and others asked if it is a fact that an inspector reports on matters other than the specific matters complained of in relation to a council house or cottage prior to vesting.The inspector is not debarred from reporting on all matters relevant to the condition of the house. Inspectors have, in fact, reported on many occasions on matters outside of those immediately complained of and, where they have so reported, determinations have been made accordingly, even in regard to matters not mentioned at all by the appellant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney stated he was not satisfied with the co-ordination and co-operation between local authorities and groups desirous of implementing group water schemes.  He believed such groups should get every possible encouragement from local authorities. I am in entire agreement with that view.  So far as my Department is concerned, we will do all we can to smooth out any difficulties which may exist as between a group and its local authority.  We shall be only too happy to bend all our energies in that direction and give whatever help we can to bring about the desired co-operation and co-ordination, without which our water programme cannot proceed as expeditiously as we all desire.</P>
    <P>As usual, Deputy McQuillan complained, though the grouse was perhaps longer and there was more wailing in it on this occasion, about the county road improvement problem in Roscommon.This problem is not, of course, confined to Roscommon. Deputy McQuillan did not give the full facts when he instanced the amount his county gets by way of grant.  He did not state that over the past ten or 12 years a number of additional miles of county road has been taken on annually in the county. He suggested that these roads should <Col N="1283" /> rank for an appropriate share of whatever moneys are going.  That would be a fair proposition, were it not for the fact that, if this were done, other counties which acted with a certain amount of prudence in relation to the moneys at their disposal would find themselves penalised, while, at the same time, those which had not exercised the same degree of prudence would actually find themselves rewarded.I am not prepared to recommend that what Deputy McQuillan suggested should be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan gloated slightly &mdash;he is, of course, quite adept at that, though he does not have much to gloat about&mdash;over Deputy Noel Lemass having expressed horror at a six months' delay in 1956.  He said that he could cite a good example of an even longer delay in dealing with a CPO in Cork.  He misquoted Deputy Lemass in working up this effective gloat. Deputy Lemass was not complaining about a delay in a particular case in 1956.  He was horrified at the idea of a nationwide stoppage taking place by order of the then Government in regard to every job on hands at the time.  Deputy O'Sullivan will have to strain himself to bursting point to find any similar precedent in regard to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney described a very moving situation; he said that there are three families comprising 18 persons living in an unserviced rural cottage.  They cannot get a house because, he alleged, they will not get the two-thirds subsidy.  Now that is just not so.  The two-thirds subsidy can be paid on compassionate grounds in certain cases and, if what the Deputy says is true, the case he cited is one that could be regarded as a compassionate case.  I do not know of my own knowledge if the facts are as he stated. Perhaps Deputy Rooney would give me further details.  If there is anything I can do to remedy the situation, I shall be only too happy to help.</P>
    <P>Dangerous quarries were mentioned. I met a deputation from the Dublin County Council in regard to these last June.  We were all agreed that <Col N="1284" /> something should be done to prevent further loss of life, not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  It was agreed that officers of my Department and officers of the county council would get together to see what might be recommended immediately and what might be proposed as a long-term solution.  I can now say that the Government have approved, and have authorised me to confirm to this House, the preparation of legislative proposals making it possible for local authorities to enter on and carry out these necessary works of closing up dangerous quarries and sites of quarries.I am also empowered to say that the derelict sites grants scheme may be applied in this direction, that there will not be any charge on the owner of the land on which the quarry is situated in respect of whatever the closing off costs may be, and that we may authorise local councils forthwith to act on the basis that such legislation is in fact forthcoming and that they will be retrospectively covered in respect of any such expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady mentioned flooding about which, naturally, all of us are concerned, particularly the very severe circumstances which obtained not so very long ago, spoiling property and rendering it less valuable and upsetting the occupiers of newly-built, costly houses.  It is not true to say that nothing could have been done about this. Deputy Brady pointed out that better planning, for instance, better maintenance and in the final analysis, better citizenship could have done an amount about it.  Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council are all concerned to prevent similar occurrences and in so far as my Department and I are concerned, we shall do anything we can to help.  At the moment all I can do&mdash; and it is not of any great help to the people immediately concerned&mdash;is to sympathise with them.  Of course I can also say that the local bodies, together with the Department, are anxious to take steps to prevent a recurrence of flood damage.</P>
    <P>Another matter that ran through the debate in its earlier weeks&mdash;certainly <Col N="1285" /> in its earlier days&mdash;was the amazing propensity of certain Opposition Deputies who are members of local authorities, as if they were untouchable, to criticise their local authorities roundly and then, illogically, wind up by blaming the Minister for all the ills they had blamed on their own local authorities.  By and large, they behaved in a rather childish and illogical way.  I was accused of criticising local authorities unduly.  I do not mind being criticised because I believe criticism helps to bring out many circumstances that may need ventilation, but I do object to certain members of this House and members of local authorities, as soon as I as Minister for Local Government open my mouth, criticising me for casting aspersions on any local authority.  I have a very great deal to do with local authorities, but as soon as I say anything that can be interpreted as casting the slightest aspersion on a local authority, immediately the very same people who criticised that local authority get up on my back and say that I have no right to do it.</P>
    <P>I have a perfect right to do it and I shall do it, if and when I see it is called for.  In so far as the criticism of me for allegedly criticising local authorities in the recent past is concerned, all I can say to local authorities who feel from the speech I recently made that they have been criticised, is that if the cap fits them, they may wear it but it was not intended for those who do not fit the cap.  Any reasonable member of the Opposition, inside or outside the House, who reads what I said will clearly see I was not casting aspersions on all and sundry of our local authorities in regard to any particular matter, but in regard to certain things which do apply to a relative minority of our local authorities, and if they want to squeal about it, they are branding themselves as they could not be branded by any indication of mine.</P>
    <P>The greatest dissertation we heard for all time came from Deputy Ryan who made a terrific attack on the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee.It would have sounded very well, were it not for the fact that we were <Col N="1286" /> enlightened to a very great degree by the vivid picture given by a colleague of his on that committee who has attended all their meetings and who could point out from the records of that committee that Deputy Ryan was seldom seen at these meetings.  Yet he was able here to criticise all they were doing.  That is the type of criticism I do not feel deserves any worthwhile, if any, answer.  It would be but wasting the time of the House.  Deputy Sherwin's references to that matter are far more effective than anything Deputy Ryan had to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Ryan is a member of the Housing Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; it was not that he was a member of the Housing Committee but that he was a member of a Party who had so many members on the committee who never turned up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They obviously recognised Deputy Sherwin's worth.  There was no necessity for anybody else to be there, surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall leave that on the record.  In so far as the general position is concerned, I feel I may have left out points raised by several Deputies, but if they draw my attention to them I shall deal with them.  If I have done so, I am sorry.  The Fine Gael Party tabled a motion which I submit was purely a political gambit at the beginning of the open season, so to speak, before we came back after the recess.  The Special Committee which is sought in that motion is, to my mind, unnecessary for the reason that in fact we are aware in the Department of what the causes of the present housing shortage are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, from our experience over the past months and from the returns of the survey instituted in 1960, we are in a better position more expeditiously to show the way in which houses may be provided more quickly than would be the case if a Special Committee were set up.  Such a Committee would take some time to get together, would require quite a lot of documentation and would finally be <Col N="1287" /> likely to come up with findings we ourselves in the Department have arrived at already and about which action is being taken.  If the Committee were regarded as being desirable and were appointed, the only purpose it could have is to delay the very matters it was set up to expedite.  I can see no useful purpose whatsoever it would serve in the circumstances of the moment.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Seán Dunne's motion is concerned, in which he seeks a special housing authority which would cover the entire area, I think it is only necessary to point out that the city and county of Dublin at the moment have one administrative head. We can surely expect that with the one administrative head over the two regions, we must get the ultimate in co-operation since it is within the authority, the ambit and the power of this man to ensure that this co-operation is forthcoming.  I am sure there is nobody on the staffs of either of the two bodies who does not wish for this co-operation and who will not do everything to ensure that whatever good can come from such co-operation will in fact emerge.</P>
    <P>I can see no useful purpose in this motion.  Furthermore I do not agree with the sideswiping at the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee for the good reason that the Housing Committee does not require any legislation of this House to wipe it out.  It is a subsidiary of the Dublin Corporation and if it were the case that it could be wiped out, then the case would surely have to be made that it is the Corporation that should be wiped out or, alternatively, that the Corporation should be advised and influenced to wipe out their own committee.  That can be done without any legislation or any help from us and if Deputy Dunne bends his energy in that direction, no doubt he will succeed in convincing the Dublin Corporation that their committee is as useless as he says it is. Quite candidly, I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello made a very eloquent and flowing speech, beautifully prepared, no doubt, in the way <Col N="1288" /> these people in the legal profession are used to in talking to a brief.  As I sat here listening to him, I could not but admire the eloquence and the persuasive tone of his talk.  I might even have gone out of here in somewhat of a haze, believing what this Fine Gael front bencher, for the time being at any rate, had to say, were it not for the fact that immediately on his heels came Deputy Sherwin who, without any eloquence or persuasiveness, completely and absolutely shattered Deputy Costello's case.  In a few abrupt and probably rough sentences, he hit the bull's eye and immediately I was brought back to reality.  I was glad because I should hate to be misled to the degree I was being misled by Deputy Costello, and I asked myself the question: How does this whole shattering of the case take place?  It is obvious, of course, that Deputy Sherwin knows what he is talking about, has experience of what he was saying, and Deputy Costello knows nothing whatever about it except what he read or heard from somebody else. That is the difference between the two Deputies, and let me hear any time those who know what they are talking about, no matter how they may put it, rather than those who put it well and knew nothing about the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, who was followed parrotlike by a few others, said the Government were directly responsible for the housing problem which had developed.  He quoted from the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> of November, 1958, which, he said, indicated that spending on these building and sanitary services was to be reduced in the following years and that, in fact, that is what has taken place, that it was the deliberate policy of the Government from as early as 1958 to depress building to the degree that we created a shortage.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figures for 1958-59 which would be the relevant time of the announcement of this first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> In 1958-59, £4.6 million was issued from the Local Loans Fund for housing; in 1962-63 that figure has risen strangely, and despite the assertions of Deputy Costello, to £7.4 million.  It <Col N="1289" /> should also be noted that public expenditure on all building and construction during the period 1958-59 to 1963-64 has risen from £10.22 million to £21.44 million, again surely giving the lie entirely to the assertion that we depressed spending in line with what might have been foreshadowed in this first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Indeed let me say that the success of this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is probably itself one of the great causes of the upsurge in actual spending, the figures for which I have now quoted, and more of that I will mention in a moment.</P>
    <P>Let me refer also to other charges that were made, not necessarily by Deputy Costello.  I have been blamed and the Government have been blamed for a slowing down in housing.  The charges were made against me that I told the local authorities to slow down and it has even been suggested that some four or five years ago I had been indicating to the public that house building in this country was completed.  I want to refute all those charges completely and categorically.  Not only that, but I want to say that I never was, and I am not now, of the opinion that house building is finished in this country.  In fact, it never will be finished while the country is a living entity.  House building will never be finished here unless the country is to be completely abandoned and we all get out and go somewhere else.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned in this question, my views can be found on record quite a few years back and before any of the wise guys, as Deputy Sherwin called them, came along, as they have in the last couple of years, to start crying about not enough houses being built.  If they wish to go back a few years further than that, I can be found on record as saying that house building was not completed and that we had a huge job in regard to rehousing our people in rural Ireland, particularly the small farmers. That was before we got down to eliciting by way of survey what was the actual position as it has now proved to be.</P>
    <P>Let us go back and try to find out <Col N="1290" /> how the public mind could have been brought to believe that house building was almost at an end.  As far back as I can go to where that rumour could have started would be to the days of my predecessor, Deputy O'Donnell, the then Minister for Local Government, and the days of the then Minister for Finance when he found himself up against a financial crisis at the beginning of 1957.  If there was a start to this story and to these rumours that house building had almost been completed, that start was made by Deputy O'Donnell, then Minister for Local Government, perpetuated by Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance, and circulated abroad by God knows how many adherents of those Parties who formed the Coalition Government, then about to collapse.  I believe that that was the start of the plan to make the public believe they did not need any more houses.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that in the last dying days of that Coalition Government, money was not available for house building as it is available today?  Is it not true that in those last months and even in the last weeks of that Government, there were sessions held at which local authorities were advised that they would not get sanction for any new schemes of any kind whatever unless they were absolutely necessary and that in so far as their commitments up to date were concerned, only those actually entered into, and from which they could not withdraw, would be financed by the central Government?</P>
    <P>It is also true that in the last weeks of that Government, they did not have the money to meet even those limited categories; yet those are the people who come in here and talk about there not being enough houses and about a Government allegedly depressing the building of houses to save themselves and the Exchequer money.  I assert what I have asserted on numerous occasions both inside and outside the House, that no housing, no scheme of housing, or no single house that came to me for approval, by way of contract or tenant, has been held up by me, or my Department, or the Government because of lack of funds over the past six and a half years.  That is the <Col N="1291" /> situation and it can be compared with the situation that had to be met behind the scenes by my predecessors in office in 1956 and in the early weeks of 1957.  The allegation in regard to the Government's or my telling local authorities to go slow is completely and absolutely untrue but it is true of our predecessors in office.  They did tell them to go slow and in fact told them not to go at all because there was no money to meet what they were doing.</P>
    <P>To show that these assertions are not just empty assertions on my part, I can say, in addition to quoting the figures for expenditure on housing from the Local Loans Fund over these relevant years, and also the figures for total expenditure on building and construction, that it is also true that my Department has consistently over the past five or six years been doing everything possible to encourage local authorities to expand their services to the people. We have been making the way easier for them.  We have been bringing in new legislation.  We have been cutting out old procedures and substituting new ones which are less onerous.  All in all, these few matters, which I merely put down for record purposes, may serve to pinpoint what I am saying.</P>
    <P>In 1960, for instance, we asked for a housing survey.  I had a fair idea of what that survey was going to show. Without the figures, however, I knew it would be impossible for this House or the Government to approve plans to remedy a situation which I thought existed but of which I had no proof. Now we have the proof and shortly there will be a remedy in regard to unfit small farmers' houses throughout the country.  You may remember also in 1960 the furore there was about having to come to my Department to justify the need for particular houses. I said to the managers: &ldquo;You can decide as managers; you take the responsibility and you do not have to come and convince us that this person or that person needs a house.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the managers, especially in regard to cottages, are afraid to take that risk because they will not know until the cottage has been built whether or not they will get the two-thirds or the one-third subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have our dilemmas and we do not always find a Father Christmas to come along and make things easy for us and take responsibility for them.  This responsibility was given locally because there was a complaint of undue hold-up in regard to housing schemes.  It has been shown during the past few years that it can be and is being dealt with locally and I am not aware in a general way that managers cannot or are afraid to exercise their responsibility or that they are afraid if they do, they will get their heads in a sling with either the council or the Minister.  If it can be shown that there is complete stalemate in regard to a particular manager not being able to carry out his responsibilities, then I can consider what it is necessary to do to remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>For the moment, I am not aware of any such situation.  Again, in 1961 a request went out to the local authorities to service rural cottages.  I <Col N="1293" /> do not think anybody really disagrees with the intention behind that.  It could not be taken as being indicative of the Government's intention to cut down building.  In 1962, we told the public about the new Housing Loans and Grants Act.  In December of that year, I addressed the master builders and told them that we were living in new times and facing new problems in their field which demanded new methods.  I told them I was looking to them and to people in the same business and with the same interests to set about, in a positive way, doing something about this matter of new methods to meet new problems in the new times in which we were living.  Although it is not long ago, I am not really disappointed, but rather sad that so far we have not had any great evidence that there will emanate from within our own shores and from the members of our own building and construction companies and allied traders any worthwhile new solutions to our present day problems.  That is not to say that I am despondent or think that they may not yet come forward with some new ideas that will be well worthwhile.  Indeed, I am looking forward and hoping that they will do so.</P>
      <P>On the side of legislation, in 1958&mdash; remember, this is the year in which the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published from which Deputy Costello quoted figures which, according to him, would indicate that we were going to depress and did depress building thereafter&mdash;the Housing (Amendment) Act was introduced which increased the range of the grant and loan facilities for private housing. Deputies will remember the details.  It is not necessary for me to outline them. The fact is that it was a significant year and a significant move, in so far as housing legislation is concerned, to encourage more building rather than less building, as Deputy Costello suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again on the side of legislation, there was the Housing Loans and Grants Act, 1962, which was a consolidation measure and included, for the first time, grants for the housing of old people, special grants, special <Col N="1294" /> prototype grants and grants for the temporary preservation of houses for a limited period.  It also took power to revise the SDA loan limits.  All of those things surely are an indication of the continuing trend of the Government's policy to expand and to encourage and to create more spending in the building trade because of the fact that we needed those houses both on the private and the local authority side.</P>
    <P>The subsidisable limits of local authority houses were raised in 1962, that is, over a year ago, before there were any motions put down by the Fine Gael Party or Deputy Dunne or before any such storm was being kicked up as they have been attempting to kick up during the past month. This raising of the subsidisable limits meant that we increased the limit from £2,000 to £2,500 for a flat; from £1,500 to £1,650 for a serviced cottage and from £1,000 to £1,100 for a nonserviced cottage&mdash;in other words, an all-round increase of 10 per cent.  This, again, continued the trend, I might say, the happy trend for any Minister for Local Government, of the Government's policy to encourage still further, where feasible and where possible, by these incentives, the building of more houses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>During the same period, there was the record which I shall give in regard to sanitary services.  Everybody would like to say that he agrees with the expanded programme in this matter.  I do not think anybody disagrees with it overall.  Some people may have their own detailed small criticisms but by and large they are very few and very odd persons who will disagree with the idea of trying to make available in the widest possible manner piped water and to follow it up with proper sewerage systems for all of our people in whatever part of the country they may live.</P>
    <P>In 1956, there were roughly, in round figures, about £1 million worth of schemes under the sanitary services head, both water and sewerage, in progress.  Today the amount represented by schemes actually in progress is in excess of £5 million and today also, side by side with that £5 million, as an indication that it is not merely <Col N="1295" /> a flash in the pan that will disappear as soon as this work is finished, there is a further £4½ million of work under sanitary services at the tender stage and overall there are 919 new schemes, costing approximately £30 million, being planned and of this £30 million there is £12 million worth of work well advanced.</P>
    <P>If that is not a definite and concrete indication of the Government's intention, which is the reverse of what Deputy Costello alleges, then I do not know what is.  They are figures which cannot be denied.  There is £5 million worth of schemes in progress; £4.5 million worth at the tender stage; £30 million overall being planned, of which £12 million worth is actually well advanced.Side by side with that, of course, we had various other small schemes introduced, all of them intended to improve the environment of our people throughout the country, such as the Derelict Sites Act, on the legislation side, which was followed by the derelict sites grant scheme, to which we welded the amenity scheme. Then there was our encouragement of the provision of swimming pools by local authorities for the benefit of our people and the enjoyment and education of our young people.</P>
    <P>These things all came along at the various stages and were introduced, financed, and actually going&mdash;with costs being incurred currently under all heads&mdash;despite the allegations about a slow-down and instructions to stop going ahead which are made against us by Deputy Costello on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We also, of course, had improved borrowing provisions brought in to reduce the difficulties of local authorities in borrowing money for their various needs.  The Act was the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960.  As a result, no mortgages are now required by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities can now get loan instalments direct, as required, which they could not do heretofore.  This, overall, has had the effect of streamlining the procedure, making it less onerous on local authorities and less difficult <Col N="1296" /> and less time-wasting when they were about to do a job for which they wished to raise money through the borrowing process.</P>
    <P>Also&mdash;and this is probably the biggest thing of all, although it was not so treated by many local authorities&mdash; there is the survey for the continuance and completion of which we have had to make repeated requests since 1960 &mdash;a survey of the unfit houses in this country, a survey which would at least once, if not for all time, give us a clear picture as to what the situation is in regard to the entire housing stock. We have been three years plugging that and it has taken continuous plugging to get the local authorities to co-operate.I do not think they fully appreciated the value this survey could have.  I think they do not fully appreciate that without a true assessment of the position it would be impossible for any Minister for Local Government or, indeed, any Government to justify the remedies which we in fact will be proposing to the House in the very near future.  If they had appreciated it I do not believe they would have been as lax in coming forward with their figures as they have been. Now that they know that these figures are of some real worth to us, as are the early figures from them and the additional information we are getting from the 1961 census, I feel we will get, and I hope we will get, a much quicker reaction to any request for such information in future.  Without this information it is not possible to design a proper scheme to meet the needs that may be thrown up and it certainly would not be possible to justify the expenditure envisaged without proof of the need for it.</P>
    <P>In regard to these surveys, of course, it is our intention in future that there will not be this start and stop business in so far as building generally and house-building are concerned.  We would hope&mdash;it is certainly my hope&mdash; that from the information we are gaining through these surveys and the census we will be able to indicate to local authorities the method by which they should draw up their immediate building programme, which probably would be a five-year programme, and <Col N="1297" /> their long-term programme, which probably would be a 20 year programme.Both such programmes will be necessary if we are to avoid a repetition in any part of the country of the shortage of houses that we are now experiencing in Dublin city.  Programming is vitally necessary to avoid this situation.  It is vitally necessary to ensure that those engaged in the building trade will be assured of work by a programme for five years ahead, and indeed that they have a long-term programme of 20 years, so they can weigh the prospects for the future.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Telefís Éireann: Supply of Information by Minister&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the attitude of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in declining to supply important information to Deputies as to the activities of Telefís Éireann is contrary to the assurances given by the Minister during the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959; Dáil Éireann, therefore, calls on the Government to arrange that all reasonable information will be supplied by the Minister to Deputies when requested.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of Telefís Éireann, there have been many complaints from Deputies to the effect that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refuses to supply certain information when requested to do so, especially by Deputies in the Opposition Parties.  This motion has been tabled by the Labour Party because we believe it right that the Minister should supply reasonable information to the House and, through the House, to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from certain sections, the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1960, had a relatively easy passage through the House.  The Minister's move to establish Telefís Éireann was generally acclaimed by Deputies from both sides. <Col N="1298" /> Deputies were pleased that the Minister had approached the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority in the manner in which he did.  He appeared to be a very reasonable Minister when piloting that Bill through both Houses. He gave certain assurances in regard to the establishment of Telefís Éireann, which were designed to dispel the doubts and fears expressed by Deputies from both sides.</P>
    <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that this refusal of the Minister to transmit certain information to the House is not peculiar to him.  What we find frustrating and what the people cannot understand is the reluctance, not alone of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but of other Ministers with responsibility for semi-State bodies, to divulge what we consider to be information the public want.</P>
    <P>When piloting the Bill through the House, the Minister assured us that the Government would be responsible for Telefís Éireann and that he, as their instrument in this House, would be responsible for Telefís Éireann to Deputies and the public outside.  The Minister and other members of the Government should make a reappraisal of the situation as far as semi-State organisations are concerned, particularly Telefís Éireann.  People with television sets subscribe £4 per annum, and will subscribe £5 per annum.  That money is not given to Telefís Éireann as such; the licences are issued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs through the various post offices throughout the country.  In fact, therefore, the people are paying the Government for this service.  Therefore, I do not think it unreasonable that the Minister should be expected to give some information, what we regard as reasonable information, to the public through Deputies who put down questions to him concerning Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a cliché to say&mdash;the Minister himself has said it many times and, no doubt, will say it again tonight&mdash;that nobody wants to interfere with the day-to-day affairs of Telefís Éireann.  Nobody wants to interfere with the day-to-day administration of CIE, Bord na Móna, the ESB <Col N="1299" /> or any of the other State companies. The complaint I make to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is in respect of all the State companies and the reluctance of the various Ministers to give information to the public.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any strong point about criticism of the type of programmes shown on Telefís Éireann, because I do not consider that I, as an individual, am a custodian of the public taste.  Therefore, it would be useless for me to criticise the Minister or the Authority for this or that programme, or to say whether the public want céilí music, cowboy films, sport, ballet or dance music.  Because public taste differs so much, the difficulty of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann is to try to suit the public generally and not to cater for one section alone.  If one were to make any general criticism of Telefís Éireann to the Minister, it is in respect of the proportion of live programmes as against canned programmes.I appreciate the difficulty of having an emphasis on live programmes because of their cost.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, the Minister said he had responsibility for the general type of programme shown on Telefís Éireann.  He is also charged with ensuring that Telefís Éireann will put on programmes that will not offend, that will encourage Irish culture and language, and so on.  Therefore, my general criticism to the Minister is that far too many canned programmes of an inferior type are shown.  I do not know the reason for this.  There may be a financial reason, as I have said; but one is inclined to suspect&mdash;this was mentioned during the debate on the Bill and I make no apology for mentioning it again now&mdash;the fact that there is at least one person in Telefís Éireann who has a financial interest in these things.</P>
    <P>I am posing the question whether or not the interest some people in Telefís Éireann have in these canned programmes is responsible for the preponderance of canned programmes and cheap American films.  I do not think the Minister can discount or discard the opinions he gets in this House with <Col N="1300" /> regard to either his Department or Telefís Éireann.  Whether anybody likes it or not the three Deputies who are now on the Fianna Fáil benches or the six or seven of us who are on this side of the House represent the views of the people.  As the people pay for Telefís Éireann, our views must be listened to.  I know the Taoiseach has not much regard for Dáil Éireann and has less regard for those of us who are in opposition, but whether he likes it or not there are so many people in County Wexford who elected me, so many people in Meath who elected Deputy Tully, so many people in Waterford who elected Deputy Lynch, so many in Cavan who elected Deputy Dolan, so many in Leix-Offaly who elected Deputy Egan&mdash;and Deputy McQuillan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is this: While we do not want to interfere unduly in Telefís Éireann, our opinions must be heard.  The Minister himself acknowledged that in the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, when, in reply to a contribution made by Deputy Dr. Browne, he said that in respect of any programme which offended the public taste in the country it was desirable that such a programme should be discussed in Dáil Éireann by way of a motion.  He said that in the heel of the hunt he was responsible for the overall policy of Telefís Éireann and for the overall presentation of the various plays, acts, discussions, music and all that sort of thing on Telefís Éireann.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned, our idea in bringing this motion before the House is to get the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to accept, and to act upon, the responsibility which he claimed he had for Telefís Éireann when he was piloting the Broadcasting Authority Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is charged in Section 26 of the Bill with producing an annual report which shall also include information on such particular aspect of the Authority's proceedings as the Minister may specify.  Now, Telefís Éireann has been in operation for <Col N="1301" /> practically two years and I should like to ask the Minister this particular question.Has he in the past two years asked Telefís Éireann to report to him on any aspect of the Authority's proceedings because I suspect that the Minister believes Telefís Éireann is going along swimmingly and there is no reason for him to interfere?  I think it is not so.  As the Minister has a responsibility, I think he should acquaint himself with the activities of Telefís Éireann and of the various people in it because, as I say, he is charged with that responsibility under the Act, and he accepted it, when the Act was being discussed in this House. Therefore, perhaps, he would be able to tell us whether or not he did, in fact, ask for any particular aspect of the Authority's proceedings to be included in the annual report of Radio Éireann, which embraces both Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have the third annual report in front of me.  It is, like all semi-State body reports, a very elaborate sort of document.  One would not imagine they were in the dire financial straits they pretend to be in when one considers the manner in which these documents are produced.  There is very little information in it which the people do not know already.  Granted there are some tables which show the hours devoted to news, public affairs, comedy, westerns, documentaries and all that sort of thing, but, generally speaking, so far as I can see, it is merely an effort to fill up so many pages in order to comply with the legislation that they must produce an annual report.  There is one thing which intrigues me, something to which I shall refer later, but I should like to read an extract from page 9 of the report which says:</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, requires the Authority to be impartial in matters of public controversy.Such impartiality is fundamental to the concept of a national service; a complementary duty, which must equally be recognised, is to bring issues of controversy and debate before the public.  Freedom of the press is secured, very largely, by the existence of different journals of varying opinions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> That is very interesting in view of what happened recently.  I should like to come back again to the role of the Minister in Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  I refer to Deputy Dr. Browne's question to the Minister with regard to the raising of matters in Dáil Éireann.  I should like, therefore, to refer to col. 1575, vol. 180 of the Official Report dated 31st March, 1960.  First of all, let me quote the Minister at column 1575 in which he says:</P>
    <P>If it should happen that there be a television show that would not measure up to our standards, it would be necessary for the Minister, or the Government, to take immediate cognisance of that, and for the Authority itself to take cognisance of it and do something about it to make certain there would not be a repetition of shows that were substandard, so far as our ideas of good shows are concerned.</P>
    <P>He says &ldquo;it would be necessary for the Minister, or the Government, to take immediate cognisance of that&rdquo;. The invariable reply of the Minister is that he will not or he cannot interfere and he wants to allow the authorities in Telefís Éireann to make up their own minds and to use their own judgment.</P>
    <P>I had occasion, as a matter of fact, to bring to notice, by way of Parliamentary question, a film which I thought should not be shown on Telefís Éireann.  I must confess some of my colleagues on both sides of the House disagreed with me that it was an objectionable film.  Be that as it may, when I raised it with the Minister, he had not even seen it.  I do not think the Minister took the trouble to ask Telefís Éireann what the show was.  His whole attitude was that they have their own form of censorship in Telefís Éireann and he was not going to interfere with them.  That was contrary to what the Minister said here during the debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill.  He alleged there was some sort of liaison between Telefís Éireann and the Censorship Board but we have since discovered that there is no such liaison.  The Minister admitted, in this House, so far as censorship was <Col N="1303" /> concerned, that Telefís Éireann had their own brand of it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister had spoken about the responsibility of the Minister and the Government for shows which were considered to be objectionable, Deputy Dr. Browne asked:</P>
    <P>Will the Minister be responsible to the Dáil in that regard?</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply said:</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, the Government are responsible for the setting up of the Authority and we could not shed our responsibility in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said:</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister shall we be allowed to ask questions if we dislike a particular programme?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>It will be possible to have the matter brought to the attention of the Minister and to the attention of the Authority.  I would say there would not be anything to prevent a Deputy raising the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>The Official Report then continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins: By question?</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: It could be a motion.  Once the Government are responsible for the appointment of the members of the Authority, I do not see how they could shed any responsibility in that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Throughout that, I think there is a definite acceptance by the Minister of responsibility for things that happen in Telefís Éireann.  When the Minister invites Deputies to put down questions or to table motions the inference is that the Minister will answer them. Our experience over the past two years is that the Minister has refused to answer any but easy questions.  He will not answer the difficult ones.  If you ask him any of the difficult questions, he will say the matter is the responsibility of Telefís Éireann and that under <Col N="1304" /> the Act he is precluded from interfering in the day-to-day affairs of Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon did not see eye to eye with Deputy Dr. Browne or with the Minister.  He questioned the Minister on this and suggested it would be wrong for the Minister to interfere to the extent Deputy Dr. Browne thought he should interfere and that the Minister thought he and the Government could interfere.  In reply to Deputy Dillon's speech, in which he disagreed with Deputy Dr. Browne and with the Minister, the Minister had this to say, as reported at column 1578 of the Official Report, Vol. 180:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: I do not want any doubt to exist in regard to this matter.  When Deputy Dr. Browne asked the question, I assumed he was making reference to a programme that would be regarded by the people as generally objectionable.I was not dealing with any particular item in a programme, in a different class of a programme. Take a situation in which you would have a general objection expressed, say, at county council meetings or at other meetings at which our people come together, similar to a situation which developed recently as a result of a programme from another broadcasting service.  If such an objectionable programme were put out by our broadcasting service and our people took grave exception to it and so expressed themselves, I think it would be very hard for a Minister to resist a discussion on the matter in this House, a matter that was of vital interest and which so affected the moral standards of our people. It is true that the Authority will be an autonomous Authority and that the Minister will not have any interference whatsoever with the day-to-day programmes of that Authority but we have an over-riding responsibility to our people in the matter referred to by Deputy Dr. Browne. I think I would be failing in my duty to the House and to the country <Col N="1305" /> if I gave any type of answer other than the answer I have given to Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>That was that Deputy Dr. Browne could ask questions; that Deputy Dr. Browne or any Deputy could put down a motion about Telefís Éireann programmes.Our experience in the past two years has been that the Minister has decided he will not interfere in any way with the running of Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to say this now, without any disrespect to the Chair.  Whilst we are very annoyed and frustrated by the attitude of the Minister in refusing to answer these questions, I would point out that there are many other questions which the Ceann Comhairle, by reason of his judgment and in accordance with his interpretation of the Broadcasting Authority Act, has to refuse.</P>
    <P>The tone of the Minister in that debate on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, was that he was trying to be helpful.  Many controversial questions have been asked of the Minister with regard to Professor Williams, and so on.  However, questions have been asked here in good faith but for some reason the Minister refuses to answer them.  That is what annoys us more than anything else.  The impression given by the Minister to the House is that there is something to hide.  I do not think there may be much to hide in Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is a lot that can be hidden in every organisation and, maybe, every political Party.  However, the Minister gives the same impression as his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, which is that there is something to hide in relation to State companies.  I do not think he can allege that Deputies in their questions have been trying to pry unduly into the affairs of State companies or have been prying about individuals, and so on, in Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well able to answer the easy questions.  That shows up his inconsistency, as is the case with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, in relation to questions about State companies.  However, questions of general interest to Deputies <Col N="1306" /> and to the public will not be answered.  If you ask a question about the placing of contracts, and so on, you will get an answer if it is not controversial but you will get no reply to a question, say, asking about the filling of a post, whether it was by an examination, whether there was a competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many examples of the types of questions asked of the Minister.  I do not want to weary the House but some of this might be interesting.As reported at column 360, Volume 197 of the Official Report, in reply to Questions Nos. 127 and 128 by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Rooney in regard to the Irish language on Telefís Éireann, the Minister replied as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Hilliard: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen statements by various bodies and individuals regarding the use of the Irish language on Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>By the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, the Authority is given the maximum freedom regarding programmes and Section 17 places on it the obligation of bearing constantly in mind the national aim of restoring the Irish language and of endeavouring to promote the attainment of this aim.</P>
      <P>I believe the Authority should be given time to set up the service&mdash; the provincial transmitters are not yet in operation&mdash;and to explore all the possibilities, financial and otherwise, before it can reasonably be criticised for failure in any particular direction.  I know the Authority is concerned about the language position and has already noticeably increased the Irish content of the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That reply was made on 31st October, 1962.  I questioned the Minister on another occasion in regard to his <Col N="1307" /> obligations and those of the Authority under Section 17 of this Act.  I was pushed aside: the Minister had the utmost confidence in the Authority.</P>
    <P>Everybody must know the policy of the Labour Party in regard to the Irish language.  We do not want to see it treated as it has been treated and as it is still being treated, namely, from a compulsory point of view.  I believe Telefís Éireann is a good medium for the teaching of the language.In the past 12 months, the time given to the Irish language on Telefís Éireann was less than that given to it in the previous 12 months. I should like the Minister to check on that point.</P>
    <P>It is the stated policy of the Government to promote the Irish language. They have a duty to ensure that the best use is made of television and broadcasting for the promotion of the Irish language.  On Telefís Éireann, that is done admirably in many respects by many of its artistes.  Every Monday night there is the feature of a ventriloquist with a doll.  The doll speaks in Irish and the ventriloquist speaks in English.  I believe that that is one of the best methods available to the children of this country to learn Irish.  They could learn more Irish through such a programme than they could from any of the text books.  I do not want to talk about the Irish language tonight but I want to say that as far as Section 17 is concerned, the Minister seems to be reluctant to ensure that it is being properly operated by the Telefís Éireann Authority.</P>
    <P>I have many examples of the reluctance of the Minister to answer questions in the House about the Authority for which he has responsibility. On 4th April, 1962, in volume 194, column 1194 Deputy Dr. Browne asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>Whether in view of the recent report of the Royal College of Physicians which has established without doubt that cigarette smoking causes cancer of the lung he will use the powers available to him to direct Telefís Éireann to reject <Col N="1308" /> advertisements for cigarettes on their programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Official Report continues:</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne: The Minister has a certain moral responsibility to prevent the improper use of Telefís Éireann for advertisements.  Cigarettes are both dangerous and poisonous.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: The Oireachtas, in its wisdom, took that matter out of my hands and placed it in the hands of the Authority.</P>
    <P>That is cod.  I am not saying whether the Minister should or should not be in favour of these advertisements but what I do object to is his saying he has no responsibility.  That is too easy a role for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should read out all the questions I have here because every Deputy knows, particularly Deputy T. Lynch, of the frustration there is in asking either Deputy Childers or Deputy Hilliard to reply to questions regarding their Department.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is the interesting section of this Act.  Unfortunately, I have left it in my office but it talks about the presentation of views and the presentation of controversial subjects objectively and impartially.  Deputy Tully reminds me that the Minister in volume 180, column 1595 said:</P>
    <P>The Government will have to be reminded that in Section 18 the Authority is obliged to maintain impartiality in the presentation of news and public discussion.</P>
    <P>At that stage the Minister should blush.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that I am against political discussion on Telefís Éireann.  On the contrary, I should like to see much more of it, both on Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  But I would not be in favour of it in the manner in which it was presented on last Wednesday night week when Professor Desmond Williams was interviewed by one of <Col N="1309" /> the reporters of Telefís Éireann.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that I think Professor Williams is entitled to his views, that he is entitled to describe me as being stupid and a bad tactician, that he is entitled to criticise Deputy Dillon and the Fine Gael Party, that he is entitled to criticise the Labour Party, but I do not think that he should be afforded the medium of Telefís Éireann to do so.  I do not think he should have been allowed to do that.  I am told that his views on the various political Parties in this country are well known.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Director of Telefís Éireann should be taken to task about this matter.  I am sure the Minister has already taken him to task for allowing this one individual, whose political views are generally known, to use Telefís Éireann for commenting in the way he did on one of the most important discussions and vital votes in the history of the present Dáil.  The Minister did not see that telecast.  I did not see it, but I checked pretty well and I spoke to people who saw and heard Professor Desmond Williams and his presentation of the situation as it was in Dáil Éireann that night would not be described as being either objective or impartial.</P>
    <P>He is entitled to his views but it would only be common intelligence on the part of those in charge of Telefís Éireann to have ensured that two or three different points of view would be presented.  I am told that this man is a professor of modern history and I am sure that he was introduced as Professor Desmond Williams, Professor of Modern History in TCD, or UCD, or wherever it is.  I do not think it is good enough to have honest Irish people subjected to the harangue which I am told he delivered.  I do not care what he said about me.  I can take it from the Taoiseach, from the Minister, or even from the Tánaiste because I am here in the House and able to answer them and because the Press is good enough to give publicity to what I have to say in answer, but to present this man to give a certain view is plain stupid.</P>
    <P>A director of Telefís Éireann who did that could only be described as <Col N="1310" /> failing in his duty on such an important occasion by having put forward such a person to present the point of view of Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Government.  That would have been all right if the point of view of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party had been presented by somebody else.  And then we have the reply of the Minister given to the members of this House last week when he reiterated the answer he had given when questioned about other broadcasts.  This was too serious an occasion for that kind of thing.</P>

      <P>I want to reiterate my belief that there should be political discussions on Telefís Éireann but in accordance with Section 18 of the Act which says that controversial subjects should be presented in an objective and impartial way.  Then there is the treatment of &ldquo;An Fear agus a Scéal&rdquo;. The man who presents that programme is an acknowledged member of the Labour Party but he is also regarded as one of the best producers in Telefís Éireann.  Compare the treatment of Professor Williams and the treatment of the interview by Proinsias MacAonghusa and Con Lehane.  The director of Telefís Éireann said there was a lack of moderation in the MacAonghusa programme.  Where do you apply that to the programme by Professor Desmond Williams?</P>
      <P>We cannot but believe that there was interference by somebody to stop this particular programme.  It was being advertised up to 6.30 p.m. as going on the air at 10.30 p.m.  They were boasting about it; they were telling everybody to listen to &ldquo;An Fear agus a Scéal&rdquo;, to hear Con Lehane.

      <P>I could say much on this.  The Minister like his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, tells us in respect of certain questions we ask: &ldquo;You had better ask the Authority yourself&rdquo;.  The Authority will not answer.  They refuse to give the information.  I have positive evidence of that, not in respect of the present Director whom I did not have occasion to question, but I raised certain questions with the Minister previously and he told me to ask the Authority.  The Authority refused to give me information.  That is another good reason why we put down this motion.  If the Authority refuses the information and the Minister also refuses it, where are we?</P>
      <P>Therefore, I ask the House to call upon the Minister to be more liberal in giving information to Dáil Éireann in regard to the activities of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.</P>

      <P>This motion serves a very good purpose.  Anything that will bring out information in regard to these semi-State bodies is very welcome, whatever Party it comes from. I support the motion.  This House provides the money to run these bodies and whoever pays the piper should have a say in the tune that is played. We have had cases concerning the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs where it was practically a closed book when you sought information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point in this motion is not to discuss the different types of programmes but the fact that information is being refused.  It should have a good effect on the Director and Board of Radio Éireann if they knew they are subject to question in this House.  I do not suggest that the day-to-day business of Radio Éireann should be questioned here.  That would be bad, <Col N="1312" /> but matters of policy, matters of public discussion, should be brought up here.  We should be allowed to discuss various questions and get reasonable replies from Ministers, as far as possible.Up to now, on minor details, the Minister will give replies, on matters having no bearing on policy, but on points of policy, there is no hope of getting any reply.  The result is that we have cases such as we had recently in Béal na mBláth where cameras were used and films taken of commemoration proceedings for General Michael Collins and on the following Sunday night, or on other nights, when the people expected to see some of this on the programme, it was not given.  There was no account of it at all.  Other commemorations were held this year and reports and pictures were given.  That is not a proper course to take.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann was set up by the whole House, not by a particular Government.It will be there when the present Government and any other Government after it, have gone.  Telefís Éireann is expected to present an impartial view of proceedings in the House and of political proceedings generally.  Nobody will object to hard hitting as regards politics; that is the usual thing.  Anybody who enters politics is prepared for that.  If he wants a quiet time he will not enter them. People would like to have a fair show given to every Party in the House. Then nobody would object but it is when you allow only one side of the question to be debated that it is not fair.</P>
    <P>The money for the television service is put up by the people of Ireland and people are very much influenced by television.  If one Party is put up as the only Party in the country, as was the case recently, it has an affect. Governments will change and it would not be nice for the next Government to follow the lead given by the present Government.  I ask the Minister to see that information will be given on political or on major topics, if it is required here.  If that were the case, it would remedy much of the treatment of matters of public importance that has given rise to complaint in recent times on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I trust the Minister will accept this motion as the Minister for Social Welfare accepted another motion last week and, not alone accept it as that Minister did, but do something about it and carry it into effect.  All we want in Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann is fair play for all sides of the House. If we get that, we will leave it to the people to decide when the time comes on any matters put before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <P>This motion serves to bring, for the first time, to my knowledge, in the past couple of years, forcibly into the open this infernal scandal that exists in this House as regards dodging of responsibility by Ministers.  I have a file at home consisting entirely of refusals from the office of the Ceann Comhairle to accept questions relating to vital matters affecting the interests and lives of my constituents on the ground that the Minister had no official responsibility.</P>
      <P>This matter has been mentioned by the mover of the motion and others, and I deem it my right to mention it also.  This particular complaint, as it relates to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is part of the pattern by which the Government have built a series of outworks consisting of State companies and organisations such as Telefís Éireann, An Bord Fáilte, CIE, Bord na Móna and a whole bundle of others that I cannot think of, but there are 50 or more of them.  Behind these they can shelter and behind them many a thing is done that they would not like to trot out into broad daylight and discuss in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a motion which affords an opportunity to talk about one aspect of this matter.  There is nothing so frustrating, so infuriating, so enraging, to an ordinary Deputy who has gone to the trouble of having himself elected to this House&mdash;which is not a simple exercise&mdash;and who has at heart the interests of the people who send him here, than to put down a question and be told that it will not be allowed because the matter is outside the official responsibility of the Minister. The Minister cannot interfere in State companies.  State companies are <Col N="1314" /> sacred: they are sacrosanct.  They are staffed by saints&mdash;nearly all, of course, Fianna Fáil saints.  There are very few Fine Gael saints in these companies. They are peopled by saints who, apparently, can do no wrong and who cannot be challenged by members of this House, by the people who vote the money to pay them their salaries.  We cannot challenge them in any direction whatever if the particular Minister elects to hide behind the phrase: &ldquo;The Minister has no official responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to Telefís Éireann, Deputy Corish was in a somewhat difficult position in speaking about this incident which occurred almost a fortnight ago in relation to an interview by some person called &ldquo;Williams&rdquo;, of whom I had never heard and of whom the people of Ireland had never heard before, whose name I saw mentioned only last night in a book dealing with spies in Ireland during the war.  This person named &ldquo;Williams&rdquo; was brought along obviously to play the Government's game and was permitted to say over a nationwide network things of an insulting nature concerning a member of this House, the Leader of the Labour Party.  I should be just as enraged if what he said about him were said about any member of the Fianna Fáil Party, or of any Party in this House, by such a person in such a manner.  It was the grossest impertinence on the part of this so-called professor.  The only thing he can have graduated in is ignorance. I do not think the Minister can dodge responsibility.  It is merely one instance of much that happens.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo;&mdash;I wonder how many members of this House have listened to that piece of so-called objective reportage without getting blood pressure because of the partisan display.  I wonder how many have observed the very definite efforts which are made in the presentation of news to show the Government Party in a favourable light and discredit as far as possible the other Parties in this House.  We are told that impartiality is of the essence so far as Telefís Éireann is concerned.  It certainly does not display it.  On many occasions, when I have talked to people in this <Col N="1315" /> city about Telefís Éireann, I have been met with the response: &ldquo;Sure, doesn't everybody know there is a clique there. They are all one sack one sample. They are all brought in from the one source&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now that is not true of all of them. There are obviously men of talent there, young men who have not yet become tainted by contact with the backroom politics that brand some of the members of the Television so-called Authority.  There is quite obviously in Telefís Éireann an element which is striving to put over the propaganda of one single Party. That is stupid because we are the people who provide the money to make Telefís Éireann possible and we are entitled to expect Telefís Éireann to present news and programmes and to report in an impartial manner, in so far as it is possible to do so.  But that is not being done.  I accept what the Minister says, but that is not being done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the programme &ldquo;An Fear agus a Scéal&rdquo;, which related to a former Deputy, Con Lehane, I accept that the Minister did not interfere personally in that.  I know the Minister to be an honourable man. We can accept his word in matters like this.  Somebody out there, however, did not like the name of &ldquo;George Plant&rdquo; being mentioned.  Somebody was trying to hide historical facts.  Why should they, after a lapse of 20 years and in the case of a man long mouldering in his grave, a man who did his duty, whether or not we agree with it, and who gave his life in a fashion, whether or not we agree with it, for what he believed to be right?  Simply because some hidden, anonymous clerk did not like the mention of this man's name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me tell a little story about Telefís Éireann and myself.  Quite recently, there was a news report which, in my view, was incorrect.  I rang the news room.  I said in what I considered to be an eminently civil tongue to the person in charge that I believed this report to be incorrect and, because I was concerned in it, I wanted to have it corrected.  The reply made was that the listener was not used to being spoken to in such a rough tone of voice.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is not my purpose at all to speak to you in any rough tone.  I simply want to have mistakes corrected.&rdquo; In the course of some further conversation, I happened to use a colloquialism, to drop into the common idiom.  I said: &ldquo;What the hell,&rdquo; and I was told by the listener that I was not to curse at him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>At that stage, I said: &ldquo;Look, you know my name.&rdquo; In case he did not, I repeated it.  I said: &ldquo;What is yours?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are not permitted to give <Col N="1317" /> our names over the phone.&rdquo; So much for the anonymous people out there. That is an example of wished-for anonymity.  I am not making anything out of it except to show the stupidity of the carry-on.  Just imagine a person of that mentality presenting news, a person who feels himself bearing the brunt of foul language when he is asked &ldquo;What the hell.&rdquo; It shows the level of intelligence.</P>
      <P>I support this motion.  If I had any fault to find with it it is that it does not express itself with sufficient pungency.It does, however, give us an opportunity of raising here publicly this whole question of the rights of members, a matter I have tried to raise on many occasions, to obtain information.</P>
      <P>I recall that two or three weeks ago the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Dillon, in a very eloquent manner, addressed some club in Dublin &mdash; I think it was the Publicity Club &mdash; and spoke of the great shield we have for the protection of the public, of the great weapon there is in the hands of Dáil Éireann, the simple Parliamentary question.  He must have forgotten that these Parliamentary questions are frustrated, not in a single file but in battalions.  Every member of the House has files from the Ceann Comhairle's Office, or at least any member of the House who has tried to make use of this theoretical right which we have but which does not exist must have files of documents as I have.  Deputies McQuillan and Browne probably lead the field in that &mdash; their file must run into three figures &mdash; but we all have our share of them over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has helped to expose that situation.  I am grateful to the Labour Party members who have put down this motion to enable the situation to be exposed, not that it will bring any results, but, through the medium of the Press &mdash; is it too much to hope through the medium of Telefís Éireann &mdash; that it will be shown to the people of the country that all is not as it seems to be and that when somebody is elected to Dáil Éireann, theoretically he may have the right to <Col N="1318" /> ask questions but that there is a restriction of at least 50 per cent on that right.  It is in the hope that by public exposure of this flagrant violation of this democratic principle that I support the motion &mdash; in the hope that some remedy will eventually be found.</P>
    <P>Political differences are in the nature of progress; they are essential to progress.  If we did not have political differences, discussions and debates, our whole existence would be inanimate&mdash;there would be no life, no progress.  It is from conflict of ideas that man progresses.  Telefís Éireann does not appear to believe in that.  Its idea is to put across one line only, the Government Party line.  No other line is permitted to exist, as far as I can see, and I most vehemently protest against that policy.  I think it is scandalous, an insult to the Irish nation, more than half of whom are not in favour of the Government.  It is an insult and an imposition on them to ask them to pay licence fees to subsidise and patronise a system to put over a political Party line in matters of reports and otherwise.  Members of this House have had to stand before the people, which is far more difficult than attending a few lectures in University College, Dublin, or in Trinity College.  It is a better test of a man.  With those few, I hope, civil words, I congratulate the movers of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in here to support the motion mainly because I have always argued here on the rights of Deputies to ask Parliamentary questions.  I was glad to see the Leader of my Party making a magnificent address to the Publicity Club recently on that.  I have been continually asking another Minister questions and he has continually fobbed me off, even though he had admitted he is responsible.  The Minister now in the House has countered my questions with the statement that he is not responsible, notwithstanding the fact that during the debate on the television Bill he assured us he would be responsible to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we stress <Col N="1319" /> here tonight that when Deputies ask Parliamentary questions, they should be answered properly.  It is the Minister's business to answer questions. Section 18 of the Bill lays down that controversial subjects must be handled with impartiality.  We know what has been happening.  A man with no political background has been pushed before the camera to pontificate for the Irish nation and to give the Fianna Fáil Party line.  If the Minister says there is not Party line, I shall reply by drawing attention to what happened in this House the day President Kennedy addressed us when the television cameras covered no side of the House but the Fianna Fáil side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With their mouths open.  That is a matter of record. Since I came to the House, there has been a vendetta, organised by the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, against General Michael Collins.  The Army were not allowed to go to Béal na Bláth.  Telefís Éireann sent their cameras to all these ceremonies.  They took their pictures on a fine day but none was shown on the programme because this vendetta must be carried on.  Is it not obvious therefore that there is a line?</P>
      <P>The Dublin by-election was passed over by Telefís Éireann as if it were something that was happening thousands of miles away, but we could hear all about elections in Liberia. Then, the other day, we had a topical talk on the Luton by-election and on the British Prime Minister winning in his constituency.  If the Minister and his friends think we do not read the newspapers and pay attention to those things, they are making a mistake. We do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always complaining about the treatment my constituency gets.  I want to give another instance of it now. We ran the best musical festival in this country, one that pays for itself and that brings in the most tourists. I am putting it against every other festival in the country; yet we got no coverage from Telefís Éireann.  In fact, there was a complaint to this effect <Col N="1320" /> in the columns of the <i>Evening Herald</i> recently.  At the same time, they sent their cameras 156 miles from Dublin to televise two or three little girls tripping around because they were friends of somebody in Radio Éireann who wants to have a few days down there.  These are functions that have no news value, no promotional value to the country.</P>
    <P>I saw the streets of Waterford filled every day for its festival with people with accents from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  They came there day after day and a most magnificent musical festival was put on, but there was not a single picture on Telefís Éireann.  The people of this country are getting tried of just listening to the news and looking at the newscaster.  There are not enough pictures of what happens.  There was a sporting event recently and there was good notice that an Irish-bred dog trained by Mr. Dick Ryan had won his fourth round in the Waterloo Cup. If we had good news organisers, we would have had a cameraman on the plane that night to take the final, whether this dog won or lost.  It won, and it was a miracle that it was even announced that the dog had won. Again there is never any rowing shown.  Rowing seems to be a sport that is gone.  Nobody bothers about it in Radio Éireann and naturally if they have no interest in it, nobody else will know anything about it.</P>
    <P>The news is read out night after night and you see only the newscasters, nice, competent fellows, and maybe an occasional picture.  There would have to be a fire in Dublin within half a mile of the studio and that would have to occur fairly early in the morning in order to give them time to film it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon had a Parliamentary question down to the Minister regarding the famous Williams broadcast. He asked would the film be made available.  The Minister shook his head and did not say the film would be made available.  If Deputies such as the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties here asked to see a film such as that, especially a telecast that was both insulting and unimpartial, they should be given the opportunity of seeing it as a matter of courtesy.</P>

      <P>From what I was told about him, he was not photogenic but we shall leave that.  He was told to toe the Party line.  We must judge by results and the results are that as far as Telefís Éireann is concerned, there is a strong Party line from the Government benches and from Fianna Fáil right into Telefís Éireann, influencing the policy of Telefís Éireann, influencing the pictures and the news. There is no question of Telefís Éireann giving the Leaders of the Opposition Parties an opportunity of having their say, of even reporting them or being present at any of their functions.  The whole idea is, as they say in modern times, to create an image: the image must be created that Fianna Fáil know all, dominant, that Fianna Fáil know all, that they see all and that they are everywhere and &ldquo;Be careful of what you are saying or you might lose your job.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another matter I want to mention to the Minister is censorship, which was mentioned here by Deputy Corish. There should be some standard of quality.  The type of canned programme which is dished up sometimes is dreadful.  I do not say the programmes I am talking about are immoral; they could not be condemned on any immoral grounds but they are an insult to the intelligence.  The people who bought them must never have seen them.  They must have bought them by the hundredweight, by the ton, by the gross or by the thousand, and they keep showing them.</P>

    <P>Recently I saw two plays on Telefís Éireann, &ldquo;The Workhouse Ward&rdquo; and &ldquo;In the Train&rdquo; with Cyril Cusack and Anna Managhan.  We have great actors and actresses but we do not make enough use of them.  They are not able to penetrate into Telefís Éireann.  Many of the best of our young television people are going to England because they get more opportunities. <Col N="1322" /> May be they get better pay but I will not go into that.  The Minister should take cognisance of this motion.  He should see to it that Fianna Fáil do not establish a cumann in Telefís Éireann and, if they have established one, he should insist that it be taken out of it.  Telefís Éireann belongs to the Irish people and whatever telecasts come from it should be impartial and national, and the Irish news should reflect Ireland and not just one or two places in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In regard to this motion, I do not think we could have a more impartial Minister.  He will not interfere with Telefís Éireann.  I am not going to embarrass you, Sir, by straying from the motion but being a charitable man, you will be silent for a few seconds until I deal with this matter about the Minister.  The Minister is blamed for everything.  Surely the Minister cannot supply all the information?He has set up a Committee <Col N="1324" /> and there is a Director General and there are directors of the various branches in Telefís Éireann.  It is their job to carry on and if they were to be subject to a Minister in regard to everything they did, it would be impossible for the Minister to carry on and I would say to my colleague if he found himself in that position that he should resign.  He has not placed himself in that position.</P>
      <P>If somebody speaks on Telefís Éireann and the Minister is not there to censor what he says, we have a hullabaloo in the House and a lot of questions put down.  That is not democracy, to put it around that it is political and that it is staged by the Minister, or to say that the Minister is withholding information.  This is complete eyewash and the people who put down the motion know it.  Some day they may find themselves in the position in which the Minister is at present and will find themselves answering questions tabled by Deputies.  The Deputies who have been tabling these questions have been trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  The Opposition do not care whom they hurt.  The Minister will go down in history as one of the men who instituted Telefís Éireann.  He is an old soldier of Ireland who puts the interests of Ireland first.</P>

They put down all the questions they could to embarrass the Minister.  We should give all the encouragement we can to Telefís Éireann.

      <P>One of the most frequently heard statements in this House from Ministerial benches is: &ldquo;The Minister has no function in the matter&rdquo;.  I do not know how often I have heard that phrase, and also the phrase &ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle regrets&rdquo;.  In my opinion, 50 per cent of the questions which should be put to a Minister do not get further than the Ceann Comhairle and to those which do get past him, the reply from the Minister is &ldquo;I have no function in the matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose to comment, not in a personal way, on the Minister's part in that and in so far as that attitude on the part of Ministers has given the public the idea that a Minister is trying to utilise State companies as a screen and if things go wrong in State companies, pretend he has no responsibility The result is that very often State or semi-State companies are blamed in the wrong.  The proper attitude on the Minister's part, as far as this motion is concerned, would be to set up a special Committee of the House which would act as a liaison between the House and the Television Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of programming about which I was talking when the debate was adjourned is one which I should like further to impress on Deputies as being of very great importance to the future of house building and building generally carried out by local authorities throughout the country.  It is a matter that I will be dealing with much more specifically in the very near future and will be taking up directly with the local authorities concerned with a view to bringing about a balanced approach to the problems on hands at the moment and to ensuring that building, particularly house building, will follow a fairy even pattern, not a pattern of starting and stopping, as may have been the case in the past.</P>
      <P>The general indications that I have given of what we have been doing as a Government and through the Department of Local Government in particular, are a complete answer to the assertions that we were trying to slow down the spending of money for such very necessary purposes as housing and other social services.  There are a number of other items in the general overall position that should be mentioned, which are additional proof, if that is necessary, that far from depressing expenditure on these services which are of benefit to the community as a whole, in fact we have been doing the reverse, namely, stimulating and increasing expenditure and introducing further and greater expenditure under various other heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, a matter of some concern to the agricultural community would be that from 1956 to 1963, by deliberate action of the Government <Col N="1328" /> and through legislation in this House, we have increased the amount paid from the general Exchequer by way of agricultural rates relief from £5.2 million in 1956 to £8.5 million in 1963-64. In addition, again dealing with the farming community, in order to induce farmers to avail of the improved grants provided by the Department of Agriculture for the reconstruction and erection of farm buildings, we brought into being a 20-year complete remission of all rates on such new buildings or reconstructed buildings as would come under this heading.  Previously there had been exemption for a limited period of seven years.  These two matters are again an indication of our wish to accelerate building, contrary to the allegation made that we are trying to depress it.</P>
    <P>A few facts should be kept in mind in regard to the Road Fund and road construction.  The relevant facts are that when we took over from the previous administration in the early part of 1957 we found the situation to be that there was £4.1 million of commitments laid at the door of the Road Fund.  Incidentally, that commitment had risen from £1.8 million in 1953-54, which was the last year in which the previous Fianna Fáil Government had been in office.  While £5.1 million was allocated for road reconstruction, repair, improvement and maintenance in 1956-57, this year there is £8.07 million allocated to our various local authorities and, despite this very noticeable increase, the commitments on the Fund are being contained at the, I think, fairly reasonable and safe figure of £3.4 million.  It should be borne in mind that this £8.07 million is available for payment out to local authorities this year, which is more than could be said for the £5.1 million which was allocated in 1956-57, which, but for the advent of the Fianna Fáil administration in the early part of 1957, would not have been available for payment to these councils.</P>
    <P>These are figures which should be kept in mind and should provide food for thought to those who talk about Fianna Fáil depressing spending, depressing building, depressing construction and who allege that that was deliberate policy generated by the <Col N="1329" /> terms of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> issued in November, 1958.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the various things we have been endeavouring to do with regard to roads and road traffic.  As the House is aware, we brought in and got through this House very extensive road traffic legislation a couple of years ago and since then we have been endeavouring to bring in by way of regulation the various matters which had yet to be attended to as outlined in the Act but which it was left to the Minister to bring into operation as and when the time was ripe.  We did bring in regulations and put into operation almost immediately quite a considerable part of the Act dealing with penalties, new offences and so forth and in the past couple of years we have seen other fruits of the Act in the traffic signs, parking bye-laws, fines on the spot&mdash;so-called fines on the spot at any rate&mdash;and recently we brought into being quite elaborate and complex regulations dealing with construction, equipment and lighting of vehicles, which, no doubt, were very much needed but which took a considerable amount of time because of the complexities involved and the consultations which it was necessary to have before being in a position to bring in the regulations.  At present we are dealing with all of Part III of the Act, which includes, amongst other things, the driving test regulations, and we would hope to bring in this Part of the Act in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have had submitted to us in the recent past the Report of the Commission set up to deal with driving under the influence of drink or drugs.  The public have been given until the 30th of this month to express their views on certain aspects of this Report.  The Leader of the main Opposition mentioned one aspect of this&mdash;the question of the intake of alcohol.  I entirely agree with his approach to this matter, which is that a fixed figure of alcohol content in the blood should not now or ever be an indication of whether a person is drunk or sober.  This figure, which will be based on all the experience we can garner, will merely indicate the point at which it is held alcohol can be taken <Col N="1330" /> and beyond which it can be said, not that a person is drunk, but that his driving would not be as good as if he had taken less alcohol.  That is the approach that is intended.  We should not go into the never-ending argument as to when one man is drunk and when another man is drunk, which cannot be decided by how many pints and how many half-ones they have had. The Leader of the main Opposition referred also to &ldquo;breathaliser&rdquo; tests and whether blood tests were objectionable or not.  I do not intend to deal with these points now, because I do not think that would be relevant, but they will come up for debate in due course.  As I said, we are giving up to the 30th of this month for the public to express their views.  On the basis of that, we will decide what form this legislation will take; and the legislation will be brought before the House as soon as possible.  Any flaws that have emerged in the working of the new Road Traffic Act will be corrected in this amending Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of speed limits has been discussed.  Naturally, not all of the views expressed coincided.  The question of the siting of traffic signs is currently under review by the local technical committees.  These will report to their local authorities, who will transmit to me their considered opinions, on which I will be entitled to act.  I expect this to be done in a very short time.</P>
    <P>One charge made on which I should like to comment is that the 30 m.p.h. limit is frustrating and causing accidents.  I entirely disagree with the view that the 30 m.p.h. limit is the cause of accidents by frustrating drivers who want to get by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have driven a lot here.  This idea of frustration being caused by those observing the limit <Col N="1331" /> is entirely wrong.  What I regard as the correct assessment of the position is that the slow-moving driver, who hugs the crown of the road regardless of whether it is within the speed limit area or not, is the cause of a great deal of frustration that does lead to accidents &mdash; in other words, people who will not keep to their own side of the road when they are driving at a slow speed.  If they are doing 30 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. speed limit area, there is no reason why they should be passed out, because those passing them out would themselves be breaking the speed limit.  It is the driver who hugs the centre of the road who is the cause of a great deal of frustration and is, indirectly or directly, the cause of accidents, because those behind him take a chance in order to try and get by.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan says there are too many poles in Galway.  I am not inclined to disagree with him at all. I think what he had in mind was the apparently haphazard manner in which poles for signs of various kinds are erected.  I am aware that this is something which happens not alone in Galway but in other counties as well. We have at present in course of preparation a memorandum on this subject which will be directed to local authorities.  It invites them to take a little more care in the placing of these signs and to try and avoid erecting a multiplicity of signs where fewer would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot pass from this question of road traffic legislation without mentioning the Safety First Association. They have introduced a new scheme and have appointed two organisers, one based in Limerick and one in Sligo.  I understand it is their intention to cover the south-west and north-west and to put across as much safety first propaganda as possible, particularly to the school-going population.  I want to congratulate the Association on this scheme and to ask schools throughout the country to co-operate with these organisers wherever possible.  This scheme is well worth trying.  If it is a success and can be further developed, it will give a good return for the <Col N="1332" /> money invested in it.  As I said to the Safety First Association, while we in the Department are in fact contributing towards the scheme, if the scheme is worked in a good way, and shows signs of success, they will be pushing an open door, so far as financial assistance is concerned.</P>
    <P>When I referred to Deputy McQuillan and his arguments&mdash;or, should I say, complaints&mdash;about the <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads being taken over by the council in Roscommon and not being included for the purpose of existing road grants, I should have said, lest it might be mis-understood, that other counties do not have that mileage counted either, so there is no question of Roscommon being dealt with in an isolated or unique way.  They are getting their due of the Road Fund money.</P>
    <P>On that matter of Road Fund moneys, I do not agree with the general sweeping assertions that roads are being made too wide and too elaborate.  Where arterial roads are concerned, we have not only to improve these roads and bring them up to a standard capable of carrying today's traffic, but we have to look ahead and try to visualise by way of figures and anticipate growth for the future and anticipate the needs for those roads for a number of years ahead.  On that basis, and in respect of what we might call arterial roads, the width and the manner of their construction is not in fact outside of that which is called for in the circumstances.  In addition, I should say that local authorities were given the power, which they did not enjoy until a few years ago, of vetting the proposals of their county engineer, in so far as road proposals were concerned before their submission for final approval to the Department of Local Government. That power was given to them and that right was given to the elected members in 1958.  In so far as Roscommon is concerned, I am not aware that they have exercised that right since then. Whether the roads were too wide or too narrow, so far as I can ascertain, they have not utilised that right, or adopted counter-proposals to those put before them by their county engineer.</P>
    <P>There is the complaint, which is not <Col N="1333" /> an unusual one, of not enough money being spent on county and by-roads. That is one which depends on which view you wish to take.  You can make a strong argument for and against. The figures I have are quite enlightening.From 1953 to 1962, we have in fact spent £24.7 million on our county roads and at the same time, we have spent £15.8 million on our main roads. The criticism I have heard, which really lacks any reason whatsoever, was advanced by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Rooney &mdash; Deputy Rooney on behalf of county Dublin and Deputy Byrne on behalf of the Dublin Corporation area.  Both of them fell into the mistaken idea &mdash; how I just cannot imagine &mdash; that the amount, for instance, given to the Dublin Corporation is based on the road mileage within the Corporation area.  As a result, Deputy Byrne insisted that the amount allocated was far too low.  In the first place no such calculation is based on road mileage so far as road mileage for Dublin Corporation is concerned. Secondly, the question of the amount being far too low is wrong, for the reason that Dublin is getting more than they ever even asked for at the present time.  Nobody who knows the facts will attempt to deny that.</P>
    <P>In so far as County Dublin is concerned, Deputy Rooncy follows much the same line as Deputy Byrne, and even with less reason, with complaints as to what they have been getting or the condition of particular roads at present.  Dublin county, as some members of this House will recall&mdash; particularly those on the Opposition benches &mdash; have had a special grant reserved for them since 1947, and despite repeated requests from several Ministers, it is only in the last little while that they have taken cognisance of the fact that there was money reserved for them or that they had a job to do on their roads in and out of Dublin city and through the county. The idea that they are not getting enough is wrong and is entirely without foundation and completely untrue.</P>
    <P>The record is there to show that not only have they been getting money but, in fact, they have not been spending the money they were getting and, <Col N="1334" /> for some peculiar reason, for years did not want to spend it.  There is now a revival on their part and I am glad to see it and glad to see at least we are getting work done, and work under way that in fact should have been done 15 years ago, work which is probably costing three times as much today as it would have cost then.  It is giving rise in the entire city and county of Dublin, due to the fact that these roads were not done when they should have been done, to very great congestion and loss of time and money to the users of our roads.</P>
    <P>It has been said that dual carriage-ways should be made in and out of Dublin.  I cannot say that I do disagree with that view.  I am not saying categorically that that is what we will have but the need for greater ease on the main roads in and out of Dublin city has grown in importance.  The size and number of industries is such that this is certainly not too far-reaching a view to take in regard to what may be needed in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Getting back to what we would propose to do, I am merely reciting those and many other facts to contradict in a very emphatic and definite way the assertions made by some of the Opposition speakers and showing in this way that we have been really pushing ahead with general development of services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would now indicate to the House in some little detail new legislation and schemes which will come into being in the very near future.  In regard to housing legislation, for instance, we have coming, I hope in the not too distant future, new housing legislation which will codify and simplify the existing several codes which have been in operation for a number of years.  At the same time, we will deal with the newly and recently announced increased assistance for small farmers by way of increased grants for privately-built houses which will be supplemented by increased loans from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In so far as the smaller of the small farmers are concerned, they will still be enabled to build their own homes. <Col N="1335" /> We will be placing on the local authorities, a responsibility, which up to now they have not had, of building for these under-£5 valuation people.  In addition to giving them responsibility, we shall give them assistance where-with to do it.  We shall so design this scheme that the cost to the rates will not be a burden to the community. At the same time, it will be an incentive to the local authorities to build for these people, particularly in the West of Ireland and along our coast where up to the moment they have been unable to build.</P>
    <P>In so far as subtenancies policy is concerned, I can tell the House that new legislation will bring about a radical change and will leave some of those who have talked in this House not only this year but last year without one of their stock arguments.  We intend to remove the absolute prohibition on the subtenanting of local authority housing.  That will bring about a situation wherein our local authority houses will be used as near to their full capacity as is practicable. In other words, we shall not have waste space.  We shall not have, say, five-roomed local authority houses going to loss with maybe only one or two occupants which for the time being could house &mdash; as many are illegally housing at the moment&mdash; other members of the same family who are married.</P>
    <P>Consequent upon the removal of this prohibition, there will follow a higher rate of subsidy for the rehousing of those people who occupy, as subtenants, these houses if, in the future, they become over-crowded with the normal progression of the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have to look at that.  However, without tying it down to the income levels at the moment, let us say the prohibition that exists will be removed.  The illegality, as it were, that now attaches to these people will be removed. Where overcrowding will be removed. result of subtenanting, as is the case <Col N="1336" /> at the moment and as will develop with this type of system in the future, a higher subsidy will generally be available for the rehousing of those people out of these local authority houses.</P>
      <P>In addition, we shall have to get down to the problem of doing something really solid and concrete about the housing of our old people.  In earlier legislation and in regard to grants schemes I have tried to encourage the housing of these people.  There is evidence at the moment that some good is coming from that encouragement but we shall have to place more emphasis on it in the future.  It is a growing problem.  We are having more old people and as the years go on we shall have a greater number of old people.  If we are to do something for them, we must start soon.  Otherwise, a lot of these people will be in very poor circumstances, with no hope for the future but an extension of the county home system which none of us wants and which we should not endure in these times.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would hope to be in a position on this occasion to have a new approach, a new push, to try to get over this problem that has not just come about overnight.  It did not come about last year or the year before.  It is a problem which has been growing in volume for a number of years because priority was given, and probably rightly so, to the larger young families living in very bad conditions.But, by and large, it is a very big problem now and one which we cannot tolerate to continue in its present from for very much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall have much to say on these items when this legislation comes before the House.  However, I consider myself rather lucky to have been Minister for Local Government whilst there is in office a Government who can foresee and who are prepared to go as far as this Government are prepared to go to relieve these types of people, particularly the small farmers whose housing needs have been recognised by many of us for many years but, for various reasons, have not been dealt with.  They will be dealt with in the future and I think effectively.  I shall <Col N="1337" /> be inviting our local authorities in the very near future to prepare, on the basis of this new assistance, their definite building programmes for these people so that we can get going with this job and get going immediately.</P>
    <P>Near the beginning of my reply I referred to the first Economic Programme issued in 1958.  I probably would wish to finish on a more recent economic programme&mdash;a White Paper issued quite recently in which it is foreshadowed that by 1970 there should be an additional increase of 50 per cent in our national income. If we can, and I believe we can, and the signs are there to show we can, accomplish anything around this figure, then it is quite obvious that there are not only the problems we have been talking about facing us but an increasing volume of that type of problem due to the greater prosperty that will be created.  Greater needs will arise, for instance, with earlier marriages and more families seeking new houses.  With the greater wealth, we shall also have no doubt an increasing number of private cars which will add to our traffic problem and in turn add to our demand for roads, and so on.  All of this increase in our productivity and general improvement in our economy to anything like 50 per cent, as foreshadowed in this decade, will strain us to the limit to keep up with the demand that will undoubtedly follow from it, added to that of the backlog we have in these respects at the moment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as far as Local Government policy and planning are concerned, I feel that probably the most important legislation we have put through this House &mdash; taking an overall view of it &mdash; in recent years has been the Planning Act.  Within that Planning Act, all of these developments I have mentioned can find their proper place and proper setting.  It is on the background generally of the terms and conditions of this Planning Act that we can programme and plan for the future.  It is of very great importance, I believe, that we should keep this in mind.  With the 1970s, with the optimistic outlook on this type of progress and development which I think <Col N="1338" /> is becoming common to the people of this country today then we must have a far wider range of imagination than has been our lot in the past.  We must consider the huge advances that must necessarily follow this type of national economic growth.  We must plan for it not only for today but for seven, ten and 20 years hence.  To do that, we shall require this optimistic outlook and imagination which has not been terribly evident due to various circumstances in the past.</P>
    <P>This Act should enable all of us in local government to correlate our various activities and to set them all into a planned pattern which will be the way in which we shall attain the ends and goals we set ourselves most readily and most economically.  If this type of growth is to go on and if there is, as we can anticipate, not only today's demand for housing, for instance, but an increasing demand in these next seven years to anything like that indicated by this type of growth then we have to ask ourselves if, under our present conditions and within our present methods, we can hope to keep up with the demand, for instance, for houses.  If we are to keep up, then I am convinced that there must be a very great change in our traditional methods.  They must be much more streamlined than they are today; there must be much more method on the sites of our building jobs, much more mechanisation and pre-planning.  The haphazard operation of some of our developments of the past will not be tolerated in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a time of great challenge to the building industry and that challenge can be met by an improvement in our present type of organisation and, if necessary, we will have to go into the realm of industrialised building which is working successfully in several countries in Europe and elsewhere.A really telling coincidence exists today when we compare our situation with the development of industrialised building in other countries.Today we have here a growing necessity for more houses.  We have somewhat of a backlog to make up; <Col N="1339" /> we have other building works proceeding at the same time; and we have a greater demand for skilled building workers than we can supply.  The answer to that may be better organisation and more mechanisation but we may also attract back to their own country some of the disillusioned building operatives who left us some years back.</P>
    <P>What we have in common with these countries where there is mechanised building is this necessity for more houses, this backlog in housing and this great demand for building workers. Each of these countries which have the same problem have developed various forms of industrialised or prefabricated building and we are coming to that stage here.  If our traditional system of building is not an answer to that problem, we will have to look further afield to industrialised building to cope with our problem.  In talking to the master builders a year ago, I put this type of problem to them in somewhat different terms, telling them that this was the type of problem they would have to grapple with and asking from the industry as a whole, whether employers or employees, some type of development that would give us a greater out-turn of work.  The results so far are not very bright but there may be developing in the minds of some of those groups certain proposals of which we have not heard.  I hope there are such proposals and that they can give us a greater output of building than is possible at the moment.</P>
    <P>The result of this situation which I have outlined is that there is a greater amount of building work available than we can cope with.  Another result is that we have not only greater delays but that there is, no doubt, a greater percentage being added to the price to compensate for that.  It has the effect of putting up the cost of housing further and beyond what it would be in the natural course of events.  We cannot stand by and let this trend continue to its ultimate end. That would lead nowhere and create great difficulty for us in our efforts to cope with our problem.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that in our <Col N="1340" /> proposed new housing legislation, we would hope to facilitate building by greater subsidy incentive to the building of high rise dwellings in Dublin city.  We cannot forever go on spreading the city over the fields of County Dublin, and we cannot continue to do that while we know that there are left at present the remnants of the old tenements which were cleared in the past 20 or 30 years.  There is in Dublin this core of bad building which must come down and which must be replaced.A great deal of it is in the centre of the city.  The land there is too valuable to be just left there covered by the useless and obsolete buildings which are now on it.  If we are to utilise these sites, we should do so to the greatest possible degree, consonant with greater and better traffic routing in our cities.  This is something in which the Government will help and there will be indications that for the purpose of high rise buildings, we will be prepared to give greater financial assistance where this type of building is necessary than we would give for the normal type of building.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated that off-street car parking is a necessity for this city and that local authorities can get grants from the Road Fund to construct such off-street car parks.  These need not necessarily be on cleared sites.  There is very good reason why the question of multi-floored car parks should be gone into thoroughly.  Dublin Corporation are thinking along those lines and we shall be hearing from them in the form of requests for assistance in these matters.</P>
    <P>The rebuilding of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and other cities or the planning for that rebuilding was not clearly feasible until the passing of the Town Planning Act.  A great deal of the centre city building will now come in for redevelopment and we now have the law to handle that position.  Up to the passing of that Act, we had not reached the point where we could face up to the actual cost nor, may I say, had we the will to face up to it.  I believe we have now reached the point where we must do this, that we have reached the point where we cannot allow our city centres to fall into <Col N="1341" /> decay and where this rebuilding of obsolete dwellings is part of our programme for the future.</P>
    <P>To finish on an aspect of the subject with which I began, local authorities, I did say definitely and emphatically as Minister for Local Government I had every right to criticise local authorities where I thought fit.  Not only that, but I have an obligation to criticise them because a great deal of the money channelled into local authorities comes from the Central Exchequer through my Department. That does not mean that I am carping at local authorities, or that I wish to find fault with them.  To put me in the position of saying that I would say such things would be an entirely wrong conception of my mind on local authorities and their functions.  I have tried and shall continue to try, to work with local authorities in the greatest harmony and co-operation possible because I believe that if the central Government and local government are to work most effectively, that will be done when there is harmony and co-operation.I feel that is, in fact, there now.</P>
    <P>If at times anything said by me may be twisted to suit a particular local political figurehead, that is unavoidable, but my wish is to co-operate and I think in general we have been co-operating and our progress, locally and centrally, in the services with which we deal, depends very greatly on harmony and co-operation.</P>
    <P>In regard to Dublin housing which we had at the beginning and end of the debate, for the benefit of those who might have any doubts, I want to explain what the role of the Government has been and its effects in Dublin city and elsewhere.  I have shown already that no house and no building with which I have had anything to do, as Minister for Local Government, was held up at any time for want of money. Money has been available for any and all schemes operated through, or under, my Department during all the years I have been in the Custom House and there is no Deputy in any Party and nobody outside the House who can give any proof to the contrary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> It is true we need quite a considerable number of houses in Dublin to-day.That number has grown rapidly in the past couple of years.  It is true also that the number of new houses completed in Dublin in recent years has been showing, up to last year, a continuing decline, but it is also relevant, when we come to judge the situation and to condemn either the Minister for Local Government or Dublin Corporation, that we should not only consider the number of houses completed in these years but that we should take into consideration the number of vacancies occurring in the housing stock which exists in Dublin today.</P>
    <P>Let me put on record again that there is wonder in the greater part of Europe, if not in the world, among many in public bodies, at the high percentage of local authority housing constructed by Dublin Corporation which has one of the highest figures for any city of comparable size in any part of the globe.  That is so, despite the narking and carping criticisms we may hear here, without any thought for what has been done in years gone by.</P>
    <P>Coming back to figures which are the relevant factor in this argument, the decline in the number of houses being completed in Dublin Corporation area and, parallel to that, the corresponding rise in the number of vacancies, there was a vacancy rate of 639 in 1954-55 rising to 1,689 in 1959-60.  On the other side of the scale, completions of new houses stood at 1,922 in 1954-55 and dropped to 505 in 1959-60.  Adding those figures we get the net new tenancies created in each of the years in question.  Taking the first and last figures and leaving out the others, we get 25,061 new tenancies created in 1954-55 and 21,094 in 1959-60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures in between vary.  There is a figure for 1955-56 which is 2,100, less than the figure for 1959-60.  It was 2,500 in the following year, dropping to 2,400 in the year after that.  Taking the whole line <Col N="1343" /> right along, the net tenancies created, that is, the number of new houses completed, plus houses vacated, and adding them together gives a general picture of the situation as it has been over the past eight years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the combined figures are the figures on which one must judge the approach of Dublin Corporation to the housing problem in the critical years under review. I ask any member on any side of the House, is it not a fact that until 1960, and until the number of vacancies for the first time had begun to show a downward trend, as Deputy Sherwin said, it was only then that the &ldquo;wise boys&rdquo; began to see they needed more houses?  I think that is a fact and to use these figures in other ways to condemn or criticise or level charges at Dublin Corporation or its housing committee is wrong; it is based on absolutely wrong arguments and wilfully so based in most cases, I fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the figures on which the Corporation and the housing committee had to base their calculations. Everybody knows you do not decide to have new houses and have them next week or next month or even next year.  Part of the overall procedure is that it takes about three years from the decision to build houses until you actually have them and in many cases you are lucky to have them in about three years.  Taking those figures as the criterion on which undoubtedly the Corporation Housing Committee had to judge the situation <Col N="1344" /> we also must take into consideration the overall picture as it was.  Much as we might like to do so, we cannot forget about it if we want to consider the matter in its true light.</P>
    <P>We find we have an increasing vacancy rate, increasing because of the depression that had befallen the country at the time of the departure, and immediately before the departure, of the last Coalition Government of 1954-57.  That depression continued for a considerable period afterwards.</P>
    <P>People continued to leave the Dublin Corporation housing estates in their hundreds and eventually a peak figure of 1,600 vacancies occurred. Had the Dublin Corporation continued to build at the rate of which they had been building two or three years previously they would have had hundreds of houses with no tenants for them. Had they done that those who now criticise the Dublin Corporation for not building would make the charge that there had been a complete waste of public money on houses for which there were no tenants and, because there are a number of their own members on the Dublin Corporation, they want the Minister now to take the rap.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1960 no one could have made the charge that the Dublin Corporation were not building enough houses.  But people are always wise after the event and it is quite easy to come along now and assert that more houses should have been built.  It is quite easy for Deputy Dunne to ask how many applications there are.  There are upwards of 10,000 applications but of that 10,000 only 4,500 are cleared as eligible for and entitled to housing by the Dublin Corporation.  This round figure of 10,000 has been repeated here by those who do not know the true facts and who probably believe that that figure represents the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The list of applicants is never a true reflection of the <Col N="1345" /> responsibility of the local authority. We all know from our own practical experience that local authorities do not accept responsibility for housing every single person who makes application, regardless of personal circumstances or housing conditions.  To say there are 10,000 applicants without a roof over their heads is to grossly misrepresent the true position.  Of course, the exaggeration suits the mentality of those who indulge in it. It does not reflect the true picture. Neither is it fair to the members of a local authority which is faced with the task of dealing with the problem now.  It is particularly invidious when one remembers that it is made by people who are themselves members of that same local authority.  These wild charges are made but no effort is made to substantiate them by people who are themselves members of that body and who have done nothing worthwhile for the people they allegedly represent.</P>
      <P>We must look at the position in its proper background of the general depression so evident not alone in this city but all over the country at the time when the Coalition Government left office and in the years immediately after.  Nobody will realise better than the Members of that Coalition Government that it took years to straighten things out.  We had to pay the bills of the Coalition.  We found we had a backlog of moneys which had to be paid out.  We even had a backlog of sanctions for jobs that needed to be done.  We found we had to supplement the Road Fund so that men would not be thrown out of employment and our roads would not deteriorate still further; we had to do that as a result of the raid of £500,000 on that fund only a few short months before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things have to be said to get the proper picture.  This is the way in which to prove the rising vacancy rate.  The Dublin Corporation had been told in January, 1957, that there would be no money in the future except for things which were absolutely essential.  The vacancy rate continued to rise in 1958 and probably the Dublin Corporation pulled in their horns very quickly.  They were lucky because <Col N="1346" /> the trend which evolved in the years 1954 to 1957 continued; there was a general depression, a general exodus from the city, a closing down of work, rising unemployment and increasing emigration.  Surely the Dublin Corporation should not be branded because of that depression and those who were members of that Coalition Government should be the last to brand any local authority for not taking an optimistic view.  How could anyone take an optimistic view in that particular period?</P>
    <P>After some time then the trend grew less and, as emigration eased, Dublin Corporation began immediately to set in motion plans for more housing.  In 1960/61, the improving trend really became evident and, so soon as the Dublin Corporation had proof of that improving trend, they immediately started to build.  Building increased in 1961/62.  The upward swing continued in 1962/63.  The swing will go higher in 1963/64.  In two or three years, it will be four times, if not five times, what it was two years ago.  It takes up to three years to complete a house from the time the decision is taken to build. That is the situation and that is the situation that should be studied by those who criticise.  They should keep in mind the fact that there were 100,000 unemployed, that 70,000 had emigrated in the previous year, that the balance of payments of this country was in a disastrous condition, that our national finances were chaotic and that our Budgets were unbalanced, as we found to our cost when we came to office, by more than £6 million, even if we still had Deputies like Deputy Coogan hanging around saying otherwise.</P>
    <P>On top of all that, there were instructions and admonitions handed out by Ministers in that Government in 1957 to all our managers throughout the country not to proceed with or put forward anything unless it was absolutely vital, not to do anything in fact that would put an extra demand on the Exchequer because the Exchequer was not able to bear any demands.  That was the position.  We had the Road Fund raided to stop a hole in the boat. I admit the hole was not too big, but the boat was not a very good one.  It <Col N="1347" /> was that raiding of the Road Fund for £500,000, at a time when the Road Fund could not afford to be raided for anything, which left us in the position that not only had we to put that back but we had to add hundreds of pounds extra to make up for what they had done.</P>

If there is foundation for the belief that the public mind was conditioned to not building as many houses as in the past, that was started by members of the Coalition, through the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, plus repetition by a number of other Ministers</P>

What must appear to the Deputy are the ghosts of those days, particularly of the days when his Party stood up here to criticise Fianna Fáil and lay at their door the blame for all the shortcomings.They blame Fianna Fáil now for lack of houses to provide for our returning emigrants.  As against that depressing litany, here we have now a situation in which employment is rising, in which there is more secure employment than ever before, in which our people are being paid better than ever before.  Is that not a fact?  Is it not also a fact that in this year we have seen for the first time in many years an actual rise in the population, a new low in emigration?</P>

Our outlook is bright; the optimism of our people is there for all to see.  That is something you cannot get away from.

So far as my Department, I and this Government are concerned, we are wholeheartedly behind our local authorities in this planning and will give every possible assistance and, further, we will give the money and we will be able to pay the money, which is more than could be said for the last Coalition Government when they left office.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to take power to abolish the Housing Committees of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council on the grounds:</P>
      <P>(1)  that, despite the fact that Dublin Corporation officially admits that applications for housing accommodation were received from 8,748 citizens, the record shows that only 309 dwellings were built in 1961, and that present building proposals seem to be based upon a plan to provide dwellings for only one family of every eight who apply;</P>
      <P>(2)  that Dublin County Council despite its acknowledged waiting list of housing applications of 988, in 1961 erected only 52 houses and appeared to have no immediate plans for the construction of more than 90 odd in 1962, or a ratio of one dwelling for every ten applications received; and</P>
      <P>(3)  that the housing plans of these bodies do not make sufficient provision for the accommodation demands arising from the annual number of marriages in the city and county;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> and that, further, Dáil Éireann considers that, in the light of this obvious neglect of responsibility and disregard for the hardships being suffered by thousands of persons living in overcrowded conditions, particularly as Corporation or County Council subtenants and as occupiers of ratinfested apartments, the Minister for Local Government should set up a Dublin City and County Housing Authority charged with the urgent and essential task of speedily providing a dwelling for all Dublin citizens who are in need of a home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move :&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this token Estimate is to enable the Dáil to discuss the 1963/64 Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I propose also to move after the debate on this Estimate a further Supplementary Estimate in which the main item is £1,350,000 for the support of creamery milk prices.  I will deal with this and the other items in the Supplementary Estimate in the course of this speech so that the debate may cover both the Main and Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The total net Estimate for 1963/64 shows an increase of £4,973,590 on the original net Estimate for 1962/63, which amounted to £19,073,410.  Including two Supplementary Estimate provisions for 1962/63, the final total Estimate for that year was, in fact, £24,563,910.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As compared with the original Estimate for 1962/63, the following subheads in particular show substantial increases: N. Marketing, etc., of Dairy Produce; K.15 Losses on Disposal of Wheat; K.14 Payments to Pigs and Bacon Commission; K.8 Lime and <Col N="1355" /> Fertiliser Subsidies; I.6 An Foras Talúntais; K.6 Farm Buildings Scheme.  The only items of note which show a decrease compared with the original Estimate for 1962/63 are concerned with the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, subheads K.11 and KK. 11.</P>
    <P>Deputies have received a memorandum entitled &ldquo;Notes on the Main Activities of the Department&rdquo; giving detailed information on the operations of my Department and on various trade and economic matters with which it is concerned.  As Deputies know, agricultural output and agricultural income reached record levels in 1961.  These records were surpassed in 1962.  In that year, the value of gross agricultural output (including the value of changes in livestock numbers) amounted to some £213 million, or £6 million more than in 1961, and profits of farmers increased by some £4 million to a record figure of £120 million.  As total agricultural income increased from £97 million to £120 million between 1952 and 1962 and as the numbers whose main occupation is agricultural fell by about 74,000, it appears that the increase in per caput agricultural income during that period worked out at about 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>These facts disprove those who have been indulging in rather wild propaganda on this subject.  This propaganda gives the impression that farming profits have been falling in recent years instead of increasing.  It is true, of course, that non-agricultural incomes per head are higher than agricultural incomes.  There is not a country in the world, from the United States to Russia, where this position does not exist. And it exists notwithstanding State assistance to agriculture on an unprecedented scale, especially in the big industrial countries which have far greater resources than small agricultural countries depending on exports of foodstuffs for their economic survival.The fact that this famous &ldquo;income gap&rdquo; is universal does not in itself prove that the gap is justified, but it does prove the enormous difficulties involved in trying to close it. The basic reason for the gap is that commercial demand for food has not <Col N="1356" /> during the past five or ten years kept pace with increasing production, while, at the same time, there has been a continually expanding demand for industrial products.  It is obvious that in a country such as Ireland which has to export at least one-third of its agricultural output to markets where, for some major products, the prices obtainable are below the cost of production here, the task of maintaining and improving the income of farmers and farm workers is particularly formidable.In fact, however, the relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes in Ireland is more favourable to agriculture than in a number of other Western European countries or in the United States itself.</P>
    <P>The financial contribution of the Government to agricultural progress and improvement has risen to a record level &mdash; from a total of some £10,900,000 in 1950-51 to £26,300,000 in 1960-61, £36,800,000 in 1961-62, £37,300,000 in 1962-63, and an estimated £39 million in 1963-64.  The cost of price support, included in these figures, has gone up from £2,800,000 in 1950-51 to £8,500,000 in the present financial year.  As a percentage of total expenditure on the Supply Services (including voted capital services) expenditure on agriculture has mounted from 14 per cent in 1950-51 to an estimated 23 per cent in 1963-64.  Price support for milk alone is costing over £6 million this year, as against £122,000 ten years ago and £2 million five years ago.  This increase is reflected in the fact that the amounts paid out by creameries to their suppliers went up from £13,950,000 in 1950 to £18,330,000 in 1955, £22,680,000 in 1960, and an estimated £28 million in 1963.</P>
    <P>Relief of rates on land has also been greatly expanded.  It cost £3,900,000 in 1950-51, £5,700,000 in 1960-61 and will cost about £8,800,000 in 1963-64. The net average rates now payable on a farm of £20 valuation amount to only £13 16s.; on a farm of £30 valuation, £31 1s.; on a farm of £50 valuation, £65 11s.  Sixty-five per cent of our farms have a valuation not exceeding £20; 80 per cent of our farms do not exceed £30 valuation, and 90 per cent of our farms do not exceed <Col N="1357" /> £50 valuation.  Apart from the employment allowances, the position is that where the valuation does not exceed £20, 70 per cent of the rates are met by State grants; where it does not exceed £30, the percentage met by State grants is 55 per cent and where it does not exceed £50, 43 per cent of the rates is met out of State grants. Of the total rates on agricultural land, 57 per cent is now met by State grants.</P>
    <P>I have gone into some detail on the question of Government assistance to agriculture, including rate reliefs, because of campaigns of misrepresentation and false propaganda which have recently been instigated by certain interests.  They appear to be a somewhat crude attempt to imitate protest meetings and marches which have taken place in some Continental countries where radically different conditions prevail.  In certain Common Market countries, there has been an unprecedented industrial growth, marked by full employment, high wages and strong inflationary pressures.These developments have placed a great deal of strain on agriculture, for which a common policy is now being put into operation.  This involves drastic changes in existing national policies, and growing pains are inevitable.France, which claims a high agricultural potential and has a level of prices which is low relative to other EEC countries is greatly in need of markets which she can only obtain by better access to the markets of her partner countries.  Such access can only be secured by sacrifices on the part of farmers in those countries. German farmers face, perhaps, the most difficult problems of all, being confronted with the prospect of a lowering of prices and drastic structural changes in their whole farming economy in order to conform to the requirements of the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The difficulties referred to will gradually work themselves out as the movement towards a unified policy for the whole region progresses.  Mean-while we must not be surprised that problems, sometimes acute, arise and I should hope that the issues will be <Col N="1358" /> fully understood by farm leaders here and that they will preserve a healthy sense of proportion in dealing with their own domestic problems.</P>
    <P>Let us not belittle the advantages we have.  In this country, with all our difficulties, our agriculture is being enabled through Government measures to develop under more stable conditions than in many other countries. All of our major products are supported, either by the Government directly, as in the case of milk, pigs, barley and wheat, or indirectly through links with British guaranteed prices as in the case of store cattle and store sheep.  Very large amounts are being spent also on schemes to increase productivity, that is, on schemes which help farmers to produce more at less cost per unit of output.  And we have a basically good system of land tenure. Farmers own their holdings subject to payment of annuities which, in nearly all cases, are of relatively trivial amount in relation to the real value of the land.</P>
    <P>It is now over two years since I established the Interdepartmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms, whose report was published in April, 1962.  Many major recommendations of this Committee are already being implemented including the important recommendation that extra financial assistance should be given to county committees in the west, north-west and south-west, to enable them to expand the agricultural advisory service rapidly and adequately.We estimate that, with this extra help, the number of agricultural advisory officers in the area in question will have increased from 102 in 1963 to 183 at the end of 1965.  This is the kind of practical contribution which will help to solve the problems of these areas on a lasting basis.  At least that is my opinion.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of small farms in this country of which any nation could be proud &mdash; thousands of industrious and intelligent men who are making the best use of the many facilities which are now available to enable them to improve their material position in life.  These small farmers know very well that, while the guaranteed <Col N="1359" /> prices for wheat, barley and sugar beet are more useful to the big farmer, they themselves have in the guaranteed prices for milk and pigs a form of State support which is specially adapted to their needs, and, on top of that, they have a wider range of facilities for better farming than have ever existed before &mdash; for example, cheap fertilisers, land reclamation, building grants, improved advisory services, and so on.</P>
    <P>Those who talk glibly about low &ldquo;average&rdquo; incomes ignore the fact that the real small farm problem applies, not to all small farmers but to a proportion of them whose circumstances are particularly unfavourable, due perhaps to unduly small holdings, poor soil, family circumstances, and so on. But the fact is also ignored that, in many such cases, there are other sources of income and that the farming enterprise is often a part-time one. This problem exists in greater degree in other countries, and they are trying to solve it very largely &mdash; as in France and Germany &mdash; by regional development programmes which will provide more local opportunities for work in factories, forestry, tourism, etc. there for those living on very small holdings. Far from signifying the end of the very small farmer, this policy should, in fact, enable him to survive in comfort and dignity.  Our Government are also placing increasing emphasis on the regional approach to the solution of rural problems, including the small farms problems.  Our development programmes in fisheries, forestry and tourism are being intensified and new jobs and additional sources of income are being created which will benefit greatly those under-employed in agriculture.Ideas on what constitutes a small farm very but I think it is true to say that, in this country, there are quite a large proportion of farms which, though not large in area, are capable of providing a good living for farmers who strive to be efficient and make use of the advisory services and the many other forms of aid available to them.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal more specifically with our agricultural programme in the years ahead.  The <Col N="1360" /> programme proposed for the remainder of the present decade is outlined in the Government's Second Programme for Economic Expansion and will be set out in much greater detail in a longer document which we hope to publish early in 1964.  The purpose of publishing an outline of our programme in the first instance was to enable all interested persons and organisations to express their views before the programme is finally crystal-lised in detailed form.  As Deputies know, the main objective proposed in the outline programme is an increase in gross agricultural product by 31 per cent between 1960 and 1970, and the principal means suggested for achieving this target is an increase in the annual output of cattle from less than 1,100,000 in 1960 to 1,500,000 in 1970.  I was very surprised to read in the papers recently that Deputy Dillon had difficulty in understanding the mathematics of our cattle projection, and I hope he has not become mesmerised by the fact that, as everybody knows, the number of cows in this country has traditionally fluctuated around a rather static figure of 1 million to 1,200,000.  In fact, there is no insoluble physical, technical or practical difficulty in achieving the proposed increase in cattle output. What is involved is an increase from around 230,000 a year to something less than 350,000 a year in the rate of intake of in-calf heifers into herds. Since at least 320,000 heifers go into store or fat market at present, there is, clearly, an ample supply of females from which the extra number of in-calf heifers for our herds can be drawn.</P>
    <P>The increase in our cattle numbers, therefore, depends essentially on our being able to induce farmers to keep increased numbers of breeding heifers instead of selling them as stores or fats. In order to give them an incentive for doing this, I propose &mdash; as already announced &mdash; to introduce early in 1964 an important new scheme under which a grant of £15 will be paid to farmers for each additional heifer kept by them above their normal cow-herd replacements.The grants will be payable after these additional heifers have calved and have been added to the herd in each case.  As Deputies are <Col N="1361" /> aware, I had intended to give full details of the scheme when introducing this Estimate.  In view, however, of the fact that the Estimate has been taken later than I had originally expected and as I appreciated the importance of letting farmers know the main features of the scheme as early as possible, I thought it well to make an announcement of a fairly detailed nature on 26th October.  Under the scheme, payments will be made in 1964 on increases in the numbers in herds over this year's level, which is available from BTE Scheme records; in 1965 on increases over 1964, and so on for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme is estimated to rise from about £300,000 in the first year&mdash;1964/65&mdash;to around £1,500,000 in 1966/67 and to about £1,800,000 a year in the later '60's. On the basis of these costings there would be a total net increase of between 500,000 and 600,000 cows and heifers in herds by 1970.  The estimates of annual costs which I have given are not, I should explain, rigid maximum amounts but are the best judgment we can make now of likely expenditure under the scheme.  I believe it is the most simple and direct way of stimulating the increase in cattle production which we all desire.  I should add that I propose to improve certain of the grants payable under the Farm Buildings Scheme and this will help farmers who are increasing their numbers of stock.  I also believe that this is a favourable time for introducing a vigorous cattle expansion policy, for a number of reasons.  First of all, the very gratifying pace at which bovine TB eradication is now proceeding give us every reason to believe that we will have eliminated this disease from the whole country within the next two years.  Secondly, the carrying capacity of our land is steadily increasing, largely as a result of the fertiliser subsidies which have helped to bring about an increase in the use of phosphates by 80 per cent since 1958 and of potash by 50 per cent in three years.  Thirdly, the expansion and improvement in the agricultural advisory services, including the development of specialised advisory <Col N="1362" /> services by the Department of Agriculture, together with the big expansion in agricultural research, will soon place at the disposal of every farmer expert advice to enable him to expand his production on the most efficient possible basis.  We shall, of course, be prepared to discuss the details of the proposed scheme with farm organisations and interested persons.</P>
    <P>So far as can be foreseen, the long-term outlook for beef seems to be better than for many other agricultural products, and, as there can be no doubt at all that this country is particularly well endowed for the production of cattle and cattle products, I am confident that the measures now proposed will meet with success.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, add that, with the successful conclusion of bovine TB eradication in sight, we are now drawing up comprehensive plans for the eradication of brucellosis which, after tuberculosis, must have the highest priority.  The basis of a brucellosis scheme would be a combination of slaughter and vaccination, depending on the circumstances of each area.  We are also actively pushing the wider use of new preparations for treatment of warble fly infestation which the Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory has tested and found to be very successful.</P>
    <P>I believe that our future cattle programme will also be assisted by the importation of American Charolais cattle which my Department arranged during the past year.  These American cattle are, of course, of French descent and their quality is good.  It has not been practicable in the past to arrange for direct importations of breeding stock from Continental Europe, but I think I should tell the Dáil now that, after very careful consideration and following detailed consultations with veterinary experts from other countries, including the United States, we are contemplating the establishment by the Department of Agriculture of a special island quarantine station through which the Department would hope to import breeding stock from Continental Europe of the highest quality obtainable.  Needless to say, any such importations would be surrounded by <Col N="1363" /> the most detailed precautions and checks.  I believe that it is important for our cattle industry here to have access to the best specimens of such breeds as the Dutch Friesian, the German Friesian and the French Charolais.I should, perhaps, mention that the island we have in mind for the quarantine station is Spike Island which, of course, is Army property. This means that there is no possibility of access to the island by unauthorised persons and no possibility of any stock being landed there except our own. Moreover, there is an old fort on the island surrounded by a dry moat, and I am advised that, from the point of view of segregation, this is an ideal site for a quarantine.</P>
    <P>Our future agricultural programme will involve continuing large-scale investment in agriculture by the Government.  It will mean increased outlay on grants to farmers, and increased use of credit also.  This reminds me that the Leader of the principal Opposition Party has been advocating interest-free loans of up to £1,000 for all farmers.  Let us have a look at what this means assuming, of course, the proposal were to be taken seriously.  If an interest-free loan is available to all farmers every farmer will naturally take it whether he wants it or not.  If it is not available to all farmers is there to be some tests as to who should get it, for example, an acreage, a valuation or some other such basis?  Are all applicants to get £1,000 irrespective of their circumstances?</P>
    <P>Let us take it that such attractive terms will immediately secure a very large number of applicants.  As I indicated to the House last May in reply to a question by Deputy Burke the cost of forgoing interest on a loan of £1,000 repayable over 25 years on an annuity basis would be about £950 assuming an interest rate of 6 per cent. If, therefore, 200,000 farmers obtained loans of £1,000 each, the total cost of the scheme over 25 years would be £188,667,000, or £7,547,000 a year. There would also, of course, be the task of providing the capital of £200 million which would be necessary to <Col N="1364" /> make these advances initially.  I personally regard this as pure fantasy and I would now challenge those who talk so glibly on this matter to tell us now what the qualification and the conditions are going to be about which they have so far made no mention.</P>
    <P>Supplemented by State grants, farmers' borrowings for useful development purposes have, in fact, been increasing.  Total advances by commercial banks for agricultural purposes have increased from £21.36 million as at April, 1958, to £42.62 million in April, 1963, and the total amount of loans outstanding on the books of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has increased over the same period from £2.47 million to £5.06 million.  Since the passing of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been endeavouring to provide an easier and expanded flow of agricultural credit with a minimum of formality.  When the 1961 Agricultural Credit Bill was before the Dáil, the Minister for Finance indicated that he would be prepared to accept a lower dividend on share capital provided by the Exchequer while the Corporation build up reasonable reserves to meet any risks involved in a more expansionist policy.  I believe that, when account is also taken of other sources of credit such as the substantial advances made by creameries to their milk suppliers, repayable out of the monthly milk cheques, present credit facilities, supplemented by my Department's grant schemes, are reasonably adequate, I would not be in favour of deliberately encouraging farmers generally or indiscriminately to go into debt by means of so doubtful a device as interest-free loans, and I believe that such a scheme could, in practice, impose serious long-term burdens on our farmers.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, will, no doubt, expect me to say something about recent British proposals for steadying food markets in the United Kingdom.  These proposals would involve British home production as well as imported supplies, and the expressed intention is to bring about more orderly market conditions and to prevent disruptive falls in prices such as have occurred from time to time in recent years. <Col N="1365" /> The British regarded bacon as the product which called most urgently for arrangements of the kind indicated, and during the past few months they were discussing this product with the supplying countries, including Ireland. On our side, we kept farming and trade organisations informed about these discussions, which terminated in a multilateral understanding reached in London last week by Britain and the seven other countries regularly supplying bacon to the British market, namely, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Yugoslavia and Hungary.  We were prepared to co-operate with the other countries mentioned, including the United Kingdom, in an agreement for the sharing of the bacon market in Britain on a basis which would be reasonable from our point of view, particularly if our position on the British pork market would be secured.</P>
    <P>The understanding reached on the supply of bacon to the UK market gives us a share for the year commencing 1st April, 1964, of 27,000 tons out of the minimum total quantity of 615,000 tons agreed for that year.  This compares with about 24½ thousand tons supplied by this country out of a total of 615¾ thousand tons supplied to the UK market in the year ending June, 1963, and may be regarded as a reasonably satisfactory result for us. We will also share on a percentage basis in any increase in the minimum total quantity of bacon which may be agreed later for the supply to the UK market above the level of 620.6 thousand tons.  We will therefore have an assured place in the growth of the British bacon market.  In addition to the initial minimum total quantity of 615,000 tons for the year 1964/65 there will be a reserve quantity of 25,000 tons for that year, the first 5,600 tons of which will be shared by four countries&mdash;UK, Denmark, Poland and Sweden whose overall shares had been slightly modified during the multilateral discussions.</P>
    <P>The multilateral understanding provides for the establishment of a Bacon Market Council consisting of official representatives of the participating countries.  Bacon industry advisers <Col N="1366" /> from each country will also constitute an Industry Panel, to be associated with the Bacon Market Council.  The Council will be concerned with keeping under review the functioning of the understanding and the realisation of its objectives; advising on distribution from the reserve quantity and on the overall quantities to be fixed in future years; considering rates of supply to the British bacon market in an orderly way; and other such matters.  As regards rates of supply, due regard will be had to the normal pattern of supply in the case of a supplier with seasonal production.  The limits on supply fluctuations will not be unnecessarily narrow in the case of suppliers like ourselves who have relatively small shares of the market.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the multilateral understanding relates only to bacon and does not cover fresh pork for consumption as such, in which we have a growing trade in recent years. We have had bilateral discussions about our pork trade with the British authorities and they have told us that they have no intention of imposing any restriction on pork imports.  Our pork has a very good reputation on the British market and our exports of that commodity will have a special place in our plans for the pigmeat industry under the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>Some discussions have also been held about beef and lamb, but these have by no means reached an advanced stage as yet.  These products are, of course, of cardinal importance to our economy and, indeed, our future agricultural and general economic development will require that we have reasonably good markets in which to dispose of the increase in production we foresee under our <i>Second Programme for Economic Development.</i> I, myself, believe that the time is coming when the countries which import substantial quantities of agricultural products must come to sensible terms, especially with smaller nearby countries, which have traditionally been dependent on the export of agricultural products to these larger industrial countries.  Ideally, such arrangement could be envisaged as a consequence of an enlarged <Col N="1367" /> European Economic Community, of which the United Kingdom and Ireland would both be members, and, while nobody, of course, can foretell the future, long-term political and economic forces will, in the opinion of many people, lead the two countries along this road.  In any event, we shall continue to have very close agricultural relations with the neighbouring country and, if these relations are maintained on a sensible and harmonious basis, the outlook for the future should not be unfavourable. Ireland, of course, is one of Britain's biggest customers.  Our imports from Britain in 1962 exceeded in value the imports by Denmark and New Zealand from Britain in that year.  Per head of population, we rank first among the importers of British goods, and in absoluate terms we are the tenth biggest customer for British goods in the whole world.  These natural trade associations and affinities are the proper foundation on which to develop a further expansion in trade between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the Supplementary Estimate for a net sum of £1,215,000 which is also before the Dáil.  The biggest item is an increased provision for the support of creamery milk prices.  This provision, added to the original estimate of £4,668,000 will make a total of £6,018,000 available in support of creamery milk prices during the present financial year.  This is the largest amount of money ever made available by any Government for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I should like to mention here that when An Bord Bainne took over butter stocks from the Butter Marketing Committee on 1st August, 1961, my undertaking to enable the Board to start its operations with a clean sheet was implemented by the Exchequer meeting the Board's estimated export losses on those stocks and on stocks held by creameries at that time.  These losses were related to the prices then obtaining for butter on the export market but as a result of an increase in these prices the Board made an unexpected profit of approximately £380,000 on the disposal of these <Col N="1368" /> stocks.  This profit has not been offset against the Board's other losses and they have been permitted to retain it in full.  It can, therefore, be regarded as an additional Exchequer contribution to the Dairying Industry.  Personally, I am glad to see the steady increase in milk output which our farmers have achieved in recent years with the help of considerable Government assistance both of a technical and financial nature.  We now have the highest support price for milk in our history, notwithstanding that the total output of milk has increased spectacularly during the past five or ten years.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the assistance given from the taxpayer, it will, of course, always be contended on behalf of producers &mdash; as it always has been contended &mdash; that the price of milk is not as high as it should be.  There can be no objection to legitimate efforts by producers to secure an increase in the milk price but it is quite another thing to find an attempt being made to induce creamery societies to refuse to meet marketing commitments to which they are legally bound under statute. Such a course can only be described as irresponsible.  If certain creamery societies should be so unwise as to persist in a course of this kind, it can be countered by a withholding of the creamery milk price allowance paid by my Department to all creameries.</P>
    <P>Another substantial item in the Supplementary Estimate is the sum of £330,000 under the Grain Storage Scheme which I introduced earlier this year and which came to an end in September.  As a result of this scheme, there has been a notable increase in the amount of grain storage capacity and grain drying facilities, and this has contributed in no small way to the efficient handling of the 1963 harvest.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also includes £100,000 for additional expenditure on farm building grants. We under-estimated the extent to which farmers would avail of this Scheme in the present financial year. Total expenditure is now estimated at about £1,100,000.  It is very encouraging that farmers are showing such eagerness to avail of this very useful improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> In the Supplementary Estimate we are also asking for an additional £100,000 for losses on disposal of the 1962 wheat crop.  The total cost of Exchequer support to wheat growers since 1957 now amounts to no less than £11 million.</P>
    <P>The fertilisers subsidy is another item on which we have to ask for additional money to the tune of £150,000.  This is due to the fact that the use of phosphatic fertilisers in the present year is likely to be considerably higher than we anticipated when the Estimate was being prepared.  As I have already mentioned, the use of phosphatic fertilisers has now increased by about 80 per cent compared with 1958.</P>
    <P>I am also asking for a sum not exceeding £10,000 to be paid to the National Farmers Association as a contribution to their expenses in connection with the Conference of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers which was held in Bray earlier in 1963.  This is a maximum sum, and the actual amount required may prove to be less when statements of expenditure have been received and duly examined.  Conferences of this kind are expensive, and I readily agreed to the request of the NFA for a contribution in this case.</P>
    <P>The estimated net saving on the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme over the provision made in the Estimate, that is, a fall in gross expenditure of £2,118,205, counter-balanced to the extent of £1,285,000 by a consequential deficiency in Appropriations in Aid, does not, of course, mean any slackening in the pace of eradication.  It means, on the contrary, that the number of reactors has proved to be less than we anticipated and that eradication has made even greater strides than we hoped when the Estimate was being framed about a year ago.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3 of the Supplementary Estimate represents a payment to the Food and Agriculture Organisation in respect of the project we are sponsoring in Tanganyika under the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.  The project <Col N="1370" /> will be administered through FAO which has very wide experience of such matters, and, while the field cost of the project will be met from the national collection organised by the Irish Red Cross Society, the Government have agreed to meet the technical and administrative servicing costs incurred by FAO in organising and supervising the project.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish Red Cross Society for having already raised the level of the collection to the substantial figure of £94,000.  I understand since that figure was recorded that it is nearer to £100,000 now, and to thank them for agreeing to continue the collection until 1965.  Our Tanganyikan project will consist of the establishment of a village settlement scheme and a related farmers' training centre. We have had detailed discussions about the project with the Minister for Agriculture of Tanganyika and representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and I am satisfied that the project which will be of a very practical nature, will represent an appreciable contribution to the agricultural development of Tanganyika and will afford abundant evidence of the generosity of the Irish people when called upon to help by voluntary contributions people in other parts of the world whose lot is difficult and who have a tremendous task facing them in getting their economic development under way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that, as usual, I am asking the Dáil to make available an increased amount of money for agriculture.  I do not think that the Dáil will grudge this amount, large though it is, for the further development and support of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as the Minister appreciates that my felicitations refer to his personal and not to his political health, I wish to congratulate him on reaching 40 years in public life.  I want to say that in the past three years when he <Col N="1371" /> comes in here, he seems to bring with him rose-coloured spectacles and he produces figures which seem to indicate that the agricultural industry is well and that the farmers are doing better than they are.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the figure of £213 million and the figure I had was £211 million which was up £5 million on the figure for 1961.  This was gross agricultural output and at the same time, the costs were up so that the net output was only up by £1,800,000.  If we look at the table of statistics which was issued at the time of the Budget we will see at the bottom of Table Six that the output takes account only of the costs of seeds and fertiliser; it does not take account of the cost of tractors, increasing labour cost and increased living costs so that the net agricultural output in 1962 was far less than it was in 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is bunkum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the figures. I merely give them as I take them from the Government's own Book of Statistics issued with the Budget.  These are the figures we must consider.  The last figure we have for agricultural prices is that for September, 1963 and compared with the base 100 for 1953 that figure is 101.  The figure for August was 100.5 and for most of last year it was under 100 so that the farmer was not really getting as much for his produce as he was in 1953.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the position in relation to the things he has to buy. If we look again at the economic statistics we will find in Table 14 that the consumer price index is given at 125.3 for 1962 so the farmer had to pay 25/- for every £1 he paid in 1953, although he got £1 for every pound's worth he sold in 1953.  That means that his income has decreased by 25 per cent in those 10 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have another indication in the percentage of the national income that the farmer enjoys.  While in previous years we find that he enjoyed 25 per cent and 23 per cent of the national income his share in 1961 was 20 per cent and that has decreased in <Col N="1372" /> 1962 to 18 per cent.  And at the same time, everybody will admit that the farmer is the corner-stone on which all our prosperity must be based.</P>
    <P>The output of cattle was something better in 1962 than in 1961, but 1961 was a low year and the previous years were much better.  The previous year gave us a stock of cattle of 1,168,000 head but in 1962 this dropped to 968,000 head.</P>
    <P>Even though the figures for the current year up to last August are better all round than those in 1962 I do not see any great improvement in our position.  I am the first to agree that there are improvements in the numbers of our breeding stocks but at the same time I am quite certain that there is no real improvement over the past three years in the output of cattle which is what we must all live on.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a summary of the position in 1963 in a broad way before I go into greater detail on these matters.  There was some increase in our breeding stocks of cattle but there was a reduction in the number of sheep and pigs, two matters that are most regrettable.  Pigs are the poor man's friend and our grassland is not stocked as it should be stocked. Sheep have a low capital value in relation to profits and a higher rate of employment on the land.  At the same time, we had a decrease of 6.4 per cent in the area under grain crops. At the same time, in the high priced product, wheat, we had a reduction of 25 per cent.  This meant, if one is to take one ton per statute acre &mdash; a figure usually used for the production of wheat &mdash; and the very low price of £25 per ton, a reduction, in terms of farmer's income, of over £2 million. That is the year the Minister puts on his rose-pink spectacles.  That is the year in which he says we have stepped forward.  I do not think we have.</P>
    <P>There has also been the question of subsidy for heifers which the Minister has now announced.  There are various flaws in this scheme &mdash; which we welcome as a measure of improvement but a very small measure of improvement. One of the flaws is that while a large farmer may be in a position to spend <Col N="1373" /> money to increase the amount of space for cows, to increase his herd numbers spectacularly, the small farmer who has been obeying all he has been asked to do over the years and who has brought himself to the optimum will gain no money from this scheme whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Take a man in the west with maybe five or six cows.  It will be very hard for such a man to bring his number up to seven or eight.  When he gets to seven, all he will get is £15 and he will never get another one until he steps up to eight. On the other hand, a man with 30 cows can more easily increase the number to 40 and thus make it worth while in one year.  This scheme will definitely help but to such a small and measured extent that it is not anything like what the Minister would like us to believe it is.  Furthermore, his figures confuse me.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how he estimates that at the end of the period he will have 120,000 new heifers, apart from replacements, entering the cow herds each year so that the scheme will cost £1,800,000 at that period.  Bear in mind that the largest increase in the number of heifers recorded so far has been less than 20,000 and the increase this year is 12,000.</P>
    <P>We feel that these figures are just something out of arithmetic, which seems to be what has governed the blue book on Economic Expansion. Without doubt, the whole thing is related to the statement of page 28 of that book whereby a major aim of the Second Programme is &ldquo;to raise the output of cattle from 1,046,000 in 1960 to 1,500,000 in 1970, an increase of 454,000 or 43 per cent almost all of which will be for export.&rdquo; We do not believe &mdash; and we would be the ones who would make every effort to bring it about&mdash;that just can be done. While it is necessary for the Minister, in producing this scheme which is apparently the foundation on which he is trying to build, to make a statement that in the late 1970's he expects an extra number of heifers in cow herds in each year to prove his arithmetical formula we are of the opinion that the figure he states could not be achieved and will not be achieved and therefore is nothing but in the nature of <Col N="1374" /> something to keep people happy if they will only believe it.</P>
    <P>Do not think that this question of calf subsidies and heifer subsidies has not been considered by the Party on this side of the House.  I should like to quote the Leader of the Opposition on the Agricultural Resolution at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis when he said, in February, 1962:</P>
    <P>It would be worth while examining the calf bounty for calves born from attested cows and heifers.  This would be a material incentive to dairy farmers to have their herds attested, and at the same time increase the number of cows and heifers in the country.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, February 28th, 1962, again from the <i>Irish Press</i> of that day, the Leader of the Opposition was reported as saying:</P>
    <P>That it would be worth examining an incentive along the lines of a calf bounty for calves born of attested cows or heifers.</P>
    <P>I myself referred to it on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture in 1962 as reported in the Official Report, Volume 196, column 2386 of 17th July, 1962.  I said:</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion from this side some months ago that a subsidy on calves might possibly be considered.We have not all the information here and cannot readily get it, so I am not suggesting that that would be a positive answer, but it is something that might be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently has considered our suggestions.  We believe that the scheme he has produced is a watered-down version of what we would have done.  We wish him well but we do not believe that the figures that have been quoted for it will be realised nor do we believe that the Minister's Party intend to realise it.</P>
    <P>A question which occupies us each year on this Estimate is the number of people on the land.  It has come to be accepted by politicians and by all sorts of people in various walks of life who like to consider these things <Col N="1375" /> that there will be fewer and fewer people on the land.  It is quite true to say that there will be a certain wastage of employment on the land because of a greater economy of effort, greater mechanisation, more modern ways of doing things.  But to say that there will be fewer and fewer people on the land in each progressive year is to suggest that at the moment we are at the optimum of efficiency; that at present, there are no new opportunities for employment on the land.</P>
    <P>The figure of 19,000 fewer on the land in 1962 we regard as a catastrophe.  The fact that this figure was balanced only by a tiny increase of 3,600 persons in industry in the same year further highlights and magnifies that catastrophe.  It is our belief that while there may be fewer people engaged in specific tasks there are more opportunities for work on the land.  We believe that the Party now in power is not investigating those opportunities and that if there were increases in production it would take more people to produce the increased volume.</P>
    <P>The Government have stated in their blue book that they accept 1.8 per cent as the annual drop until 1970 in the numbers employed on the land and 2.7 per cent as the annual increase in production.  In Northern Ireland the number of people who left the land in each one year of the past 10 years is 1,000.  We on this side do not accept the glib statement by professors of economics, politicians and all these people that in respect of every person who leaves the land of Ireland there is no opportunity to employ another. We regard the figure of 19,000 fewer people on the land in 1962 as a national catastrophe and that if there were to be any decrease, and we do not accept that there should be, it should be far lower than that figure.  The fact that in another part of this island the decrease in each one of ten years was only 1,000 whereas our figure was 19,000 in one year indicates the failure of the Government to do what they should do for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>If one wants to indulge in arithmetic, <Col N="1376" /> there is no doubt the figure of 2.7 per cent increase in agricultural output, the annual amount laid down in the Government's Blue Book, would be far exceeded if the Minister's statement on the increase in the output of cattle were realised.  That is where the people who exist on statistics and arithmetic and produce something that is supposed to be accepted as a sugar-coated pill by the people, fall down.  Anybody who likes to examine the arithmetic of that will see that if we could do what the Minister says, we would far exceed the figures laid down.  We do not believe the Government want to do this and that is the great difference between them and ourselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is an indication of how the Government feel about agricultural production that they did not include a farmer in the national Economic Council, nor did they give representation to a farming organisation or anybody having direct dealings with agriculture.These are the facts that must be remembered and it must also be remembered that agriculture, according to figures published in <i>Economic Statistics</i> circulated by the Government before the last Budget, employed 360,800 and that the number employed in manufacturing industry at the same time was only 164,000.  We had a fall of 19,000 taken into account in that figure of 360,800 and yet in a figure far less than half of that, we got an increase of only 3,600 people.  Where are we going?  Who has succeeded in getting this thing across that agriculture is a backwater, that it must survive in the backwoods, that the opportunities are not there and that the political effort of bringing people with you and trying to make them do things that will give them a decent standard of living, make them remain on the land, is a bad political bet? That is something that must change and we, on this side, are ready and willing to make the effort to make that change.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent years of marketing of agricultural produce, its supply and quality.  Clearly, the first step the Government must take is a realisation that if we have a constant supply of high quality agricultural goods available and can maintain <Col N="1377" /> that supply, it is only then we can expect to sell.  Let us remember our experience with butter.  At a time when Denmark was regulating her exports of butter to Britain to a variation, year by year, of not more than two per cent, we sent almost no butter to Britain in 1959&mdash;which was a dry year &mdash; and as a result, our quota, when fixed by GATT and accepted by Britain, was very small.  I believe they have helped out with that since in a temporary fashion, but that is the sort of thing in which we go wrong.</P>
    <P>That consistency of supply that is required can only be achieved by the Government setting out to get increased production which will secure us valuable markets, even though it may create losses and political difficulties.That is the belief of this side of the House&mdash;that the Government do not want that, that what they want to do is come here and say: &ldquo;We had to pay a little more for agriculture this year than last&rdquo;, or, even &ldquo;a great deal more&rdquo;.  We believe that the real effort is to pay as little as possible and that they feel any constant increase in production is something that will cause political difficulties for them.</P>
    <P>There is also the aggressive line that should be taken in relation to countries that do not take from us at least as much as we take from them. We have a great opportunity there by taking an aggressive line and trying to ensure that these countries buy from us at least almost as much as we buy from them.  For instance, it is hard to think that France, with its millions, bought only £1,475,000 worth of agricultural produce from us in 1963: it is extraordinary that quotas were fixed with Federal Germany whereby we were restricted to £1,650,000 of carcase beef, 250 tons of canned meat and 250 tons of mutton and lamb.  To Belgium, we exported £900,000 worth of agricultural goods &mdash; a drop from the previous year for which the figure was £1,325,000.  These are extremely small figures and we want to know did the Government say to these countries: &ldquo;If we buy from you, will you not buy more from us?&rdquo; Did they take that aggressive bargaining line?  Did they say to Holland that she should <Col N="1378" /> take more from us than the £1,680,000 worth they did purchase, which showed a reduction on the £2,010,000 worth they took in 1961?</P>
    <P>I could go on with this list for a long time but I do not think I need elaborate.  We all know these countries &mdash; I drive a German car myself.  Can we not succeed in getting, by real bargaining, a greater share in these markets for our agricultural produce? I think we can and that it is essential that we do.</P>
    <P>The position about marketing makes it clear that we must market branded products.  I have been asking a series of questions here year after year on branded butter and eventually An Bord Bainne brought out Kerrygold butter.  I know advertising expenses of Kerrygold are quite high but I would regard those as more of a capital charge in the first years than an actual expense to be charged against each ton of butter exported.  That is how a businessman would do it, and would have to do it if he wanted to gain access to a market.  When we remember that Kerrygold in certain markets gets a premium of as much as £22 per ton, it is a big satisfaction to realise that by advertising, if you have high quality and constancy of supply, you can gain such a premium by selling to the housewife rather than the retailer. You put yourself in the position that the housewife is asking the retailer for your product.  That ensures you a market and when quotas are being fixed again, in addition to considering the amount sent in dry years and wet years, the British Government or GATT must also consider that you have established yourself to such an extent with your branded product that the citizens of the country in question want your branded product and no other.</P>
    <P>These are simple facts which have governed business not for decades but for centuries.  They have been exploited to the full in the last couple of decades and it is, therefore, irritating to us to find that in 1957, when this Government took office, they voted a sum of £250,000 for agricultural marketing and the way in which the Minister for Finance got rid of the last of that sum &mdash; I think some £130,000 &mdash; not so long <Col N="1379" /> ago was by passing it over to An Bord Bainne, which was just another way of putting it into a kitty where it would benefit nobody solely for the purpose of preventing Deputy T. Lynch constantly asking questions as to how much of £250,000 voted several years ago had been spent.  For the four years following 1957 all that was spent was the expenses of certain advisory committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned advisory services and I am sorry that the scheme announced in respect of the west of Ireland has not been made general throughout the country.  There is great necessity in the west for increased advisory services, but we believe there is fantastic necessity for an increase everywhere in such services.The Minister has been very dilatory in this matter.  What we want to get across&mdash;the Minister has not mentioned it &mdash; is that one must have a correlation between advisory services and actual production on the farms. We would prefer an advisory service manned by personnel who would call at the farm and suggest new production on the farm or a change in existing production.  The advisory officer should bring home to the farmer the benefits of the operation, even costing it for him, if necessary, and showing the profits and advantages to be gained by modern methods of husbandry.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite scathing in his comments of the plan adumbrated by the leader of the main Opposition, the plan to give £1,000 interest free loans.  We would operate these loans in the way I have just suggested.  The leader of the main Opposition has made it quite clear, as have other speakers on this side on many occasions, that these loans would be given to farmers who would co-operate with the advisory officers in specific schemes designed to increase production.  That is how we intend to implement this scheme.</P>
    <P>The arithmetic adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party is of no interest to us.  The Minister produced a glorious figure of £7 million.  While he was talking about it I had a look at the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> If one takes <Col N="1380" /> the 30-acre farm, in which the schemes would be relatively small schemes, one finds that out of a total of 360,000 holdings there are 140,000 30-acre farms or less.  This question of the maximum sum and all the difficulties are just a way of deprecating what we believe should be a comprehensive scheme to help the small farmer and Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>We would hope that every one of these schemes in which an interest-free loan of £1,000 would be given would constitute a pilot scheme, a scheme in which every neighbouring farmer could see the work done.  Each operation would be under the guidance of the advisory officer.  That is the way we want to do it.  There is nothing wrong in it.  The arithmetic produced by the Minister does not detract one whit from it.  Even if it were the sum mentioned by the Minister, the difference between the Minister and this side of the House is that we are prepared to &ldquo;go it&rdquo;, whatever it costs.  I have some figures I shall quote later to support my argument.  The Minister would prefer to produce a small, measured scheme, such as that in relation to the subsidy for heifers, and then support that with fallacious arithmetic in an effort to prove it is something really worth while.</P>
    <P>Credit facilities for farmers must be considered.  I asked the Minister today the source of long-term capital available to farmers, with no spare money of their own, who wish to drain their land and who cannot avail of section (b)  of the Land Project now discontinued.The answer I got was that the alternative sources of credit are the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the commercial banks.  I have nothing but praise for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but up to a few years ago that body did not give long-term loans. That is not their function.</P>

      <P>Does he think it is as good a proposition as having it put on the farmer's land annuity over 35 years?  I am a borrower myself from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, an excellent institution, and I know that they will not give you 100 per cent of the cost of your land drainage. No ordinary financial institution will. The Minister mentioned the commercial banks.  No commercial bank will give more than 50 per cent of the cost.  I want to say quite categorically now that it is the decision of this Party, when we take office, to reinstitute section (b) of the Land Project thereby ensuring that the small farmer, and the poor farmer, will be in a position to avail of the land project to drain his land, giving him a repayment period of 35 years on his land annuity.</P>
      <P>We believe credit facilities and advisory facilities should be interrelated.The last few years have seen fairly free credit but the trouble will be not merely to provide the money to capitalise on our 12,000,000 acres of arable land but also the proper application of it.  We are quite determined, when we are re-elected, to interrelate credit facilities and advisory services and ensure that advisory work is related to actual progress on the farms.  Individual efforts will be made, substantiated by our pilot schemes of up to £1,000 interest free loans, to ensure that, by example, proper advisory services and a correct appreciation of the asset we have for exploitation, the land of Ireland will give its full contribution to the nation's economy as against the position I outlined at the start in which there is a drop from 25 per cent of the national income to 20 per cent, to 18 per cent, with 19,000 fewer people on the land and agricultural prices standing at the same level as they did in 1953, while the cost of the things the farmer has to buy increased by 25.3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I must mention, though I dislike having to do so.  The Minister's relations &mdash; the Minister confirmed this in his own speech &mdash; with farming bodies are bad.  We had during the year the Bord Gráin row. <Col N="1382" /> I want to say I believe that in this instance the Minister was seriously at fault.  It is quite wrong for the Minister in the use of his office to select individuals for appointment to the Board, when the practice should have been to leave it to the bodies concerned to select their representatives.In my capacity as a merchant, I was present at a meeting at which we voted to select our representatives. When it came to farming, the farming organisations were allowed to propose certain people, but then the Minister said: &ldquo;I shall select others myself&rdquo;. That is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>At page 4 of his statement, the Minister refers to what he called campaigns of false representations and said there appeared to have been here a somewhat crude attempt to imitate protest meetings and marches that have taken place in continental countries where radically different conditions prevailed. He should realise by now that every Department must be ready for criticism and I suggest to the Minister that now and again he should look at the <i>That Was the Week That Was</i> programme on Saturday nights on BBC television or some of the other similar broadcasts from that station.  He would then realise what the public man has to put up with, and smile if he can.</P>
    <P>The Minister's function now is to lead the farmers, to strive to get the farmers with him.  I was shocked to see a reply to the Editor of the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> in <i>Farming Bulletin</i> recently.  I do not care whether the Minister was right or wrong: an antagonistic reply of that nature should not have been made. Once one is in public life one must realise he is liable to be a butt.  The Minister, in my view, has been indulging in unseemly and unnecessary vituperation.The relationship between the farming bodies and the Minister is of great importance ultimately and no matter how much it irritates, the Minister should not indulge in this behaviour.</P>
    <P>Another exercise that is being performed almost hourly is the assessment of the bill against the farmer and against agriculture.  Nothing annoys us more on this side of the House than the suggestion that the farmers are <Col N="1383" /> living off the lady who sells hats in Grafton Street.  It is old now: we have had it every year.  I do not think the <i>Farming Bulletin</i> helped when it produced a two-page list of the things which they alleged the farmers were getting in the form of State aid to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to differentiate between State aid to agriculture and State aid to the State generally.  I do not concede, for instance, that a single pound spent on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis benefited the farmer by a single penny.  I am quite satisfied that the total operation, so necessary and, thank God, now reaching a successful conclusion, was in defence of exports, was in defence, incidentally, of the lady who sells hats in Grafton Street. This exercise of totting up the bill against agriculture is, therefore, something that should not be indulged in. This list in the Bulletin, to which I have just referred, includes the bill in respect of butter and butter products for 1963-64 at £6,418,000 but they do not mention the fact that the price of milk in Norway is 3s.  0½d., in the UK, 2s. 10½., Italy, 2s 7d., Netherlands, 2s. 6½., Germany, 2s. 4d., Denmark and Belgium, 2s. 3d., France 2s. 1½d. and in Ireland 1s. 9½d.</P>

      <P>The average price for milk in this country, without skim, is 1s. 9½d.  The figures I am quoting in respect of European countries are taken from a report of the EEC and laid before this House on 13th June, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not concede that arterial drainage is something specifically for the benefit of farmers.  This is work that should have been done years ago, and would have been done were it not for our troubled record of strife.  It benefits everybody in the country; it is work that is largely done to protect us from further flooding rather than to improve the lot of the farmer and give <Col N="1384" /> him 10 or 15 extra acres on his holding. Often it does, but the farmer pays his share.</P>
    <P>I do not concede that bacon factory grants are things that should be laid against the farmers, that Gaeltacht and congested area schemes are a bill to be laid against the farmers.  I do not concede that Departmental capital expenditure on lands and buildings is a bill to be laid against the farmers. Neither do I concede that relief of rate charges, which is estimated at a large figure for the current financial year, is a bill to be laid at the door of the farmers.  I do not believe capital for the Agricultural Credit Company is a bill that can be laid against the farmers because when a farmer goes to that excellent organisation, he pays his interest.  These are the sort of things I should like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>The big thing is that in the publication of figures in this form you create a situation of town versus country, of agriculture versus industry.  Our view has been and will continue to be that we must have both arms.  Industry needs a good agriculture which will buy a proportion of its products and so let agriculture produce more for export.  There is the old saying that we eat one-third, sell six at home and export one-third.  The market for agricultural produce is of the utmost importance to the farmer, and the production of lists of figures such as I have referred to leads to a situation where one part of the community begins to think the other is taking the bread out of its mouth.  That is not the type of atmosphere that will lead to a prosperous nation.  We must strive always to live together, not begrudging the other, co-operating one with the other.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to a discussion of our grain crops.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our grain crops are down by 6.4 per cent.</P>
