      <P>It has been calculated by my Department that to extend the present services, other than those designed to provide simply for maintenance, such as the county home service and the payment of allowances to disabled persons, to the entire population, without charge and subject to some modifications which these extensions would render necessary, would result in a total expenditure from central and local taxation of the order of £35 million a year, excluding capital expenditure. This would represent an increase of some £13 million on the estimated expenditure in the present financial year.  On the existing financial basis, £6.5 million of this annual increase would be met from local taxation and £6.5 million would represent the additional cost to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will now state, further to a reply of 1st May on the subject of income tax liability of co-operatives in which he stated that a precise estimate of the annual return from the proposed taxation had not been made, whether any estimate whatever of the annual return from this tax was made prior to the decision to impose it; and, if so, what was the estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 1st May, a prime purpose of the proposed legislation in question is to prevent abuse of the existing exemption. <Col N="204" /> In this connection, therefore, the proposed charge is not so much intended to bring in additional revenue as to stop a leakage which, if not checked, could lead to serious loss of revenue.  I cannot say what the loss of tax would ultimately amount to since it would depend on the extent to which advantage would be taken of the existing position.  Recent indications, however, are that this was becoming more widespread and I am satisfied that, if the abuse was not ended, the loss might soon amount to over £100,000 a year.</P>

      <P>An estimate of yield is always made in regard to a tax charge which is imposed with a view to producing revenue.  Where, however, the basic purpose of the charge is to prevent tax avoidance or in any other respect to ensure equity of incidence, the yield is not necessarily of importance.</P>

      <P>The portions of Donegal Castle in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works for preservation as a national monument comprise only the structure and curtain walls which are generally in good condition.  The Commissioners have been aware for some time that the adjoining areas were not all that could be desired but these were not under their control and they had no function in regard to them.  I understand that the position has recently changed.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application for a grant is examined by experienced technical officers of my Department who satisfy themselves from their first-hand knowledge that it is sound and genuine before recommending a grant.  I am not aware of any abuses, but, if Deputy Sheridan thinks he knows of any and supplies me with the requisite information, <Col N="209" /> I shall be glad to investigate the matter fully.</P>
    <P>It is a condition of the scheme that all applications for grants must be accompanied by plans and specifications prepared by a qualified architect and engineer, who must subsequently certify that the storage accommodation provided is of sound and durable construction and suitable for storage of a stated quantity of grain.</P>
    <P>A total of 191 applications was received, and up to today approvals have issued in 35 cases.  The remainder will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that railways employees are, in accordance with their conditions of service, subject to transfer throughout the system.  An employee who becomes available for transfer because of the closing of a branch line and for whom a vacancy exists elsewhere is not redundant and does not qualify for redundancy compensation under the Transport Acts.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that if a person employed as a linesman between Navan and Kells, who has his family living there, is offered a job in Skibbereen or Letter-kenny it is a worsening of his conditions? In those circumstances, will he consider giving redundancy pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very long period before the operation of the Transport Act it has always been a condition of service of CIE rail employees that they may be obliged to transfer from one area to another.  If any CIE employee feels his conditions have been worsened he can appeal to the arbitrator who has been appointed <Col N="211" /> for that purpose.  Complaints of that kind are generally considered by the trade union concerned and CIE management.  That is the way it has proceeded.  On the whole, I would say it has worked satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>CIE informed me some time ago that because of the losses on the Hill of Howth bus services they were anxious to transfer the services to any operator who would be willing to operate them.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the services in this manner would require the issue of a road passenger licence or licences by me under the Road Transport Act, 1932.  I informed CIE that if they could find an experienced private operator who could be depended upon to provide a regular public service with an acceptable timetable and at acceptable charges I would not rule out the possibility that the service might be transferred to him.  I made it clear to the board, however, that I would not in any circumstances visualise a position in which the residents of the Hill of Howth and the summer visitors would be deprived of a regular bus service and that in advance of any transfer I would expect from CIE an undertaking that they would immediately resume operations in the event that the private operator ceased to provide services or failed to comply with the conditions of any licence which I might grant to him.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware CIE do not at present contemplate the handing over of any other services, economic or uneconomic, to private enterprise.</P>

      <P>I have not made any recent review of profit margins in the trades mentioned by the Deputy but I am aware, from the report of the Fair <Col N="217" /> Trade Commission of their inquiry into the grocery trade in 1955, that net profits in that trade are modest. While a competitive situation may create difficulties for individual traders, many small shopkeepers have surmounted these difficulties by effecting cost economies through co-operation and the adoption of new techniques of trading.  The small trader can also exploit the advantages of personal service and convenience of location.  I do not think that it would be wise in present circumstances to interfere with the free play of competitive forces which provide the incentive to efficiency in the distributive trades.</P>

      <P>Insurance companies licensed to carry on business in this country are required to deposit with me annually, audited returns in the form laid down in the Insurance Acts.  Copies of the returns must be laid annually before both Houses of the Oireachtas and copies must also be made available to the public for inspection in the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>The latest accounts of the Equitable Insurance Company Limited were received in my Department on 3rd April, 1963.

It is likely that there will not be sufficient assets there.  Therefore, it would be in the interests of those insured with the company to look after their policies.  In the meantime, in so far as motor insurance is concerned, there is in existence the Motor Insurance Bureau which may provide for third party compensation claims when an insured motorist finds himself not covered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they must submit their accounts within six months of the end of the financial year which these accounts covered&mdash;1962.  The Minister has discretion to extend the period by a further three months, which is usually given in the case of a company seeking such concession.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that Section 3 of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, is being interpreted in such a way that only farmers and farm labourers are entitled to get an instalment of a reconstruction grant when half the work is completed, and that this is a worsening of the position, as other workers were similarly entitled before the passing of this Act; and if he is in a position to revert to the original arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the passing of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, payments of instalments of reconstruction grants were made only to farmers and &ldquo;agricultural labourers&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;Agricultural Labourer&rdquo; was discontinued on the passing of the 1962 Act, and was substituted by the definition &ldquo;person who derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit <Col N="224" /> of agriculture&rdquo;.  The effect is that instalments are now restricted to farmers and genuine agricultural workers and I do not propose to extend the concession to other classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in view of the fact that practically all persons working in country districts were able, until the passing of this Act, to get an instalment when repairing a house and, in those circumstances, and particularly in view of the fact that the position is much worse now, as such persons cannot get an instalment, will he reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I think the gradual build-up of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; to a point where everybody was an agricultural labourer for the purposes of these Acts made the position rather ludicrous.  The idea was that farmers and genuine agricultural labourers should get this preferential treatment and in the 1962 Act the new definition confines such preferential treatment to those two categories.  If it is given to everybody, it is no longer preferential.  In addition, I would say that even if it were feasible and desirable that the treatment should be extended to all and sundry, we just have not got the staff to do it.  In fact, it is difficult enough to try to get the applications we have paid once, not to mind having them paid twice and making two jobs out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The technical difficulties are the cause of this change&mdash;the fact that it was claimed that there were not enough engineers to examine the work when it was half completed.  In view of the fact that this was not explained when the Bill was going through the House, that everybody was led to believe that there was no change in the position and that people now are finding that they cannot proceed with work because they will not get an instalment of the grant, would the Minister reconsider the matter?</P>

      <P>If they misled themselves as to what was in it, I cannot redress that at this stage.  I would say that this is preferential treatment, which has been given down the years as preferential treatment to these categories.  It has merely been defined as such now.  That definition exists.  In addition, there are real practical difficulties as to why it should not be extended to all and sundry.  I do not agree that, in the final analysis, the restriction to these categories imposes an undue hardship because the grants are not paid in two parts.  It is much better to get the grant in whole rather than in part.  Giving it in parts might make it an interminable operation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if the Land Commission have yet decided to whom the remaining farm on the Beggan Estate, Diamer, Crossakiel, County Meath is to be allocated.</P>

      <P>Of an original area of 169 acres on this estate, 123 acres were allotted last spring.  A final decision has not yet been reached regarding the allocation of the balance of the estate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it seems ridiculous to hold back what amounts to one fairly decent farm in an estate like this?  Would the Land Commission not make some attempt to decide to whom they will give it or is it being used simply to placate those in the area who are under the impression they still have favour with the powers that be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no such thing.  I told the Deputy they have not reached a final decision on the matter.  They expect to do so by next spring.  That is all I can say.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to instal a second switchboard in Templemore post office to enable telephones to be provided for 16 applicants some of whom applied in 1961.  The subpostmaster has objected to taking on any additional telephone work and he has refused permission for the installation of the second switchboard in contravention of the terms of his appointment which stipulate that he will make proper provision for postal, telegraph and telephone work.  All attempts to persuade the subpostmaster to change his mind were unsuccessful and, as it is necessary to give service to the waiting applicants, there was no alternative to giving him notice of termination of his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last Wednesday, I had mentioned industrial relations and was dealing with industrial grants.  I wish to revert for a moment to industrial relations because of remarks passed to-day by Deputies Tully and T. Lynch about the non-intervention of the Minister for Transport and Power in the <Col N="248" /> recent CIE bus strike.  It is only fair to the Minister to say that so far as it is the function of any member of the Government to intervene in industrial relations matters, it is the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. So far as the bus strike is concerned, the Minister for Transport and Power would be doubly inhibited in any attempt at intervention in that he would be usurping the function of another Minister and he is the Minister responsible for CIE.  The Minister for Transport and Power has had that charge levelled against him inside and outside the House for a number of weeks past.  He has made no attempt to defend himself and in view of the two suggestions made against him this afternoon, it is only fair for me to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One must have regard to the amount of public hardship and inconvenience caused by such strikes. It is not desirable that a member of the Government should intervene in strikes at all, and if he does, it is when the hardship suffered by the public is such that his intervention would appear to be necessary.</P>
      <P>In regard to industrial grants, I refer to the charge&mdash;repeated in this House during the debate&mdash;that it is easier for a non-national than a national to get grants under the Industrial Grants, and Undeveloped Areas Acts.  I said I thought that the figures I had given in the course of the debate on the amendment of these Acts early in the year would have to be scotched by false impressions that might be abroad in this respect.  I have since taken the trouble to find out what the most recent figures are for grants given to nationals, to non-nationals and to nationals and non-nationals in association with each other.</P>

    <P>As at 31st December last, 67 grants had been approved under the Industrial Grants Act.  The number of promotions sponsored by foreign promoters was 33 and by Irish promoters <Col N="249" /> 28 and six projects had joint Irish and foreign participation.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 123 grants were approved up to 31st December, 1962, the number of promotions sponsored by foreign promoters was 59; by Irish promoters, 58 and there were six projects with joint Irish and foreign participation.  These figures clearly prove the allegations are absolutely unfounded and that Deputies should think before they come in here and lightly make such charges.</P>
    <P>The allegation made by Deputy Clinton about procrastination on the part of the authorities who examine and process industrial proposals is not in accordance with the facts.  It is true that some delay might occur in connection with some proposals for industrial projects which involve the giving of grants or the making of loans by the Industrial Credit Company, but it is only because in any such case there may be a weakness or some other problem affecting the proposal itself that the delay arises. The experience is that the number of complaints has been very small.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made by Deputy Clinton was that there seems to be a bias against Dublin.  I was surprised some western Fine Gael Deputies did not take up the challenge and repeat what they said on a number of occasions previously, that any bias in the giving of grants is in favour of Dublin. I suppose, with the by-election pending in Dublin, it would not be good politics for them to deny what Deputy Clinton said but the fact is that Dublin is doing very well under the industrial grants legislation and if the complaints made by Deputy Clinton's colleagues from western counties and other rural areas are true, there is no justification for Deputy Clinton's allegation.  I assure the House that is the case.</P>
    <P>There is only one other specific matter in this connection that I might refer to, that is, the reference by Deputy Harte of Donegal to a proposal in connection with the processing of Muckish sand.  I have heard about this proposal.  There was a suggestion, however, that certain persons <Col N="250" /> associated with the proposition had discussed it with me.  If anybody has made that statement in Donegal, I should like to assure the House that nobody from anywhere has discussed that proposal with me, nor was I asked by anybody specifically to discuss it with him except perhaps in the past couple of days.  There was a letter received recently&mdash;I forget whether there was a suggestion that I discuss it with certain groups or not&mdash;but no individual asked me to discuss this proposal with him on any occasion nor was any appointment made by anybody with me in that connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal itself, a proposition has been before the Industrial Development Authority.  I believe there is some local agitation and, that, in fact, some local capital was raised or promised for this specific project.  Lately the Industrial Development Authority have seen the local development group and explained to them there were certain weaknesses in the application and that in its present form they could not see their way to recommend it.  It is only right that not only An Foras Tionscal but also the Industrial Development Authority should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an industry has a prospect of success in order to ensure as far as is possible, first, that any local capital that may be put into it would not be lost, that any grants payable out of the Exchequer would be secured properly and that the employment attracted to that industry would have a reasonable chance of being maintained. If these factors are not found to be present, it is only right that the Industrial Development Authority should not encourage such an industry. Similarly, it is only right that An Foras Tionscal should not make a grant towards such an industry.</P>
    <P>I say all this only because of my knowledge of certain local agitation about this proposal and of certain claims made by or on behalf of persons that I personally had been seen in the matter.  I had not been seen.  As I told the House on many occasions, An Foras Tionscal, as far as grant giving is concerned, are an autonomous body. I do not interfere with their functions <Col N="251" /> in that respect, nor would I like to have the obligation of interfering at any time.</P>
    <P>To come now to more general matters, Deputy Cosgrave asked me in connection with the turnover tax whether I had any functions under the Prices Act in relation to this tax.  As Deputy Cosgrave said last Wednesday, he believes&mdash;and I believe with him&mdash; that the most effective brake on prices is free and full competition.  That free, full and fair competition has been operating in relation to all consumer goods since the Act was passed and there has been no reason why the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take any power vested in him for the setting up of committees to investigate the prices of particular commodities since then.</P>
    <P>The only suggestion made for the reference to a committee under the Prices Act for an examination of a particular commodity was in respect of motor insurance.  One of the reasons for the liquidation of the company discussed here during Question Time today was the severe losses it incurred in the motor insurance business.  I have told the House over and over again that the companies have been incurring this loss as far as motor insurance is concerned.  Beyond that, there have been no suggestions I can remember offhand for the setting up of an inquiry into the price of any commodity.  Certainly in the price of consumer commodities I do not expect the two and a half per cent turnover tax will lead to necessity for doing so either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made some inquiries about quotas&mdash;quotas which were to be removed or which were to be extended.  I will be having a Bill dealing with quotas immediately after the passing of this Estimate and I think it would be more proper for me to deal with them on that occasion.  I shall leave them until then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised a number of matters I should like to deal with.  He asked in particular about grants for adaptation and modernisation made for the purpose of helping industry to adapt itself to meet free trade conditions, <Col N="252" /> particularly with an eye on breaking into the export market.  It has been made clear that the purpose of these grants and loans is to help finance re-equipment and adaptation and not simply to provide for routine replacements.  The decision on any application for such a grant rests with An Foras Tionscal.  Deputy Dillon asked in particular whether An Foras Tionscal would regard an application from a cleaning and dying works as qualifying for an adaptation grant. The position in this case is that the Board of An Foras Tionscal would consider the application from such an industry for an adaptation grant if it could be proved that the necessity for the re-equipment arose out of the dismantling of tariffs.  Any special circumstances apart from that would be examined on their merits.  I do not think An Foras Tionscal would give a grant to such a concern which was clearly not affected by freer trading conditions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also expressed his concern about State bodies and the manner in which they account to the Oireachtas for their administration and activities generally.  It is not absolutely proper in this debate to discuss the whole range of State-sponsored bodies. Many of them are under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, some are under the Minister for Transport and Power, while some, certainly, come within the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  However, there are a number of different types of State bodies, trading companies perhaps first, and promotional companies. On the trading side, you have monopolies and companies in opposition with outside interests.  As far as the promotional bodies are concerned, I do not think there is any special reason why we should adopt any new system of bringing them into account in so far as their administration and expenditure are concerned.</P>
    <P>Their administration and expenditure figures are set out very fully in their accounts and there is full opportunity for discussing all these accounts here. In any event, their finances are usually provided by Vote of this House and the House has that most effective control <Col N="253" /> over promotional bodies such as An Bord Fáilte and Córas Tráchtála to ensure that nothing can be done without the authority of the House.</P>
    <P>Then we have on the other side the trading companies and I think it would be unfair and in fact unwise from the national point of view, that the trading companies, who are in opposition to outside companies, should be brought to account by this House and in public, as they inevitably would be.  I instance the nitrogen company whose detailed administrative functions, if discussed freely in the House, would expose them to the machinations of the very big cartels operating on the Continent of Europe and in other places, to the detriment of the company and of the purposes the company was set up to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is different in the case of State monopolies, perhaps, who are given their finances by way of advances from the Exchequer, by equity shareholding by the Minister for Finance and a variety of other ways.  However, I have no such company under my control and I would suggest to Deputy Dillon that the proper occasion on which to bring his views to bear on these matters would be during the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department or the Estimates of the particular Ministers dealing with these companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked what was being done about the adaptation councils and a question was raised during Question Time earlier on the same matter.  As the House is aware, the Committee on Industrial Organisation recommended generally in its third report, and specifically in reports on a number of industries, that these councils should be set up.  Following on that, an industrial reorganisation branch was set up in my Department whose function it is to follow up the CIO reports, to ensure that the steps recommended are carried out in so far as possible by the various industries, and in particular, that the adaptation councils recommended should be set up.  CIO have taken up with a number of industries the desirability of establishing adaptation councils without delay.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases, the approach <Col N="254" /> to an industry has been made in anticipation of the CIO survey itself on that particular industry.  As well as that, some industries which have not been investigated by the survey team of CIO have established adaptation councils themselves.  I informed the House this afternoon during Question Time that adaptation councils had been established for the following industries: linen, cotton and rayon, leather footwear, structural steel, iron foundries, paint and hosiery.  In addition, the Irish Paper Mills Association, which represent all the firms in the paper and paperboard industry, have decided to act as an adaptation council for the paper and the paper board industry.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place with other industries and I think it is very likely that in a short time adaptation councils will be set up, following these discussions between the industries concerned and the CIO.  Deputy Tully asked on the same matter what the Minister for Industry and Commerce could do if an industry did not carry out the CIO recommendations.  That is a difficult enough question to answer; but the answer comes readily here: the Minister can do little though it may be too early yet to answer the Deputy's question because the Minister may be able to take some positive action to encourage the recalcitrant or laggard industry.  It must be assumed, however, that any industry will realise, when its own interests are in jeopardy, that it should do everything possible to ensure its survival.  If it is an industry in which a number of firms are already engaged in adaptation measures, example would be the best spur and other firms in the same type of industry would follow suit to preserve their own interests.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to think firms will not follow the advice of CIO.  I have encouraged them to treat the implementation of the recommendations as urgent, notwithstanding the breakdown in the Common Market negotiations, and I feel there is clear realisation of the approach of the competitive conditions which most firms will meet in the years immediately ahead.  In the course of my opening remarks, I mentioned <Col N="255" /> I had reason to be disappointed initially because firms were not responding to the facilities made available under the adaptation grants scheme, but I had occasion later to say that latterly I had become quite pleased with their responses and that there were many more applications now for re-equipment and expansion grants to meet freer trading conditions.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me specifically to deal with our state of international trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from adaptation grants, might I ask the Minister if he is in a position to answer my query in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with it before the Deputy came in but I am satisfied to deal with it again so that I can also deal with any question the Deputy may raise on it before I conclude.  The position is that adaptation grants are given to industries whose existence might be threatened by the lowering of tariffs and the entering into freer trading conditions.  In the case of, say, the cleaning and dyeing industry, unless it could prove clearly that this certain position existed in its case, I doubt if An Foras Tionscal would deal with applications for grants from firms in that industry.  I dealt with the matter quite extensively but that is the sum of what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am obliged to the Minister.  Anybody who wants to inquire about grants can address himself to An Foras Tionscal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the body dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of our future trading relations is one which I cannot very easily answer.  The majority of Deputies share the disappointment of the Government at the suspension of the Brussels negotiations.  Since then, of course, the British Government and their partners in EFTA have agreed to accelerate their tariff reductions and the question has been put to us in the House and outside why we should not join.  The answer to that is very easy to anyone who knows the pattern of our foreign trade.   EFTA is an organisation <Col N="256" /> which so far has not paid any regard to agricultural products.  For that reason, it was not attractive to us.  As well as that, dealing only with industrial products, Britain's partners in the EFTA agreement would, as a result of the gradual reduction of tariffs, enjoy a position ultimately&mdash;initially it was to be in 1970&mdash;in Britain's markets that we now enjoy to a substantial extent. The amount of trade we do with Britain's EFTA partners in industrial goods is very limited.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for those three reasons, the absence of any arrangements for agriculture, the fact that we enjoy most of the benefits the EFTA countries will get in the elimination of tariffs exercise, and the fact that we have a very limited trade with Britain's EFTA partners, there was not any great attraction in EFTA for us.  So far, the position as far as EFTA is concerned has not changed, and the reasons for our not joining are still valid.  In any event, we were not invited to the initial meeting at Stockholm where the agreement was made, nor has an invitation been extended to us since.</P>
    <P>In the absence of negotiations for Britain's entry into the European Common Market, the obvious course for us would be, first of all, to try to strengthen our trade relations with Britain and, secondly, to improve so far as we can our bilaterial trading with other countries.  As the House knows from statements made by the Taoiseach last week, and from statements made previously, we have already been in consultation with the British Government about our future trading relations with them and, following Mr. Sandys' visit to Dublin the week before last and the statement issued afterwards announcing that further meetings are to be held in a short time, I do not think there is any more I can say, short of trying to conjecture on our future trading relations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we are going ahead with the exercise of tariff reductions.  I shall be dealing with quotas later on. So far as the general proposition is concerned, Deputy Cosgrave asked whether we should not seek some reciprocal advantage for the tariff reductions we put into effect.</P>
    <Col N="257" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister departs from that point, may I ask him if EFTA opened negotiations for reciprocal agreements with the EEC, would membership of EFTA by us be a possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not discussed that with anyone but, in my opinion, it would change our thinking about it if, as a result of that eventuality we were left on our own, so to speak, without any prospects of making international trading arrangements that would benefit us.  So far as the reduction of tariffs is concerned, whether we should seek reciprocal benefits for what we are doing now is a question that is easily enough answered.</P>
      <P>Deputy A. Barry referred to ghosts walking around office corridors in certain industries and on factory floors as if there were some great fear about the tariff reductions that have already taken place and the ones to be effected at the beginning of 1964.  As the House is aware, the purpose of the tariff reductions was to ease our industries into the position we expected to meet at the end of 1970, in which all our tariffs would have disappeared; secondly, to give the necessary incentives to our industries to improve their productivity and efficiency. I think it is necessary, in order not to create too severe and impact on industry, to continue at least for another year this tariff reduction rhythm we have embarked upon.  If as indications now are, the Common Market negotiations will not be reopened for about two years, that will bring us into 1965&mdash;it might well be later&mdash;and if the term within which we must eliminate our tariffs ends at the end of 1969, that would give us only five years in which to carry out this exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might prove too severe a jolt for some industries.  It might, therefore, be worthwhile, on that score alone, to proceed with what has already been announced, the tariff reductions starting on 1st January last, and the ten per cent reduction on 1st January next.  The position may then have clarified itself and we may be in a better position to know whether we <Col N="258" /> should proceed with that rhythm or accelerate or reduce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister understands that under the Euro-market conditions there was a reward for this punishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Common Market is still the most suitable for this country and it is still the situation we would like to reach.  We would like to reach that situation fairly well equipped to stay alive in it.  I do not think the Deputy need have any doubts that the people in Britain believe they will get into the Common Market ultimately.  The bridge which was demolished is now being re-built. Therefore, I think it is worthwhile to have these two tariff reductions, the one which has gone into effect, and the one we propose for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any examination made of those steps backward?  There was a loss of trade in some degree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the tariff reductions were effected without any corresponding improvement in efficiency, there would undoubtedly be a loss, but the purpose of the tariff reductions is to achieve a greater degree of efficiency and therefore to enable our manufacturing firms to withstand whatever extra competition the reductions bring about.  In the belief that greater efficiency is being achieved, I do not expect any adverse effects by reason of these tariff reductions.</P>
      <P>In any event, it is not so much the reduction of a tariff when it is fairly high but when it comes to the vulnerable point which would be lower down the scale that the real cold blast might be felt.  I do not think that in any cases we have reached that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may depart from that for a moment, Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the increase in the number of petrol stations and the effect that increase was likely to have on petrol prices.  As the House is aware, that is a matter which was taken up by the Fair Trade Commission.  The Commission decided that it would not be in the public interest to interfere too acutely in the right to set up or the right to control the setting up of outlets in the retail trade.  Therefore, they did not accept a suggestion that they should be in a position to license the setting up of these stations in order to regulate their growth.  I think it could be argued that there are too many retail outlets in other trades as well as in this but, nevertheless, in a free competitive economy, it would be difficult to justify the licensing of such outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Commission did make recommendations which were designed to check the growth of needless or uneconomic stations.  They recommend that the practice of the distributing companies of giving incentives, such as advance rebates and low interest loans to new entrants to the trade, should be completely discontinued and the companies have accepted that recommendation. In general, the Commission's recommendations aim at providing a check on intensive competition for outlets and the promotion of price competition by providing for the elimination of arrangements relating to the collective fixing of prices.  In the case of the company stations, it recommended the Motor Spirit Order which has since come into operation by reason <Col N="260" /> of an Act of the Oireachtas which I think was passed in July, 1962.  The Act provides that any petrol company proposing to build or acquire a retail station should notify the Commission in advance and should furnish the Commission with any information they might request.  In that way the Commission will have full knowledge of any increase there might be in retail outlets of petrol and, therefore, be in a position to take action if they feel action is justified.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters to which I should like to refer is mineral development. The matter was first raised by Deputy Dillon and a specific matter was raised by Deputy Tully.  Deputy Dillon expressed fears that people were coming in here, getting prospecting licences, doing little work and then going abroad to places like Canada, and Canada principally, and giving exaggerated accounts of the minerals that were to be found in the area covered by the prospecting licences.  He said that this would inevitably do damage to this country.  I agree with him wholeheartedly in that respect and I want to say that the greatest care is exercised in the giving of prospecting licences.  In the first place, the financial background of the applicant is examined; his technical ability to do what he proposes is taken into account and only then is he given a prospecting licence.  In most cases, and in all cases where the applicant is not a resident of the country, or not a person with property within the country, he is asked to make a deposit in the event of any claims for compensation arising in respect of people's property over which he may prospect.  It has happened in recent times that people who either had prospecting licences or had letters of intent from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that prospecting licences would be given tried to assign these for fairly sizeable considerations.</P>
    <P>In all cases where I had any doubts about the <i>bona fides</i> of such a transaction, I refused to give my consent to that assignment.  If, on the other hand, a person had done a reasonable amount of prospecting and had spent a reasonable amount of money to <Col N="261" /> establish whether or not there were some minerals there that were at least worth looking at further, then I was quite prepared to sanction such an assignment as long as the consideration was reasonable.  In so far as prospecting is concerned the prospector must give a return to the Geological Survey Office of any findings he makes. He will have to give assays of the minerals he extracts from the bore-holes and if there is any publication of the ore content of these minerals in foreign newspapers in order to stimulate dealings in stock, then I will have an opportunity of comparing whether or not the publication in these foreign newspapers corresponds with the particulars given to our Geological Survey Office.</P>
    <P>In most cases, the figures published abroad coincided with the figures made available to the Geological Survey Office.  In some cases, unfortunately, it did appear that the ore content indicated abroad for a particular area, was, in fact, appreciably higher than what was returned here and in these cases I took immediate steps to ensure that any transactions to be induced by reason of that publication abroad would not have my sanction and any rights I was in a position to give were immediately withdrawn.  Therefore, I want to assure Deputy Dillon and the House, that I am fully conscious that in this business, which is a highly speculative business, there is a great danger of non <i>bona fide</i> speculators coming in and doing damage to the reputation of this country.</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair to say that the usual pattern of mining is that somebody seeks a prospecting licence, discovers an area either in Ireland or else-where, and, having discovered an interesting property, will try to have a company established by means of floating shares or selling his rights to another company who will stimulate the market to provide the money to investigate the property in which the ore is found.  It is not unusual that these activities take place, it is a matter of form, but it is important that we should ensure that the Irish economy and Irish landowners will not be exploited <Col N="262" /> by any shady deals in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of Tynagh and he raised the question of the delay in giving them their mining lease.  One might be forgiven if one felt that there was some assistance given to Deputy Tully in raising that question.  Whether the company or an individual officer gave it to him does not matter.  I may say a letter of intent to give the lease was issued on 22nd November, 1962, the company having indicated at that time that a letter would enable them to go into the negotiations necessary for the major financing that would be required for the development of the mine.  A draft lease was subsequently drawn up in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and was forwarded to the company's solicitors for approval or 16th February, 1963.  The company proposed a large number of amendments which they desired to have inserted in the draft lease.  These matters were discussed with the company's representatives.  I need not tell the House that they were discussed and that there was good, hard bargaining on both sides.  It was not easy to reach agreement on all matters.  However, they objected to some provisions in the lease that were in standard form &mdash;provisions designed to protect the interests of the State and the interests of neighbouring landowners.  A final draft of the lease, then, these matters ultimately having been agreed, was forwarded to the company's solicitor's for approval on 10th May.  We have heard nothing since.  I hope I have established reasonably well to the satisfaction of Deputy Tully that if he has been instructed to blame the Department for some delay all the blame is not on the Department's side.</P>

      <P>Thanks for the explanation. It is true that I contacted the Minister's office last November as a result of which certain steps were taken and the letter of intent was issued.  I thank the Minister for taking the action he took then.  My information is not that which the Minister has just given to me.  Yesterday, I was informed that the delay is with the Department.  I am <Col N="263" /> rather surprised to find that the company's solicitors are supposed to be holding up the signing of the lease, because the company are most anxious to have the deal completed.</P>

Deputies will recall the announcement made in January last of the decision to remove quantitative restrictions on imports as soon as possible and, in any event, not later than the 30th June next.  This decision was taken as a consequence of Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community, since quantitative restrictions would have to be removed at once on entry into the Common Market, so far as the goods of EEC countries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even as a member of the European Economic Community, however, it would still be possible for us to maintain such restrictions against goods coming from certain countries outside the Common Market, subject to the obligations of the Rome Treaty in <Col N="264" /> regard to common commercial policy. The Control of Imports Acts are not suitable as they stand for the operation of quotas on such a selective basis and, since it was considered necessary to be in a position to maintain quantitative restrictions on the entry of goods coming from particular countries e.g. those which are low-cost producers, while removing them from the goods of other countries, steps were taken, subsequent to the decision announced in January, to prepare legislation amending these Acts so as to enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>In view of the change which has taken place in the circumstances in which this country applied for membership of the European Economic Community, it has been decided to proceed more slowly with the removal of quotas and to retain most of them for the time being.  In certain cases, however, where it is judged that the industries concerned can be adequately protected by tariffs, it has been decided to carry out the original decision and to remove the quotas as from the 30th June next.  It may be necessary, however, to dismantle these quotas on a selective basis should there be a danger to the Irish industry of severe competition from low-cost countries and for this reason it is necessary to proceed with the legislation amending the Acts.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to the particular commodities involved.  An Order providing for the revocation of the quota on rubber-proofed garments has been made and will become effective in the course of a couple of days.  No difficulty arises about possible imports from low cost countries so the removal of the quota will be absolute.  In the case of cycle tyres, imports from low cost countries will have to be guarded against.  It is proposed, then, that the revocation of these quota restrictions will apply only to OECD countries. This legislation will enable us to maintain the quota against low cost countries whose exports to this country would affect the home industry.</P>
    <P>As far as rubber footwear is concerned, the House is aware that there is at present a review of the leather <Col N="265" /> footwear quota before the Industrial Development Authority.  The intention was to eliminate the quota on leather footwear at the end of June this year but since it will not be possible now to have the review on leather footwear completed it was thought better to delay the removal of the rubber footwear quota until the decision of the Industrial Development Authority on the leather footwear quota is made known.  In the meantime, the rubber footwear quota is being continued up to the end of this year&mdash;in other words for a further six months from the end of June, but the size of the quota has been doubled in agreement with the Irish Dunlop Company.</P>
    <P>The quota on a number of commodities is being increased by 10 per cent.  They are motor tyres; silk or artificial hose; cotton piece goods; hats; lamps; miscellaneous brushes; plugs; laminated springs; wood screws; superphosphates.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the leather footwear quota is being reviewed at the present time.  There are also negotiations in connection with the woollen piece goods quota.</P>
    <P>I have given an outline of what is happening in relation to quotas which I hope will clear up any misunderstandings there might be.  I may say that these orders will be operative within a week or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very brief measure from which may flow considerable consequences if it is implemented fully.  The Minister has said that it is proposed to proceed with somewhat more caution than was originally anticipated when our application for EEC membership was still under consideration; that in view of the breakdown of the Brussels negotiations it was the intention now to proceed more slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to examine with considerable care the possible consequences that some of these quotas may have.  I do not propose at this stage to cite the figures which have been quoted here on a number of occasions recently and which are <Col N="266" /> available in the Official Report in the form of replies to Parliamentary Questions concerning trade between this country and a number of European countries, some with our trade with answered in various forms.  Some of them deal with our trade with EFTA countries, some with our trade with the EEC and some with our trade with OECD countries.  I note from the Minister's remarks introducing the Bill that it is proposed at present to apply these quotas only to OECD countries. That description includes some countries that are also members of EFTA and some countries that are also members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The reason why I suggest it is necessary to proceed with caution appears obvious from a brief glance at the figures for our trade with, for instance, EFTA countries.  I shall give the figures for the year 1961.  The completed figures were not available for 1962 but the January-November figures indicate a pattern similar to the 1961 pattern.  For the year 1961 the percentage of exports to imports between this country and Denmark was 12.7 per cent.  In the case of Norway it was 45.6, which was somewhat better; in the case of Austria, 16.9 per cent; Sweden, 21 per cent; Switzerland, 18 per cent and Portugal 25 per cent. The pattern for the period January-November, 1962 was 7.1 per cent; Norway, 26.8 per cent; Austria, 20.3 per cent; Sweden, 13 per cent; Switzerland, 16 per cent and Portugal, 9.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The trading figures in respect of the continental countries with which we have trade agreements&mdash;and some of these are included in the EFTA figures&mdash;show that in most cases we import from them about three times what we export to them.  In some cases the figures vary somewhat but, on average, we import anything from three to four times what we sell to them.  It is for that reason that we should proceed with considerable caution before wiping out the existing quota or tariff protection.</P>
    <P>As I understand from the Minister's speech, it is proposed in most cases to substitute tariffs for quotas.  As the <Col N="267" /> Minister said in his reply to the debate on the Estimate, it is likely that the effect of the reduction in tariffs will be felt at a later rather than the initial stage.  That is undoubtedly true.  On the other hand, in the case of certain types of goods, a marginal change can have a considerable effect and there would need to be very considerable compensatory advantage in lower prices before we could be satisfied as to the possible consequences on employment.</P>
    <P>I have already heard some complaints about the effect of the reduction in the case of certain silk goods.  Industries vary and the competition which this country is likely to face in respect of certain categories of goods varies from one type of manufacture to another but in view of the existing uncertainty about the EEC developments and the unlikelihood of membership becoming a reality in the near future and the fact that these other countries at present enjoy very substantial trade advantages so far as this country is concerned, we ought to proceed with very considerable care.</P>
    <P>The list which the Minister has read out covers a very considerable range of industries&mdash;motor tyres, leather footwear, silk hose, laminated springs, superphosphates, wood screws and cotton piece goods&mdash;affect industries which are very considerable employers and some of which may be the sole suppliers of the goods produced.  The effect upon particular industries of a reduction, particularly of the initial ten per cent reduction, may not be great but, on the other hand, some industries may feel it immediately.  Anything that would jeopardise their trading ability or interfere with the existing level of employment should be most carefully examined before being decided upon because all industries will be facing keen competition in trying to develop export markets.</P>
    <P>All of us are, I think, familiar with industries which, even though enjoying protection, find it difficult to compete with countries where the raw materials are available at lower prices. I am thinking particularly now of laminated springs.  This change is, at <Col N="268" /> present, confined to OECD countries and we may not, therefore, be faced with the very acute competition likely to come from low cost countries.  On the other hand, some of the OECD countries have available to them certain commodities at cheaper prices and can, therefore, enjoy lower costs of production.  In certain circumstances, they even have cheaper labour.  In most cases they have the advantages of readily available raw materials.  For these reasons, I believe we should proceed with care not only in substituting quotas by tariffs but also in reducing tariffs where they apply.  It is not easy to see what <i>quid pro quo</i> can be granted.  It is worth considering having discussions with the EEC authorities or the EFTA authorities to see if some <i>modus vivendi</i> could be worked out under which credit would be given for any reduction that might be granted.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether it is proposed to take any action against countries with which we have trade agreements where the balance of trade is heavily adverse.  Will any effort be made to get the pattern corrected and ensure that these countries are affording to this country, its traders and manufacturers, the full rights under the agreements? We had one or two instances in the past in which administrative or other action was taken to defeat the actual terms of an agreement.  It is only right to say that in such cases the country concerned on the receipt of representations, and sometimes vigorous representations, agreed to admit the particular commodities.  One is never sure, however, that these agreements are being respected in the letter as well as in the spirit.  Because of that I believe the pattern of our trading with these continental countries requires careful examination and consideration, particularly in the light of the present uncertainly with regard to our future trading position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unpretentious Bill but it has in it the ingredients of what could be quite serious developments. Power is taken here to exempt countries from quotas and tariffs, even where quotas are at present in operation. <Col N="269" /> The Minister gives a list of industries in respect of which it is proposed to increase the quotas in the near future.  That means more of these quota goods will be coming in. Everybody with experience knows that, if one cannot prohibit the import of a particular commodity in order to assist an Irish industry, the next thing is to impose a quota thereby ensuring that the Irish product can be sold.  It is only when the product is sold that goods from outside are permitted in in order to fill the market.  An industry may supply 80 per cent of the home market.  A quota is granted for the import of 20 per cent, and no more.</P>
      <P>Now, because of the possibility of our entering EEC, we may find ourselves faced with the problem of dismantling not only tariffs but quotas as well.  We will thereby subject a number of our industries to excruciating competition and anybody who does not believe that is incapable of appraising the competitive spirit of modern Europe.  The soundest policy for us is to hasten very slowly because a too rapid repeal of quotas will be tantamount to erecting headstones over the graves of Irish Industries.  Some of those quoted by the Minister cannot possibly survive in EEC.  These highly-developed European countries are quite capable of supplying the entire market here for the 52 weeks of the year on a couple of weeks' production.  When the battle is fought, a number of Irish industries will be lying dead on the battlefield.  There are some which will survive, but there will be casualties too, particularly in those areas where industries provide a substantial measure of employment at perhaps a high cost to the whole nation.  I do not think we should be in any great hurry to reduce quotas and tariffs.  As far as Britain is concerned, joining EEC is just a big question mark and it is scarcely wise for us to fix a date by which we will adhere to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have nothing to apologise for so far as our trading with other countries is concerned.  Speaking on the EEC debate here in February last I gave certain figures.  They will bear repetition now in briefer form.  I showed <Col N="270" /> then that we bought from these EEC countries approximately £40 million worth of goods and we sold to them only £8 million worth of goods&mdash;for every £5 worth that we bought from them they bought only £1 worth from us.  So long as that is our relationship with these countries I do not think we need be in any hurry to take any particular action in the way of reducing our quotas and cutting our tariffs, even from the point of view of external relations, good neighbour relations, or any other substantial reason.  At all events, if we are not given some immediate compensation for what we are doing we ought at least to be told what we shall get when we reach a certain stage.  So far we have reduced tariffs, increased quotas and we intend to reduce tariffs again in January and to increase quotas next week.</P>
    <P>What are we getting for all this at the moment?  It may very well be this is a method of creating a climate and an atmosphere in which some manna will fall our way at a later date but I should like to be sure of that.  If we look at the pattern of our trade with Europe we shall see it is not getting better.  It is getting very much worse.  I quote again from what I said on that occasion at column 960, Volume 199, of the Official Report of the 5th February, 1963.</P>
    <P>In 1957, Belgium bought from us 43 per cent of what we bought from her; today she buys 17 per cent. France bought, in 1957, 60 per cent of what we bought from her; today she buys only 18 per cent.  Germany bought 47 per cent in 1957; today she buys 27 per cent.  The Netherlands bought 22 per cent in 1957. Today it is 21 per cent. Italy, in 1957, bought 64 per cent, today she buys 33 per cent.  Luxembourg bought nothing from us in 1957.  We buy from her today over £300,000 worth of goods; she buys from us £700 worth.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as regards these countries we provide a very substantial market for them and export relatively small quantities to them in compensation.  If we look at the EFTA countries, that is excluding Britain, which is one of <Col N="271" /> the Outer Seven, we find the position is relatively as bad as that in regard to the European Economic Community. We buy £9 million worth of goods from those six EFTA countries and they buy from us only £2 million worth of goods.  Here again we happen to provide a very good market for these countries while our market in these countries is relatively small.  The pattern is strictly against us.  In 1957 Denmark bought from us six per cent of what we bought from her; today she buys seven per cent.  Norway bought 13 per cent in 1957; today she buys 26 per cent.  Sweden bought 20 per cent in 1957; today she buys 13 per cent.  Portugal bought 57 per cent in 1957; today she buys nine per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is nothing that compels us to repeal our tariffs or dismantle our quotas in order to show these countries that we have provided a very substantial market for them.  I am sure the Minister has these facts in his Department and in regard to some of our industries he will know, as will some of the survey teams, that it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for these people to exist in a market in which their continued existence is not provided for by a quota.  The day may come when these things will have to be done but it will be a very painful exercise for the Irish industries concerned.  The Minister would be wise in making haste very slowly and then only if we can see something tangible within our reach by doing so.</P>
    <P>I should like also to raise the other aspect of imports, exports, and quotas. It is quite clear that some of the countries from which we buy goods in substantial quantities are buying only a small quantity of goods from us and we can do two things: we can let them carry on and say: As long as we are able to pay for them it does not matter. We pay for them, of course, only by being able to exploit our tourist industry.  We pay for them by utilising our external investments and we pay for them with the help of the Irish boys and girls who send money home <Col N="272" /> to their parents or who come home on holidays each year and spend their money here.  In the long run that is how we are able to keep our trade with these countries going.  It is possible because of our size and because of the limited degree of our industrial investment that there is no effective course open to us but I have never believed that we were wholly powerless.</P>
    <P>It may be said against that that if we are thinking of going into the European Economic Community we must forget our weapons and go in there with a lofty adherence to high ideals and pledging ourselves in advance to co-operate to the fullest in the promotion of trading relations. However, until we do go in, and even when we are in, some serious effort should be made to bring the countries of the Six up against the reality that in the aggregate we are buying £40 million worth of goods from them and they are buying only £8 million worth of goods from us.  If that lopsided state of affairs continues there is not much prospect for our prosperity in the European Economic Community or indeed outside it.</P>
    <P>Before I read this Bill I thought it was an effort by the Government to put into operation what had been threatened, that we would have to consider whether we would permit the continuance of the arrangements under which we bought £5 worth of goods from countries which bought only £1 worth from us.  I am not saying that in this matter the Minister can act the Goliath with these large and highly-organised countries in Europe but he is not defenceless in this job and until such time as we are members of the European Economic Community we should try to get a better state of balance into our exports to Europe than exists today.</P>
    <P>In all this, one thing stands out, that is, that the British market is by far the best market for us.  The statistics which I could quote from the same speech show that there is a much closer approximation to a balance between our exports to Britain and our imports from Britain.  Unless we have that stable influence in our external trading <Col N="273" /> relations, our whole economy will be lopsided and there will be no viable economic structure whatever.  It is that very fact which dictates to us out of sheer self-interest that we should keep an eye on British moves in relation to both the Common Market and EFTA countries because any examination of the trade figures of this country makes it perfectly clear that the one country with which we can trade on some sort of rewarding basis is Britain.  Our trade with the other countries of EFTA and EEC is onesided and operates very considerably to our detriment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The lowering of tariffs and the increasing of import quotas is necessarily a very painful process.  My uneasiness about the whole pattern of what is taking place here continues.  I take it there has been&mdash;if not, there should be&mdash;complete consultation with home producers on the matter of quota increases.  I take it that an increase of ten per cent, for instance, in the quota of imports can be absorbed without any reduction in the capacity of our producers.  If, hitherto, we had an import quota of 50,000 pairs of a certain kind of shoe or boot and if we increased that figure to 55,000, are we taking those 55,000 pieces of manufacture off the benches and out of the hands of employees in our factories?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the way in which the proportion of these quotas is allotted to importers.  I am not clear about what is being done. I hope it is being done in a manner fair to importers and that the proportion of quotas is allotted to the countries to which we export.  The countries which get these quotas from us should get them in relation to our present trading figures with them, the figures Deputy Norton has quoted and of which we have all been made aware in recent months.  They show this silly disparity in our trade figures.  A great disparity should be a factor in the decisions we make about allotting import quotas to countries who trade with us on a more favourable balance of trade than some of the European countries do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all part of a pattern of reversing a 30-year-old policy of high protection here.  I do not think it will be as <Col N="274" /> invigorating a process as the Minister suggested it might be in his speech on his Estimate.  An increase in the flow of imports in any way carries grave danger, I believe, to both employment and investment here.  We have feather-bedded industry for 30 years and I do not think we can decide to sleep on the floor too quickly.  I believe we are doing it far too quickly for our economic comfort and I agree with the two previous speakers that exhortions to go slow should be heeded by all of us in this matter.  We should curb enthusiasm for what I think would prove an illusory feeling that we would get efficiency overnight by plunging manufacturers, industrialists and workers into the cold water of the facts of international trade.  It seems curious to me that the Fine Gael Party of which I am a member should now seem to be champions of industry but I think we have always been champions of reasonableness in everything and if we thought you went too fast in 1933, possibly we think you are going too fast now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to underline some of the representations made by Deputy Cosgrave in dealing with this Bill.  He spoke of the impact of the consequential steps which were in contemplation in connection with the Bill on the labour content of industry. I often think when I sit here and listen to the Minister for Industry and Commerce producing legislation of this kind, what the Fianna Fáil position would be if we were in their place and they over here.  I can imagine the screams of hysteria that would be heard from these benches and the charges that we were betraying the industrial interests of the country.  I am proud of the fact that that kind of hysterical fraud does not characterise this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for recalling to the mind of the House the fact that we are members of OECD and that one of the obligations of membership is to progress steadily towards the abolition of quotas.  Is not that true? We are bound to proceed deliberately to that end and, where it is desired to retain protection, to substitute for <Col N="275" /> quota appropriate rates of duty.  We have the choice of cutting ourselves off altogether from external contact with Europe, the US and Canada and &ldquo;going it&rdquo; utterly alone or else collaborating with them in OECD and other international organisations which are becoming more and more a fact of international life and, outside of which, I believe our circumstances would become well nigh intolerable.</P>
    <P>There should be no sentiment in dealing with matters of this kind but there should be prudence.  I recognise at once that progress, slow or rapid, towards the disappearance of quotas is bound to create problems for our industrialists but I am also aware that very considerable help has been provided by this House for industrialists to adapt themselves to the new climate in which we must operate.  I want to say again what I have said here repeatedly and what I went out of my way to say at our Ard Fheis in the Mansion House recently and what I have heard Deputy Cosgrave and other members of his Party refer to repeatedly: we do not seem to be sufficiently preoccupied with the problems of the people who are working in these industries.  I sympathise with the man who has a substantial capital investment in the country but I am conscious of the fact, having been in business all my life myself, that you have an obligation if you are running a business on rational lines, of accumulating from your profits reserves adequate to meet any foreseeable contingency.  Indeed, you ought to have supplementary reserves to meet the unforeseeable contingency.  If we add to that the adaptation grants and other devices, difficult as some industrialists may find the process of adaptation, they are not without resources and anyone who pleads he is absolutely without resources is, I think, open to question as to whether he has himself taken reasonable precautions.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man who at 23 or 24 years of age had the option in 1933, 1934 or 1935 of going to England or to America or of taking a job in a new industry established <Col N="276" /> here with Government patronage and the extremist type of quota tariff protection. He said to himself: &ldquo;This is a new departure.  The Government guarantee they are going to give whatever protection is necessary to ensure this industry will survive.&rdquo;  He took a chance and took a job.  He trained himself in that industry and in due course got married.  He bought a house and his children are now going to school. He has a wife and family and maybe payments are outstanding on his house. Suddenly he is confronted with the situation that it is not impossible that the industry in which he has invested not his capital but his whole life is going to close down.</P>
    <P>I remember a specific case of which I had personal experience.  I remember a man who was in just that case.  He had spent approximately 30 years in an industry in this city and had reached a very responsible position in it.  He was not a director but he was a principal foreman.  He was very comfortably circumstanced.  He was a hardworking, industrious man, most highly thought of.  In this case the family owning the business died out.  The employer was an elderly man, and when he died his executors simply wound up the business.</P>
    <P>I shall never forget the despairing prospect with which that man was faced through no fault of his own.  He would have most gladly taken any work, but the difficulty was he had attained to a position of responsibility and distinction in his particular industry, which was a small industry of which there are only four or five units in the city.  To get that man a job in the lower ranks of experience in that industry was virtually impossible, because men who were 10 or 15 years younger than he and who had attained to supervisory capacity naturally recoiled from seeing a man who was their senior in experience being brought in under them.  This man was, therefore, out of a job and was suddenly brought smack up against a problem of a man with family responsibilities who has attained a time in life where it is hard to get a job no matter how willing or eager he is to take it.  He suddenly <Col N="277" /> finds his employment folding up under him.</P>
    <P>What I am anxious about is this. There is no use closing our eyes to the fact that with the disappearance of quota protection there is a certain number of industries here whose survival is highly problematical.  As Deputy Norton said, without particularising I can think of certain commodities where the large mechanised industries in Europe and Great Britain could supply our entire requirements in one day.  What are we saying now to the individual workers in these industries by way of reassurance, if they find that the employment in which they have spent their lives and invested the only capital they have, which is their life, spent in acquiring experience and expertise?  What are we saying to them if they are faced with the prospect of the industry in which they have worked closing up?</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to address his mind to this problem and take an early opportunity of saying that our resources will be mobilised and that we will regard as a first charge upon them two obligations to persons who find themselves in that circumstance. First, that we will seek, where their age is such that entry into a new industry is virtually impossible for them, that superannuation on reasonable terms will be provided to ensure that they will not be thrown on the industrial scrapheap.  Secondly, we ought to say, boldly and resolutely, in regard to others of middle-age and below middle-age that we will devise a re-training scheme, access to which will be available to them all, to retrain themselves for alternative employment, that we will concern ourselves to get them settled in alternative employment, and that during the period of re-training we will provide them with an income to make it possible for them to keep their families together and to avoid a complete disruption of their lives.</P>
    <P>I believe we ought to have the moral courage to say to the employees of such industries whose survival is highly problematical in the completely free trade era, particularly to the younger man: &ldquo;Listen, you ought to look around now for alternative employment <Col N="278" /> in an analogous trade so as to avoid becoming unnecessarily a social problem in five or ten years' time when it might be very much more difficult for you to make the necessary adaptation in spite of any help the community can provide for you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These things are to be faced.  If they are not faced, it will gradually dawn on a great many trade unionists here that this kind of danger is looming up. You will be liable to get a very acute reaction, which perhaps will on occasion appear to be irrational and extreme.  But then you pause and think that a man with a wife and family to provide for finds it extremely difficult to concentrate his attention on the wider economic interests of the country as a whole if it involves his utter ruin.  You cannot expect him to be as calm and as deliberate as we here who are trying to look at the thing from an overall viewpoint.  I urge the Minister to turn his mind to that aspect of the situation, in the certain knowledge that any proposal he has to put forward will be most sympathetically received in this House, if we are to provide a real solution to the inevitable problem that will arise.</P>
    <P>I heard a good deal of talk about a kind of nostalgic yearning for the preservation of highly protective tariffs here no matter what happens in the world outside.  This is an illusion, because the industries that have a prospect of expanding employment and have a dynamic future are the industries that have passed the point of depending on the domestic market exclusively.  I do not think there is anything truer in business or trade than this: nobody ever stands still. You either expand or you decline.  No business long stands still.  The firms which are depending for their dynamic on expanding production are the firms who are exporting a part of their output. And what will those firms find, whether they like it or not and whether we like it or not, in 1966?</P>
    <P>The EFTA countries are pledged to abolish all tariffs and all quotas. One of the EFTA countries is Great Britain, and we will find ourselves in competition in Great Britain in 1966 <Col N="279" /> with her partners in EFTA on the basis of free trade.  Not only that, but President Kennedy is pressing very strenuously for an across the board reduction of all existing tariffs by 50 per cent in the immediate future.  As the Minister has said, Britain is preparing very hard, with her EFTA partners, to get into the Common Market, which presupposes a complete disappearance of any tariffs, of any protective device, in Europe by 1970.</P>
    <P>That is a world for which we must adapt ourselves.  We had better ask ourselves whether all this is unqualifiedly black.  I do not think it is.  In the first place, I do not believe that the Grand Design adumbrated by President Kennedy at Philadelphia on 4th July last year will disappear into smoke.  If I did I would substantially despair for the survival of free society. If I had to accept that prospect I would not give a fiddle-de-dee, I would not give a damn for our chances, because then Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Mao Tse Tung would be calling the tune. I believe that unless the Grand Design of the Atlantic Partnership is implemented then Mao and Khrushchev and their subscribers will call the tune.  I do not believe that they will call the tune.  I believe the Atlantic Partnership will become a <i>fait accompli</i>, despite the work of some Europeans to stop it.  If it is illuminated altogether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;illuminated&rdquo; and I endorse the emphasis the Minister casts on the verb &ldquo;illuminate&rdquo;.  I want to recall that these developments leading to an Atlantic Partnership may take time as a result of the lack of illumination which at present afflicts certain quarters in Europe.  We have got to live in the meantime.  Deputy <Col N="280" /> Norton has drawn attention to the obvious discrepancies that exist in the balance of trade between Ireland and certain other countries in Europe.  That is a problem not peculiar to Ireland. It is a problem occupying the minds of economists in Europe with growing emphasis.  It is this: there is a woeful tendency, which manifestly must be controlled if disaster is not to ensue, for the rich to grow richer while the poor grow poorer.  There is a queer and almost uncontrollable dynamic operating in which the highly developed countries trade more and more with one another and with an increased gross national product, while the less developed countries tend to trade less and less, with danger of a steadily decreasing gross national income.</P>
      <P>That is not only a danger to the less developed countries.  It is, in the long run, a much greater danger to the highly developed industrial countries because nothing is more certain than that the free world cannot survive half plutocrat and half pauper, and they know it.  What is to be done about it?  I often think that when these gargantuan problems present themselves to the minds of men they produce a sort of paralysis which prevents people doing the obvious thing.  Here is a problem requiring solution.  There may be some very complicated and elaborate answer to it but nobody seems to know the complicated and elaborate answer.  However, <i>ad interim</i>, I think there is a simple solution.  If we have an organisation for European economic co-operation and development which comprises not only the free countries of Europe but Canada and the United States as well, if they mean what they say, what problem does it present to the nations of that organisation, say they accept the obligation that we must all buy at least one per cent of our total imports from one another?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I think, is making a mistake.  There must be <Col N="281" /> no eleemosynary element in this.  I am suggesting that the rich countries of the world know that the free world cannot survive half pauper and half plutocrat.  It is that idea that is enshrined in the suggested European economic and development co-operation.  Now, does that mean what it says or not?  If it does not, the sooner this idea of European economic co-operation is wound up the better. If it does, let us do something about it, and we have a perfectly simple proposition which will resolve a large part of the interim problem which will continue to exist until an exhaustive solution for the whole difficulty is found&mdash;let each nation say: &ldquo;We pledge ourselves to buy one per cent of our total imports from one another&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Norway, Sweden and the others bought one per cent of their total imports from Ireland, our problems were over.  It might, on the other hand, create a problem for them because they might find themselves having to deposit a sum here and then to search for means to convert that into goods.  It simply means they are co-operating, developing and ensuring that some measure of unity and progress will be maintained between us.  As far as co-operation between the USA and Britain is concerned, it happens in any case; it happens unilaterally between Great Britain and Germany already: they buy far more than one per cent of their total imports from each other.  What it means is that in respect of poorer members of the community, certain minimum guarantees would be provided&mdash;that until such exchanges become automatic, the rich will take steps to ensure that the exchange we all desire will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was Minister for Agriculture at the time of OEEC.  I remember Deputy Cosgrave was sitting beside me.  OEEC broke into two parts and there was a green pool annexed.  The Minister will remember it.  I think they are both combined now.  I said to the Secretary General of the new body with which I was primarily concerned as Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;You are going to get a fine job and I will measure your competence by your ability or failure to sell Irish fish.  If these people mean what they say, they will provide a market for Irish fish, which for them will be a fraction of the total consumption, and for us it will mean the foundation for an expanding market for fish produced by us.&rdquo;  Before that had time to develop, OEEC disappeared and OECD exists today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that if OECD accepted an obligation of that kind, it would resolve the problems of the countries which are at present struggling with this growing tendency to imbalance to which Deputy Norton referred?  Deputy Norton pointed out that when you examine the whole picture, it transpires that the British market is the market which is of real significance to us.  Why?  Because we have trading relations with Britain going back over seven centuries.  Ever since the first dawn of the industrial revolution, there have been intimate trading relations between us and Great Britain, because we have daily contact with Great Britain and because&mdash;and this is a very material and substantial <Col N="283" /> matter&mdash;any salesman going from here to Britain, when he trades with Britain, speaks the same language.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, what you eat for your breakfast in Britain is substantially what you eat for your breakfast in Ireland; what you wear in Birmingham is indistinguishable from what you wear in Cork; what you smoke in Cardiff is indistinguishable from what you smoke in Drogheda.  It is not until you go to the Continent that you discover that what you smoke on the Continent is radically different from what you smoke here.  What you eat for your breakfast in the morning on the Continent is different from what you eat for your breakfast here.  The clothes you wear on the Continent are entirely different from the clothes you wear here.</P>
    <P>It is relatively easy to trade with Great Britain, but to make any headway on the Continent of Europe involves a far more complex operation, and unless we can afford to build up the kind of sales organisation requisite to break in there, I suggest some device along the lines I now adumbrate is necessary if our problems and the problems of other small countries are not to be gravely complicated.  I am not offering this as a solution of all the problems that exist in international trading, but I am saying that until someone turns up with something better, unless we are to agree that, the OECD notwithstanding, the free world is to allow that dynamic to continue of the rich getting richer and the poor growing poorer, some interim step is required.  Here is one interim step that will solve our problems.</P>
    <P>It is a device that could be adapted to very much wider problems, including the problems of the underdeveloped countries in Africa and elsewhere, albeit the percentage may have to be graded down.  It is a form of economic development and co-operation that would produce results.  I suggest to the Minister that it is worth considering.</P>
    <P>I especially direct the Minister's attention to the matter raised by Deputy Cosgrave, the implications of which this Bill is the herald for the <Col N="284" /> men working in industry who are jeopardised by the developments that lie ahead.  They require, and they are entitled, to have a recognisable reassurance now.  In my judgment, the adaptation requisite to meet the new situation cannot be made without their effective co-operation, and you cannot get that co-operation unless they get the minimal reassurance.  I invite the Minister to provide it for them at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the difficulty of doing so.  I fully appreciate it.  I do not reprobate the Minister because he has not been able to rush in with a readymade scheme.  This Bill is a milestone in the journey towards a new situation which confronts us, and a milestone at which he should not allow himself to be further delayed in producing some blueprint which will meet the problems of the man who entered industry as a worker 30 years ago, and who now, in middle-age, foresees the disappearance of his job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have little difficulty in approving this Bill. Its purpose is simply to give power to the Government to exempt goods from particular countries from quota orders, and to exempt goods from particular countries from quota orders already made.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I am responsible for widening the scope of the debate in so far as I referred to the elimination of quotas, the expansion of quotas, and a review of some commodities which were under quotas.  Therefore, the Bill does not relate to the wider scope of the debate, that is, the effect the removal or expansion of quotas is likely to have on Irish industrial firms and their employees.  The meat of the debate was provided by those reductions to which I referred in introducing the Bill.  I thought that reference would be more appropriate on this Bill than in my reply to the general debate on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention to the House that only two quotas are being removed.  The firms manufacturing the goods which were covered by these quotas are satisfied that the removal <Col N="285" /> of the quotas will have no effect on the employment content or the output of their factories.  One is rubber proofed coating, the quota on which is being removed immediately, and the other is cycle tyres, the quota on which is not being removed immediately because of certain administrative difficulties in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both rubber commodities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, of course, there is more than one firm engaged in rubber proofing coats.  Each of these firms was consulted and they gave us the assurance we sought before the action was taken.  I want to assure all the Deputies who spoke and who expressed concern about one, the danger of removing quotas, and two, the danger of going too fast, that I am very conscious of these dangers and of the effect there might be on employees.  The extensions that will take place have been discussed with the firms involved and any reasonable fears they expressed were taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to two quotas, leather footwear and woollen and worsted piece goods.  One is being reviewed by the Industrial Development Authority and the other may be unless we can come to an agreement with the British, that is the woollen and worsted piece goods. If the quotas disappear it will be because of our obligation under the trade agreement but they will be replaced by tariffs.  Therefore, here again the reasonable requirements for the protection of the firms will be taken into account and, therefore, the problems that might be faced by the employees. I can assure Deputy Dillon that I am very conscious of the position of the type of man to whom he refers.  It has arisen in my own city where a big business undertaking closed down and went into voluntary liquidation and threw on the labour market a lot of men who had spent their lives working for this firm.  Their savings were perhaps dissipated by the obligations they had to their families and their commitments for their own housing were still outstanding and because of the level they had <Col N="286" /> reached in their employment they were not entitled to any social welfare payments.  I knew several of these men intimately and I knew some of them practically all my life and I have a good idea of the hardships these men can be involved in.  In fact, I have an even more personal contact with this problem because my own father was working for a concern which went out of business, probably from the same type of reason as Deputy Dillon mentioned in his case.  I can assure the House that I, for one, will be conscious of the difficulties of men and women in that position.</P>
    <P>As I think I told the House on a number of occasions, we had set up during the currency of our application for membership of the European Economic Community an inter-Departmental committee, headed by a Senior official of the Department of Social Welfare, examining the effects of the European Social Fund and how it could be applied and adapted here.  That committee is still in existence and they continued, notwithstanding the suspension of negotiations, to examine adaptation and retraining for workers and resettlement costs, so that while I cannot say that there is a ready solution to meet the type of case involved I hope as a result of this exercise, it will not be necessary because the ten per cent increase in the quotas now involving these commodities will not create a great problem for the firms involved, and the firms were specifically consulted.  I want to assure Deputy Barry of that, in all cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as footwear is concerned, I am afraid we have no say.  The British were entitled to apply at any time to have the quotas replaced by tariffs.  The obligation to examine any such application was at one time on the Prices Advisory Body and latterly the obligation reposed on the Industrial Development Authority.  At the present time they are examining such an application and they will be <Col N="287" /> bound to suggest a tariff to replace the quota.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as reasonable protection for Irish industrialists.  Within these limits, the IDA will have to impose the tariff in replacement.  In so far as the woollen and worsted goods are concerned, the British have the same right but we are now negotiating with the British to see if we can come to some agreement with them on woollen and worsted goods rather than have the matter submitted to the Industrial Development Authority for a similar type of review.  As Deputy Dillon said, we are members of OECD.  We hope to move towards liberalisation and I think we have a reasonable record in that regard so far.  We are also in this fast moving world where freer trade is pressing in on all sides and because of our isolation now, I think it would be wrong to stay in isolation so far as protection is concerned. As I said at the outset, it is important that we should make some move in this direction so as not to be left completely bereft of competitive ability say by 1966 or 1967, when tariffs, and possibly quotas, will have been removed in other European countries and when the results of the Kennedy round will have had its effects so far as the United States of America is concerned.  It is important that we should, even at some pain to ourselves, take steps to ensure that our industries will be reasonably competitive at a time when we hope we can take our place in an expanded European community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Norton and Deputy Cosgrave dwelt at some length on the balance of payments problem.  This Bill is not designed to improve that as <Col N="288" /> such.  We have the other Act, the Restriction of Imports Act, 1962, which was passed recently, but which as I stated in the House at the time, was designed to meet the position of imbalance as far as Iron Curtain countries were concerned.  It was not the intention to apply it to other countries but there is a considerable degree of control involved in this Bill.  If the position went out of hand with non-Iron Curtain countries I am sure I would get the goodwill of the House if I asked for it in the event of applying the provisions of the 1962 Act against non-Iron Curtain countries, if that were necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I need say except, again, that this Bill does not provide for the extensions of quotas which are now being proposed as well as the removal of a quota in one case and the removal, ultimately, of a quota in another case.  These have all been done by Orders under previous Bills and by Orders which will be effected in a short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to complete the arrangements necessary for the implementation of the revised scheme for the provision of finance for large-scale industrial projects The new grants scheme was given legislative sanction in the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act 1963 and the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act 1963 which became law on 20th February, 1963.  These Acts lay down special conditions for cases involving grants by An Foras Tionscal in excess of £250,000.  Included in the conditions are limits of up to 50 per cent of the <Col N="290" /> cost of the fixed assets or £1,000 per worker employed in the industry, when in full production, whichever is the lesser.  For projects of a high capital cost and relatively low labour content, grants within the limits I have mentioned might not in themselves be adequate to attract the industries to this country.  On the other hand, it would not be desirable to give a grant of up to 50 per cent of the cost of fixed assets in every case regardless of the labour content as this could result in grants running into millions of pounds for some projects involving very little employment.  The Government, having considered various possibilities, have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to make provision for supplementing grants, in cases involving very large expenditure, by making available other financial facilities, including loans on preferential terms.</P>
      <P>There are good grounds for arguing that part of the financial assistance to be provided by the State in these cases should take the form of participation in the equity capital.  Provision is being made in the Bill to facilitate arrangements of this kind.  Equity participation by the State has been suggested to a number of industrialists interested in establishing factories here, but the response has not always been favourable.  Insistence on a share in the equity capital in all cases where large grants are provided by the State might, as the Committee on Industrial Organisation recognised in a recent report on industrial grants, reduce the attractions of the grants scheme and this could hinder the efforts being made to attract really worthwhile projects to the country.  The special loans scheme was accordingly devised as a partial alternative to equity participation. It implements one of the recommendations in the CIO report to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, in the course of the debate on the industrial grants legislation, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that the Government had decided that a special Finance Company should be established to provide on preferential terms a proportion of any loan finance <Col N="291" /> required to supplement a grant.  The present Bill provides for the establishment of this new company.  The Industrial Credit Company will continue to be available to provide loan finance on commercial terms.</P>
    <P>The special loan scheme evolved is better in some respects than equity participation.  These loans would rank before all shareholders in the event of a liquidation, and provision is being made for a sharing in the profits in so far as dividends in excess of 7½ per cent are paid.</P>
    <P>Promoters will be required to provide at least one-third of the cost of fixed assets and the State agencies concerned will be in a position to provide the balance of up to two-thirds. This arrangement will mean that the promoter of an industrial undertaking will be supplying the entire working capital, plus one-third of the cost of fixed assets.  Such an order of participation would be a guarantee of the promoter's confidence in the viability of the project and would be a strong inducement to make a success of the enterprise.  Also, the scheme should ensure that no worthwhile industry will be lost to the State because of inadequate financial facilities.</P>
    <P>Grants by An Foras Tionscal will, of course, be subject to the limits laid down in the relevant Acts.  Any balance to be provided by loan from State sources will be partly by way of a contract loan given by the Credit Company at normal interest rates and repayable within a period of up to 12 years with no capital repayment for the first two years, and partly by way of an unsecured special loan provided by the new company, repayable only at the option of the borrower, and free of interest for a period up to 7 years.  Thereafter the special loan would bear interest at the same rate as applied to the contract loan, plus additional interest at the rate of ½ per cent for each 1 per cent per annum paid by way of dividend on the promoters' investment in excess of 7½ per cent.  Promoters can avoid the payment of this higher rate of interest by redeeming the loan.  The <Col N="292" /> arrangement ensures, therefore, that for successful projects the State will either participate in the profits or secure the return of the loan capital provided.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wonder why it should be necessary to form a separate company for the purpose I have mentioned. There are two main reasons. First, it is outside the functions of the Industrial Credit Company to provide loans of the kind contemplated. The Industrial Credit Company operates in accordance with the normal commercial criteria of a finance house and it would not be appropriate to require it to engage in this new type of business.  As Deputies are aware, the company provides special loans for re-equipment and expansion to meet conditions of free trade on terms which include waiver of interest and deferment of capital repayments for up to five years.  However, these special loans are secured loans and are in a different category from the unsecured loans redeemable only at the option of the borrower which the new company will provide.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the new company will have other functions which I shall refer to shortly.  I would like, however, at this point to assure Deputies that the establishment of the new company will not complicate the grants and loans arrangements or add to the bodies that promoters have to deal with.  To secure economy in administration, the new company's affairs will be managed by the Industrial Credit Company.  Consequently, persons seeking loan facilities from the State will, as hitherto, have to deal only with that company. Subject to the necessary detailed arrangements being worked out, it is contemplated that the Industrial Credit Company, having satisfied itself as to the merits of an application, will divide the approved loan into two equal parts, one of which will be provided by the Credit Company itself in the normal way and the other half by the new company.  Applicants will thus have no direct dealings with the new company and there is no reason to fear that the arrangements will complicate the work of industrial promotion.  I should add that cases will be confined <Col N="293" /> to the relatively small number eligible for grants from An Foras Tionscal in excess of £250,000.</P>
    <P>Although it would not, as I have explained, be practicable in general to secure for the State an equity interest where substantial financial assistance is provided by the Exchequer, it is desirable to take power to enable shares to be so acquired in any case in which equity participation would be a desirable and acceptable manner of providing finance.  The new company will be responsible for holding such shares on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the company will have the powers of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  taking up shares and debentures in hotel companies to which a grant or guarantee of borrowing has been or is to be given under the Tourist Traffic Acts;</P>
    <P>(ii)  taking up shares in Aviation Development Limited, the development company established by the Potez interests in connection with the project to manufacture commercial aircraft in this country;</P>
    <P>(iii)  taking over from the Industrial Credit Company Limited the shares and debentures in Industrial Engineering Company Limited, Dundalk;</P>
    <P>(iv)  guaranteeing borrowing of companies to which An Foras Tionscal make grants.</P>
    <P>In two hotel cases in which large grants were given, it was found desirable that the State should participate in the equity and this was effected through Aer Rianta and the Industrial Credit Company.  It is now desirable to make specific arrangements to provide for any further cases that may arise.</P>

    <P>As regards the aircraft project, two companies have been formed, one a development company to be jointly owned by the Government and the Potez concern and the other a manufacturing <Col N="294" /> company to be owned by the Potez interests.  One half of the capital of the development company equal to the proved cost of the special tooling, but not exceeding £1.5 million, will be provided by the Government, and the special tooling will be the property of the development company.  An equal amount of capital will be held by the Potez interests, representing the development work carried out by them, and the corresponding assets, including all the designs and prototypes, will also become the property of the development company.  For the first ten years, half of the profits of the manufacturing company in excess of £100,000 a year will be paid to the development company and no dividends will be paid by the manufacturing company to its shareholders until the amount subscribed to the development company has been paid to it.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company Limited holds shares to the amount of nearly £½ million and debentures totalling about £2 million in the Industrial Engineering Company Limited, Dundalk.</P>

      <P>The Credit Company' participation in the Dundalk under taking arose out of Government policy for the utilisation of the engineering works of the Great Northern Railway when these works became separated from the transport concern.  It is considered in the circumstances that the new company, when established, would be the more appropriate body to hold the shares and debentures on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>The provision authorising the proposed company to guarantee borrowings by companies to which An Foras Tionscal make grants is complementary to the power to issue loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the new company will not take up shares or give loans or guarantees of loans except on the direction of the Minister for Finance, given after consultation with the appropriate Minister and with the agreement of the companies concerned. The projects with which the new company <Col N="295" /> will be concerned&mdash;with the exception of the Dundalk undertaking &mdash;will already have been examined by either An Foras Tionscal or Bord Fáilte as the case may be; in addition, projects involving special loans will have been examined by the Industrial Credit Company in connection with an application for commercial loans.  The new company will thus be a channel for State investments undertaken on the basis of an examination of the projects by autonomous State agencies.  It will have the duty of watching over the progress of concerns in which it holds shares, debentures or loan capital on behalf of the State and to bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance any development likely to affect those investments.</P>
    <P>The company will have a nominal share capital; it is proposed to finance its operations by repayable advances from the Exchequer within a limit of £7½ million.  A sum of £1½ million will be required for the investment in Aviation Development Limited and up to £2½ million in respect of the transfer from the Industrial Credit Company of their shares and debentures in Industrial Engineering Company Limited.  This leaves a balance of about £3½ million for the other purposes of the company.</P>
    <P>The facilities being provided under the Bill will enhance the attractive incentives now open to persons establishing new industries here and should reinforce the impetus given to industrial development by these measures.  The availability of the company to serve as a holding body for certain State investments will also fill a gap in our financial institutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me where in the <Col N="296" /> Bill is that limitation imposed, because, as I read the Bill, everyone who gets a grant from An Foras Tionscal, will be entitled to come within this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>First of all, let me say that the manner in which this Bill was first thrown to the Dáil without any explanation or indication of its purpose on the day it was circulated is something that deserves criticism. Some few days after its circulation, there was a blurb in the papers which I expect was an inspired attempt to rectify the crude manner in which a Bill, which purely is an operating Bill, was put out without any indication or explanation of its purpose.</P>
      <P>The more I see of this Bill, the more I feel that it is an attempt to cover up in a clumsy and crude way a few ghastly mistakes.  The Bill, I had thought first of all, was an attempt to do something that I have been saying for a long time should be done.  I believed and I had hoped when I saw the introduction of the Bill on First Reading here that it was designed to provide that the attempt that had been made to hide ghastly failures under the shadow of commercial viability service given by the Industrial Credit Company would end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions in this House on the desirability that something should have been done at the time in relation to the situation in the Great Northern Railway Works, Dundalk, when the Great Northern Railway folded up.  I made it clear then, and I make it clear again now, that I accepted wholeheartedly that there was an obligation on the Government to take some steps to provide alternative employment for those concerned.  Deputy Dillon on the Control of Imports Bill today made <Col N="297" /> our view clear in relation to those employed in industry where industry is forced to fold up because of the wind of change now blowing across the world in relation to free trade. So, too, was our view in relation to those employed in the Great Northern Railway.  The manner in which more than one Minister of the Government came in here and told the House that the loans made by the Industrial Credit Company to Dundalk were purely commercial loans is something of which the Government cannot now be proud.  The manner in which a Minister of the Government came in here on many occasions and indicated that the venture in Dundalk was an entirely private enterprise venture and he was therefore debarred from giving any details in relation to it when, in fact, it was all the time a State-operated concern, is also something of which the Government cannot now be proud.</P>
    <P>Later, in some detail, I shall expose the fake behind this Bill and behind the Minister's speech when he talks of transferring £2½ million from Industrial Engineering in Dundalk to the new company; £2½ million perhaps in nominal value, but I doubt if that £2½ million is worth, for reasons I shall give later, as much as £250,000.  What has happened is that at least £2¼ million of the taxpayer's money has been lost, lost by wrong handling in the early stages of that venture; and the Minister is producing this Bill now as a means of covering up the mess made because of the obstinacy of the Taoiseach in insisting that one particular man should be left in complete and absolute control, notwithstanding that that man had been found out earlier as being a person with feet of clay where industrial management is concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, if it were only one instance, we might grumble, we might criticise, we might complain.  It would not matter if it were only one instance.  But the significant fact is that this Bill is drawn on the basis of the future and the future will be cut on this particular pattern.  I have always felt that any commercially viable proposition put forward should be handled as a purely <Col N="298" /> commercially viable proposition by the Industrial Credit Company.  That is accepted now.  I am glad that the Government have gone as far as accepting that, but, where it is not a commercially viable proposition, one that cannot reach proper commercial standards, it is entirely wrong and improper for the Government to bring pressure on the Industrial Credit Company to make finances available.  That the Government did that can be shown without question in relation to Dundalk. In fact, it has been admitted by the Minister in the speech he has just made.  Where the Government feel it essential in the national interest that money should be invested in a concern which is not economically viable, there is an obligation on the Government honestly and honourably to say so, to state that they are doing this because they believe it is desirable in the national interest and not try to hide behind any cloak of commercial viability.  The Government should state &ldquo;We are doing this because we think the national interest demands that it should be done for reasons (a), (b), (c) and (d).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to Dundalk, having regard to the hardship involved on those employed there, there was undoubtedly a case for the Government coming out openly and saying they were going to take certain steps and they were taking them in the national interest.  They did not do that. They said that this was a commercial proposition and it was being handled by the Industrial Credit Company as a commercial proposition.  We know now that it was not a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>What are the Government doing in this Bill?  They are providing through the medium of the definition of a State-assisted company a back door which will not be open to the glare of public opinion and, relying on anonymity and secrecy, they can take certain steps to deal with particular concerns. I, of course, accept the Minister's word when he says, as Minister for Finance, that it is the intention to restrict the operations of this Bill to those companies given grants of more than £250,000 by An Foras Tionscal. <Col N="299" /> If that is the intention, then why was the Bill not drawn on that basis?</P>
    <P>We are here setting up a statutory corporation.  We are here giving a company that will operate within the four walls of this Bill power to say that it is operating within the provisions of this Bill.  A State-assisted industry means an industry that has received at any time any grant from An Foras Tionscal.  That will be the position under the Bill as drafted.  If the Bill were drafted in such a way that its operation would be restricted to companies with grants in excess of £250,000, that should have been stated in the Bill.  To bring the Bill to the House, without including that provision, is sloppy drafting and not the type of drafting one would expect from the Minister and the Department of Finance.  I accept the Minister's word that that is his intention, but I suspect that the intention really is to leave the door open for a change at a later date, a change that can be made without the knowledge of the general public.</P>
    <P>If the intention is&mdash;I accept the Minister's word&mdash;that the Bill will be restricted to companies with grants in excess of £250,000, then the Minister should have told us today what companies have so far got, or been promised, grants in excess of £250,000.  He did not do that.  We are apparently expected to pass this Bill blindfold.  It is easy for a Minister introducing a measure such as this to say that anybody who criticises it is preventing employment, that anybody who criticises it is preventing expansion.  I fully understand the ease with which such criticism can be made but when sums of taxpayers' money as large as are involved here are being expended and the means for their expenditure is being provided, somebody has a duty, no matter how unpopular it may be or no matter how much the Minister may be able to point a finger in relation to it, to come out and to state boldly the results of the mistakes of the past and how those mistakes of the past can influence the future.</P>
    <P>I want to know what companies other than the companies named here <Col N="300" /> have got grants in excess of £250,000. I want to know why there is no restriction in this Bill on the company giving the facilities where the amount is under £250,000 in grant and I want to know why there is no provision in this Bill prohibiting facilities where it can happen that there will be unfair competition with existing concerns.</P>
    <P>I can see that there might have been a case for coming in here in relation to stated industries, naming them, putting them down bravely and bluntly on the face of this Bill, putting down on the face of this Bill, for example, Verolme Dockyard which already has, I understand, got facilities of over £2.3 million contractually and I suspect that one of the reasons behind this is that they will be given additional facilities by the Minister under this legislation.  It is well known that they have applied for them.  It is well known that some of the work they have done has been done by them in competition with another Irish similar concern, that it has been done at a loss and that it was taken at a loss by contract because the other concerns were contracting at realistic figures at which they knew it could be done.  It was done by the concern in the South at a loss, and, having regard to the existing contractual arrangements that were made, it means losing taxpayers' money.  Losing taxpayers' money is bad enough but when, as well as losing taxpayers' money, business is taken away from another private enterprise concern, it is worse.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions here across the House in relation to Dundalk with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the fact that work was taken and staff were enticed from my constituency up to Dundalk with the assistance of the taxpayers' money. It will not improve our economy as a whole if work that was formerly done in one part of the country is merely transferred to another part, particularly when it means that it is being done at a very heavy loss of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever personally examined the affairs and the balance sheets of the <Col N="301" /> Industrial Engineering Company in Dundalk because there is in relation to his speech in reference to it a naivete or simplicity, and whatever other criticisms any of us may have about Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance nobody could accuse him of being naive or simple.  What is the position about this £2½ million it is alleged will be transferred to the Industrial Credit Company in respect of Dundalk?  The Minister, I am quite sure, has later accounts than I have been able to get in the Companies Office in this respect but in relation to Dundalk, the pattern on which we were asked to pass this Bill is that the Industrial Engineering Company had had an authorised share capital of £1 million and an issued share capital of £500,000, of which all but some 502 shares are held by the Industrial Credit Company Limited.  The 502 shares are held as qualifying shares by the directors and I suspect are held by them only as nominees of the Minister for Finance, but that is a matter on which anybody inspecting the documents in the Companies Office records is not able to judge.</P>
    <P>Let me take the liabilities first. Capital of £500,000 was put in.  There is a capital reserve of £19,262 in respect of the proceeds of the sale of assets taken over from the Great Northern Railway Board.  There is a loss on profit and loss appropriation account of £49,966&mdash;call it £50,000. The Industrial Credit Company have lent £1½ million.  When one adds that to the £500,000 in shares, one finds a figure of £2 million.  I got those figures out of the Companies Office and the Minister himself acknowledges that this concern which is to be taken over under Section 3 of the Bill had £2½ million advanced by the Industrial Credit Company.  Of that figure of £2 million at the date of the balance sheet I have in my hand, £143,000 had been given as an unsecured loan to the subsidiary associated companies; £470,943 had been given for shares in the subsidiary companies at cost; and there were sums due by those associated companies of £112,280.</P>
    <P>When one examines the accounts of the subsidiary companies, whether it <Col N="302" /> is the Dundalk Engineering Works, which has an operating loss of £278,854, whether it is Frank Bonser and Co. Ltd., which has an adverse balance on the profit and loss account of £4,479; whether it is Dealgan Steel Founders, Limited which also has a deficit balance on the profit and loss account of £105,963; or whether it is in respect of Commercial Road Vehicles, I defy any accountant to produce any real or tangible assets for the £2 million invested in that department by the Industrial Credit Company other than, perhaps, about £350,000 to £400,000.  The same assets still remain but another £500,000 has gone in and it is true beyond doubt that the Dundalk operation has meant that the Government have lost £2 million of the taxpayers' money. In spite of the £2 million that has gone, the amount of employment given was something without any comparative value because the £500,000 that was not lost would have, adequately and properly, if it had been invested in a sensible manner, provided for the employment that is given in the works.</P>
    <P>We all know of the almost-scandal that arose in respect of the Heinkel motor cars.  The manner in which funds provided by the State were lost in that venture was common gossip. I believe that Commercial Road Vehicles, the subsidiary company in Dundalk, will prove a success and it is the only one that will.  The others have meant the loss of £2 million of taxpayers' money and the tragedy is that it has been wasted in such a way that it has given no real permanent employment in return for the investment made.  If the amount spent were going to mean permanent employment for those whose employment was jeopardised by the closing of the works, I am quite certain everybody on all sides of the House would have said: &ldquo;That is worth doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of doing it like that, the Government chose the backhanded way of pretending this was a commercial proposition, when in no circumstances could anyone have believed it to be such if he examined the matter in any <Col N="303" /> detail.  I urge the Minister when replying to this debate to tell us how much money has been lost in that venture and to provide by way of Estimate for the amount that has been lost to be paid back to the ICC, money that it should never, as a judge of commercial viable concerns, have been asked to pay, an amount that should have been provided by the Government in the ordinary way by Vote of this House. He should provide now to wipe out the loss and to give this new company at least a chance of starting off in that respect on the right foot, without being told that they are taking over an asset of £2½ million that I think would be generously valued at £500,000.  That would be a better proposition and would make for better accounting in the future in the strict sense of the term in relation to the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, we are told frankly by the Minister&mdash;I commend him for his frankness in this respect&mdash;that the purpose, to a large extent, is the provision of £1½ million for Aviation Development Limited.  I know nothing about that concern but I read in the papers that a man who has been able to make a great success of his own business and who with his own private enterprise, investment, drive and money has been able to further the company very largely that he controls, operates and directs, said in public&mdash;and was not afraid to say&mdash; that this particular industry had been hawked all around Europe.  I should like to know, before this House concedes £1½ million to such an investment, whether that is true or not.  I should like to know the exact terms on which those funds are being made available.</P>
    <P>Some people say that when a person comes in with any investment here, he should not be asked, and Ministers should not be asked, to disclose the terms on which facilities are given by the State.  I have never held that view, whether on this side of the House or the other.  If a person wants to come in and start a business here, we should encourage him as far as possible.  They are all welcome and <Col N="304" /> nobody should pry into their private business but the day they ask to make their private business a matter of cashing in on the taxpayers' money for assistance, there is an entirely different standard to be used in judging the operation.  Such people by their own act, in asking that taxpayers' money be handed to them as a grant, are themselves saying that they wish their arrangements to be open to the daylight of criticism.  It is not then a matter of a Minister or a Government disclosing private affairs; it is the person who comes along and says: &ldquo;I may be able to go into this on my own or privately but I want some of the general taxpayers' money as well as the money I am putting into it.&rdquo;  Once a person says that, there is an obligation on the Minister concerned to say: &ldquo;Certainly, but I am the guardian of public funds and as such I must be in a position to ensure that the light of public opinion is let into this operation involving the spending of public funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This does not do that; it provides by a veiled definition that State funds can be passed on, State interests taken over in other concerns without proper public examination.  The very least that should be done in relation to Section 3 of this Bill is to provide that companies who are already named should be named and in addition, that any other companies who want to get help through the operation of this Bill should be named by ministerial Order tabled in the House.  Short of that, there will be no way in which the public will know of what happens here.  We will be faced perhaps in a few years time with the same story of heavy loss to which I have already referred and faced with it on the basis of: &ldquo;Oh, well; it is done under the cloak of commercial viability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole method of disbursement of public funds through State companies of one sort or another has now reached such a proportion of our total capital resources as to require new thinking as to its method of control. The Minister complained on Budget day that buoyancy of revenue was not sufficient to match the increased charge arising for the public debt.  Why? <Col N="305" /> Because the investments that had been made did not produce their returns. Is that of itself not a criticism of the selection of those investments.</P>
    <P>Investments by the State can, of course, produce a return in two different ways.  They can be self-financing, that is to say, they contain within themselves the seeds that will provide for the repayment of interest on the moneys lent and of the sinking fund. Therefore, in the method of financing provided by the Government it is little more than a loan in the true sense of the term.  Apart from that, they can provide their desirability in the additional revenue or expansion they are likely to generate, not merely in the public sector alone but in the whole economy.  That type of investment is, of course, sometimes a difficult one for a Minister for Finance to handle, but, nevertheless, can be an excellent one from the point of view of the national interest.</P>
    <P>When we get a position, as the Minister said in his Budget Statement, in which the cost of financing an investment had not been met by the revenue coming in directly, on the one hand, or by buoyancy of general revenue, on the other, surely it is time for us to sit back and to think, criticise and see whether the manner in which those investments had been selected was one over which we would all desire to stand?  Therefore, I would suggest to the House that at present, when investment of public moneys to State-sponsored companies of one sort or another has reached such fantastic proportions in relation to the national availability of capital assets, a case is now to be made for something equivalent to the Committee of Public Accounts for voted moneys.  That Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General operate in relation to the moneys voted by this Dáil to ensure that the instructions of the Dáil in relation to such payments are truthfully and faithfully carried out.  It is not for the Comptroller and Auditor General to challenge in any way the policy of any payment.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to challenge in any way the policy of any payment.  All the Comptroller and Auditor General, in <Col N="306" /> fact, does is to see by his detailed accounting procedure that the instructions given by this House are not exceeded and that the funds paid out are paid out by the authority of this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disbursement of ordinary governmental expenditure, be it on the Supply Estimates or in relation to the Central Funds, that procedure is perfectly adequate.  It ensures that the Minister concerned must come to the Dáil and seek proper and adequate authority before he disburses public funds by way of Supply Estimates or otherwise.  The Central Fund payments are, of course, made under statutory direction in the various acts. We have now arrived at a situation in which the role of the State-sponsored body takes up such a very large sector of the whole economy and such a large proportion of the available capital, that something must be done to ensure that the State-sponsored bodies operate within a system of proper and adequate control.</P>
    <P>Let me not be in any way misunderstood when I say I know that the Minister for Finance and other Ministers do through their Departments keep some tag on the expenditure of those companies.  But I do not think that is sufficient.  We will have to provide something that is, if you like, a committee of this House dealing with State-sponsored bodies, whose task and function is to supervise their working, and further to have an equivalent to the Comptroller and Auditor General who will be able to ensure that the policy adopted in relation to those is the same as the policy indicated when the enabling Bill was going through the House.</P>
    <P>I put it that way deliberately because the State-sponsored body always has its functions in relation to direct year to year policy laid down in this House but within the terms of an enabling Bill, enabling, perhaps, as in this case, the inauguration of a company under the Companies Acts or in other cases, a specific board to be set up.  Once it has been set up, it does not come back again for review or it is never considered for public review unless further or additional funds are required.  On <Col N="307" /> the other hand, if there were some means of assessment, some means of criticism, without danger of preventing day to day administration, we would not be faced with the same problems as those with which we have been faced in relation to a couple of those concerns.</P>
    <P>I believe it was wrong to get the Industrial Credit Company to deal with cases that were not commercially viable.  That was prostituting the functions of the Industrial Credit Company.  I believe it is right to provide that where something requires it to be done in the national interest the Minister and the Government should have appropriate power to direct such would be done, but it should be done properly, clearly, cleanly and above board by the Minister concerned.  It should be done by naming the concern, scheduling it perhaps in an Order and putting that Order on the Table of the House so that if any Deputy, in relation to the disposal of taxpayers' money, believes something is not right, he can come in here and, by putting down the normal annulling motion, openly ventilate what has come to his ears.</P>
    <P>We all hear from time to time rumours about one concern or another and we endeavour, in so far as we can, to see whether those rumours are with or without foundation.  Nothing can do a company more harm than that rumours without foundation would float around about it day after day, week after week, perhaps month after month.  The Minister must know as well as I do that, in respect to those companies who are assisted by Government directive and by an estimate of public viability by the Industrial Credit Company, those rumours will continue unless there is some method of ensuring a proper, competent and clear examination.</P>
    <P>Any company worth its salt has nothing to fear from such an examination. On the contrary, any company worth its salt knows that the result of such an examination would be to put an end to rumours without foundation which might otherwise <Col N="308" /> damage it.  The Minister should know that far from harming our industrial structure in so far as the State sponsored bodies are concerned, it would give a sound basis to industry generally and would achieve public respect as well.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  I do not think that will be any surprise to anybody, in view of the oft-stated policy of the Labour Party of favouring greater initiative by the State in industry and the participation of the State in the industrial sphere in cases where private enterprise does not seem to be able to do the job or appears to be unwilling to do the job.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.  I trust it is not the end of State participation in industry as described here in the Bill and as elaborated in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have advocated this for a number of years and whether that has been in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Government or not I do not know.  The Minister will admit this is one of the things we have been advocating for a long time.  We hope these proposals are designed to offset to the greatest extent possible redundancies that may arise with the dismantling of our tariff and quota systems, because it seems many of the captains of industry here at the present time who feel they cannot readapt themselves and change their industries to suit keener competition will go under, leaving a gap to be filled by somebody.</P>
      <P>If private enterprise does not fill that gap, my Party believe it is the duty of the State to step in.  We, therefore, trust that this measure is designed to provide against redundancy in the event of our becoming a member of the EEC, in the event of freer trade coming along, whether we are members of the EEC or some other trade organisation.  Quite a number of factories have been established here in recent years with pretty valuable State assistance by way of loan and grant. While it is a good thing that industrial employment in these factories has increased to some extent, at the same time we must have regard to the type of person employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I have no firm figures available but it has been indicated to me that while male adult workers get valuable employment in these industries, in many of them the emphasis seems to be on juvenile female labour, one might say. I appreciate young boys and girls coming out of school are entitled to employment but our primary concern must be the provision of factories to give work to adult male workers.  If we are to continue to lose the cream of our manhood through emigration it is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note&mdash;and I trust this is not mere lip service&mdash;the Minister's seeming interest in the establishment of industries with emphasis on the provision of employment. The State have, through their agencies, given good loans and grants towards the establishment of new industries, and while I know these agencies have had regard to the employment content in such factories, I would suggest that the primary qualification for a grant or loan should be tied to this labour content question. Many industries have been opened by the various Ministers and invariably we hear that, though at the start the industries would employ only about 30, ultimately the employment content would rise to 300 or 400.  I wonder if these objectives are often realised. They seem to me to have been very much exaggerated in many cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister should here go much further than the Minister for Industry and Commerce did in the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act and the Undeveloped Areas Act to ensure that the maximum employment possible will be given and that this will be the primary qualification for the payment of grants.  I note in Section 3, which is the principal section, a list of the types of industry in which the Minister may acquire, hold, sell, assign and otherwise deal with shares and debentures.  They are listed as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  a state-assisted industrial company,</P>
    <P>(ii)  a company to which a grant or guarantee of borrowing has been or is to be given under the Tourist <Col N="310" /> Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1961, in respect of the development of holiday accommodation,</P>
    <P>(iii)  Aviation Development Limited,</P>
    <P>(iv)  Industrial Engineering Company Limited,</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has considered whether that list should be extended.  If he has not already done so, he should give consideration to the extension of such investment as is described here, under which quite a number of other industries which would qualify would be assisted by this company.  Those are the new industries that have been established over the past 20, 30 or 40 years.  In the past two decades, we have had a system of State assistance either by loan or grant, and I think many of our existing industries would qualify.</P>
    <P>There are many old established industries that have given, and continue to give, very valuable employment, industries that were established 50, 75 or 100 years ago, through private investment.  I suggest that the possibility of their being assisted through this measure might be explored.  I know the difficulties that might be involved, but surely, with the agreement of the owners or the directors who would invite the Government to participate, it might be possible to give those old established industries a shot in the arm, so to speak, to enable them to compete with those they will be selling against or with, with the advent of freer trade.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the possibility of our becoming a member of the EEC, the Minister should also consider the total acquisition of industries that do not seem to have either the intention or the desire to readapt themselves, to modernise their machinery, or to make improvements to meet the challenge. I do not know whether that is possible within the terms of this Bill, but I believe that unless it is done by the State in respect of private industries that have no intention or desire to do anything, we will have a lot of unemployment and redundancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister may describe this as a beginning or an experiment.  I appreciate that it is a beginning, and somewhat of an experiment, but there are industries in many parts of the country <Col N="311" /> that never asked for &ldquo;a bob&rdquo; from the State which now feel they are in a pretty bad way and could do with a shot in the arm.  I should qualify that by saying that the industry it is proposed to assist should satisfy this company that there is a desire and a firm purpose on the part of the owners or the management to make the changes they believe would make the firm progressive and maintain or increase employment.</P>
    <P>I assume that in respect of an industry in which the State invests money or acquires shares, there will be some form of control&mdash;I do not suggest overall control&mdash;by the Government through their agency, this company, and that they will have some say in the determination of policy. That may be implicit in the Minister's speech, but I should like him to pin-point it and say whether what I believe is a fact.  I do not want to flog this, but we have had the unfortunate experience of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines in Avoca to which the State advanced many millions of pounds.  It may be true that over the past two or three years of the life of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had an idea of what was happening, but up to a short time before the death of the copper mines, the Dáil and the general public had no idea that its death was imminent.</P>
    <P>We had no direct representation in the St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  We had no say in the formulation of policy, and we had no say in the administration of the affairs of the company.  I have always believed, and I still believe, that where the State provides substantial sums of money by way of loan, and particularly by way of grant, there should also be some Government representation which will be conversant with the policy of the company, which will participate in the formulation of policy and which will, in effect, look after the interests of the people of the country, the taxpayers, who in the heel of the hunt are the only people who will lose if there is to be a loss. There have been losses in many of <Col N="312" /> these concerns to which the State advanced money.  People are beginning to resent the fact that they have no representation, through the Government, in concerns in which large sums of their money are involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government have always told us they have no function, An Foras Tionscal have no function, and the Industrial Development Authority have no function, in placing industries throughout the country.  They will now be required to have a function in determining where an industry is to be established.  If my memory serves me correctly, one of the general reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation suggested&mdash;I forget the actual term they used&mdash;the regionalisation of industries.  It is not unreasonable that when a big project such as the Minister envisages in the Bill is being established, the Government, through the company which it is now proposed to set up, should have not a vital say, but a say, in where that industry is to be established.  That is very important, especially in view of the importance the CIO placed upon the proposal they made to the Government, which I think was more or less accepted in principle by the Government on consideration of the report.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I should like to know, if the Minister has the information available.  I have always believed that the financial encouragement we give to foreigners to establish industries here is very generous.  Maybe I am entirely wrong in that, but I wonder has the Minister any figures or information to demonstrate what inducements are offered, say, by other European countries to those who contemplate establishing industries there. I do not know what competition we have to meet in trying to induce people to set up industries here.  It would be interesting and very informative to know how we compare with other European countries in the assistance we give by way of loan or grant to encourage the establishment of industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Sweetman's plea that we should get more information in this House about investments by way of grant or loan in <Col N="313" /> industry.  The usual reply is to the effect that it would not be proper or usual to disclose the innermost secrets of a particular industry.  One can see immediately the disadvantage at which an industry might be placed if information about its business were disclosed to the Dáil and, of course, to the public.  But apart from the reports we get annually from An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Development Authority, etc., with regard to grants, some system could be evolved such as the one we have at present in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts which would ensure that representatives of the House were satisfied that the money was being spent to the best advantage, that there were no scandals, and that there was no special preference for this person or that person, or for this section or that section.</P>
    <P>As I say, I approve of this Bill and I would ask the Minister to say what conclusion he came to if he has considered my proposal regarding the investment by the State in ordinary industry where the industry wants the injection of new capital or where it is evident that a particular industry has no intention of changing its methods and machinery for the period which we are entering, when it is obvious that we are entering a period of freer trade, whether in the EEC or any other organisation.  It is most important that that should be done and more important especially in our present circumstances that the State should, where private enterprise either fails or refuses to do the job, step in and as far as humanly possible ensure that industry will be built up and that we will not have redundancy but increased employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but having listened to Deputy Sweetman criticising the Government for putting money into the Dundalk Engineering Works I feel I must say something on this matter.  It is easy for Deputy Sweetman to see all the faults now and to criticise. I feel that if Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for Finance, had shown some foresight, we might not have been involved in the very <Col N="314" /> difficult problem regarding the DEW which faced us in 1957.  This money was used to save the employment of 1,000 men in the old Great Northern Railway works.  Not only that, but it was used to save the economy of Dundalk town which everybody knew would have collapsed, were it not for the action taken by the Government then.  I will go into what actually happened at the time very briefly.  About November, 1955, Lord Glentoran, the then Minister for Commerce in the Six Counties, publicly stated that it was the policy of the Six County Government to close down the railway lines in the Six Counties.  Immediately that statement was made, it was obvious to everybody, and particularly to those working in the GNR works, that there would be considerable redundancy in the works even if the lines in this part of the country were not affected, because the GNR works in Dundalk were doing all the maintenance and repair work for the whole GNR system, in the Six Counties as well as in the 26 Counties.</P>
      <P>It was, also, obvious that if the Northern lines were closed down, the branch lines joining the 26 Counties main lines with those in the Six Counties would also have to close down and therefore there would be even more redundancy because the loss of traffic would affect the system here. That was the time in 1955 when the Government should have been doing something about the matter, when they would have had at least two years to take the necessary steps to provide alternative employment for the people in the works.  That was the time when the Coalition Government had the time and the opportunity to make the necessary changes.  However, the Coalition Government did nothing and in 1957 when we came into office the whole problem fell into our laps and we had to face this problem at once. The result was that the Government had no option but to endeavour as quickly as possible to establish whatever industry it was possible to establish in Dundalk to ensure that these people would not lose their employment.  That was an exceptionally difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> I can clearly remember the feeling of relief in Dundalk when the Government made a move and ensured the employment of those men.  Despite what Deputy Sweetman says, they provided very considerable employment and are still providing it for the workers in Dundalk.  I am perfectly well aware that the Fine Gael Party had been itching to make use of this matter for a considerable time and they have been wondering when it would be politically expedient to do so.  I do not know if they reckon that this was the politically expedient time to do it but I am well aware of the fact that they were anxious to draw whatever political kudos they could from the difficulties being experienced in the works.  Their hopes in that respect will misfire.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman has developed a certain technique recently in this House.  He always tries to give the impression to the Dáil and to the country that there is something sinister behind whatever we do.  Sometimes it catches on and people say: &ldquo;Maybe there is something in it,&rdquo; but he knows there is no truth whatever in it.  However, I do not expect honesty from Deputy Sweetman as a politician and therefore I have to put up with it. There is nothing sinister about this Bill.  As a matter of fact, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was dealing with the Industrial Grants Bill in February, he forecast the introduction of this Bill.  He said the Minister for Finance would bring it in and he gave a short outline of what this Bill would deal with.  That was the first mention of this Bill in the Dáil.  The Bill has now come along and we are told that it is a crude attempt to cover up some ghastly failures and so on.  He went on to point out that we are trying to hide the affairs of the Dundalk Engineering Works but then he went on to read all the figures himself.  That was a silly sort of performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he said he could not <Col N="316" /> find these figures, there would have been some case but having made the accusation that we are trying to hide the figures, he then read them out. Somebody published them and Deputy Sweetman got them and read them out. Why then does he think that we are trying to cover things up?</P>
      <P>Of course, he made the usual accusation&mdash;that the Taoiseach had appointed a friend to look after things there and that he was a failure.  The Taoiseach appointed a man who had very large experience in transport matters. He is not there now.  A few changes have been made in the meantime. It looks as if no man can solve the problem there in the way Deputy Sweetman would like it to be solved. It is a hard case to deal with.  It is unfair to blame any man for not making a complete success of the whole thing.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Company have been examining the accounts of these various Dundalk companies. They intend to put them down at their present value before they hand them over to this new company.  The new company will get the assets at a proper value handed over to them.  The Industrial Credit Company will be relieved of any expenditure they made in the Dundalk factories so far.  Everything will be cleared up.  Nothing will be hidden from the Dáil or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>If I come here and ask for money to pay what is due, I cannot very well hide it from Deputy Sweetman or anybody else.  I would advise Deputy Sweetman to try to deal with these things in a straight and honest way. If he can help in solving the Dundalk situation, I shall be glad of his help. However, it will not improve matters to make accusations about hiding things and trying to conceal the facts by a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman's first point was that we gave him no explanation of the Bill.  That is a fairly common occurrence.  For many Bills which we circulate, we do not give any explanation. It is only when a rather difficult Bill is circulated that an explanatory memorandum is sent out with it.  I do not think there is very much in this Bill that would need to be explained. <Col N="317" /> It is a perfectly straightforward Bill. In fact, it could be read by a person who has no great knowledge of the law and be understood.</P>
    <P>I gave the impression, I think, in my opening speech that this Bill was to cover cases where a grant of £250,000 or more would be given.  When Deputy Sweetman asked about it, I understood that was the intention but it may not be in the Bill.  As I explained in my Second Reading speech, where a large amount of money is being invested by a new company, we do not want to exceed a certain amount by way of grant.  Let us say a person invests £10 million.  We do not want to give half of that&mdash;£5 million&mdash;by way of grant.  Where the cost of the factory will be, say, £50,000 the grant might be £25,000; that would be normal. When it goes into millions, we thought we should try to meet it in another way.</P>
    <P>We thought of giving a loan on certain terms&mdash;equity capital, if the person would agree or, if not equity capital, then a loan at a favourable rate of interest where we would benefit if high profits were being paid by the company later on and where the company would be always free to pay us off and we would get our money back.  We thought that type of financing might be useful where a big amount of money was involved.  It is not likely, therefore, that it would ever be required for the smaller type of case where the grant would be less than £250,000.  I cannot visualise at the moment that it would ever be required for a case of that kind.  On the other hand, I do not know if the Bill should be amended to say that.  I do not see what object there is in putting into the Bill that we must use this Bill only for cases for £250,000: however, it can be considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also came back to one of his old <i>bêtes noirs</i>, the Verolme industry.  I have never heard Deputy Sweetman say a good word about the Verolme factory.  I think Deputy Sweetman kept me here two days because I wanted a guarantee for a loan when that factory was starting. Fine Gael fought it tooth and nail. We do not know why Fine Gael are <Col N="318" /> so much against it.  Verolme came here and started a good factory.  Almost a thousand people are employed.  Why we should not help him the same as any other industrialist coming into this country I do not know but Fine Gael think otherwise.  I do not know why they are so much against him.  Fine Gael now say that we are contemplating giving him big grants.  I have not seen any grant going to him yet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be grants going to him&mdash;I do not know.  I am not saying that I would refuse a grant if the negotiations should go that way. It must be remembered that Verolme was building his factory in four stages: there was a financial consideration at each stage up along.  I do not know whether he has reached the fourth stage and I do not know whether a grant would be payable.  If there is, why this Fine Gael hostility to Verolme?  Why should he not get a grant the same as anybody else? I do not know why there is such hostility to him by Fine Gael.  I suppose the only reason is that he started under Fianna Fáil and it was a fairly big industry and, therefore, Fine Gael must try to give the people the impression that he got very preferential treatment, better terms than anybody else who came along, and so on&mdash;in other words, that Fianna Fáil got him along.</P>

There were three propositions there.  It had to have a certain percentage of copper; it had to have a certain output every month and it had to get a certain price for copper. Never in its whole existence did it fulfil any of these three conditions or had it any chance to succeed.  However, we had to pay up.</P>

      <P>I should like to get more particulars about it.  Deputy Sweetman wants to know if I could give a list of the companies that will come under this Bill.  I cannot; I do not know what companies will come under it. I dealt with existing companies that are coming under it.  They are named in the Bill.  For the future, I do not know what companies may come in.  I gave the type of case that may come under this Bill but I am not aware of any pending application at the moment and therefore I do not know what may be done.  In any case, An Foras Tionscal publishes every year a list of grants given and there is no secrecy about it.  Any Deputy can look at the list and see what grants were given by An Foras Tionscal in that year and can also read the annual report of this new company when it is set up and will be able to see what they have been doing.  So there will be no secrecy about it, whatever Deputy Sweetman may say to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Potez, the other company, have discussed their arrangements for coming in here.  As I mentioned in my introduction, there will be a development company where Potez and the State will hold equal shares.  Potez will supply the designs, the prototypes and so on, which will largely make up his contribution to the development company and the manufacturing company will be owned by Potez.  For that, it gets a grant but it will be owned by Potez.  He gets the grant but until he pays off our share in the development <Col N="321" /> company, he pays no dividend to his shareholders.  That is not a bad arrangement as far as we are concerned.  I think that we could not be expected to do much better than that.</P>
    <P>The last suggestion that Deputy Sweetman made is a suggestion, indeed, that has given me a lot of thought, that is, that a committee of the House should be enabled to examine the returns of these State companies.  When I came into this office, I was very keen on that.  I read a number of memoranda on the subject.  The matter was considered also in the British House of Commons.  They made various attempts there to deal with this matter also.  I read of their recommendations and of their failures.  I cannot get a good recommendation on this matter because the point is that you either go too far or you do not go far enough. It is very difficult to get a scheme whereby a number of Deputies can examine the affairs of a company, without giving them at the same time the power of being maybe a bit too vexatious or of creating trouble for the company concerned.  I was trying to base it on the same system as applies in the case of shareholders at an annual meeting.  Shareholders at an annual meeting can ask questions.  I have had experience of being, as it were, on both sides of the table and I know that directors need not give their shareholders very much information, and they do not, but at any rate a shareholder can ask questions.  It must be remembered that a shareholder in a company wishes that company well and does not want to do it any harm.  He may want information.  There might be a danger, if we appointed a committee to examine a State company, that a Deputy might have a grievance against that State company and might not care very much whether he did it harm or not.  That is one of the troubles about it.  I should like very much to get some system that would be workable and at the same time, would not involve the danger of any harm being done.  I would welcome a scheme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish made a plea that the list of companies that might be helped by this new Taiscí Stáit Teoranta should be extended. What he had in mind, I think, was that existing companies that wanted money to carry on should be brought in.  I do not think they could be brought in because this company is not going to deal with the working capital of a company that is doing badly or taking them out of a bank overdraft difficulty, or anything like that.  It is designed to encourage the establishment of new manufacturing companies.  It could, of course, be applied to an existing company that is extending its business. Take an existing manufacturing company that wants to double its business. That is the type of thing that could come under this Bill, too, but not, I think, the type of case that Deputy Corish has in mind.</P>
      <P>The Deputy thought the Minister for Finance had not sufficient control.  He has, of course, because the Minister for Finance gives the direction to this new company to make the loan.  He does not initiate, it is true.  He does that when it is recommended to him by the Minister concerned&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce in many cases or perhaps the Minister for Transport and Power, who may be dealing with these companies that they have taken charge of.  If they recommend a loan from this new company and, of course, if the manufacturing company coming in is agreeable to the terms, then they will ask the Minister for Finance who, in most cases at any rate, will agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish also said that according to a recent report from the CIO, the Minister for Industry and Commerce now has power to direct an industry where to go.  I think he is not exactly correct in that.  The CIO, in their recommendations with regard to the establishment of industries, made one particular recommendation with regard to development centres.  That was a controversial sort of question. <Col N="323" /> Some think that all industries should be congregated rather close together rather than to have one industry in every little town in the country.  They favour this scheme.  They give very good reasons, I must admit, as to why they favour this scheme but the Government did not adopt it and therefore, so far as that is concerned, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in the same position as he has always been; in other words, it is for the person starting an industry to decide where he wants to establish it.</P>
    <P>I could not say, in answer to Deputy Corish's last question, whether our financial incentives here are more favourable than those given in other countries.  It is impossible to make a comparison.  There are incentives here by way of grants, favourable loan terms, income tax exemption for exports, provisions in regard to wear and tear, and so on.  There are so many and various incentives to people to start industries that it would be impossible to compare those given here with those given in other countries because we might be better in one respect and might not be so good in another.  All I can say is that on the whole our incentives are as good as those in other countries.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of this Bill are to extend the existing statutory powers of Córas Iompair Éireann in relation to (i) the construction of railways; (ii) temporary borrowings; (iii) long-term borrowing for capital purposes; (iv) the abandonment of railway lines; (v) the payment of redundancy compensation and also to provide sundry statutory safeguards for members of CIE staff transferred to the new Hotels Subsidiary Company known as Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity to extend CIE's <Col N="324" /> statutory powers in relation to the construction of railways arises from the fact that the Board proposes to extend the railway line at Wicklow so as to provide a rail connection to the factory of Shamrock Fertilisers Ltd., Wicklow.  At present traffic between the factory and the railway station has to be hauled by road and the proposed rail extension would allow of traffic from the factory being loaded directly on to railway wagons.  The present arrangement involves double handling of fertilisers consigned for onward delivery by rail from Wicklow with a resultant increase in costs.</P>
    <P>The extension is a relatively small job involving only about 700 yards of new line at a cost estimated not to exceed £8,000.  The extension line will, however, run partly over the public roadway and partly through private property.  It would seem at first sight that CIE could be given the necessary powers to construct this railway extension by the making of an Order for the purpose by me under Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950.  I have, however, been advised by the Attorney General that in the laying-down of new lines other than lines on its own property or on another person's property with that person's consent the Board might successfully be restrained if some part of the construction works, for example, the breaking-up of the public roadway, where held to be in conflict with Statute or Common Law.</P>
    <P>Since the proposed railway would run for some hundreds of yards through the town of Wicklow along a route adjacent to the sea front, it will be necessary having regard to the Attorney General's advice in the matter to extend the existing statutory powers of CIE in relation to the construction of railways.  This I propose to do in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed statutory powers are in Sections 2 to 10 of the Bill.  There is nothing novel in these proposed powers; they are, with a few minor exceptions, identical with the corresponding powers conferred on Bord na Móna by the Turf Development Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>As CIE has already constructed minor railways under powers conferred <Col N="325" /> by two separate ministerial Orders made under Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, it is proposed for the avoidance of doubt to provide as at Section 11 of the Bill that the two Orders which are specified in that section shall be treated as if they had been made under this Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>CIE are empowered under Section 28 of the Transport Act, 1950, (as amended) to borrow temporarily from their bankers for general financing purposes.  They may borrow at their own discretion up to £½ million and to the extent that these borrowings exceed £½ million my prior approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is required.  The Minister for Finance is empowered to guarantee these borrowings to the extent of £1½ million.  CIE normally exercise these powers to secure short-term accommodation during periods when revenue drops seasonally.  There has, however, been a rather serious deterioration in the Board's revenue position during the past financial year and it is clear that the Board will be obliged to have recourse to temporary borrowings to a greater extent and for a longer period than in preceding years.  It is proposed accordingly to take powers in the present Bill to enable the Exchequer, in the person of the Minister for Finance, to lend direct to CIE within the existing £2 million statutory limit of such borrowing by CIE.  As a complementary measure, the Bill proposes to empower CIE to borrow temporarily from sources other than bankers.  I think that the House will wish to have some explanation as to the reasons for deterioration in CIE's revenue position.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in the period following the enactment of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE made substantial progress towards achieving the objectives of that legislation.  The Board's operating losses, which amounted to £1,950,000 in 1958/59, fell to £709,000 in 1959/60 and to £246,000 in 1960/ 61.  This progress suffered a sharp setback during the year ended 31st March, 1962, due mainly to the eighth round of wage and salary increases <Col N="326" /> and associated improvements in conditions of employment, which in that year together amounted to an increase of £1,024,000 in the Board's wage and salary bill.  In a full year the cost to the Board of these increases amounts to £2.35 million.  Other factors also contributed to worsen the Board's financial position; these included heavy additional maintenance costs of a periodic nature, increased depreciation charges, and the cost of additional road staff recruited to handle increased business.  To these factors there was added a continuing decline in railway business and the fact that the increased rates and charges only came into operation in the last few months of the year.  There were on the other hand offsets resulting from increased road freight and passenger business and from economies introduced.  The net result, however, was that the Board's operating loss for the year 1961/62 rose to £1,696,000 as against £246,000 in the preceding year.  During the financial year ended on the 31st March last, the course of events I have outlined continued without significant change and the operating loss is, I understand, even greater than for the preceding year.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the position now is that the Board seems to be without prospect of overtaking the effects of the eighth round.  It now appears clear that the increased fares, rates and charges which the Board introduced to counter the effects of the eighth round cannot be expected to bring in more than £1.13 million in a full year. The cost of the eighth round has worked out at £2.35 million a year and there is, therefore, a gap of £1.22 million. This corresponds roughly with the Board's forecast deficit on operating account in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>A reasonable comment on this situation is that if the eighth round increase for CIE, including the cost of associated improvements in employment conditions, had been at the National level of 12 per cent, as recorded in September, 1962, instead of the actual increase of 20 per cent, then the deficit for 1962/63 would, on the provisional results, have been reduced by about £900,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> CIE is empowered under Section 28 of the Transport Act, 1950, as amended, to raise funds by stock issues to meet its capital requirements.  The Act sets a limit of £12 million to the amount which may be so raised and this limit was reached by the last stock issue for £2 million, which took place in May, 1962.</P>
    <P>The Board has estimated that its expenditure on capital account including renewals, replacements and additions in the two years ending 31st March, 1964, will amount to £6.13 million.  Initially the programme amounted to £9.7 million but, having regard to the desirability of curtailing the rate of new capital expenditure the Board, at my request, revised the programme so as to defer until after 31st March, 1964, part of the planned capital expenditure.  The deferred expenditure covers a reduction in the number of new diesel locomotives and deferments in planned expenditure on reorganisation of stations and workshops including provision of new buildings.  These deferments, together with an arrangement for obtaining the 37 new diesel locomotives purchased in 1962 on an extended credit instead of a cash basis, have made it possible to reduce total capital expenditure for the two years 1962/63 and 1963/64 to £6.13 million.  This revised estimate represents maximum practicable deferments of capital projects and takes account of planned rail and station closures.  Included in this programme are such essential items as payment of the instalments totalling £883,590 on the new diesel locomotives, the construction of new railway coaches of an advanced design, the continuation of the railway wagon construction project, the cost of new and more up-to-date buses for the Board's touring services and the provision of additional road freight vehicles including vehicles required to replace branch line services which have been closed down.</P>
    <P>Of the total estimated capital expenditure of £6.13 million, a sum of £3.261 million will be provided by the Board's depreciation provisions leaving £2.869 million to be financed from new capital funds.  The Board must <Col N="328" /> also, at this stage, take account of capital requirements arising in the earlier part of the financial year 1964/65, which amount to £734,000, approximately.  In addition, provision must be made for contingencies and for the expenses of stock issues, together estimated at £250,000.</P>
    <P>The estimated total capital requirements for which provision must be made is, therefore, £3.853 million.  The capital funds remaining available to the Board since the last stock issue of £2 million in May, 1962, will not suffice to meet this essential expenditure. It will, therefore, be necessary to empower the Board to raise further capital funds and it is accordingly proposed in the present Bill to increase the existing limit of £12 million, to which I have referred, by £3 million to £15 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure the House that the capital expenditure proposed by the Board in the two years I have mentioned, 1962/63 and 1963/64, would all be necessary even if a firm decision were taken to reduce the mileage of the CIE railway system to that envisaged in the Beddy Committee Report.  The present mileage is 1,459 miles compared with 2,168 miles in October, 1958, and the 850 miles envisaged in the Beddy Report, to which must be added 63 miles of the former GNR line from Dublin to Belfast.  Much of the proposed expenditure is, in fact, being incurred on equipment for road passenger and road freight services, both of which activities give a satisfactory return on the capital invested in them as may be seen from the Board's accounts.</P>
    <P>The entire operation of CIE in all its sections and departments is being steadily reorganised.  Very detailed information has already been given on this inevitably lengthy process of modernisation.</P>
    <P>The whole question of future transport policy, with particular reference to the position of CIE after 31st March, 1964, is at present under review.  CIE itself has embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the operation of the whole undertaking with a view to providing a fully documented factual basis for the formulation by <Col N="329" /> the Government of new policies on the future of the railways, for the purpose of new long-term transport legislation which will be necessary after 31st March, 1964.  That legislation must take account of, among other things, the long-term capital requirements of CIE.</P>
    <P>I myself have spoken in very great detail on this problem and have made it clear that in the long term the taxpayer will not be asked to pay subsidies in order to maintain any type of public transport if another less costly and more efficient type, either publicly or privately owned, can be provided.  I have also analysed the position in regard to the additional cost of maintaining roads where branch lines have been closed and have made it clear that there is a considerable net saving to the collective body of taxpayers and ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Criticism of this policy, I am glad to say, has come largely from a minority of public representatives and the overwhelming defeat in this House of the Private Members Bill, whose object was to relieve CIE of the obligation to pay its way, was significant. Deputies have been fully briefed in this matter over the last four years and I do not need, at this stage, to say any more on this subject.</P>
    <P>In December, 1961, a subsidiary company, Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., was incorporated to acquire the Board's hotels and to administer its catering services.  In order to facilitate consultations between CIE and the trade unions on matters arising out of the establishment of the proposed subsidiary, I undertook at the time to introduce certain measures relating to redundancy compensation and pension rights.  Provision is now being made in this Bill whereby staff transferred by CIE to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo. will retain their existing rights as CIE employees to redundancy compensation under transport legislation as though they were still in the employment of CIE.  Provision is also being made whereby staff transferred to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., who are already members of CIE superannuation schemes, may continue in membership of such schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> The Memorandum and Articles of Association of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teo. provide for a degree of official control of the company comparable with that exercised over CIE under the Transport Acts.  Provision is made in this Bill for certain additional controls complementary to those in the company's Memorandum and Articles.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that it would be desirable to provide for two minor amendments in the law relating to the abandonment of railway lines.  The existing legislation does not permit of the abandonment by CIE of a railway line on which all train services had been terminated prior to the transfer of the railway line, for example, from the GNR to CIE.  Secondly, the existing legislation does not permit of the disposal of tenanted premises on abandoned lines to the tenants thereof by private treaty.  These matters are covered in the Bill now before you.</P>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1958, and the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, provide for payment by CIE of compensation to employees whose services are dispensed with within five years of the passing of the Acts, that is up to and including 15th July, 1963, and the recoupment of the cost to CIE by the Exchequer.  Section 19 of the present Bill proposes to extend this provision up to 31st March, 1964.  The extension has been found to be necessary because the schemes of reorganisation which CIE are introducing under the Transport Act, 1958, will not be fully completed until some time between 15th July, 1963, and 31st March, 1964.  It is, therefore, necessary to safeguard the position of staff who may become redundant between the two dates I have mentioned and for that purpose the Bill proposes to extend the provisions for redundancy compensation from the present termination date, which is 15th July, 1963, to 31st March, 1964, which is the date of expiry of the reorganisation period envisaged in the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>I think that, at this stage, I should give you some figures of the number of CIE employees declared redundant by the Board since 1st October, 1958. Up to 31st March, 1963, a total of <Col N="331" /> 1,247 CIE employees had been retired with compensation and some 50 other employees are expected to be retired with compensation between 1st April, 1963, and 15th July, 1963.  The ultimate cost to the Exchequer of recouping the compensation involved is estimated to amount to £4 million.</P>
    <P>CIE estimate that a further 300 employees will be retired on redundancy during the period 16th July, 1963, to 31st March, 1964, and that the ultimate cost to the Exchequer of the compensation payable in relation thereto will amount to £900,000, making a total of £4.9 million to be borne by the Exchequer in respect of redundancy compensation.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is now being taken to deal, also, with two small defects in the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958.  It was the intention that ex-GNR employees transferred or seconded to CIE as a result of the transfer to CIE of that part of the GNR undertaking in the State would have the same rights to redundancy compensation as CIE employees.  I have been advised, however, that while the provision of Section 17 (1) (c) of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, cover redundancy arising from such causes as the reduction of rail services or the substitution of diesel for steam traction, the subsection does not extend to redundancy arising under reorganisation schemes covered by Orders made by me under Section 14 (6) of the Transport Act, 1958.  It is accordingly proposed to remedy this defect by amending subsection 17 (1) (c) of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958 so as to bring its provisions into line with those of Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1958, in accordance with the original intention.</P>
    <P>A further drafting amendment to Section 17 of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, has also been found to be necessary.  Subsection (3) of that section deals with, <i>inter alia</i>, the grant by CIE for the purpose of determining entitlement to redundancy compensation, of an increase in pensionable service of a person taken into the employment of the Board at a late age. <Col N="332" /> It now appears, however, that the application of this provision does not extend to employees who become redundant under the provisions of Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1958. As it was not the intention that this provision should be so restricted it is proposed to take the opportunity of extending it to cater for redundancy arising under the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Finally I come to Section 21 of the Bill.  This section is designed to remedy defects in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Second Schedule to the Transport Act, 1958.  Paragraph 5 of the said Second Schedule deals with the abatement of redundancy compensation where the recipient is employed by a State-sponsored company or a local authority. That paragraph as at present drafted does not embrace subsidiary companies of such companies or bodies; neither does it embrace Industrial Engineering Co. Ltd., the holding company for the Dundalk group of companies.  These defects are now being remedied in so far as future redundancies are concerned. Paragraph 6 of the said Second Schedule, on the other hand, refers to the abatement of redundancy compensation by the amount of any pension the redundant employee may be in receipt of from a CIE pension scheme; the amendment at paragraph 6 provided for at Section 21 of the Bill brings pension schemes to which Ostlanna Iompair Éireann contribute within the scope of this abatement provision.  This provision is necessary in order to equate the position of employees transferred to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann with that of CIE employees in the matter of abatement of redundancy compensation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has my sympathy in having to stand up and admit to the House on this Transport Bill that the position in relation to transport is hopeless, that he cannot solve it and that he does not know where it is to end.  A funeral oration for all the railawy lines in Ireland would be an inadequate description of the speech we have just heard.  It was rather interesting, as one listened, to <Col N="333" /> compare the speech he made now with the thundering, bragging bravado of the present Taoiseach when he introduced the Transport Bill in 1944 and again in 1958.</P>
      <P>When he came to the House in 1944, he said he had produced a scheme to reorganise the transport company as a result of which he and the Government and the people as a whole could look forward to a transport system that would operate successfully for 50 years at least.  In that bragging spirit of bravado, the Government succeeded in putting it across to the country that they really had something, that they really had a plan and a system. Fourteen years went by and the Taoiseach came back to the House in 1958 and again he said there was to be a rejuvenated railway, a new system of transport that would solve all our problems.  Nobody need ever again worry about transport because of the great plan he, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had thought up and brought to the House as the Transport Act of 1958.  There is this much to be said for it&mdash;it has lasted half as long as the one before it.  I feel sorry for the Minister now who had to show himself so completely beaten as to admit he could see no solution to the problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently he realised he was making a funeral oration.  He began by saying, of course, that it was a Bill for the purpose of the reconstruction of railways, building a new railway line, but I notice that he did not give us any undertaking that he would not close down that railway line.  We have all become accustomed to the Minister coming here saying that his main function in relation to transport has been to close down railway lines.  He succeeded pretty well in that.  However, we have this provision now and if it does ease an administrative problem and make for more efficient operation we are prepared to accept that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Minister says it is proposed to provide under Section 11 <Col N="334" /> that certain orders that have been made may be validated.  I should like a clear, unequivocal assurance from the Minister to go on the records of the House that all the compensation that there could possibly be, for claims under those orders, has already been met and that the validation included retrospectively in Section 11 cannot in any way injuriously affect any citizen who might otherwise have a claim.  If that assurance is given in no uncertain terms, possibly the approach might be accepted to that aspect of the Bill although frankly it is not an approach &mdash;and, to be fair to the Minister, I think he also feels this&mdash;which we should normally take.</P>
    <P>What impressed me most about the Bill is that, in relation to the second phase that is responsible for the interruption of this legislation, the Minister in dealing with temporary borrowings proceeded to give some indication of the situation as he saw it, or if I may say so, as he failed to see it.  He has been far more specific in this House than in the Seanad.  He said here categorically that he cannot see any prospect of CIE overtaking the effects of the events of 1962.  Having said that, he has not offered any solution or any indication of the direction in which a solution lies.  I do not know if he wishes the House to take from that lack of suggestion or direction that he is going even further forward on the policy of closing lines and uprooting railways built at great expense throughout the years and doing so at a time when there is no real, planned alternative proposed.</P>
    <P>I could understand an approach in regard to a railway which was not being satisfactorily utilised if before that approach was made there was a planned and co-ordinated scheme as to how the track could be otherwise used. For example, I have seen no suggestion by the Minister or by CIE of any attempt to develop, as has been developed in other countries, the idea of providing a bus that could operate alternatively on railway or on road. Other countries with a density of population as low as ours&mdash;of course, we know why the density is so low&mdash; have found it possible to combine, by a system of what I might call rail cars, <Col N="335" /> safety in transport along a fixed rail with the ease of point development provided by road transport.  No serious attempt has been made by the Government or CIE to assess the possibility of that here.  Certainly, any study that has been made in relation to it has been hidden in the secret archives of the Minister's Department, more guarded than many of the documents about which his colleague, the Minister for Justice, waxed so eloquent not so long ago on the Official Secrets Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be loath to say to the Minister I did not accept his word.  I would not say so.  But I would suggest to him that, if he wants people to accept the examination of something, it is desirable to give the House some information about it.  As far as I can recollect, no information was given in last year's Estimate.  No indication is given in this Bill now before us that any such examination was operative in relation to transport policy.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's approach to this Bill.  As I understand it, he wants to provide by the Bill that CIE can have extended powers of temporary borrowing.  One could understand that if the effect of it was to be that he could see some point ahead at which those temporary borrowings could be repaid.  But, far from seeing any prospect of that in the time ahead, the Minister has come down and admitted &mdash; I must congratulate him on being truthful enough to say so&mdash;that the situation is hopeless and he can see no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me inquire the purpose of a Minister for Transport and Power in relation to transport.  Is it not to find some method of co-ordinating transport policy suited to our country? This Minister comes in here and frankly admits that, while he is extending the powers of temporary borrowing, the Board is without prospect of overtaking the effects of 1962.  What is the use of having temporary borrowings if there is no prospect whatever <Col N="336" /> of being able to repay them? What is the use of calling them temporary? Is it not a fact that what the Minister wants in those circumstances must be either permanent borrowing or a proper development scheme to arrive at a conclusion in which he will not have to get up and admit he can see no prospects for the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought we could have got some indication from the Minister of what policy the Government have in this respect.  Is it the policy of closing all railway lines all over the country?  If that is the policy, why does he not say it?  If he has another policy to provide a proper transport system, why does he not say it?  If he has no policy&mdash;and I suspect he has no policy, other than trying to cover up the fact he has no policy&mdash;it would be wiser for him, for his own reputation and for the country as a whole, to go and to make way for someone who will provide a policy in relation to this aspect. We have to have one or else we are going to fail completely to make the country a viable economic unit.  A transport policy is a <i>sine qua non</i> of the achieving of that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  The Deputy only had the opportunity to read the statement.  In order to have an intelligent debate in the House, I should point out to the Deputy that the raising of the capital expenditure by CIE implies, whatever the final new policy will be, that the main arterial railway system of the country will be maintained.  I thought I should tell the Deputy that just in case he might not have had the opportunity of comprehending that part of the speech.  It is important for a constructive debate that he should realise that.  That is one phase of policy quite evident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great difference.  The Minister did not say in the Seanad: &ldquo;I regret to say that the position now is that the Board seems to be without prospect&rdquo;.  He gave certain figures, but he did not admit in the Seanad the complete hopelessness of the situation.  What I want to get at is&mdash;and not even the most friendly interruption by the Minister will prevent me trying to get at it&mdash;what is the new policy in that hopeless situation he now envisages. What has happened between now and the debate on 24th April, when he gave statistics but certainly did not come down as flatly as he has come down now?</P>
      <P>Let us suppose for the sake of example that the new transport policy, which the Minister says will be operated as a result of this examination, leaves the main lines.  What main lines? Are we not entitled to some indication as to how many more closures are to be announced by CIE acting for and on behalf of the Minister?  I have some sympathy with the Minister. Clearly, he is going to go down in history and be remembered as Childers, the man who denuded the country of railways.  He will clearly go down and be remembered as Childers, the man who denuded even the county he represents, Monaghan, of its railways.</P>

      <P>When I read the Seanad debate, I did not think he had any solution at all.  I certainly think so now, as I did when I was listening to him.  Here he comes in and asks for temporary borrowing.  If he sees no prospect, what is the point of temporary borrowing?  Would it not be better to accept the thing on a whole-time basis, if there is any necessity for it at all?  The whole point of temporary borrowing is that there is a foreseeable prospect of paying back. Neither today nor on 24th April last was that made clear by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the company's hotel subsidiary.  Do I understand that what he is anxious to provide in relation thereto is the equivalent of the deeds of adherence where a subsidiary company operates through an insurance company pension scheme?  If so, then I have no objection to the proposal.  I should like to ask him one question in relation to the hotel subsidiary. Did CIE apply to the Minister and get specific and express authority before the subsidiary company was set up?  I think they should have.  It is entirely undesirable that State sponsored bodies should set up subsidiary companies without clear and express consent from the responsible Minister.  The reason why I ask for that assurance in no uncertain terms is that when I was in office some little time I found that one State-owned company had set up a subsidiary without having asked the corporate Minister for Finance for permission, so that, in fact, what was being done was that the subsidiary was not being subjected to the light of examination in the Department.  I think the Minister will agree that such a development would be entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  I can agree at once that the sectionalising of certain aspects of the affairs of any company by means of a subsidiary company is desirable but when it is done it should be subject to examination and analysis in exactly the same way as are the affairs of the parent company.  I notice that the Minister, in pursuance of his desire to be known by the name under which he will go down in history, could not bring in a Transport Bill at all without having in it some arrangements through which he can more easily abandon railway lines.</P>
      <P>The redundancy provisions made show fairly large payments, just under £5 million.  The whole question of redundancy and of labour relations in CIE seems to have gone very much amiss somewhere.  I want to say at once that I do not know enough about what occurred or the reasons for what occurred to be able to offer any constructive criticism or help in relation to them.  I welcome any effort that may be made now to improve these labour relations, even though I think the effort is somewhat belated.  I do not know whose fault it was, but it is an undoubted fact that persons whose lives were to be affected did not get adequate explanation of what was intended, or, perhaps, it was the fault of those people that they did not listen to the explanation if it were given.  I do not know whether it is of any advantage to pursue it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, an undoubted fact that unless there is to be a modern approach to management and labour relations in all aspects of State-sponsored industries as well as private enterprise, and in particular in relation to transport which affects the welfare, the convenience and the comfort of the community to such an overwhelming degree, we will not have a proper approach to the policy and the problems of the future.  There has been an announcement that there will be some new approach in the future.  I do not want to say anything that may in any way harm or injure it, or make anyone wonder why it is being done now, except to say that it is devoutly to be <Col N="340" /> hoped that whoever was responsible for the lack of proper relations in the past will appreciate, for their own sake as well as for the sake of the community, that it is desirable that that lack of proper relations should end, and that we should see an era of understanding by labour of the problems of management, by management of the problems of labour, and by both of the problems and convenience of the consumer. Unless we get that in the future, I am afraid there is no use in putting down plans on paper and working out statistics and schemes.  Unless the human factor is brought into the whole picture, in a way in which it has not been brought in in the past, no matter what policy is adopted, transport will never be a success.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was being introduced, many of us felt the Government would take the opportunity of seeking to extend the time limit within which CIE were to get an opportunity to pay their way beyond 31st March next.  In fact, we were shocked when we found the opportunity given by this Bill was not availed of.  In a reply to a question a few weeks ago, we were told that when the expiring date of 31st March had passed, the Minister would bring in a Bill to decide what would be done after that date.  It is repeated in the Minister's statement that after 31st March new arrangements will be made.  It is rather a pity the Minister did not take this opportunity to remedy that very bad situation. From my reading of his speech, it appears as if the Minister is saying that eventually we will retain the main lines.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A reasonable comment on this situation. . . &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that they almost paid their way in 1961-62.  He said: &ldquo; . . . the Board's operating loss for the year 1961-62 rose to £1,696,000 as against £246,000 in the preceding year.&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister can claim that I am misrepresenting him when I say that he gave as his reason for that:</P>
      <P>This progress suffered a sharp setback during the year ended 31st March, 1962, due mainly to the eighth round of wage and salary increases and associated improvements in conditions of employment. . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I misrepresenting the Minister when I say he is blaming the workers for the position which CIE are in, and that if they had continued to work for the few pounds a week they got in the early days, CIE would be able to pay their way?  The Minister wants to have it both ways.  He wants to claim to be a good employer, and to say that the workers were ruining that employment because they looked for the eighth round of wage increases.  He also suggests that there is no possibility of the ninth round of wage increases which he and his colleagues have already set in motion with their 2½ per cent turnover tax.  We get too much of this from the Government front benches.  The workers are to be blamed for everything that happens. <Col N="342" /> The Minister seems to think that, provided the Government are allowed to deal with a certain group of workers on the question of compensation, other workers down the country who, even though they may be members of trade unions may not have the industrial strength to force their views on CIE and the Minister, can be left out.</P>
    <P>There were a very big number of linesmen working for a very small wage throughout the country.  Some of them had something like £7 a week. They lived with their families in frugal comfort.  In some cases a member of the family or a wife was able to earn a few shillings to help out.  They had a small house with a small garden. CIE did not dismiss those men.  They offered them jobs at the other end of the country, and because they would not take them&mdash;they could not take them&mdash;they were dismissed.  They got their cards and were told: &ldquo;We are very sorry; you will have to go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill which includes redundancy compensation for those people.  Possibly they do not count; possibly the ordinary labourer does not count.  If they were a big group of craftsmen in a workshop, they could threaten to take industrial action together and have their grievance remedied, and I have no doubt they would be considered and would get redundancy compensation. Because these people have not that power, the Minister can tell Deputies, as he told me, that it is a matter for the trade unions, that they are entitled to this, that and the other, knowing darn well that there is no hope of having matters straightened out because the people concerned cannot bring the necessary industrial strength to bear on CIE.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Government would forget about the eighth round of wage increases because that was quite some time ago.  They will probably have a ninth round to talk about before long.  When the Minister talks about increases and losses, does he realise that the sales tax will further disimprove the conditions of CIE workers?  He says that tax will not be collected on fares, but it will be collected on the cost of petrol, diesel <Col N="343" /> oil, spare parts and replacements.  If that does not put up fares, I wonder how it will be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Criticism of this policy, I am glad to say, has come largely from a minority of public representatives. . .</P>
    <P>Does he realise that the people throughout the country often wonder at the different treatment meted out to CIE and the other forms of transport which the Minister so often boosts. There is no question of CIE being allowed a respite by having interest-free loans for the replacement of equipment.  They must pay and be shown to be in the red.  Other more favourable forms of transport, which do not affect the ordinary people, can have interest-free loans and can show a profit, even though they are not paying interest on the repayment of the loans.  The Minister need not look surprised.  He said the other day that the air companies were not paying interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison in that CIE is being used by the ordinary people and, at £400,000 a year, the others will not be long reaching the £16 million and they do not deal with the ordinary people. Apart from the fact that the closing of railway lines means a loss of employment it also means grave hardship for a number of people.  It is quite true for the Minister and others connected with CIE to say that in certain districts the lines were not being used as much as they should have been and that passenger trains particularly were going along almost empty, but I suggest that there were some occasions on practically every line when there was a big rush to use the trains.  I also suggest that there was an indecent haste <Col N="344" /> to rip up the lines where they had been closed.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the most recent crop of announcements about closures. I see that some people in the west of Ireland have been complaining about the fact that lines that are now being closed pass through stations which were painted and decorated very recently.  Perhaps the Minister has a good reason for doing that but it seems extraordinary if the decision had been made to close the lines that this should have been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the provision in the Bill to sell houses to the tenants who have been living in them.  That is an improvement and I am very glad that that step has been taken.</P>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister taken into account the damage being done to roads as a result of the change-over from rail to road traffic.  I do not know whether eventually there will be a reckoning between the local authorities and CIE over the misuse of the roads by very heavy vehicular traffic because of the change-over.  I know in my constituency, where only a very small number of railway lines have been closed, the roads are being seriously damaged not alone by CIE transport but by private transport which has to use the roads because there is no other way of transporting their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister when he said that Ostlanna Iompair Éireann would have the same relation to the Department as CIE has, meant that we will have reached the stage that if a question is asked in the House about its running, he will say he has no function in the matter?  I feel the Minister should be able to take greater powers to deal with these matters.  Earlier today, a few of us were taken to task by the Minister for Industry and Commerce because we suggested that when a labour dispute occurred in CIE, it was not the Minister for Transport and Power who intervened but the Minister for <Col N="345" /> Industry and Commerce.  I paid tribute to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the excellent effort he was making but despite the fact that he made an excuse as to why it was he who carried out the mediation, I still feel, as do very many other people, that the person who should have taken the first move in the matter was the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to labour relations and said that he hoped that relations would be better.  I should like to finish on this note: the sooner the State and semi-State companies realise that, if a dispute occurs and that dispute must ultimately be settled, it is far better to settle it around the table before a strike takes place and before the men have been walking on picket lines for weeks, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker should realise that 1964 is not a year in which something remarkable is going to happen.  If Deputy Tully thinks the Minister waited until then to give the railway company an opportunity of going out of the red into the black, he does not see very clearly what is happening.  CIE will not pay their way in 1964 or after 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said they would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not believe it, if he said it.  I think this is a sad Bill because it hints at the end.  It is remarkable in that it provides for the laying down of a railway line in County Wicklow.  That is a change from the activities we have known for the past four or five years. It would be appropriate if the Minister, with the Chairman of CIE, had a plaque erected on the spot on that occasion.  The year 1964 is receding into the future like a pair of railway lines running to the horizon across the countryside.  It is no use blaming rounds of wage increases for it because most people could have foreseen the rounds of wage increases which the Minister blames for the debâcle.  Most <Col N="346" /> people can see that we are not at the end of wage demands.</P>
      <P>The pity about the whole thing is that on the main lines&mdash;the only lines I have experience of&mdash;the service is excellent.  Normally the present Chairman, Dr. Andrews, would get results by the methods he is using but this is not a normal kind of public service, not alone in Ireland but in any country in the world.  Dr. Andrews and the Minister are unfortunate in that they have to preside over an organisation which is declining.  I do not think it is even possible to save the situation now on a commercial basis.  If the Minister ever looks into the future, as Ministers must, and as even back-benchers like myself must, he must ask himself what will be there in 25 years' time?  Will there be railway coaches running on iron lines anywhere in this country?  Is there any evidence that any policy we adopt will give this rail service a continuing lease of life?</P>
      <P>We might as well face the facts. Run on a commercial basis, this railway system must fold up inside a quarter of a century.  Can we possibly justify the pretence that we are now just in a rough spot, an uneven spot? The Minister has almost said the writing is on the wall.</P>
      <P>I think a new decision is needed.  I shall not canvass either point of view but there are two steps which we must take.  First, we must consider the railway as a commercial proposition in the light of the population of this country. On that basis, the railway is out.  But, if the railway is needed for national or social purposes, we should face that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could help the railway.  We are completely illogical about it.  We are allowing our roads to be used by very heavy goods traffic.  We should not permit that, if we are serious about maintaining the railway as a commercial proposition.  In Italy, a few years ago, I was shown the heavy trailers, two- and three-vehicle trailers, such as we see on our roads, which were give a five-year period in which to get off the roads.  If we were serious, we should do that.  We should not allow heavy goods to be carried on <Col N="347" /> our roads.  If we were serious and did that, the taxpayer would not be asked to subsidise to the extent he is being asked to subsidise now.</P>
    <P>The problem is not unique, of course.  In every country in Europe this matter is a headache.  I think the Dutch are the only people who run railways at a profit; I am not even sure that that is the usual pattern there.  I was in the United States a fortnight ago and I found that most of the railways on the eastern seaboard there are in Queer Street, too.  Therefore, this problem is not a sign that anything is wrong with us but we have the added difficulty of the very light density of our population.</P>
    <P>If we do not look at the matter in a light other than that with which we have been fooling ourselves in this House for the past 15 or 20 years, then what is happening here tonight spells the death sentence of CIE and the Minister is in the unpleasant position of Lord High Executioner.</P>
    <P>The railway could be saved, if, for instance, the Government were serious in their declamation that they are about to move somewhat to the left. In such a context, they could justify the preservation of the railway as a social and national need.  That would be the only justice in borrowing money. To borrow money on the basis that this is a commercial proposition is almost immoral because we all know it is not.</P>
    <P>What happens the materials that are available for sale when these lines are torn up?  Where does the money go? On what page of the balance sheet do they figure?  We shall not do service to the country, to CIE, to those who work in CIE or to ourselves if we do not face the truth about this.  Unless we try to preserve the railway as a social and national service, we are just being cowardly in not acknowledging the truth that there is no possibility of making CIE a paying, going concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said, this problem must be faced.  What Deputy Barry has said must be accepted by the Minister and the Government&mdash;that the railway system must be regarded as a social <Col N="348" /> service and not as a commercial enterprise. But whether it is or is not, the railway system should not be torn up. That is simply work of waste and ruin.</P>
      <P>We are in a changing world.  We may not always have peaceful conditions.  War conditions could arise again.  What sort of transport would we have if we were confined to petrol and oil?  Bad and all as the railway may be, it can be utilised for the transport of much of our raw material.  It might not be as fast, perhaps, as we would desire but it is a safeguard.  It is very bad business for CIE to tear up the line, when they decide to close it.  It means burning our boats and leaving no reserve whatever.</P>
      <P>On the question of borrowing, the Minister should have stated the position positively about the capital that CIE now seek.  There is no use in polishing or painting it with the adjective &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; because he is quite clear that he does not see any prospect of CIE ever being able to overtake the eighth round of wages. No matter how the Minister may try to cover his words now, the implication in his speech is that the whole cause of the troubles of CIE can be laid at the feet of the workers because they claimed the eighth round increase&mdash; although that eighth round was itself brought about by Government action, the removal of food subsidies and so on.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Tully has very properly pointed out, the proposed sales tax will bring about a further demand. What then?  Does it not mean, then, that CIE and the Government must regard the railway service as a social service?  When the Minister says that only certain representatives condemn the present policy, surely he cannot say that in respect of the deputation he received recently from the west of Ireland?  It is an important matter there.  The Government, even if it means bringing in certain legislation to declare it a special line, should keep it open.  It serves a very large number of people who find it difficult to travel otherwise than by rail.  To blame the workers is a shield put up by the Minister but a very weak one and does him no credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> With Deputy Tully, I am glad that where lines are being closed, the houses in which the workers live can be sold to them.  I would ask the Minister for an assurance that every effort will be made to give alternative employment as near as possible to the workers' existing homes.  It is no use to offer employment in Cahirciveen to a man from Dromod, who has lived there with his family all his life, and then to declare him redundant because he refuses the employment.  The Minister and CIE should be very careful in that matter.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments appear to be fairly generous but I have received complaints from employees that generous payments were made in some cases and niggardly payments in others.  I do not know why that should arise because I believed and was given to understand that there was a general rule and principle applied.  There are complaints that people have been declared redundant and got compensation and were able immediately to engage in other types of activity whereas people who were not so well able to do that did not get a similar offer but were retained in employment and then paid off when they were offered a transfer which they could not accept.  I do not know what truth there is in that suggestion but I should like an assurance from the Minister and from CIE that every effort will be made to give generous treatment and equal treatment in cases of redundancy.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that after all the efforts made to build up the railway system and to maintain it, and all the money that has been spent on it, all that should be of no avail.  The maintenance of the railway system has been a costly business over a great number of years.  It appears now that we are going to have short railway lines called main lines.  If there were only one mile of railway line, one could save all the money and it could be suggested in theory that the railways were being maintained.  The railway should be regarded as a social service and should be a guaranteed form of transport so that in the event of an outbreak of war it would provide an alternative <Col N="350" /> transport system when lorries and motor cars would be off the road.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the canals which, strictly speaking, do not come within this Bill.  With the permission of the Chair, I should like to suggest that the canals should be kept open.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I suggest that CIE should go very slowly in the matter of lifting the railway lines and ensure that there will be available a transport system should a situation arise in which there is not a sufficient supply of fuel oils for road transport.  That is a very important matter which the Government should examine very carefully before taking the final step of destroying the railway system.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill was in a rather more reasonable spirit than I have known in time past, for which I am very thankful.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say, in reply to Deputy Sweetman, that the reorganisation scheme for CIE embodied in the Transport Act, 1958, was based on the recommendations of the Beddy Committee on Internal Transport.  That Committee undertook a most comprehensive review of all aspects of public transport and it is quite evident that the conclusions at which they arrived proved to be very accurate indeed.  The 1958 Act, for which the Government took responsibility, was based largely on the conclusions in the Report of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that we sometimes seem to get confused between the reorganisation that it is essential for CIE to undertake and the question as to whether or not under any Act CIE is compelled to pay its way.  I want to make it absolutely clear that even if that clause in the Act had not embodied a great deal of reorganisation in CIE, the elimination of uneconomic railway lines would have been part of the normal process <Col N="351" /> of reorganisation.  Many people seem to be confused over that and seem to think that one can maintain a railway line carrying practically no passengers simply because the Act might not have declared the necessity of CIE paying their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked a question about the nature of this temporary borrowing.  I do not want to delude the House in any way but I should think it is almost certain that some subsidy will be needed to cover part of the temporary borrowing from the Exchequer by CIE and the temporary borrowing in the Bill is being looked at in the context of the latest financial difficulties of CIE and the plans which must be made in future to deal with new legislation in regard to CIE and the public transport.  It is only reasonable to state the position quite frankly and honestly.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the point about Ostlanna Teoranta.  The formation of OIE was approved by me; their articles of association were examined; the method of selecting the board was examined and approved by the Government.  I also give an assurance to Deputy Sweetman that the Bill does not in any way adversely affect the compensation to anyone concerned in the construction of railway lines, for which, apparently, there was not proper legal provision originally.</P>
    <P>Another minor question asked by Deputy A. Barry was what happened to the railway lines and other material when disposed of by CIE.  The revenue was put to an appropriation account and the loss that is published annually does not, in fact, include the revenue from the sale of railway lines and other material which, after the main loss has been published, is then expressed as a receipt in the appropriation account.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of previous Ministers in charge of railway affairs.  I do not see any harm in being hopeful when a new Bill is introduced.  I was very hopeful when the 1958 Act was introduced that we would at least succeed in eliminating a major part of the losses of CIE.  It is very difficult to predict all the changing circumstances that may occur in regard to transport conditions.  Very startling changes have taken place not only here but all over Europe.  Some very wise prophet might, perhaps, have predicted the enormous growth in the volume of private transport since the war.  It has gone beyond what we regard as predictable bounds. The decision of the Irish people to have the largest amount of private transport per million pounds of their income in the whole of Europe is one which has very deeply affected the fortunes of CIE.  It is, indeed, one of the most remarkable features in our whole transport set-up.  Today there is roughly one car to every 14 people in the country, one to every eight in Dublin.  Taking the 1951-61 rate of increase&mdash;a decade which included some good as well as bad years&mdash;we reckon that in the early 70's there will be one car to every eight or ten people in the country and one to every four in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The main problem facing CIE is that, though there will be this great vehicle growth, nevertheless, even if we double the number of cars, there will still be less congestion here than there is in any other country in Europe, outside the conurbation of Dublin, and excluding the cities areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of miles of road per thousand of the population in this country and in Sweden constitutes a European record.  There is a scattered human population and a huge car population in relation to the income of the country with, at the same time, a lack of congestion and none of the conditions that prevail in so many European countries.  In fact, we shall not be faced with those conditions even if the vehicle population increases very rapidly.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, and I think this is important, that I am absolutely convinced, after regular conferences with the Chairman and Board of CIE, that the losses this year would have been anything between £3 million and £4 million, not the anticipated loss of £1,600,000 to £1,900,000 if drastic reorganisation had not taken place, including not only the closing of lines but also the tremendous effort made to increase the volume of road freight services.  In a period covering roughly four to five years the volume of road freight has increased by some 58 per cent.  The tremendous effort to reorganise the whole system through containerisation and pallotisation, and reducing the handling costs to the lowest possible level, is still proceeding.  One of the great difficulties facing railways all over the world is the number of categories of goods that will not bear a double handling under any circumstances, that must be handled as little as possible if they are to be carried economically.  Part of the reorganisation has been directed towards reducing handling costs of goods that take double handling.  I regard that as progress even if CIE have failed to live up to the terms of the 1958 Act.  I should think the loss would have been nearly twice as much if reorganisation had not taken place.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about the future policy of CIE. CIE are making their own detailed study.  A proper cost accounting system has been introduced and the services of commercial exploitation are now included.  A great deal of accountancy work is being mechanised and it is possible now to prepare a plan and give a concept of its future in a far more definite way as a result of the reorganisation that has taken place.  It is possible to draw deductions, make predictions and estimates in a way that was not possible before because of the lack of a modern cost accounting system.  Allied to that study, a study is being made in my Department in the process of which we are considering the overall problem.  We are helped by representatives of the Department of Local Government.  The whole problem of transport is being studied.  That study is proceeding somewhat on the lines of the agenda used by the Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Beddy, that reported on internal transport, but, of course, taking advantage of all the newer information we have and all the increased amount of information made available to us by CIE because of the change in their accountancy and costing methods.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that whatever proposals are made they will be based on the idea of providing an efficient service of transport with no prejudice against rail or road services, and one hope I have is that whatever proposals come from the Government, they will be based on a realistic approach to transport and not on a sentimental feeling for an empty railway.</P>

      <P>I cannot help feeling that the purpose of the railway is to provide a fast continuous service. That is the description of future railway services by many a prominent director of railways in Europe.  I cannot think of any better and such a service should be able to take goods that can bear double handling. It should be able to deal with a large volume of tourist traffic and with very large peak traffic at certain times of the year.  A railway is really meant for long-distance travel.  It should be noted that in this country the arterial roads are improving very rapidly.  I hear complaints from members of the House that the effect of closing railway lines is to increase traffic on the roads but when plans come for major improvements to the arterial roads of the country, I never hear these county councillors saying that we had better be careful, that we need not turn the Dublin-Cork road into an autobahn as the years go by when there is a good fast railway service from Dublin to Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is going on just the same.  The majority do not object and the work is proceeding and it simply provides more competition to CIE.  It makes it inevitable that CIE train services will have to speed up and they are being speeded up in many cases by the closing of stations that are not used.  The Chairman has told me he is quite convinced that a great deal of further reorganisation can take place to make CIE more efficient and he has not given up hope of effecting greater efficiency and reducing the cost of CIE in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Deputies referred to the damage that would be done to the roads by the withdrawal of rail services and I do think that in this case we should take an objective view.  On 1st April, 1963, CIE published notice of withdrawal of rail services from 56 stations in the midlands and the west of Ireland.  The replacement in terms of road traffic for the traffic that used to pass through those 56 stations will be two lorries, possibly with containers and trailers, eight additional <Col N="357" /> lorries during certain seasons and four buses which will be required full time. If anybody tells me that that very small number of vehicles will wreck the roads contiguous to the 56 stations, I just do not believe it and nobody would believe it because, at many of those stations, not more than four or five people per train embarked and disembarked per day and in modern terms and if one studies the whole development of railways everywhere, one realises that such a railway is not really a railway at all.  The train running along it, if it stops at that railway station, is a bus running on rails, stopping too infrequently and not serving the people half as well as if the service were replaced by a bus service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the railway closings announced in the autumn of 1962, these required the substitution of ten single-deck and two double-deck buses.  To give a further example in connection with the Portlaoise-Kilkenny and Kilkenny-Deerpark line, the number of lorries required full time is four and the maximum number required for the peak season is five. In that particular case, no new bus is required at all.  I mention that because if we had the problem that quite evidently exists in some countries where there is a real danger of heavy congestion on the roads and where the railway is losing although it is carrying a very considerable volume of traffic, it would be a different matter and we could argue the position here.  However, in a great many cases the replacement of railway traffic means practically nothing as far as roads are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also asked what we were doing to co-ordinate policy. I have already mentioned the fact that we have a study group in the Department and we have CIE presenting proposals.  I should also make it clear that all through the operation of this <Col N="358" /> Act I have had constant conferences with the Chairman, that I have had the accounts studied, that I have studied at all times the current effect of railway line closing, that I have studied constantly the effect on the roads of the number of vehicles required in replacement and the amount of capital improvement to the roads that will be needed, to be measured over a long-term period against the loss on the line.  I have also asked for particulars of the volume of traffic secured on the substitute services, and very carefully examined the very rare complaints we have received when a railway line is closed. I am very glad to say that in some of the areas the traffic with the new road services is actually greater than it was on the rail services.  I do not know of any case where there has been any marked diminution nor have I received any volume of complaints.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully compared CIE with the air companies.  I remarked, and would like to repeat, that many millions of £s in capital have been wiped off the capital structure of both the GSR and CIE.  CIE, if I remember correctly, have had some £16 million of capital written off over the past 15 years. There is scarcely any comparison between a new type of service such as the air companies and a service which is competing with a vast amplitude of private transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made some very helpful and constructive observations on industrial relations in connection with State companies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for industrial relations and for legislation concerning aiding to reduce the number of disputes taking place but I am also concerned with good industrial relations within State companies because I want the companies to be prosperous and the workers to feel happy and contented so that they will perform their work well and enjoy their service in the companies.  I have a general interest in regard to these matters and I have asked all State companies to do all they can to see if they can improve communication between themselves, the trade unions <Col N="359" /> and the workers and to ensure that every effort is made to examine all the most modern methods of so doing.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this.  There is the task of making sure that the workers in a State or in a private company have full information on the progress of the company, that they understand the objective of the company; what their own position and responsibilities are in relation to its progress so that they can fully understand the meaning of productivity and the advantages to the company and to themselves if productivity increases. Equally, it is very important for all State companies to do their utmost to improve communication between themselves, the unions and the workers.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of CIE, Dr. Andrews, has himself a tremendously strong belief in good labour relations and is a firm believer in discussions at all levels.  An example has been the formation of a great number of joint industrial councils within the railway system of CIE and, as the House knows, he recently announced that he is undertaking an inquiry to see whether he can have the same kind of communication in connection with the road service side of the company.  The example has been set on the rail side exemplified by the number of questions relating to conditions of work, matters of detail in relation to particular sectors of the rail service and that can be discussed through those industrial councils at quite low levels and then passed on to the union executives, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully chided me to the effect that I do not believe in wage increases for workers.  I have never said anything of the kind.  I made it perfectly clear in all the speeches I made both in relation to State companies and the economy in general in common with my colleagues that if the prosperity of the country grows the workers must share in it.  I have never said anything to the effect that I believe in keeping wages down.  What I said in regard to CIE is quite simple. The eighth round had different effects on different sections of the community <Col N="360" /> and there were some sections where the labour cost, as a proportion of the total cost of production, was such that, for one reason or another, very efficient managements have managed to reequip themselves or, if they perhaps had not thought sufficiently of re-equipment, the eighth round of wages made them suddenly face up to the necessity of so doing and in certain cases they managed to cover the increased cost of labour by re-equipment and reorganisation.</P>
    <P>What I did say was that when the labour cost of operating a service, as in the case of CIE, is over 60 per cent of the total cost, such a company is bound to be more affected than others by a wage increase of 20 per cent which compared, for example, with the national average wage increase of 12 per cent as at September, 1962.  That is what I said.  Also, CIE has been reequipping itself but it is quite obvious that with so huge a labour content it would be impossible for it to catch up on that big wage increase in a very short period.  What I still feel is that, as has been suggested by the Taoiseach recently in connection with his plan for an accepted growth of wage remuneration in relation to the growth of national income if wages, for instance, had risen at a more steady rate and not quite so much at once it is possible that CIE would not have lost so much traffic and the need might not have arisen to have passed on so much extra to fares and the position would have been better for them and, in the long run, for the workers.  But that matter is arguable.  If the workers felt that they were entitled to get a very large increase relative to the increase secured by the community as a whole, for one reason or another, and if that is so it is a matter for CIE and the unions.</P>
    <P>What I said was that it was just in the nature of things that a company with 64 per cent labour content was bound to be affected by a 20 per cent increase in wages and would be unable to defend itself and would inevitably suffer adverse effects, whereas possibly if that wage increase had taken place smoothly over a period of years the result might not have been so serious.  In any event the Taoiseach <Col N="361" /> has made this matter perfectly clear and has made these suggestions for national consideration of wage levels in relation to the growth of national income and whatever the result may be I have not heard any very great criticism but a good deal of praise for his suggestions which form a normal part of industrial negotiation machinery in many north European countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin asked about the payment of redundancy compensation. The basis for these payments is laid down in the Act and the basis in relation to the payment of CIE workers cannot be varied.  In certain cases there is an appeal to an arbitrator and the matter, I think, is being handled very successfully by the unions and CIE.  I have had a number of complaints but very few in relation to the number of people who have been made redundant.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points raised and I should like to thank Deputies for their constructive statements on this occasion which I consider have been very helpful.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the increase to £160 million of the existing statutory limit of £135 million on the capital expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for general purposes, that is to say, exclusive of capital expenditure on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 31st March, 1963, the actual capital expenditure of the Electricity Supply Board for general purposes was about £97 million.  In addition, the Board had entered into commitments for the same purposes amounting to approximately £37 million.  The total of £134 million covers expenditure already incurred and expenditure likely to be incurred on foot of present <Col N="362" /> commitments up to 1968/69.  It includes provision for 470 megawatts of generating plant yet to be commissioned. It is expected that all this additioinal plant will have been commissioned by 1969 and the Board's generating capacity will then be 1289.5 megawatts, of which 219 megawatts will be hydro, 407.5 megawatts peat-fired, 15 megawatts fired by native coal and the remainder of 648 megawatts fired by imported coal or oil.</P>
    <P>The Board must plan system extensions well in advance, especially generating plant extensions.  The Board must, in fact, be in a position to enter into commitments in the immediate future in respect of additional plant and equipment which will be required after 1969.  As the total of the Board's expenditure and commitments is now approaching the limit of £135 million set by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1962 which was passed in July, 1962, the authority of the Oireachtas to the raising of this limit to £160 million is now being sought.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I said when moving the Second Reading of the 1962 Bill that the limit of £135 million was expected to cover the commitments likely to be entered into for the next two years or so.  At that time the ESB were assuming an 8 per cent per annum rate of growth in the demand for electricity.  The Board are still working on an annual growth figure of 8 per cent long term but they have found that they must be equipped to deal in the short term with annual growth rates exceeding 10 per cent. For example, in the year to November, 1962, i.e. before the onset of the very bad weather, the growth rate was 10 per cent.  To meet the load situation which would develop with an accelerated growth rate of that order the Board have decided that three instead of two extra 60 megawatt generating sets must be installed at Ringsend thus bringing the capacity of that station in 1966/67 to 270 megawatts. Commitments in respect of the extra 60 megawatt set at that station, which must be entered into immediately, practically exhaust the Board's authority to incur capital expenditure <Col N="363" /> for general purposes and this explains why it is necessary to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to increase the limit at least a year earlier than had been expected.</P>
    <P>On the basis of their forecast of a long-term rate of growth in the demand for electricity of 8 per cent per annum, the Board expect that further capital investment amounting to about £27 million will arise for approval in the next three years.  The construction of about 200 megawatt of additional generating capacity and large extensions of the transmission and distribution system are envisaged.</P>
    <P>It is expected that all bogs suitable for economic development by present methods for power station fuel will be in production by about 1970.  Power stations have already been sited on all the rivers capable of being developed economically for hydro-electricity generation, and, while the collection of data on other water power resources is continuing, no significant additions to generating capacity can be expected from them.  The possibility of using the indicated reserves of high ash coal known as crow coal in the Arigna area as fuel for an extension of the Arigna generating station is still under investigation but, in any event, the amount of additional generating capacity which could be based on the Arigna coalfield is insignificant in relation to future generating plant requirements.  Unless, therefore, we should have the good fortune that adequate and economically workable reserves of oil or natural gas are discovered in the country, we must rely on imported conventional fuel or nuclear energy when that becomes economic to supply energy for new generating stations commissioned after 1970.</P>
    <P>The ESB continue to watch developments in the application of nuclear power for electricity production, but so far conventional methods of generation are cheaper.</P>
    <P>The unprecedentedly heavy demand for electricity experienced during the prolonged spell of severe weather last winter taxed the Board's generating <Col N="364" /> system to the limit.  It was only by calling on every available generating unit, including the stand-by plant at the Pigeon House which had to be worked well beyond its rated output, that the Board was able to maintain supply throughout this period.  Early in February the peak load reached a record high level of 632 m.w.  The difficulty of maintaining supply was accentuated by the widespread damage to transmission and distribution lines caused by blizzards during this period. The extent to which the Board succeeded in maintaining the supply of electricity during this period was really an outstanding achievement and I am sure that Deputies will agree that the Board's staff concerned are deserving of heartiest congratulations for the excellent services rendered by them.</P>

      <P>Although it does not arise directly on this Bill, I should like to say a few words about the progress of rural electrification.  The 1962 Act authorised an increase in the capital subsidy for the connection of rural houses to the electricity supply to 75 per cent of the capital cost subject to a maximum of £75 for any one house, and authorised the Board to spend an extra £5 million on the scheme, bringing the total permitted expenditure on it to £37 million.  A special grant of £90,000 was provided for &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; distribution lines in certain rural areas which it would otherwise be quite uneconomic to connect.  The Board is now pressing forward with the completion of the initial scheme and expect that the development of all areas will be completed by June, 1964.  At the same time the Board is putting into operation a further programme under which all, or nearly all, houses still without supply will be re-canvassed over the next few years and local post-development schemes to bring supply to all those now requiring it will be drawn up.  It is a feature of the rural programme in its final phase that some houses now prepared to take supply, may have to wait a while until the post-development scheme for their locality comes to be carried through, but this is inescapable if orderly progress, <Col N="365" /> rather than haphazard individual connections, is to prevail and thus ensure the minimum capital expenditure on the work and, consequently, lower special service charges for those who have to pay them.  It is expected that comparatively few people will have to be asked to pay special service charges of more than half their normal fixed charge.</P>
      <P>The total number of consumers connected under the rural electrification scheme at a recent date was 271,763 which together with 14,370 consumers who had been connected before the rural areas were developed gives a total of 286,133 or approximately 72 per cent of all rural dwellings. The total capital cost of rural electrification to date is about £32 million.  On the basis of the present subsidy arrangements the Board can offer supply on reasonable terms to some 100,000 rural dwellings still unconnected. The Board expects that about 64,000 of these will accept supply during the next four years and that in due course some 96,000 will be connected bringing the total rural connections to about 96 per cent of all rural dwellings.  This achievement compares very favourably with what has been achieved in many better off European countries.  The total estimated capital cost of connecting the 96,000 houses is £7 million or on average, about £75 per house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, some 12,000 houses or about 3 per cent of all rural dwellings which because of their isolated locations would be hopelessly uneconomic to connect.  The total estimated capital cost of connecting these houses is £2½ million or an average of over £200 per house.  While a subsidy of £75 per house is available in these cases, very heavy special service charges cannot be avoided because of the inordinately high capital cost of connection.  Deputies will appreciate that the cost of connecting these houses would be altogether out of proportion to any benefits to be conferred. The vast majority of these houses would be connected mainly, if not wholly, for lighting and cooking. These needs could in these cases be met in a reasonable way by alternative fuels and the initial cost would <Col N="366" /> be insignificant compared with what it would cost to connect with the electricity supply.  With this end in view, the Government has made available a grant of £10 per house towards the installation of bottled gas for these houses.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, have been struck by the magnitude of the capital investment in the electricity industry which will be required in the future, and by the rate at which it has increased.  The maximum expenditure of the ESB for general purposes, i.e. excluding expenditure on the electrification of rural areas was set at £100 million by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954.  In 1961 the figure was raised to £120 million, in 1962 to £135 million and it is expected that in three years' time the limit of £160 million now proposed will have to be raised again.</P>
    <P>The foregoing figures are exclusive of expenditure on the electrification of rural areas, which has to date cost between £32 million and £33 million. Increasing capital investment in the electricity industry is common to all countries and, indeed, the consumption of electricity in any country is a good measure of the degree to which that country has been economically developed.  Of course, as I have already indicated, the Board's cash requirements lag considerably behind their commitments.</P>
    <P>Re-investment of their depreciation funds at present provides about half the Board's annual capital requirements. For a number of years past, apart from rural subsidy totalling £5 million and minor receipts from other sources, the Board have obtained the remainder of their capital requirements direct from the public by the issue of stock, guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Minister for Finance.  Stock to a total of £27 million has been issued to date, including the successful issue of £7 million in March last.  The eagerness with which the Board's capital issues have been taken up by the public is a measure of the public confidence in the organisation, a confidence which I feel sure is shared by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House echo and, in fact, stress the remarks made by the Minister in reference to the provision of electric current during the first few months of this year.  Anyone who lived on the edge of the areas that were badly affected, as I do, realised the devotion to duty&mdash;no lesser phrase would be adequate&mdash;displayed by the officials of the ESB.  The manner in which, in West Wicklow and the borders of Kildare, they managed to keep current supplies going or were able to reconnect so soon after the blizzard deserves commendation from every side of the House.  Let us hope we will be luckier in relation to the weather in the future and that they will not be called on again to make the same efforts which, I might add, were eager and wholehearted in exactly inverse ratio to the efforts made by the Government for the people who suffered in those badly-stricken areas.  However, the tribute was due and I am glad to have this opportunity of paying it.</P>
      <P>I must confess that, listening to the Minister speaking, I thought back and decided how interesting and how amusing it was to hear Deputy Childers, as Minister for Transport and Power, coming in to give the baby elephant more fuel and food.  The Tánaiste has frequently made foolish statements&mdash;he specialises in them and there is no person who has to apologise more often&mdash;but none so foolish as the description of the Shannon scheme as a white elephant.  The rate of progress of hydro-electric supplies from the late 20s to the present time is surely something of which Deputy McGilligan can be justly proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to other more general matters, I must say I considered it rather much for the Minister to give such a late explanation as to why he has had to come again to the House so soon after last August.  It does seem there was something wrong in the forecast last August.  Any change in the supply situation since surely would not make it necessary to call for a £25 million increase in the <Col N="368" /> permissive amount of capital structure within 12 months.  Perhaps it is as well that is so, because we can well remember the mistake the Taoiseach made in directing the ESB some ten years or so ago in providing for a rate of increase for current consumption that was contrary to all the technical advice given at that time in <i>Economic Development.</i> It is perhaps better there should be the caution there was apparently last August.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly unwise to utilise capital for unnecessary pre-development as was done by the Taoiseach at that time and the Government were then properly taken to task for it by committees examining this project at the time and not merely from the financial angle.  The Minister made reference to rural electrification.  I want in that respect to get one thing clear.  There are two views in relation to the method of payment for rural electrification.  One is that it is better the general taxpayer should pay and the other, that the electricity system is one that very nearly equates to the general taxpayer system.  By and large, there is not very much difference between the two.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is quite a case to be made that when it is the rural areas that are being considered for this development, their more fortunate brethren in relation to electric current should be the people who should meet the general cost rather than the general taxpayer.  There are two quite legitimate views to be held on either side. The Minister may hold one and I may hold the other, but it should be examined from the point of view of the two rather than from the angle of any extraneous circumstances.  There never was any suggestion that the ESB, when the method of subsidy was changed, should reduce their supplies of current to new rural areas.  It was merely a question of method of payment.</P>
