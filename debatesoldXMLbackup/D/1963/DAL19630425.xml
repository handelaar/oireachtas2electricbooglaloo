    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to point out yesterday the effect this Budget will have, particularly on the industrial and commercial community. I was very surprised to note the degree of almost levity, and certainly lightness with which members of the Government Party, headed by at least one Minister, talked about the effect of a turnover tax.  We had two ministerial incursions into the debate and the Minister for Social Welfare said that the turnover tax was very slight, that it would have a very small effect on industry, and would hardly put up the cost of living at all.  I do not know who the Minister thinks will bear this tax.  The 2½ per cent tax is not the small measure which members of the Government Party have endeavoured to make out it is.  It is the biggest single imposition ever put on industry and business in the history of the State. The fact that it is 2½ per cent need not mislead anyone into thinking that it is small or unimportant.  It is an enormous tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto, the tax code of this country has been built up on the taxation of profits.  In most cases, profits are a very small proportion of turnover.  In many industries, they are not more, and frequently less, than 2½ per cent of the whole turnover.  Under this new tax, a sum is to be raised which will, in many cases, be greater than the total profits of the firm.  If any individual or any member of the Government Party thinks it will not be passed on to the consumer, he had better have <Col N="399" /> his head examined, because it must be passed on, and will be passed on.</P>
    <P>It will not be passed on exactly in the form of 2½ per cent.  It will have to be something higher than 2½ per cent.  In the course of the Taoiseach's intervention here&mdash;I think I am quoting him correctly&mdash;he said that last year the cost of living rose by five points, and that this year they think it will rise by only two points or two per cent, and that some of this 2½ per cent tax will become transmogrified into a two per cent increase in the cost of living.  That is nonsense.  It will be more than that.</P>
    <P>At the moment I am not dealing primarily with an increase in the cost of living.  What I am dealing with is this very heavy imposition on the business community and industry generally; one which it will be extremely difficult in a number of businesses to pass on to the consumer. It is such a large tax that it cannot readily be borne by the firm.  I should like to emphasise again that our tax structure deals with the taxation of the profits of industry and most people who are running a business think they are regrettably small.  I shall not go into the details of the tax structure because it is too complicated and cannot be dealt with here.  Taxation is levied on the difference between the cost of running the business and the money that comes in.  The profits are taxed.  In this case, it will have nothing to do with profits and in point of fact, it will be levied on every business to which it applies, irrespective of whether a profit is made.  That is very different from what various Ministers have tried to make out.  This is one of the most revolutionary and farreaching  measures ever introduced in this House.  That has not been made clear in any of the Ministerial speeches.</P>
    <P>When we had this intervention of the Taoiseach in the debate yesterday, I found myself excited and interested because, contrary to what some people may expect, we are not carried away so much by political differences that we do not wish to see our country prosper and industry making headway. <Col N="400" /> The Taoiseach came into the debate and spoke about the second economic plan, consultations, time tables and the necessity for economic expansion. I found myself getting very interested and very excited about all this but as the speech went on, I failed to see what connection all these sincere wishes for economic expansion and increased industrial productivity had to do with this Budget which has given industrial expansion one of the greatest slaps in the teeth it has ever got, and it has got many.</P>
    <P>Business people are hoping that this Budget would bring some measure of relief, some sign that the Government were sincere in their protestations that they wished to help industry and that they would show that that desire was sincere by doing something in the Budget.  The only things that are really welcome in the Budget, apart from the small reliefs to widows, blind pensioners and old age pensioners, is that a more sincere effort is being made to deal with tax evasion.  Sometimes we are inclined to take the question of tax evasion lightly but tax evasion costs the rest of the community money. It is taking from us they are.  If income tax and the various other taxes are paid in the way that they should be, and if all the loopholes are closed, many of us might find that the rate of taxation could be lowered.  Tax evaders do not benefit the community and they should be dealt with severely.  I am glad to see that steps are being taken to tighten the net.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see that something is being done to hit the individual who is using a farm as a means for hiding the profits of industry or business. That is something that has long been overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell would not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great attention to Deputy O'Donnell last night and I am not sure that Deputy Corry listened with quite the same degree of attention because he left the House in the middle of the speech and, while he was glad that steps were being taken to deal with <Col N="401" /> that form of tax evasion, at the same time, he felt that the whole matter would have to be handled and investigated with great care in order that it would not cause great hardship to certain individuals who were augmenting the profits of very meagre farms. There are undoubtedly in the poorer areas marginal farms, the owners of which are driven to engage in some form of business to exist.  One wants to encourage that.  We would be long sorry to see individuals prevented or discouraged from doing that by any system of taxation.  But what we do want to see and what we are glad to see is that the individual who is prospering at the expense of the community will be made to pay his just and lawful debts to the community via the Government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in the course of his exciting but disappointing intervention, said that there was a shift to the left. Now we are getting some of the truth. I have long held that in spite of protestations to the contrary, this Government are a leftist Government.  They are certainly off-centre and have been for a long time, both literally and metaphorically. It is interesting to hear that the Government propose to shift to the left.  Considering that they are already there, I wonder where they will finish up if they shift any further in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had here a great deal of State intervention, a great deal of the State entering into business and founding semi-business organisations.  The Government, through the ESB, are in direct competition with electrical traders and a great deal of public money went into and continues to go into that admirably managed State-sponsored  concern.  We could not carry on here if we did not have State-sponsored business.  It is very difficult to raise capital in Ireland for those projects and we must have a large degree of State control and State intervention.  I hope that this move to the left announced by the Taoiseach last night will not interfere increasingly with business.  We have had a great deal of it here.  Business needs help, not increasing competition from State-sponsored bodies.  I trust, therefore, <Col N="402" /> further interference will not be part of this shift to the left.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the other ministerial intervention we had yesterday&mdash;that of the Minister for Social Welfare.  From the slant he gave to the discussion, one would think that the most important consideration in the mind of the Minister for Finance when framing his Budget was the care and treatment of the less fortunate members of our community.  We all know that the treatment of the less fortunate members of the community is a matter of grave importance, but we on this side of the House feel that what has been given to them in this Budget will not do them much good.  First of all, the new benefits given are infinitesimal: the increase given to old age and blind pensioners and others will not get them very far when put up against the new tax imposed with the other hand in this Budget.</P>
    <P>New taxation is bound to increase the cost of living.  It puts up the cost of business and increases in the prices of articles must automatically follow. I am afraid this Budget will lead to further demands for increased wages. I do not see any escape from that when the full impact of this new tax has been realised by the community at large.  There will be an increase in the weekly household budget because of the increased cost of essential commodities. It is in the purchase of the necessaries of life that the strongest effects of this Budget will be felt.</P>
    <P>We have no monetary unit small enough to meet exactly the effects of this new turnover tax.  The farthing is the smallest we have and even that has practically ceased to exist.  In any event, I do not think anybody would like to see his pockets lined with farthings in order that he might be able to pay the extra amounts chargeable for smaller priced articles. On a 5d. article, the 2½ per cent would be exactly half a farthing.  We have no unit as small as that but a shopkeeper engaged in selling articles at such low prices will naturally put something on so that he will not lose on the transaction.  Old people and the poor are the very section who tend <Col N="403" /> to buy such articles and accordingly they will be the most affected.  Therefore they will not come out from the effects of this Budget at the heel of the hunt any better than they went in, despite what the Minister for Social Welfare had to say about increased benefits.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the same Minister&mdash;indeed there were echoes of this in the Budget Statement itself&mdash; say that specific articles in the higher price range would carry this 2½ per cent.  It would be extremely difficult to operate such a suggestion.  The notion that the better-off sections of the community who buy more expensive articles will bear a high percentage of this turnover tax is, in my opinion, fallacious if one looks at the facts.  Take more expensive articles, costing £5 or so.  People buying such commodities would naturally object very strongly to paying extra for them so that the effect of this turnover tax would not be felt generally.  If such a person were asked by a shopkeeper to pay £5 5s. for a £5 article, he would very quickly tell the shopkeeper: &ldquo;You are charging too much.&rdquo; If the shopkeeper replied that he was charging the extra amount to help pay for the 1/- and 6d. articles, the purchaser of the £5 article would say: &ldquo;I am sorry, but I am not in the smallest degree interested in that.  I will not pay more than the 2/6d. which is the produce of 2½ per cent on the £5.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fail to see how traders can put more on some articles and less on others.  This form of tax will create a great deal of trouble and small shops will be severely hit by it, especially small newsagents and huckster shops.  Perhaps the Government think that the existence of such small shops is not in the public interest.  I do not see much of a shift to the left in that.  This tax will make it very difficult for small shops to realise where they stand financially until perhaps it is too late for them to see that they are in danger of running their businesses on a losing basis.</P>
    <P>We have the strange, almost anomalous <Col N="404" /> position, that the larger businesses, many of which are working on low margins of profit, will be very hard hit by the turnover tax and at the other end of the the scale, very small shops will also be hit because they are dealing in articles on which it is difficult to put up the price.  The purchaser of a shilling or a sixpenny article will, I think, object strenuously if he is asked to pay four times the tax he ought to be paying on that article.  It is very hard to persuade him&mdash;and still harder to persuade her&mdash;that they are not being fleeced by somebody if they are asked to pay ½d. more when they should pay only one-eighth of a penny more.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that certain articles in the building trade would be exempt.  The phrase he used was &ldquo;bulk purchases&rdquo;.  Clarification of that at the earliest opportunity would be greatly welcomed by the building trade. I presume he meant goods such as cement in quantity but I do not really know.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speak much longer as I spoke last night also.  Regretfully, I must say that the business community and industry in general have been handed a raw deal in this Budget.  We expected certain help and concessions. Business here has been carrying a very high load of taxation for many years and it is very hard for business to expand in such circumstances.  The reliefs given to industry are much smaller than in other countries and allowances for obsolescence, machinery and so on are much lower than in other countries.  We are asked to expand and to engage in the export trade.  The increase in the levels of exports from Ireland is very welcome and has shown that our workers and managers, employers and labour, have both the skill and the initiative to hold their own in most markets if they are given a fair chance to do so.  The Government constantly talk of incentives but do not give the real incentives which amount to putting us in a position somehow to finance these ventures out of the money we can make here.  That is the soundest way. Foreign capital coming into the country is all very well&mdash;it is better <Col N="405" /> than no capital&mdash;but we still think that if Irish capital could do it, it would be better that our industries should be financed and run by Irish men and women who understand the difficulties we are up against and the conditions in which we work.  However admirable it may be to have foreigners coming in, it is not as good as having industries run by our own people.</P>
    <P>One way in which our own people can be put in a position to do this work themselves is for the Government, with sensitiveness and knowledge of the situation, to enable the business community to put itself in such a position that it will not need to crawl to foreign capitalists to get them to come in and do what the Irish people could do if they had the money themselves.  We can only build up that money out of the profits of business but the minute the profits grow a bit big, the Government come along and say : &ldquo;Give me that.&rdquo; How can it be done then?  If these foreigners had Governments as greedy in their own countries as we have in ours, they would not be able to export their capital to this country.  That is one of the fundamental facts.  Take the vast expansion in Western Germany after the war.  Where does all the surplus money in Germany come from, in spite of what they had to pay in taxation and in spite of having to rebuild many of their cities?  If their Government had taken as big a proportion of the surplus of industry as the Government here take, it would not have been possible for them to do it.</P>
    <P>We seem to be fleeced by a form of squandermania in Governments here. Business has suffered from it for years and years and years.  That is one of the reasons why we have to call in the outsiders to do the work&mdash;to provide the money which we ought to be able to provide ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot speak more hearteningly on this Budget.  I think it has failed to do for the poorer sections what it ought to do&mdash;and it has done for the business community : it has done them properly in the eye.  I hope that when we meet for our next <Col N="406" /> Budget the lamentations of the business community will be less than I fear they will be because the Government have done a most serious thing by imposing this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I do not think the country at all realises what has been done to it overnight. The whole face of taxation has been changed.  Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept this Budget and we as a Party must register our disapproval of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a measure of the success of this Budget is the manner in which it has been approached by Deputies on the Opposition benches. By now, the pattern has become fairly obvious.  That pattern of approach is basically to concentrate on the new turnover tax&mdash;and, I submit, to misrepresent it&mdash;and, in addition, to trot out the hoary old tales which we have been hearing for years and which have been explored here in the past but which I suppose will continue to be trotted out until some new political idea strikes the benches across the way.</P>
      <P>We have the usual lamentations particularly from the Fine Gael Party about the appalling position of this country today.  Apparently we are to believe that the Fine Gael Party think none of us has a memory that goes back further than the advent of the present Fianna Fáil Government.  We had the hoary old tale about the alleged promise by Fianna Fáil to provide 100,000 new jobs.  We had the story about more emigration now than ever before.  All these things, of course, have been gone into in the past and have been shown up for what they are&mdash;a misrepresentation of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House by going over them all again.  However, I wish once more to point out that they are based on two fallacies.  The first fallacy is that of picking out a particularly favourable year on which to base a comparison&mdash;which anybody can do&mdash;and the second fallacy consists in ignoring the trends which have taken place each year.  If you want an accurate picture of what is happening in a country under a Government during their term of office, you must follow the trend of statistics&mdash;not just <Col N="407" /> pick out one year and then another ten years later.  You must follow the trend.  That trend will show that, at the commencement of this Government's term of office, following the last Coalition, the position was very bad, gradually improved and has steadily been improving since.  That is the indication given by statistics&mdash;in so far as you can get an accurate picture from statistics.</P>
    <P>I was singularly struck, however, by the approach of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.  I remember not so very long ago when this House discussed the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> the case which Deputy Dillon made.  He made a point which on the face of it was attractive, that is, his claim that the major fault in the programme outlined in <i>Closing the Gap</i> was that it made no effort to restrain profits.  This Budget is taxing profits to a higher extent than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon came in here and in the manner of which only he is capable painted a picture of the dreadful prospects ahead of the small shopkeeper in this country.  I do not suppose it is any use to appeal that we should have a little more consistency in these things.  However, it is worth while pointing out that there is a completely contradictory approach between what we heard yesterday from Deputy Dillon and what we heard from him not so very many months ago on the debate on the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i></P>
    <P>We also heard from Deputy Dillon in very impressive terms that this Government hold the record on many matters&mdash;for instance, that we have the highest cost of living ever recorded; that we have the highest debt ever recorded and various other matters of that ilk.  I submit that that means absolutely nothing unless it is taken in the proper context.  Deputy Dillon did not mention that we also have the highest national income ever recorded, that real wages are higher than they have ever been and that the standard of living is higher than it has ever been.</P>
    <P>It would be equally justifiable to take the case of a man who starts off in <Col N="408" /> business in a small way with, say, an overdraft of £500 in the bank.  He builds up his business over the years and after about twenty years, has built up a very successful business.  With a successful business, he will almost certainly have a very large overdraft because that is usually the most attractive way in which to get capital.  He may end up with an overdraft of, say, £100,000.  In that regard, he will have the highest debt he has ever had in his life.  He may also be paying overheads which are vastly higher than any he has ever paid but that does not tell you anything.  You have to know how his business is doing.  If you find his business is vastly larger than it was in the past and in fact, that his profits and real income are very much larger than they were when he started, then you can say that man is doing well.</P>
    <P>To talk about the amount of the national debt and the amount of the cost of living means nothing, taken on its own.  I believe that this Budget has laid the basis for the future development of this country in a way which probably will not be appreciated for some years.  I have no doubt whatever that if by any misfortune the country were in future to be governed by the Deputies across the way, the Minister for Finance appointed by them would be very grateful to Deputy Dr. Ryan for having introduced this Budget because we have now, under this Budget, the beginning of a financial structure which makes sense, one which is not dependent in a most unhealthy way on taxes on three or four major items like beer, tobacco and spirits.  Clearly it is a very unhealthy situation for any country to be depending on a small number of items for taxation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is also clear from the figures available that the revenue received has not been closely enough related to the state of the economy. This Budget introduces a method by which the revenue received by the Government at any time will be much more closely related to the economic situation.  If the country is progressing economically, retail sales will increase; if the country is not progressing, retail sales will go down in <Col N="409" /> number, and correspondingly the revenue received by the Government will go up or down.</P>
    <P>This, I submit, is a very important aspect of the financing of our country. It is only reasonable to assume that if the economy is expanding, the Government will spend more.  That is what the people want the Government to do.  They want the Government to give better services, to spread the increase in the national income more equitably.  Consequently, it is of much more benefit to the country that there should be a method of taxation available whereby automatically and very accurately the amount of revenue received will be related to the economy.</P>
    <P>Although the negotiations for the entry of Britain to the Common Market broke down in Brussels, it is abundantly clear that as far as this country is concerned, in future years and perhaps in the not too distant future we shall be more and more concerned with economic aspects of the Continent and to that extent it is important that our taxation system should approximate more closely to the system commonly operated in the Continent and, I might mention to the Deputies on the Labour benches, more commonly operated by the socialist governments of Europe.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> We have had speaker after speaker here from both the Fine Gael and Labour benches telling us that the turnover tax will mean so much on the lb. of butter, so much on the loaf of bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to that. There is a shop selling bread and it adds on to the price of bread in order to cover this tax but there is a shop down the road that does not.  Obviously the people in the district will buy in the shop in which this tax is not added. There will be another shop which will sell bread at the old price but will add the tax on to something else.  They will very soon find that they cannot get business if they do this and I am convinced that the essential commodities will not be increased at all and that the tax will be paid in two ways : one, by being added on to luxury items and, two, by the retailers themselves.  The man who got nearest to this in the speeches I have heard so far was Deputy Dockrell who is a businessman and who last night spoke from the heart and said this Government were really kicking business in the teeth by increasing corporation profits tax and imposing this turnover tax.  He made a very strong case to show that the whole turnover tax would be paid by business.  It is my belief that the whole of the tax will not be paid by business but that some of it will and the remainder of it will be paid through luxury items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell, when he came in this morning, changed his tune somewhat and told us this tax would have to be passed on to the consumer.  I do not know whether he thought it over last night or somebody spoke to him, but eventually he came back to his original theme that this was primarily a tax on business.  Let us face it that this tax is a retail turnover tax and the Minister has made it clear that he is not laying down that a loaf of bread, a box of matches, a motor car or anything else is to be taxed by 2½ per cent. How it will operate will be controlled, <Col N="411" /> I believe, by laws of supply and demand and the laws of competition. In this country today, competition in regard to the basic items, essential foodstuffs sold in grocers' shops, is tremendous.  Anybody who thinks that in face of that competition these items will be increased not alone by 2½ per cent but, as some people have argued, by much more, is just not in touch with what is going on in this country.</P>
    <P>If you take a very small collection of houses that can hardly be even called a village, where there is only one shop, there could be a case made but communications are such today and there are so few people in any part of the country who never go into town, that I do not think it would operate to any large extent.  In regard to the greater part of the country, the towns and cities and the rural areas, I believe this tax will be paid primarily through items like tinned peaches, and so on, plus the contribution of the shopkeeper.  I make no secret of my view that the retailer will have to pay some of this tax.  He will be forced to do it by virtue of competition.  I also think it will be of some assistance to the smaller shopkeepers in the fight they are waging against the very much larger combinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>That will put them in a strong position to fight the larger combinations, paying the tax themselves.  I think it will put them in the bankruptcy court.  Deputy Colley would be engaged by some of them.</P>

      <P>Retailers have had largely increased business in recent years.  Last year, the increase in retail sales was seven per cent and the indications are that it will be even higher in the current year.  That being so, it is certainly open to most retailers to work off some of the imposition involved here through increased business.  We know, and Deputies on the Labour benches know very well, it is frequently argued to justify a wage claim, if it is not too excessive, that it acts to spur employers to greater <Col N="412" /> efficiency.  The same case can be made to some extent for a tax on retailers' turnover which is not excessive&mdash;that it acts to spur them to greater efficiency and to cut down their overheads.  This will be a tax on their turnover, not on their profits.  If they can be more efficient, they can still make the same or greater profit and pay this tax.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of the efforts made by this Government and of the success which has attended their efforts.  I have no apology to make to anybody on this matter.  Far from making an apology, I am prepared to throw out my chest and boast about what has been achieved by this Government.  I am proud of the fact that this Government have had the courage and foresight to introduce a Budget clearly designed for further development in this country.  It has not only a short-term but a long-term aim in view. That is obvious to anybody who studies the position.</P>
      <P>This Government by their efforts have shown they are capable of carrying out the plans they are putting before the people.  Our efforts are being directed now to a further expansion in the economy, to the creation of further jobs, to the orderly sharing out of increases in the national wealth, to an expanding programme of education. All these things require money.  We have to face up to it that the money must be found.  I do not think the Irish people will complain about this so long as the national income is being increased and everybody is somewhat better off.  We do not begrudge the money being devoted to these items but we do require that the Government should ensure that the method of collection of the revenue to finance these efforts should be as far as possible equitable and efficient.  To that extent, I think the Minister for Finance is to be congratulated because his Budget meets both these tests more than well.</P>

      <P>If one were to accept Deputy Colley's arguments in regard to the turnover tax and how it will be collected, surely there was no need for the Minister to include essential foodstuffs in any shape or form in this <Col N="413" /> scheme of taxation?  Surely he should have exempted them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What about hotels? People eat big meals in hotels.  They will pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who eat big meals in hotels hardly justifies the fact that this turnover tax will mean with the arrival of November a convulsive jump forward in the cost of living.  I am one who believes it will not stop at 2½ per cent. When taxation has occurred in the past, the business people have not been known in my experience to absorb it out of existing profits.  Inevitably, it has been passed on.  Already we hear talk in Dublin of the publican's intention to increase the price of the pint by 2d. to make it 2/-.</P>
      <P>In my estimation, the increase in the cost of living which will emerge when this turnover tax comes into operation will be in the neighbourhood of six per cent.  The average business person, who is now being asked to act as a tax collector and make monthly returns, will first pass on the 2½ per cent tax.  Then he will argue with himself and the public that for the trouble he is taking on the Government's behalf, he must add a further percentage to cover administrative costs which must arise.  In the heel of the hunt, the people who will be paying this tax will be the ordinary working people, particularly those of the city and county of Dublin who invariably carry the great burden of taxation and who carry the transport services for the benefit of the rest of the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the idea of a purchase tax, but I have a decided objection to the manner in which this is applied.  As far as I can conclude from looking at the situation and having listened to the Minister's entire speech and to other speakers on the matter, it appears very obvious that at the end of this year the Dublin worker, whose average wage can be fixed at around £10 a week, will find he has suffered a wage reduction, in effect, of between 7/- and 9/-.  I am convinced that is how it will work out. Deputy Dockrell has indicated the <Col N="414" /> logical next step.  We all know from experience that the workers are going to take whatever steps they can to redress that grievance.  This is happening at a time when we should be trying to improve the standard of living of these workers and give them additional reliefs.  It is happening at a time when workers throughout the length and breadth of the city are finding it hard to get along and whose incomes are being considerably reduced by the impact of the present bus strike.  How they are to accept this, and how the Government will fare in North-East Dublin as a result, will be very interesting.</P>
    <P>When a Budget comes along, I am always inclined to judge its worth on what it does for the old age pensioner. Pretty nearly everybody in this country is getting some kind of a living, but the old age pensioner is getting no living. The old age pensioner living on the non-contributory pension should be an object for shame for every Deputy and everybody in the country.  Every time a Budget has been introduced in this House, there have been &ldquo;Hurrahs&rdquo; from the Government benches because the Government have invariably been able to achieve the remarkable feat of giving half a crown to these people. These people number several thoussands. Many of them are alone in the world, living in tenement rooms, trying to battle a lonely existence on 32/6d. a week and the best we can do, the best the genius and brains of the Department of Finance and the Government can produce, is 2/6d.</P>
    <P>It is miserable, it is low and it is mean and it is something of which we should be ashamed.  I personally would be prepared to go into the Lobby and vote for a higher purchase tax, applied in a different way, if only something decent had been done for these unfortunate people.  It seems to me we are never going to see that day unless this shift to the left which the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday becomes an effective fact.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not think the Government have any intention whatever of shifting to the left but it is interesting to note that when the <Col N="415" /> Taoiseach did mention this shift to the left, there were no howls from the back areas of &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; as there were the previous day against other members, a most unjustifiable and disorderly action.  There were no howls of &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; to the Taoiseach for his proposal to shift to the left, nor should there have been.  I do not think the Government really propose to go sufficiently far in that direction.  The Taoiseach, in his customary astute political fashion, is anticipating youthful thinking and youthful trends.  It has been obvious to me for some time, and I am sure to everybody in contact with the public, that the youth to-day who have been in England and are returning here, are inclined to be a good deal more left of centre than those who preceded them.  I want to make it perfectly clear, in case any of the propagandists try to misuse what I am saying, that it is not that there is any sympathy with Communism or anything related thereto but there is a definite trend in young people towards liberalisation of the democratic leftward trend.  I am glad the Taoiseach indicated that he was thinking along those lines, although I do not expect to see effective steps taken to implement that kind of policy, in so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned anyway, for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioners, as I say, are usually people on whom any Minister for Finance should look with the utmost concern when preparing his Budget.  Deputy Dockrell suggested that an intervention made yesterday by the Minister for Social Welfare did seem to indicate that that Minister's measurement of the Budget's value was based on the manner in which the less fortunate members of the community, as they are described, are treated.  I would have the same point of view as the Minister for Social Welfare in that I think you have to measure the progress of the nation and the prosperity of the nation in terms of how the economically lowest section of the nation stand.  If we cannot get satisfactory results at that level, we are not doing all right.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel at all with the <Col N="416" /> Minister's imposition of the corporation profits tax.  Deputy Dockrell and others seemed to make the case that this might be a disincentive to the expansion of industry.  I do not think that the absence of these taxes helped towards expansion.  There is no evidence of it.  As far as I can judge, whenever taxes are removed with the intention of providing industrial incentives, their removal is availed of by the vested interests to put further money into their own pockets and not to expand at all.  It seems to me that one of the major problems that any Irish Government have to face in getting industry to expand to any degree at all stems largely from the fact that we have to a great extent been over-protected for many years. Protection has been part and parcel of the economic set-up for so long that industrialists and business people have come to regard it as an absolute right and have come to regard the removal of taxation when it does occur, not as an incentive to expand but simply as a means of giving them additional profits.</P>
    <P>Much has already been spoken about practically every aspect of the Budget but just how this turnover tax will operate has not yet been appreciated outside the House and indeed it is almost impossible for Deputies to appreciate just what all the implications are.  Listening to the Minister making his Budget speech, and replying to subsequent questions, I got the impression that this was a hastily conceived idea which had not been given the thorough examination which a serious step such as this deserves. From every speaker we hear about a new aspect or a possible aspect of this tax which creates problems and which does not seem to have occurred to the Department.  For instance, it was mentioned that in a business with a turnover of £100,000, with the tax applied to that, the figure would be £102.500 and the question was asked if tax would be applied to the tax.  In other words, will the position be that the State will be getting a tax upon a tax?</P>
    <P>That is one aspect.  There are many <Col N="417" /> others.  How in the name of goodness is it to be implemented in the case of the thousands of huckster shops?  We all know there are thousands of these shops throughout the country and many people in them are barely existing, selling goods with a very small margin of profit.  They are probably living on five per cent, or less, depending on the turnover they get.  Many of these people do not bother with books except in so far as it is essential to keep some record of goods sold on credit.  How will the State ensure that there will be accurate accounting from such people of their turnover when the people themselves will find it difficult to say what that turnover is at any given time?  What penalties will be introduced, I wonder, within the course of the next few months and what penalties will be imposed for neglecting to make these monthly returns?  All these implications appear, the more one thinks about this Budget.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that a purchase tax would be justifiable if a scheme had been worked out whereby it was levied at source or at some point nearer source so that the tax could be contained at 2½ per cent. and not allowed to grow any bigger.  As was suggested by a representative of a trade body, it might have been far more effective and certainly more equitable and would cause much less disquietude if the tax had been imposed at, say, the wholesale distribution point instead of at the retail sale level and if regulations had been brought in to prevent profiteering on this tax.  I have not the slightest doubt that profiteering will occur and will flow from this tax.  Neither have I any doubt that the people who will pay this tax are those who are paying everything in this country, who are carrying this country more than any other section, namely, the ordinary working people of this city and county.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason and also for the reason that the old age pensioners were so shabbily treated that I voted against this Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had personally some considerable and rather painful experience of what it means <Col N="418" /> for a Government, and particularly for a Minister for Finance in a Government, in difficult financial and economic circumstances to frame a Budget, I rather tend, even in Opposition, to have considerable sympathy for a Minister for Finance faced with the difficulties with which the present Minister is faced.  I regret, therefore, that having considered the matter very carefully, I am convinced that the proposals in this Budget are not for the good of the country as a whole and that they will not help, even in tendency, to bring about the prosperity, advancement, and expansion in industry that is so urgently required in the conditions obtaining at the moment in the country and outside.</P>
      <P>In the concluding sentence of the Minister's speech in offering this Budget to the House the other day, he recommended the Budget &ldquo;as a set of responsible and equitable measures designed to keep our national finances in order, to be fair in the allocation of benefits and burdens, and to promote the higher rate of economic growth which is the key to greater prosperity for a larger population.&rdquo;  It would have been a pleasure for anybody to agree with that recommendation but it is utterly impossible, when the facts and circumstances facing the country at the moment are calmly and dispassionately weighed, to agree to any of the propositions set out in that concluding sentence.  I personally believe that the conditions in the country at the moment, conditions of finance, economics, and the outside facts impacting upon our conditions here in international affairs generally face this country with a situation of great gravity for the solution of which, I believe, all the energies of all sections of the people combined together in goodwill, working together in a patriotic endeavour, are required to bring this country out of the condition of jeopardy in which it is at the moment and I regret that I cannot see in this Budget any help towards securing that co-operation from all sections of the community which, in my view, is urgently required to solve the problems and difficulties that confront us at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> While I have, therefore, from conviction, to make certain criticisms of this Government, I think at the outset it is proper that we should recognise that there are certain benefits in the Budget itself, benefits which unfortunately are largely offset by some of the other provisions of the Budget.</P>
    <P>In particular, from my personal point of view as representing a city constituency in which there are many officials, civil servants, pensioners of one kind or another, I am glad that the Minister did see fit to give even a small measure of additional justice to the old Civil Service pensioners.  I am very glad of the increase, particularly for the first child, in children's allowances. The old age pension increase is again a small figure of almost a traditional amount of 2/6d., largely unfortunately offset by the impact of the cost of living and by the impact of the further rise in the cost of living which, in my view, will inevitably flow from the provisions of this Budget.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not see fit to give a further measure of justice to a particular section of pensioners who are, in my view at all events and from my experience, in a very distressful condition.  I have spoken here before of the position of the widow who has a non-contributory pension.  She has a pension of a particular amount and she gets a little increase this time but, by virtue of the administrative control over the earnings of such a widow, she is not in fact allowed by work or by her own labour or by the assistance of her kith and kin to increase that pension without the danger of having the amount paid by the State reduced.  That is a matter that should receive very serious consideration, and has not.</P>
    <P>Last year, I pointed out that I appreciated from experience the fact that when old age pensioners get 2/6d. which, as I say, is a traditional figure now when an increase is given, nobody thanks any Government for giving that amount but very few realise that while 2/6d. a week is an insignificant amount for an old age pensioner, it costs the taxpayer a very considerable and <Col N="420" /> inordinate relative sum, a tremendous amount&mdash;over £500,000&mdash;to give that 2/6d.  Nobody realises that.  I did suggest last year to the Minister that some consideration should be given to the matter to see if by other devices the old age pension could be increased, not perhaps by direct subvention from the Exchequer but by other devices which would enable the old age pensioner to supplement that income without having the official, doing his duty, often very harshly, inquiring into the means and the circumstances of the particular pensioner.  The old age pensioner and, in particular, the widow I have referred to who gets a non-contributory pension, are simply harrassed by official inquiry and by official interference to the point that they find it is not possible to work and, indeed, they are forced to cease endeavouring to obtain work because of the fact that their pensions will be decreased as a result of the inquiries of the officials.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on these officials.  Their inquisition is of a very searching kind and I know personally that their inquiries have resulted in illness, worry and anxiety to old age pensioners and widows with non-contributory pensions.  If it were possible to find some means by which widows and non-contributory pensioners and old age pensioners could work or get assistance from their kith and kin or charitable associations and get their pensions without having the fear of inquisition and the danger of their pensions being reduced, there would not be such a clamant demand for an increase of pensions and criticisms of this small amount of the traditional 2/6d. every time it is granted.</P>
    <P>Some business people give their employees a pension when they retire. Very frequently, they are not adequate pensions.  They have been earned by hard work over 30, 40 or more years.  When these pensioners reach the age of 70 years and get the old age pension, their pensions from the firms are reduced.  That should not be allowed because those firms advanced through the efforts and work over an extended period of their pensioners.  Those <Col N="421" /> people are entitled to pensions and they are also entitled to old age pensions.</P>
    <P>If some device could be found, and if there were less inquisition as to whether the St. Vincent de Paul Society or some charitable person was assisting an old age pensioner with money or food, they might be able to have a little more income coming in, and there would be less demand for old age pensions, and less demand on the Exchequer.  I spoke to deaf ears last year, and I suppose it will be the same this year.  However, I am glad that the pensioners whose interests I represent here are getting some little amelioration.  I regret it but in my view and the view of most people outside the House who have no political axe to grind, the effect of this proposal will be to increase the cost of living and reduce the purchasing power of old age pensions, widows' and other pensions given under the Budget provisions.</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to judge in the past two days from my contacts outside the House, the dominant mood of the public is not merely one of understandable shock at the increased taxation&mdash;because that is what it is in effect&mdash;that will be caused by the imposition of this new turnover tax, by the imposition of the additional corporation profits tax and by the change in taxation on residences, but also of wonderment as to how on earth this Budget which aims at securing economic expansion can hope in any way to secure the economic expansion that is so urgently required.  There is a mood of shock, bewilderment and confusion.  No one seems to know what the effect of this new turnover tax will be.  Deputy Dunne has referred to what has been our experience in the past two days of the endless queries and questions which were put to us as to whether this, that and the other thing in such and such circumstances are covered by this tax, what it means and how it will be enforced, in what circumstances does it cover this particular commodity and that particular service.  No one seems to know where we stand.</P>
    <P>That confusion which is, of course, <Col N="422" /> primarily directed at the effects and scope of the new turnover tax is also relevant to the corporation profits tax and to how it is hoped to increase economic expansion, increase employment and bring prosperity all around, as the Minister claims.  The turnover tax is a new tax and to practically everyone except some expert economists and financiers, it is an unknown tax.  The ordinary people, even if they are not economists, are familiar with the words &ldquo;purchase tax&rdquo; and &ldquo;sales tax&rdquo;.  They know what they mean in a vague sort of way.  They know about them because they have heard so many discussions about the effects of purchase tax in England.  Sometimes purchase tax in England is increased on certain commodities and sometimes within a certain range of commodities, it is reduced.  People have heard of a purchase tax through the radio, television and the newspapers.  They know vaguely that there is something which is called a purchase tax, but very few of them except the expert economists, while they know there is such a thing as a sales tax, have the remotest idea of the difference between a purchase tax and a sales tax.</P>
    <P>I would venture to say that until the Minister made his Budget statement, 90 per cent of the people had never heard of, much less understood, what a turnover tax is.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is such bewilderment, confusion and alarm amongst the general public as to the possible scope and effect of the new tax?  I think the Minister can be subjected to criticism because of the fact that he introduced this tax in his Budget without giving any explanation.  He merely imposed it, and said it would produce £3½ million in four months and £10½ million or £11 million in a full year.  To justify it he answered Deputy Norton by saying: &ldquo;I want the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that context, the last sentence of the Budget speech in which the Minister recommended the Budget to the Dáil because it was designed &ldquo;to keep our national finances in order&rdquo; is justified only by virtue of the fact that it will keep our national finances in order by bringing in a vast amount <Col N="423" /> of money.  Apparently it is necessary to get a vast amount of money from a tax that is unknown and which, because of the fact that it is unknown, like all unknown things, creates the utmost fears, anxieties and dismay in the minds of the people likely to be affected by it.  The Minister should have told the House the history of this tax and the difference between this tax and a sales tax or a purchase tax.  In my opinion, it was his duty to have educated a good many members of the House who required education&mdash; including myself&mdash;and also the general public.</P>
    <P>Comment was made earlier in this discussion on the Budget leaks&mdash;if they can be so called&mdash;that took place some months before the actual introduction of the Budget; where they came from, whether in fact they were leaks in the technical sense, and whether they contravened the convention that the secrets of the Budget are not disclosed before they are given to Parliament.  There is no doubt that public interest was aroused by the speeches of the Taoiseach and others in connection with the imposition of a new tax.  In the newspapers and amongst the public generally, there were discussions as to what on earth this tax would be. Everyone was more or less resigned to the fact that we would have something like the English purchase tax, and those who had more knowledge of the matter and had, perhaps, read more were still more confused when they remembered the various economic documents and White Papers and what other Ministers had said about not accepting the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission on the imposition of a purchase tax.  The general feeling was that it would be something like a purchase or sales tax, whatever that was.  Then the Minister came in with his new tax which no one understands except a few expert economists.</P>
    <P>In an intervention, the Minister controverted a statement by Deputy Dunne or one of the members of the Labour Party that the continental countries did not tax foodstuffs in connection with the imposition of this <Col N="424" /> retail tax.  That is a matter of controversy. So far as I know, that was the first time the Minister mentioned Norway and Sweden where this tax has been imposed.  I think the House and the people were entitled to know the nature and scope of this tax.  To my knowledge, this tax has never been imposed in England.  It was got from the Continent.</P>
    <P>My belief and conviction is that it is only the expert economist and financiers in the Department of Finance who recently investigated and produced this tax instead of a purchase tax and a sales tax who know where it came from.  The House is entitled to know and I think that even belatedly in his reply the Minister should tell the House and the public where it came from.  What is the justification for this tax, what is its scope and what would be its effect in our conditions?  What is the experience of the impact of this tax if it exists in other countries?</P>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister said by way of intervention that it exists in Norway and Sweden.  I did not know it existed in these countries. When I was in office and when we were facing a serious financial position, I expressed the view that I would not touch any of these taxes.  I am not criticising the Minister for bringing in this tax with my tongue in my cheek while thinking that I would bring it in myself if I were in office.  In the present circumstances and conditions of this country, it is not proper to bring it in.  When we were in office and facing a serious crisis, we did not bring in such a tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know what is the origin of this tax.  The Minister for Finance has merely thrown it at the country and told the people they are to have a 2½ per cent tax on turnover.  I think that even the Minister himself does not know the scope and effect of it and this is proved by the Taoiseach when he said yesterday in his speech that he was prepared to <Col N="425" /> listen to reasonable recommendations and proposals from various interested parties.  Why was that not thought out before this tax was imposed?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance traditionally meets representatives of the chambers of commerce, publicans and other interests before Budget Day and traditionally tells them that he will give careful consideration to their representations before he frames his Budget.  If he wanted to consider the scope and effect of this tax and if he could not see representatives of RGDATA, the chamber of commerce, the Federation of Irish Industries, the Federated Union of Employers or the trade unions without revealing the terms of the Budget he should have had it thought out by the Department.  I am convinced that the impression which has been created with the people is that the Minister has not the slightest notion of what the tax will embrace, that he has no clear view as to what it means.  The Minister's attitude is that he wants money.  That is a clear explanation of Government policy and of the aim of the Minister but he does not give us any clear answer when we want to know why we should have to pay that money and when we ask what businesses are to come within the scope and effect of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been all sorts of discussions between economists as to whether a purchase tax is better than a sales tax but I do not know if there has been any discussion about the effect of a tax such as this.  I know, and Deputies will know, from our travels abroad that in France and other countries, they have taxation on everything you eat and everywhere you go, but that is no justification for bringing over a tax to this country without adequate consideration and examination and careful preparation of the public and the bringing of the public into the confidence of the Government.  I hope the Minister will exert himself at the conclusion of this debate to explain to the House where he got this idea of a retail tax and what advantages it has over a purchase tax or a sales tax.  He should tell us, if he has examined the position in Norway or Sweden, what is the result of that examination <Col N="426" /> and what justification there is for saying that a tax which is applicable in the circumstances of Norway or Sweden is applicable to this country in our particular circumstances.  Those are matters upon which we should be enlightened.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us some indication as to what are the intentions of the Department with regard to the collection of this tax.  He should let interested parties know what is to happen or else Deputies will be inundated with questions as to whether particular people come within the scope of the tax or whether they do not.  I would appeal to the Minister and his colleagues not to adopt the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Lenihan, when he said yesterday that this is not a tax.  That is merely false pretences and it might do a very great disservice to this country if the backbenchers, for the purposes of propaganda, were to go around the country and say that no new taxation was being imposed, that the newspapers were right when they said that beer, and whiskey, cigarettes and tobacco had escaped.  This is a tax no matter how you try to conceal the fact by nomenclature.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is reported in the newspapers as saying that the turnover tax is not a purchase tax or a sales tax but simply a tax on total retail turnover.  That is stating the obvious.  Of course it is a tax on the total retail turnover but he does not say what that means.  It is a tax on turnover.  Therefore it is a tax and the person who says it is not a tax, even for the purpose of propaganda, is falsely pretending.  To say that this retail tax will not impact very heavily on the consuming public is again false pretences.  It will impact indirectly on the consuming public, whether it is simply a tax on total retail turnover or not.</P>
    <P>The actual impact must be and will be that the consuming public will have to pay more for their purchases, if not for all of them, at least for a very considerable range of their purchases, and I repeat that it would be a public disservice to maintain that this is not <Col N="427" /> a tax on the consumer because that, in effect, is what it is.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to cover the ground that has been so widely covered already and doubtless will be covered again before the debate concludes.  We have been told that in a full year £10½ million will be collected from this tax.  I believe it will be nearer to £11 million.  Eleven million pounds will be collected and the collectors of that tax will be the small business people, the not-so-small business people, the industrialists and the other businessmen in the community.  Eleven million pounds will be collected by the business and industrial community of this country who are to be turned into tax gatherers.  That is another effect of the tax which will certainly be passed on to the people in some or all of the commodities that pass over the counter or in exchange for given services. Was it not rather ingenuous of the Taoiseach to say this yesterday, if the morning papers to-day are reporting him correctly?</P>
    <P>The volume of retail sales was rising steadily and it was certain that this increased tax would continue. Traders could generally expect that a rise in the volume of business would help them to carry this tax in part, if not altogether.</P>
    <P>Does anybody except the Taoiseach believe that a rise in the volume of business will help the business community to carry this tax in part, if not altogether?  People are not all that foolish.  One point stands out quite clearly in that statement I have read: it is quite clear and absolutely true that this tax will continue.  There is nothing more certain in this life than that this tax will continue.  What will happen is that in the next financial year after this, £11 million will be collected and the then Minister for Finance will say: &ldquo;This is a gift.  It is 6d. in the £ now&mdash;let us shove it up another penny.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the experience of all Governments that once a tax is on, it stays on: it almost invariably increases and very seldom decreases.  Not merely will this tax continue but it will increase <Col N="428" /> because it is such an easy tax, and once the Minister gets his claws on it, he will regard it as a soft thing and people will have got used to it. That is what we have to consider here in the House and outside.</P>
    <P>I want from the Minister an answer to another question.  I feel sure I will not get it, but I will at least go to the trouble of posing the question.  In the few months of this year in which the turnover tax will operate, £3½ million will be collected&mdash;it would be between £10½ million and £11 million in a full year.  The Minister this year will have balanced his Budget in four months of this tax.  Given £1 million for extravagance or for increased budgetary expenses, in the next year he will have from £5 million to £6 million available for something.  My question is: what will he do with that money?  He finds that £3½ million is sufficient this year.  Give him as much as £1½ million extra administrative expenditure in the next Budget, he will still have £5 million in hand.  What will he do with it?  I know the Minister will probably suggest that we wait and see.  I want to know beforehand. There will be £5½ million of loose money that apparently, at the moment at all events, will not be wanted.  I think the public are entitled to know why information about the disposition of this money is not given in advance.  Is there any precedent in financial history for such procedure?</P>

      <P>The Minister will tell us to wait and see, but I shall now suggest where it can be spent not only to greater social advantage but to the general advantage of the economy and the nation.  I am suggesting the gradual abolition of death duties.  I notice in the tables furnished that a little over £3 million is provided this year in death duties.  It has gone up slightly from the previous <Col N="429" /> year.  On several previous occasions, I have made a case, from the national and social viewpoints, for the abolition of death duties.  I have suggested that it would be good for the national economy, that it would increase the revenue from income tax by inducing a large inflow of capital into the country.  That is what would happen if there were no death duties.  The money coming in would be available in a very easy form&mdash;not hot money&mdash; for investment in capital projects of a beneficial kind.  This is the Government's chance of doing it and I sincerely hope some Minister for Finance will take up this suggestion.  Of course, I am perfectly sure he will not.</P>
      <P>I have said that the abolition of the death duties would be of great benefit to the country generally, socially as well as economically.  I would advocate it on human grounds also.  Again and again over the years, I have drawn attention to the fact that whereas you will always find people to speak on behalf of the old age pensioners&mdash;it is always easy to make speeches about them: it does not require any great eloquence or command of language to paint a picture of their distress&mdash;you will seldom find anybody to speak on behalf of the people I represent, people who have very small incomes, who are living on fixed incomes, who have been living for many years since the war in conditions of extreme difficulty, in very many cases, extreme distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the person who will advocate their case?  I speak of the people living on fixed incomes flowing from the savings of their relatives&mdash; parents and husbands&mdash;over the years. The amount of the money has depreciated and the benefits accruing have consequently depreciated.  Taxation has increased and now we have added this 2½ per cent turnover tax.  I speak on behalf of self-employed people like myself who spent the best years of their working lives making provision for their families by way of policies of insurance and other things. They found in the years after the war, in the years of almost war or of uneasy peace, that the value of the insurance was depreciating.  When those people died, the money gathered up so providently <Col N="430" /> over the years came to the notice of the Department of Finance and a lump of it was taken in death duties, thereby eating into the provision those people made for their widows and children.</P>
    <P>I have recommended the abolition of these death duties year after year in every Budget.  Of course, it is not a very popular thing to do.  As I said, it is easy to speak for the old age pensioners, the unemployed and the workers, but there are very few of the type of person I mention who can get any advocacy on their behalf.  They are a section of the community who give good service to the country and who are required to make great sacrifices in the interests of the other sections. That is one of the reasons why I say this Budget is not fair in its allocation of benefits.  The people I have spoken about are not looked after at all, because, I suppose, politically they do not count.</P>
    <P>It is not quite clear what the scope of the corporation profits tax will be. In fact there is confusion there too.  I suppose it will become clear when the Revenue Commissioners and their officials adequately instruct the Minister. There is the question of the accounting date and I think Deputy Sweetman asked during his statement if this was a retrospective tax.  Personally I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister intended it to be a retrospective tax, but it is urgent that this matter should be cleared up in order to take away some uneasiness that exists in reference to the impact of that tax on the business community who will be affected by it.  I think this increase in the corporation profits tax is a bad thing.  I do not believe I am doing anything popular here&mdash;I have the firm belief that it will not gain me a single vote&mdash;so I can speak quite dispassionately.  Corporation profits tax is something that exists in the public mind as a proper tax on rich industrialists and business people.  So far as it is a tax of that knid, it is a proper tax, but, in fact, as it will operate in future, it will impact on smallish family businesses and it will have a further bad effect upon the economy as a whole even in regard to big businesses.  It is <Col N="431" /> going to increase again the cost of goods, materials and services.  It will increase the cost of living in some way. Any businessman listening to the Minister's speech could probably say: &ldquo;That is going to cost me an additional £40,000.&rdquo;  That is going to be passed on to somebody.  For the Taoiseach to say something which is extremely ingenuous is something I think cannot be accepted when he says:</P>
    <P>The increase in corporation profits tax had been decided on after very careful consideration by the Government. They had to give much thought to the effect that the higher tax would have on the realisation of the aim of economic expansion.</P>
    <P>At least we can take it that that very important item was considered.  It is in that context, and not in the context of appealing for rich industrialists, that I am criticising the imposition of this tax because I believe it will have a very adverse effect on economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>They believed ...</P>
    <P>I presume, the Government believed&mdash;</P>
    <P>... that the consequences would increase the pressure to maximum efficiency and secure the most economic working of undertakings so that the effect of the higher tax would be off-set.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Government were concerned as to whether the increase in corporation profits tax would have a deleterious effect on economic expansion and said: &ldquo;No, it will not; it will cause those fellows to work harder and they will have to find some method to increase efficiency to offset this tax.  Therefore, it is all right.&rdquo; That is, of course, all nonsense.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is on the effect of this Budget on the economics and prosperity of the country.  The aim of this Government, of all Governments, all Parties and persons in this House, is to increase expansion, expansion of trade and industry and particularly of exports. This is absolutely essential if we are <Col N="432" /> to survive but what incentives are there in this Budget for that?  The Minister in the final sentence recommended these proposals as something that would promote a higher rate of economic growth and lead to greater prosperity for the country.  So far from achieving any such purpose, it will act as a disincentive to further growth and economic advance.  Instead of increasing pressure to secure maximum efficiency as the Taoiseach said, in business concerns, will it not have the human effect&mdash;this is notoriously the thing economists and financiers overlook in their calculations&mdash;of making people say: &ldquo;Why should I work any harder for the Government?  When you are working on your own you work hard to gain money for your family and yourself.  You reach a point when you would be working for the taxpayers and you simply will not do it. You say: &ldquo;Why should I bother killing myself for that purpose?&rdquo; That is the human effect which is ignored by economists and financiers whose theories look good on paper or <i>in vacuo</i>.  But economic theories have a habit of going wrong, no matter how widely they are held by experts when they come up against the human effect and that is where this Budget will go wrong.</P>
    <P>If we are to survive or have any hope of doing so as a prosperous country and of increasing the standard of living, there must be what economists call and what is repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this statement, increased production.&rdquo;  We must have increased exports.  What is the use of saying: &ldquo;You must have increased production,&rdquo; if you cannot get the people who are to produce into the frame of mind in which they have some incentive for themselves to increase production which is so necessary?  These proposals will stop any such incentive. Why should a businessman say: &ldquo;I shall work harder for the Government?&rdquo; That is the popular phrase. What we want is businessmen, workers and every section of the community working, not for the Government, but for the country.  But the human reaction when increased taxation is imposed is to say: &ldquo;Why should I <Col N="433" /> work my fingers to the bone for the Government?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister appealed for what is now a cliché, &ldquo;wage restraint&rdquo; on the part of the workers.  In other words, the workers are not to ask for any more but the Minister wants money. He says: &ldquo;I want money and I ask the workers to work harder and to take less for their harder work.&rdquo;  What hope is held out in a Budget based on such a proposition as that?  We are asked to increase production at a time when it is insisted that increased production is necessary and the people who can give it are told: &ldquo;Do not ask for any greater share in the benefits that come by your increased production.  The Government want money.&rdquo;  This Budget will leave £6 million or £7 million for Government expenditure in the next financial year without any indication of how it will be applied.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that far from helping economic expansion and being really an instrument to increase expansion, this Budget will inevitably have the effect of slowing down economic growth.  It will inevitably increase the cost of living, increase taxation and increase the irritation of the taxpayers at having to pay increased taxation without any benefits, &ldquo;giving it to the Government,&rdquo; as the popular phrase is.  Therefore, I do not think there is any benefit from this Budget.</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall ask one more question in addition to the endless questions that have been asked about this taxation.  Apparently business people are to be made the instruments for the collection of this tax.  So far as I can see, that is the only method indicated in the Budget speech.  Businesses are to be registered and every business, small or great, will have to employ large or small staffs, as the case may be, to keep records for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The burden is placed on the business community, whether a huckster shop or a departmental store, to furnish returns so that this tax may be collected.  How will there be registration of the business?  My mind goes back to various sections in different <Col N="434" /> Acts of Parliament where registers have been set up.  Provision is carefully made by the parliamentary draftsman and passed by the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;it goes into an Act of Parliament&mdash;for the setting up and preparation of this register and there is one little subsection that invariably goes into it.  I want to know if it will go into this one.  Will the Minister for Finance be empowered to charge such fees as he thinks proper in connection with the maintenance of the register?  Will that be done in the huckster's shop and in the department store?</P>

      <P>I have always found it much easier to speak from the Opposition side of the House on a Budget debate and I suppose the members of the Opposition will at least agree with me on that point.  An Opposition speaker has only to sort out the unpopular points in a Budget, play them up to the public, stress them and condemn the whole structure of the Budget on account of those things which he knows are unpopular with the people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said here yesterday that tax is always unpopular.  It is very nice to stress it and to shed crocodile tears for the people who have to pay it.  It has been charged since man was first civilised in the world and I suppose it will be charged to the end and its unpopularity will continue in perpetuity. What is the purpose of tax? That is the point we have to come to.  Is it just for the amusement of the Government that it is charged?  An Opposition will of course carefully avoid tackling that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker, who usually makes a more balanced contribution to this or any other debate from the Opposition benches, made, I think, a reasonably fair speech to-day.  In fact, <Col N="435" /> it was the best vindication of this new tax I have heard from that side of the House.  Whether he made it consciously or otherwise I do not know but he certainly projected to me much more the image of the situation than the Leader of Fine Gael did&mdash;the person who is the leader appointed at the moment.  He wondered why this extra money was being collected.  In fact, I think his only condemnation of the tax was when he tried to enshroud it in mystery and bewilderment&mdash; which I shall deal with shortly.  That was completely untrue.  It is the very opposite, actually.  Deputy Costello wondered what the Minister would do with all the money collected when the tax would be operative for a full year next year.  Before he had been on his feet three minutes, he expressed ways and means of spending more than the Minister would collect next year.  He advocated increases for various groups of the social welfare classes&mdash;particularly the non-contributory widows' pensions.  Before he sat down, he cited the abolition of death duties as deserving of consideration which would absorb the full amount and more.  That goes to show that these taxes which are being condemned are not even sufficient to meet all the things the Opposition advocate for the people.</P>
    <P>It is a lovely thing to advocate all sorts of benefits, reliefs and assistance when one is playing the game in an irresponsible way, when one knows he is not called upon to meet the demands advocated and then, on the other hand, to play up to the section of the community who have to pay by condemning the means of collecting the money to do these things.  Deputy Dunne was in the enviable position of being able to advocate something for everybody and then to condemn the system by which the money is raised to pay for it.  It remains to be seen how far his statement will be taken seriously by any section of the community.  I suppose there will be that gullible section who will say: &ldquo;It is a pity Deputy Dunne is not the Taoiseach.  He has an easy way out for everything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure who said it but <Col N="436" /> I remember reading recently a statement by some world figure in which he said: &ldquo;Let us not try to tell the people there is an easy way out of any difficulty.&rdquo;  I suppose the greatest disservice we could do our people would be to create the impression that there is an easy way out because there is not an easy way.</P>

      <P>I am coming to deal with difficulties now and how they have been tackled in the past.  There are always difficulties and there always will be.  But let us not try to mislead people by saying there is an easy way, that there is some panacea.  It is quite easy to suggest there is&mdash;but nobody has ever successfully attempted to explain it.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one of the points Deputy Costello made.  In fact, the only feature of his speech to which one could take exception was where he tried to create the impression that this new turnover tax is creating bewilderment, confusion and that the people do not know how it is going to work.  If there is one thing to recommend it more than another, it is its simplicity.  It is 6d. in the £ tax on turnover on retail business.</P>
      <P>Any other tax that is collected in this country or any other country is a difficult tax.  The trader already has to keep books.  He has to make his income tax returns.  He has to claim his reliefs.  He has, if his volume of business is of any worthwhile size, to employ an auditor because the taxes he pays are difficult to assess and the returns he makes are difficult to make. There is no obvious difficulty associated with this tax.  The suggestion by a man who had been Taoiseach that it was not fully considered is, as he perfectly well knows, nonsense.  It has been thoroughly considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had the advantage of knowing the types of similar taxes <Col N="437" /> operated in many other countries.  For the benefit of the Labour Party, I should like to say that any forwardlooking, progressive country that claims prosperity seems to have a tax like this or something similar.  Deputy Costello admitted that when you go to the Continent, everything you do is taxed. If you buy a box of matches, their is a tax stamp attached to it.  When you pay your bill in a hotel, it is taxed. We return from these countries and talk about their prosperity.  We do not talk about the infinite range of taxes they have to pay.  For instance, Norway and Sweden, have a tax system most nearly similar to the one we are now suggesting and it does not seem to operate with any difficulty whatever. We very often draw comparisons in regard to the successful operation of Governments in these countries.  The advocates of the Labour people, particularly, use them as the criteria of a good Government but they do not for a moment think of mentioning how they finance the many welfare schemes they operate for the benefit of their people.</P>
    <P>The retail trade have under this Budget a tax of 2½ per cent imposed on them.  Those people who are members of the trading community are pretty intelligent sections of the community. They know perfectly well what is the position and they do not anticipate any difficulty whatever.  Furthermore, they know it will not be operated until November and there is ample time to have every little item smoothed out.  There is nothing being done in a hurry.  They know that when the PAYE scheme came in, the Revenue people did the greatest possible job of work to make it run smoothly and cooperated with every section in order to operate it smoothly.  We may expect the same again without doubt.</P>
    <P>The traders know something else. They can ask themselves what is the alternative to the 6d. in the £ which they will be called upon to pay under this Budget.  Let them ask themselves what they had to pay in 1956 when this country was plunged into a depression, when they went bankrupt in hundreds. That is the alternative.  Those were the steps taken then, when the <Col N="438" /> people who are talking about taxes applied a credit squeeze and put people out of business overnight.  They could lose ten times more in the one month than they will lose now in the entire year.  Ask a Dublin trader does he want the conditions of 1956 or does he want the system which will continue to provide the expansion and buoyancy of trade which he is enjoying at the present time.</P>
    <P>Those are the tests to apply.  Any trader will prefer to find himself in a position where he has to pay on an expanding business rather than the alternative of not having to pay on a declining business, which is the nightmare of Coalition memories.  This Budget is calculated to continue the expansion in our economy and I have yet to know the businessman, be he large or small, who will not settle for a continuing expansion of our economy and a buoyancy of trade at any time rather than a recession.  If we are to use the old conventional methods of meeting the situation and apply a credit squeeze, levies and the various things which contract distribution and shrink business, then there is really reason to be worried, when the Government find themselves in a position where they cannot give anything to the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello was very fair in admitting at the outset that he welcomed the provision made for the improvement of social welfare benefits in so far as we have gone in this Budget.  Some of the speakers who were afraid to say anything in favour of the Budget lest it would mean that they would fail to secure the full propaganda value out of their speeches when they have them published in the local papers, did advocate we had a long way to go before the social welfare classes have been anything like reasonably catered for.  That is exactly the position.  We could do much better but we can only go as far as the position allows and the people who are wondering about what we shall do with the extra money next year were promptly answered by Deputy Sherwin. We can find 101 things to do with it even in regard to the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> I could take a few items out of the Book of Estimates for this year which would provide a means of balancing the Budget.  Will anybody suggest we should do that?  This year in the Book of Estimates, approximately £40 million is being provided for agriculture, almost £2 million for tourism, over £3 million for forestry, over £21 million for our building programme. That does not relate to private building, except in so far as grants are concerned.</P>

      <P>We are spending over £29 million on Social Welfare. That sum does not include what will be spent under various other headings, such as fisheries.  Do we want to cut down on those items?  Not one member on the other side of the House will <Col N="440" /> stand for that for a moment.  As a matter of fact, every speaker has advocated further expenditure under each heading and can justify it.  We can on this side, too, and let us hope we shall have greater expenditure under these headings.</P>
      <P>Now let us talk about building.  I took it when Deputy Coogan asked about embassies that he was referring to the signs of prosperity here, to the very modern and palatial embassies being built by other countries, but it transpired that he was referring to embassies which we are building for our own representatives abroad.  That is a line Fine Gael dropped long before Deputy Coogan came to this House. There was a time when, if Fianna Fáil suggested taking a bend off a road, Fine Gael would talk about it as squandermania. Even when Fianna Fáil built the new offices in Kildare Street, they were condemned by the other side of the House as squandermaniacs.  The only thing they found wrong afterwards was that we did not build enough of them at the time.</P>
      <P>That kind of talk has long since been abandoned by the Fine Gael Party.  As long as we build in other countries for our representatives, I hope we shall raise a building that will be a credit to the country and that when our people go abroad they will not be ashamed to see an Irish representative living in a back street in some town, in some building not worthy of the high traditions of this country's architecture.  I hope they will have good Killybegs-made carpets, second to none in the world, in those buildings.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to productive development to-day.  The White Paper on economic expansion emphasises one important feature, that is, that as much of the public purse as possible be spent on increased production. If we impose this new turnover tax, it will be accepted immediately that the money is for that purpose. But we are not asking anybody to accept anything without explaining the details.  We ask those people who pretend they do not know to look at the Book of Estimates this year and see the schemes operated in respect of agriculture, industry and every branch of our economy.  Then they can judge whether or not we are spending the money for productive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition always try to pick out the unpopular parts of a Budget and attack them in order to blacken the whole structure.  This turnover tax of 2½ per cent. may be carried in one <Col N="443" /> way or another by the retail trade.  It is a matter for themselves how they offset that payment.  The Opposition have been seeking to stress what this means on every article sold in order to create an impression in the minds of the people that there will be an increase in the price of every item.  That need not necessarily be the case.  They may offset the payment in any way they wish.  They may reduce overheads. They may decide to charge something extra on a particular line of goods. They may decide to reduce their margin of profit in a particular direction. I know traders who will put up a sign in their shop windows saying: &ldquo;Prices here remain the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to suggest that there will not be any increase, but the tax does not mean that there will be an increase in every item.  I remember the Party opposite imposing taxes which had to be paid by the business community.  We were justified then in asking how much did that mean on the ounce of tobacco, the pair of gloves or the ounce of wool.  I know that for the purposes of political propaganda it would suit the Opposition to have the public regard this tax as the same as the sales tax they have in France, where everything you buy has a stamp on it showing the amount added.  It would suit them to have the public regard it the same as the tax in other countries where you get a ticket setting out, like a waiter's bill, the amount added in respect of tax.</P>
    <P>We have had the advantage of knowing the different types of purchase tax, sales tax and turnover tax operated in practically every country in the world. If we selected the one easiest to operate and causing the least upset, it is because we have had that advantage. Many States in America have a sales tax on every single item, including food.  We do not hear about the taxes they have in America; we hear only about their prosperity.  The prosperous countries all seem to operate a widelybased  tax in some form. In some countries, it is referred to as an added value tax.  This is where a tax is added at every stage from the initial production stage down to the counter of the <Col N="444" /> retailer.  It is a most difficult tax to operate.  But it is productive and it is considered to be equitable insofar as it weighs on the community.  This tax falls equitably on our community, no matter what anybody may try to say.</P>
    <P>Some member of the Hierarchy&mdash; I think it was the Bishop of Limerick&mdash; speaking a few months ago referred to a lot of overspending which was taking place.  I do not know whether that was correct or not but that was the statement he made.  He said there was too much overspending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At Government level probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was referring to the community.  If people wish to spend their money, let them.  That is always a sign of better times and it makes for distribution, but this is a means whereby they will contribute to the national wealth in tax and gives us a means of coming to the aid of the less well-off people, the old age pensioner, the unemployed and the needy. Mind you, when one looks at it in that way, it is a very fair tax, for the man who seeks to spend the most, pays the most, particularly the people who will spend on luxury goods and goods over and above the essentials of life.  The man on a county council wage of £6 10s. or £6 15s. a week who will contribute about 1/6d. or 2/- in this tax will, in 99 cases out of 100, find it more than offset by the benefits we have given.  If he has children, it is offset; if he has aged parents living with him, it is offset; and if he becomes unemployed at some stage, he finds that he gets more.  From every aspect, it cannot be regarded as anything other than an equitable tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let us emphasise that we do not expect it to be a popular tax&mdash;no such thing as a popular tax has yet been devised.  No tax is popular and no tax ever will be, but the only means whereby a Government can come to the aid of sections of the people, the only means by which they can give incentives to the various schemes that promote employment and which expand the economy is by taking the money in taxes from the community. <Col N="445" /> The best they can do is to seek to take it in the fairest means possible, a means that is widely distributed and equitable to all sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Murphy to say something about housing and I do not think I could say anything more definite in that respect than what I have said previously.  It could not be said too often.  What I said is that if you want to know what the present building programme is to-day, compared with what it was prior to 1957, ask any building contractor in the 26 Counties.  I am prepared to stand by that as the test.  You can go further and ask any builders' provider, those who provide building materials, and I am prepared to accept their answer in every solitary case.  That amply disposes of any taunts anybody may make with regard to building. The same may be applied to every other section of the economy, which brings me to the important point at which I set out.  If the traders had a choice today to go back to the conditions which they enjoyed prior to 1957, or to have the conditions of our expanding economy supported by the present sales tax or turnover tax, they would gladly accept the turnover tax in preference to the recession, the credit squeeze and the bad memories of prior to 1957.  We know they would rather it was not there but since they know why it is there and what the future outcome will be, I know they will gladly co-operate and accept it for what it is, a means whereby we may continue the expansion of our economy and the improvement of conditions for every section of the community.  No speaker on the other side of the House has advocated meeting the position by any other means.  With the exception of Deputy J.A. Costello, they all have condemned the tax and at the same time, have advocated further improvements under various headings, in particular under social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest vindication of the tax was found in the speech of the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, when he asked what would we do next year when we would have collected over £10 million, which for a moment implied that we were collecting money <Col N="447" /> unnecessarily.  Before he sat down, he had suggested matters which were crying out for this extra money which we would have collected next year. His only regret was that his advocacy of these things would fall on deaf ears.</P>

      <P>That was the greatest vindication of the new tax that anybody could have made and it could not have been repeated more frequently, having regard to the fact that every speaker from the other side of the House has made the same speech since the Budget was introduced. Deputy Coogan's practice is to look up the debate of last year and to repeat it.</P>

      <P>That is not a bad practice, when one understands his position.  The salient feature of the Budget is the new turnover tax. Nobody expects that the people who will pay it will welcome it but I have been in touch with traders around the country since the Budget was announced and they seem quite happy to know that we are not heading for a position such as we experienced prior to 1957.  The less well-off sections of the community are happy to know that anything extra they may be called upon to pay is more than offset by the benefits we are giving them.  We are all happy to know that there are indications of a better future, an impetus in the expansion that is already taking place and that we can face the future with courage and confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday last, the Minister for Finance in introducing the Budget said that its main purpose was to promote national progress. He has gone about that by introducing an innovation in the tax <Col N="448" /> system, which he has termed a turnover tax.  Naturally, the debate on the Budget has centred around that tax because it is something new, something we had never heard of before in our tax system and until very recently, something we thought would never arise.  The title &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; tax is most appropriate because it represents a complete turnover, in the tax system operated by Governments since the State was founded.  Years ago, it would have been impossible to visualise the introduction of such a tax.  If, as mentioned by the ex-Taoiseach, he had resorted to the imposition of such a tax in 1956, one can imagine the comments that would have been made by the present Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is more or less suggested by Government speakers, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that this new tax is something to be proud of, something that we should congratulate ourselves on planning, something that should have been in operation years ago but which, unfortunately, we did not think of until this year.</P>
      <P>What is the main feature of this new tax?  What does it ask the people to do?  It asks the people to hand over to the Exchequer £11 million.  That is an undeniable fact.  That fact is stressed in the Budget Statement. Eleven million pounds is a big amount of money in this country.  It represents a contribution of £4 per head of our population, man, woman and child.</P>

I said that, according to the Budget Statement, it can be assumed that the tax will bring in £11 million and I have said that, on our economic standards, £11 million is a sizeable figure and represents a contribution of £4 per head of the population of something more than 2¾ million.</P>

      <P>It arises out of the statements contained in the Budget speech.  The Government having looked for £11 million, we may ask what is the necessity for this money, where is it going, what sections of the community will benefit, what sections of the community will pay it?  The answer to the last query is quite obvious.</P>
      <P>We are told that a percentage of this money will be devoted to increasing social welfare benefits.  It has been stressed during the course of the debate that social welfare benefits have been increased regularly in recent years but if one examines the figures, one finds that the proportion of tax revenue devoted to social welfare is being steadily reduced and is much less than 20 per cent. of the total tax revenue at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach yesterday made a strong point in support of this tax when he said that there are great and exciting prizes to be won.  If we pay this tax, as we must pay it, according to what the Taoiseach told us yesterday, there are great and exciting prizes to be won.  He did not tell us what the great and exciting prizes are likely to be.  I cannot visualise what form they will take.  The Taoiseach kept that a secret.  He did not elaborate.  To judge that statement, we must go back to the statement which has been referred to on several occasions in the course of this debate, made by the then Deputy Lemass prior to the 1957 election. He told the people that great and glittering prizes were available if they did one thing, that is, if they elected a Fianna Fáil Government.  As everyone knows, mainly as a result of that promise, an overall majority was secured by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this morning.  I was sure that after years of waiting we were going to get an explanation of this statement made by the Taoiseach in 1956.  Deputy Colley referred to these &ldquo;hoary old statements&rdquo;, such as the <Col N="450" /> one about the 100,000 jobs, being trotted out here time and again.  I thought when he referred to this &ldquo;hoary old statement&rdquo;&mdash;it is his description of the statement the Taoiseach made in 1956&mdash;that he would tell us something about it, that he would give some explanation.</P>
    <P>In examining the economic position of the country this year, we must take into account what has happened in past years.  Everybody knows that instead of there being 100,000 new jobs available in this country, the Taoiseach's car has gone into reverse gear.  Instead of moving ahead to provide 100,000 extra jobs, it has reversed, and there are almost 100,000 fewer jobs in the country at present than we had when that &ldquo;hoary old statement&rdquo; was made.</P>
    <P>We cannot refrain from mentioning that statement in the House and, in the course of this debate, a somewhat similar statement, but in more vague terms, was made yesterday by the Taoiseach about the great and glittering prizes that were to be won.  I am very doubtful, and I am sure the people are very doubtful, about the great and glittering prizes that are to be won if we are to increase production, contribute £11 million, keep our mouths shut, and let the Government move along as they think fit.  It is quite obvious from the number of errors made by the Government in recent years, not the least being the blunder they made about the Common Market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the course of this discussion, if Deputy O'Connor will bear with me, I will elaborate more than they elaborated in their statements.  The most peculiar feature about this new tax, and the Minister's <Col N="451" /> announcement of its introduction, is that there has been a complete changeover from the procedure adopted in past years.  Before the Minister introduced his Budget in past years, people could only guess at what new methods, if any, of raising revenue would be devised.</P>
      <P>The Irish people were not left to guess anything this year.  It was made an open secret months before the Budget that this turnover tax, or as it was then termed, this sales or purchase tax, would be implemented.  The purpose of doing so was, to use an Eastern-European term, to brainwash the people so that they would not be suddenly struck with it when the new method of taxation was introduced.  It is most unusual for the Minister and the Government to make their plans public months before the Budget is introduced and so much so that the national newspapers were able to give a reasonably good account of what would be contained in the Budget. That should never happen in any country.  It would not have happened here, were it not that past conventions were thrown overboard and this type of Budget leakage was wilfully brought about by the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>We have to examine how the £11 million is to be expended.  I have already mentioned the social welfare benefits and I suppose the next section of the community that should be mentioned is the agricultural section.  The farmers are amongst the hardest workers in the country.  A big number of the small farmers have to contend with uneconomic holdings and labour under many disadvantages such as shortage of capital and so on.  Even though this Budget Statement is a lengthy document, a very insignificant part of it was devoted to the farming community.  Incidentally, they got no increase whatsoever from the Budget.</P>

      <P>Statistics show us that the number of people engaged in agriculture is steadily declining.  The explanation of that is quite obvious. Agriculture does not now offer those engaged in it a reasonable return for their work.  In a large part of this country, along the western seaboard, from Donegal to the Cork coast, you have an area of land which is of indifferent nature and a big percentage of which has little productivity potential.  Naturally it is difficult for the farmers and their families to make a reasonable living from these holdings and the tendency is for them to leave these holdings, and a big number of them in the south have left the country also, because there was not sufficient work available for them in other industries in the towns and villages.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the new venture of the sugar company will be helpful in keeping an additional number of these people on the land and that it will arrest the steady decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture.</P>

      <P>The bulk of the money will be paid back to the <Col N="455" /> Exchequer through the levy of 1¼d. a 1b. on butter.  The Minister and the Government should have dwelt more on the needs of the agricultural community when drawing up this Budget. It is all very well for the Minister to say that they are giving £40 million to agricultural interests.  A good part of that money has been given towards the eradication of bovine TB which has been forced on us by marketing conditions in other countries.  It is a good thing to get rid of bovine TB but, despite the considerable help given towards it, the farmer has still to make his own contribution which is a substantial one.  When a farmer sells a reactor to the Department, he has to find the difference between the price of the animal he has sold and the replacement.</P>

      <P>It must also be remembered that the report of the Milk Costings Commission indicated very clearly the differential between milk production costs in the different parts of the country.  That report cost the Exchequer over £40,000 and the Fianna Fáil Government consigned it <Col N="456" /> to some annex because they did not like it.  It indicated that the cost of milk production varied from 1/5d. to 2/9d. a gallon but the Government thought that the men who brought in that report should be confined in institutions which I will not mention. They did nothing about the report despite the fact that the West Limerick by-election was fought on it.  That election was fought on the milk costings report because the Fianna Fáil Party alleged that the inter-Party Government then in office were afraid to bring forward the report and were delaying its publication.</P>
      <P>I want to return to this turnover tax. A number of speakers, who have been able to give a much more impartial view of it than the Government side, have painted a reasonable picture of what that tax will mean.  When, for example, the Minister buys his <i>Irish Press</i> on 1st November next and reads the death column announcing 40 deaths, he can say: &ldquo;I am up another £40 or thereabouts.&rdquo;  That is so because the burial services, the provision of the coffins, hearses and so forth, will be subject to this 2½ per cent tax.  Is that correct or is it not?  Imagine a Government in 1963 imposing a tax on burial services.  This is the note of sympathy which Deputy Dr. Ryan will send out to the relatives: &ldquo;I will have my whack out of your bereavement.  If the coffin costs £20, I will get 10/-; if the hearse costs £5, I will get 2/6d.&rdquo;  I think it is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That gives some idea of how this tax will operate.  Tea and sugar, bread and butter, drink of all description, all types of essential foodstuffs, are to be taxed, as well as what can be described as luxury goods.  When this leak was made by the Government, when we were told beforehand of the imminent imposition of this new tax, it was implied it would be confined to goods used mainly by the better-off sections of the community.  None of us believed or imagined it would be a tax on bread and butter and in fact, on all household commodities.  I am sure when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach told us it was a better system than that adopted in 1956, he had his <Col N="457" /> tongue in his cheek, because if the Government then were to introduce a tax like this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I spoke some time ago about the difficulties of small farmers and others and I must now refer to a Parliamentary Question I addressed to the Minister yesterday relative to the operations of money lenders in this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach stated today that we were a very well off nation, that there was an increasing expansion of the economy and so on. Whether that is correct or otherwise, it does not take away from the fact that on 31st December last, according to the information given me yesterday by the Minister, the Irish people owed to hire purchase companies £31,900,000.  That is a big sum of money, almost £11 per head of the population, owed to hire purchase companies by the Irish public.  It is a serious matter that requires close consideration by the Government in the not too distant future.  Let us forget the Fianna Fáil nonsense about how well off the people are now.  The fact is that they owe £31,900,000 to moneylenders. The people who owe that money are mainly workers who require autocycles to take them to work, small farmers who may require some additional implements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but a big part of this £31,900,000 relates to agricultural equipment.  I have no doubt about that.  Although the Agricultural Credit Corporation are empowered to give loans for agricultural purposes, they require the submission of title deeds, solvent sureties and yards and yards of red tape must be cut, so that eventually the applicant gets tired of waiting and falls into the trap set for him by the hire purchase companies all over the country.  In many cases, he does not realise what he is appending his name to.  The position is that most of these companies, on a simple interest calculation, actually charge more than the 39 per cent interest permitted.  In fact, as far as I can see, they are permitted to charge 100 per cent interest if they like.  In his reply to my question yesterday, the Minister said this:</P>
      <P>There is at present no State restriction on the amount of interest that may be charged on private or hire purchase loans.</P>
      <P>He qualifies that by saying that if they charge more than 39 per cent, you can go to the courts and the courts will not allow interest at more than that percentage to be charged.  Everyone knows people do not like going to the courts against moneylenders, so that safeguard is not worth mentioning. I am now asking that a closer watch be kept on those moneylending firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a noteworthy feature of the Minister's reply that banks in this country own, partly or wholly, five of the moneylending companies or HP companies&mdash;they are all the same, irrespective of what name you apply to them.  I should not like this position to obtain with the honest man down the country who may be short of capital for some work or other and who goes into a bank which may wholly own one of these moneylending <Col N="459" /> or hire-purchase firms and asks the bank manager if he can be accommodated to the extent of £100 or £150 to buy a cow or two, or a machine, or perhaps a tractor.  I can visualise the bank manager saying that they could not lend out money that way, that they had to satisfy the directors of the creditworthiness of the client and adding that at the same time, they could facilitate him by recommending him to one of their hire-purchase companies who would give the money without the difficulty the banks would impose if they were to examine his application.  Naturally, the man would be delighted and avail of the loan not from the bank but through the bank from the hire-purchase company. Everybody knows the difference in the interest rates is enormous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a trivial matter to be dealt with flippantly.  There are people held by these firms to the extent of almost £2 million, and I know young fellows working very hard trying to earn money to keep up payments to hire-purchase companies.  I hope the Department will examine the moneylending facilities.  It is good to get money when required and to have loan facilities for people who can put the money to good use.  What I am against is the exorbitant rate of interest charged generally.  The State should step in when the rate is considered exorbitant.  If a man is credit-worthy enough to get money from a hire-purchase firm through a bank, he should be credit-worthy enough to get the loan direct from the bank without hire-purchase. Do not stop the lending of money to people who can use it gainfully and well, but at the same time the State should have regard to the position at present existing to ensure that people will not be fleeced&mdash;I do not think that is too strong a word&mdash;in the interest rates charged.  I ask the Minister for Defence as a member of the Government to bear that in mind and if it <Col N="460" /> is raised at some Government meeting, it would be no harm.</P>
      <P>I do not want to misquote any statements made by the Acting-Chairman at the moment, seeing he cannot very well reply to them.  In the course of his remarks, he thought up a very easy way of finding this £11 million. He said cut-price competition would do the job; that the consumers would not be charged the two-and-a-half per cent on the box of matches, the butter, tobacco or cigarettes, that prices might not be increased at all and that there would be so much competition that demand and supply would manage the whole business.  The bulk of the tax would be paid by the traders themselves and the ordinary man in the street would hear nothing about it. To use a mild word, I thought that was an out-of-the-way approach.  The Minister must get £11 million.  Everybody knows there is cut-price competition between shops today and the net result will be, if we may anticipate the future, that small shopkeepers will be wiped out.  The big combines employ very little labour, a few boys keeping the shelves filled, an overseer and a few girls at the counter.  When you deal in the self-service store, you are helping to pay the overhead costs of these buildings which are exceptionally light.</P>
      <P>I believe the other small traders have sufficient problems to meet at the present time without, as Deputy Colley suggested, taking on the payment of this tax themselves.  Shopkeepers are finding things difficult.  There is a change in marketing conditions and whether we like it or not, supermarkets are growing and I believe are likely to grow.  Possibly you will have a supermarket in all towns of populations of 2,000 and upwards and perhaps even where there are lower populations.  Naturally, some of these existing stores in the smaller towns are financed and helped for the present, at any rate, by big combines in the hope that all local competition will be wiped out and that if losses are sustained, they can be wiped out and can be recouped later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unfair system of trading when&mdash;and I know this to be the case&mdash;a store sells an article at a price <Col N="461" /> less than was paid for it to the manufacturer.  That is a proved fact. This unfair competition focuses attention on a particular store where, for instance, you can get a packet of biscuits for threepence or fourpence less than in the ordinary shop.  Immediately you are drawn to that store like a magnet and possibly eventually become a regular customer.  I believe the shopkeeper is entitled to a fair profit for his work and to enable him to pay staff reasonable wages and leave a reasonable return for himself. While we like prices to be competitive, we feel every man is entitled to a fair deal and fair trading.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the disablement allowances be increased by 2/6d. a week from 1st of November.  These are paid by the local authorities to those who are receiving benefits at the maximum rate.  That was the provision in the past and it resulted in West Cork, so far as the majority of cases was concerned&mdash;and I believe it happened in East Cork also&mdash;that only those receiving maximum allowances got the additional halfcrown.  All the others had to submit to a rigid investigation, as a result of which a big number did not get the additional 2/6d. I think the term &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; should be removed from the Minister's statement in page 32 of his speech where he says:</P>
    <P>It is again proposed to provide for increases&mdash;of the infectious diseases allowance by 2/6d. a week for a person without dependants and by 5/- a week for a person with an adult dependant, and of the disabled person's allowance by 2/6d. a week on the maximum rate.</P>

      <P>In most of these cases, they got nothing.  We discussed this several times in the health authority in West Cork without any satisfaction and I ask the Minister to remove that word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; because it will deprive people receiving lesser amounts than the maximum of this extra benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy from South Kerry was <Col N="462" /> worried about my statement about the number of unemployed but I think there is nothing in this Budget which will expand the employment potential, nothing likely to provide extra jobs. It is regrettable that we have not an inter-departmental committee with representatives, particularly from Departments employing labour such as the Department of Lands, the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Local Government and any other Department that gives employment to see what new works and what new jobs could be provided.</P>
    <P>In general, few, if any, want to see a labour exchange.  What they want is employment.  Workers would prefer to be employed rather than be forced to go to the exchange for unemployment benefit or assistance.  With our relatively small population of three million, I believe some schemes could be devised between the different Departments and between the heads of the Departments whereby we could provide full-time employment.  That was the position obtaining in Britain up to quite recently.  Full employment was available there.  Not only were they able to cater for their own population but they were able to help us in catering for a substantial section of our population as well.</P>
    <P>Everybody appreciates the position of a worker in part-time employment. You must have some type of permanent job to feel safe, to give you security.  A large number of our people have to get along with temporary jobs. They go along to the county council engineer today for a job that may last a month.  They go to the forester for part-time employment, and so on.  That system is out of place.  We should try to provide for our people productive schemes that will give full employment. In that way, we would save large sums of money at present paid out by the Department of Social Welfare. Mention has been made of progress in Western European countries.  We should have schemes such as some of those which operate in those countries which would enable our people to have full-time employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> The Parliamentary Secretary made some reference to fisheries.  Reading this statement from end to end, one notices that there is no mention of the fishing industry.  The Government and the Minister completely forgot about fishing when compiling it.  We have stressed the value of fishing to many people resident on our excellent coasts. In my constituency, a large number of people engaged in fishing at one time and a reasonable number are at present engaged in it.  So far as I can see, no mention was made of the fishing industry in that lengthy statement and I think it was completely out of place that some reference to that important industry was not included.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, we have too unwieldy an administrative system here.  The administrative staffs of public offices are exceptionally large.  We have large numbers of people in big jobs, and so on.  Whilst we do not want to take jobs from anybody, I think the statement on page 25 of this statement that a big percentage of our income goes towards administrative costs cannot be overlooked.  We all know that a big percentage of that amount makes up the salaries of very highly qualified men who are in receipt of very high salaries.  When the Minister asked where savings would be effected I wonder if that field was combed properly. Would it be possible to find some economies in that field?  Could we not have a better system of coordination between the top officers of the different Departments and avoid the duplication of inspectors and inspections?</P>
    <P>Speaking about inspectors and inspections, this will be a difficult time for our shopkeepers.  They are warned in this Budget that they will be subject to close inspection by officers of the Minister's Department.  Whether it be to inspect their returns so far as the payment of the turnover tax or income tax is concerned, we are going back again to the days of inspectors and inspectors to inspect the inspectors.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle we view this Budget, from that of the worker who is getting a few shillings which are offset by the increases or of the <Col N="464" /> person who is getting no encouragement so far as the prospect of additional employment is concerned or of people who are unemployed or of people who have members of their families ready and available for work, there is no great encouragement.  Take the farmers, particularly the small farmers around our coasts whom I have spoken about.  There is no great encouragement for them.  There may be some encouragement for the big farmers about whom Deputy Fanning was interrupting.  I know they are completely different from the type of people we have in West Cork.</P>
    <P>With regard to the industrial sector, we have had statements in this House from some members of that sector that the Budget will be no help to them but rather a big hindrance in the promotion of additional employment.  I hope that will not be the case.  We should like to see industries, whether publicly or privately owned, expanded. However, when one hears Deputy Dockrell say that that is not likely to happen under this Budget, we must be warned.  People conversant with all aspects of our industries and industrial development cannot commend this Budget.</P>
    <P>We feel that the section of the community likely to be the hardest hit are the shopkeepers, small and large, and business people who, from their own resources, will have to provide figures for the Minister's Department and make returns regularly once a month. The Minister says this tax should not cost more than one per cent.  He is probably correct.  He has in mind to ask the shopkeepers to collect it, to do the book-keeping, and so on, from their own resources, and to make returns to the Department.  Then there will be inspectors to ensure that they are doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>I conclude by voicing my opposition to this Budget.  Our economic state did not warrant the introduction of this new type of tax on all commodities to be purchased, irrespective of what they are&mdash;food, drink and so on.  As I have said, even without our knowing it, we shall have to pay this tax.  It is rather peculiar that we had not more exceptions <Col N="465" /> and that certain commodities such as food were not excluded.  Despite all the fine phrases used by the Minister and other members of the Government to describe this brand-new  turnover tax, I think it will be very difficult for the Minister to sell it to the Irish public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The great defect of this Budget is that it does nothing to promote economic expansion or to provide what is necessary in the economy, if the country is to meet the competition which is inevitable in future world trading.  It does nothing to provide for an increase in employment or for an increase in production.  It is a negative Budget with a negative, depressive approach, where the approach should be positive, progressive and expansionist.</P>
      <P>This turnover tax imposes taxes on a limitless range of commodities, food, clothing, fuel, drink, cigarettes, and so on.  These will all increase in price from November.  What effect will this have on the ordinary domestic outlay of families?  What effect will it have on the consumer price index?  Has any estimate been made of the increase in the cost of living which will result from the turnover tax?  The tax will hit all sections.  It will hit especially families with children because it is a tax on food, clothing and fuel.  An obvious defect in this tax is that it may start the old familiar cycle of a rise in the cost of living followed by wage demands.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the direct consequences of this tax, I have tried to discover what the Government's policy in the matter is and I have related what has been done in respect of this turnover tax to what was published in <i>Economic Development</i> in 1958, which says at page 22:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A general purchase tax, for instance, would have an immediate reaction on sales of Irish products but would probably in the end, have inflationary effects on wages and salaries and the cost of living.  It is desirable that taxes on spending should bear most heavily on less essential imports as this helps to ensure the retention at home of as much as possible of the stimulating <Col N="466" /> effect of capital formation on employment.</P>
    <P>It went on to say:</P>
    <P>Unless our tax is relatively light, this country can scarcely hope to attract foreign capital, enterprise and organisational competence.</P>
    <P>That was published in 1958 and it was the considered policy of the Government announced as a <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>In 1956, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, expressed opposition to the proposals in the then Budget because of the number of commodities that were included in the tax proposals.  At Column 621, Volume 157, of the Official Report of 17th May, 1956 he had this to say:</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that most people who have written upon the theory of public finance subscribe to the view that the number of separate taxes should be kept as few as possible, that the State should rely for the bulk of its revenue on a few main taxes and should not try to multiply the number of separate taxes.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason for that.  It is undesirable that the hand of the tax-gatherer should be brought into business.  The number of businesses subject to the regulation which is necessarily involved in the collection of taxes should be kept to a minimum.  Government intervention for tax-raising purposes in any business always results in waste and is a cause of higher costs as well as of higher prices.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is obvious to expect that the smaller the yield from any tax the higher will be the proportion of that yield absorbed in collection expenses.  And, the wider the number of taxes, the greater the prospect of successful evasion by individuals.</P>
    <P>That is a very emphatic refutation by the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, of a proposal to tax in 1956 a relatively few commodities.  This proposal, as I have said, broadens to an almost limitless extent the range of commodities <Col N="467" /> available for tax and puts the hand of the tax-gatherer into the pocket of every shopkeeper and every businessman, whether big or small, and also, as Deputy Murphy remarked, makes not only the cost of living more expensive but, for the first time, the cost of dying as well.  It may be truly remarked that in this Budget the hand of bureaucracy is in every home from the cradle to the grave.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged in defence of this tax that it does not fall unduly heavily on essential commodities, that traders will impose this tax only on luxuries or non-essentials.  How is that related to the statement included in the speech of the Minister for Finance that if this tax excluded food, clothing and fuel, a tax of 2/- in the £ would be needed to bring in a comparable revenue?  Of course, the two do not tally.  It may well be that in a shop that sells, say, certain types of hardware and also sells electrical goods, radios, television sets and so on, the tendency will be naturally to transfer the incidence of the tax to the less essential items, but what about the shops which will affect the bulk of the people, the shops where the vast majority of the purchases of essential goods are made and which, according to the Minister for Finance, will be affected because if the tax had excluded food, fuel and clothing, it would require to be raised to 2/- in the £.</P>
    <P>In regard to commodities such as butter, essential groceries, there is no method of transferring that tax to other commodities.  It has been suggested that it may be transferred to selected tinned foods.  If these selected tinned foods are luxury or semi-luxury goods, goods not consumed more than once or twice by a family in a period, that will absorb some of the tax but nowadays a very large proportion of foodstuffs is sold in pre-packaged containers and it is obvious that if a grocer is to recoup himself, he must recoup himself by passing the tax on to the customer.</P>

In 1960 the increase in fixed capital assets in the same set of industries accounted for £10.3 million out of the total of £23.6 million for all industries and services.

      <P>Following is the information requested by the Deputy as at 30th March, 1963 :&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Irish Government security for advances under subsection (7) of Section 3 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957, totalled £4,812,840 as follows:&mdash; Certificates of Indebtedness for: £1,567,500 at 3½ per cent per annum; £3,012,800 at 4 per cent per annum; £232,500 at 5 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>(2)  Nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  I have no information under this heading other than in relation <Col N="471" /> to securities for advances made to me under the International Finance Corporation Act, 1958, and the International Development Association Act, 1960, which totalled £201,544 as follows:&mdash; Certificates of Indebtedness: Under the International Finance Corporation Act, 1958: for £118,500 at 4 per cent per annum; under the International Development Association Act, 1960:</P>
    <P>for £54,000 at 4 per cent per annum; for £15,500 at 5 per cent per annum; for £13,500 at 3½ per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The statutory form of accounts as laid down in the Central Bank of Ireland (Form of Statement of Accounts) Regulations, 1961, does not provide for the indication of Irish Government securities held in the General Fund.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest paid on certificates of indebtedness is fixed at the time of borrowing by reference to the short-term interest rates then prevailing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is correct that customs and excise revenue combined in 1962-63 fell short of Budget estimate, as amended on 14th June 1962; by what amount; and how he reconciles the shortfall with the increase in the estimated receipts from these duties for 1963-64.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1962/63 customs and excise revenue combined (other than excise revenue from the motor vehicle duties) fell short of the Budget estimate, as amended on 14th June, 1962, by roughly £3¼ million.  The factors <Col N="472" /> contributing to this shortfall were referred to in my Budget speech.  The estimated receipts for the current year from these duties show an increase of roughly £3¾ million compared with the actual receipts for the year just ended.  This represents an increase of about 4½ per cent.  Which can be attributed to normal buoyancy and does not call for any special explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why there is the normal buoyancy to which he refers when in fact there was a substantial drop and shortfall last year?  The two things do not correspond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One fairly important factor last year was forestalling, which will not be a factor this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there no other large factor?  Would the Minister like to give me an indication of the approximate amount of duty he felt he lost by forestalling last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My own estimate would be something like £1½ million.  That is my own estimate; I did not get it from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why an emergency lorry service has not been provided to Clontarf and to Coolock-Raheny, County Dublin, having regard to the large concentration of population in these areas, which are further from the city centre than other districts which have been provided with emergency services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was saying that this Budget imposes additional burdens without providing any incentives and I asked the question: what does the Budget do to provide an incentive for industrial or agricultural expansion?  The publication <i>Economic Development</i> published a little over four years ago expressed the view on page 24 that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopes of reducing taxation are, however, being thwarted by the <Col N="488" /> yearly increase in debt service and other charges.  As a result, not only is the entry of foreign capital, enterprise and experience being discouraged but home industry and trade are being deprived, by high taxation, of the capital and incentive to pursue a vigorous programme of modernisation and expansion, a matter of particular concern because of the adjustments required by the prospects of freer trade in Europe.</P>
    <P>That was all prior to the increase in taxation levied in this Budget.</P>
    <P>The two factors which affect industry so far as taxation is concerned in this Budget are the increase in surtax and the limitless tax involved in the turnover tax in respect of an unnamed or an unnumbered variety of commodities and services.  The Budget, instead of preparing the country to meet the new trading arrangements involved either in ultimate membership of the EEC or some other trading arrangement, has made no alteration in policy or no change to meet the situation, with the one exception that the introduction for the first time of the turnover tax introduces a tax similar to that which operates in continental countries.  That surely is a doubtful advantage.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Budget is negative and depressive and provides no incentive.  <i>Economic Development</i> to which I have referred expressed the view that:</P>
    <P>The positive objective of financial policy must be to arrive as quickly as possible at the point at which it will be possible to give the economy the tonic of significant reduction, above all, in direct taxes on incomes, profits and savings&mdash;</P>
    <P>and it went on to say that it &ldquo;should take precedence over any reduction in indirect taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The total capital Budget this year shows a substantial rise, a rise of £14.56 million over last year.  This substantial growth in capital expenditure, while welcome as an objective, will pose the serious problem of securing the necessary finance to undertake it, the necessary finance not only for the current year but for the continuing projects in the years ahead.  The burden <Col N="489" /> of the national debt and the finances necessary to meet it have increased at a staggering rate and now involve an estimated sum for the service of public debt, in the current financial year, of £38,289,000 compared with £22,900,000 in 1958.  This increase is an inescapable burden of a permanent character and requires the closest scrutiny to ensure that capital expenditure is directed exclusively to essential productive needs and for socially necessary and other similar essential services. With the decline in population and the continued high rate of emigration, despite the spurious claims of Government spokesmen to the contrary, with the increased trend away from agricultural employment and the inability of industrial and other employment to absorb those leaving the land, the maintenance of the capital development programme is becoming a major problem.</P>
    <P>The figures available would indicate that the number securing employment in non-agricultural occupations is not sufficient to absorb the number leaving agricultural employment.  I have here the estimated number of persons at work in non-agricultural activity.  The total for 1962 was 708,000.  These figures, of course, are provisional.  The figure for agricultural employment was 360.8 thousand, making a total of 1,068.8 thousand compared with&mdash;and this is a fact which should be borne in mind when claims are made for the success of the policy of the Government&mdash;a total number in employment in 1956 of 1,127.3 thousand.  Compared with 1956, there is a drop in those in employment of over 58,000.</P>
    <P>What I want to urge on the Government is the necessity to channel capital development into essential services, first of all, productive services and then socially desirable or necessary services such as housing, hospitals or similar categories.  There is general agreement on the objective of developing our resources, developing the productive capacity, by expanding services such as electricity supply, providing better roads, improved drainage, and so on, but in the provision <Col N="490" /> of socially desirable services such as housing there has been a very serious decline in the last few years. The figures show that the number of dwellings erected by local authorities fell from 4,000 in 1956 to 1,463 in 1961.  So far as the provisional figures would indicate, there was some improvement last year.  At the same time the number of dwellings erected by private persons with the aid of State grants under the Housing Acts fell from 5,300 in 1956 to 3,895 in 1961 and the number of dwellings erected by Dublin Corporation dropped from 1,564 in 1956-57 to 277 in 1960-61.  Again, the provisional figures would indicate an improvement last year.</P>
    <P>It has been announced that it is proposed to establish a National Advisory Council on building.  This idea is generally welcomed.  In fact, it was suggested a considerable time ago but nothing was done about it.  Surely, however, in this matter the State and State bodies should set an example? There is, as the figures I have given would show, in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and other urban centres, a long waiting list of families living in overcrowded, unsuitable and unhealthy dwellings.  Many of these families have been many years on the waiting list for accommodation.  At the same time, the State and State bodies are building expensive, elaborate emporia, many of them being constructed simultaneously, few of them providing an incentive for economic expansion or contributing to the development of the economy.  These are merely staff buildings. Nobody could seriously suggest that they improve the efficiency of the undertakings.  I yield to no one in my admiration of the efficiency of State bodies like the ESB, the Sugar Company or other organisations that have been established but there should be a rational approach to the building problem, a rational approach to the capital needs of the country, particularly when we relate that programme and the effect on the economy to the need for more houses in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and other urban centres.</P>
    <P>I speak more familiarly about my <Col N="491" /> own constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the fact that I get representations from persons looking for houses in Dublin also means that I am reasonably familiar with the circumstances there.  The need to channel essential supplies and to press on with the building programme so far as housing is concerned should take precedence and absolute priority over any of these other projects.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, essential that some rational approach should be made to the building of headoffices or other office accommodation by State and semi-State bodies.  In that regard, it would not interfere greatly with the efficiency of the running of the Dáil if the programme for a new building were postponed or at least extended so that not all of these projects would proceed simultaneously because the situation is that capital is both scarce and difficult to secure.  The dramatic drop in the number of houses being built has not merely aggravated the position but has extended by years the length of time each family and individual applicant will have to wait before being accommodated.</P>
    <P>A definite social advantage would accrue by giving absolute priority to housing, hospitals and other necessary and urgent social requirements and by postponing and planning on a rational basis the building of new offices and other accommodation for State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech made only a passing reference to trading arrangements and I want to enquire what plan, if any, the Government have decided upon for the future trading arrangements of this country.  Is there any policy or is everything in the melting pot since the failure of the Brussels negotiations?  References which the Minister made were vague and indefinite.  What are the Government going to do about revising bilateral trading agreements?  Will we make a direct approach to the countries with which we have bilateral trading agreements, the principal one, of course, being our trade agreements with Britain?  In addition, we have a <Col N="492" /> number of other trade agreements with Continental countries.  All of these agreements have now been in operation for many years, in some cases without any modification and in others with only slight changes.</P>
    <P>The phrase in the Minister's speech, &ldquo;... the Government will do all in its power to secure, in bilateral or multilateral arrangements, improved openings for our exports, particularly agricultural exports,&rdquo; in effect, means little.  Are we going to pursue our application to the GATT or are we going to consider further the question of EFTA, particularly the revised EFTA arrangements which may come into effect or, as I say, are we going to revise the bilateral agreements with Britain and the continental countries?</P>
    <P>The recent announcements resulting from the EFTA discussions which took place in February would appear to indicate that the EFTA group are now considering, if not the inclusion, certainly the question of extending some of these advantages to agriculture. Comment was made in the March, 1963, <i>Banking Review</i>, and reference was made to EFTA membership.  It is stated on page 19 of that review:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it must be noted that Denmark, in particular, is pressing for wider exports to the United Kingdom. British Government spokesmen have already indicated that it might be possible to give additional concessions to Denmark without conflicting with the Commonwealth position in the British agricultural market.</P>
    <P>That, I believe, poses very serious problems for this country.  A recent announcement of the revised British quota for butter indicated that the Danish quota is about eight times our quota.  From recollection, the figures are that Denmark will be entitled to 96,000 tons this year compared with a quota for this country of 12,000 tons. There is little use in establishing bodies like Bord Bainne or any other State organisation unless we secure either from their direct intervention or from bilateral or, if possible, wider multilateral trading arrangements, a <Col N="493" /> market for the commodities we have to sell.  Deputy Norton said that increased butter production is now the enemy of the taxpayers because a heavy subsidy has to be provided.  I believe we should be far more alert and far more active in our approach to this problem, and I believe we should have at least observer status at the EFTA discussions.  The trading arrangements existing at the moment will not remain static indefinitely. While it may well be that ultimate membership of the EEC offers the best prospect for our economy, with Britain as a member also, nevertheless the very substantial change that has occurred in the EFTA discussions and the fact that we are committed to a policy of tariff reduction must be a consideration.</P>
    <P>Here again I believe it is vital that we should consider most carefully proceeding unilaterally with tariff reductions without getting some <i>quid pro quo</i> in return.  It may well be that it will enable us to become more competitive and efficient, but if we revise the tariff barriers either bilaterally, or better still, by some multi-lateral agreement, it may well happen that we will have given over some of the bargaining power we possess, although admittedly in some respects it is not particularly strong.</P>
    <P>I believe we should think very seriously before we reduce our tariff arrangements unilaterally or consider them in conjunction with entering further bilateral discussions with countries with which we have agreements. Alternatively, we should endeavour to be associated in some way with another multilateral arrangement which may flow from EFTA or a combination of the EEC and EFTA countries.  At any rate, the prospects for our trade are so serious and the prospects of the effect of those changes on our economy warrant that we should ensure that we at least have observer status at the discussions in order to be fully and accurately informed on whatever action may flow from those talks.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks yesterday, the Taoiseach expressed satisfaction at the fact that it was possible <Col N="494" /> to increase social services in the Budget. Everyone welcomes an increase in social services but the credit which the Taoiseach sought for the increase in social services would be more impressive if there had not been an equally steep rise&mdash;in fact, a very sharp rise&mdash; in the cost of living over the past six years.  In 1957, the figure for the consumer price index was 135.  The figure for March of this year showed that it has risen to 160.  In addition, increased taxation has been imposed on a variety of commodities: petrol, oil, tobacco, transport charges, bus fares, and so on; so that a great number of people have to pay not merely for the increased cost of living but in addition, for many other charges as well.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would claim that the increase in children's allowances and in non-contributory old age pensions will compensate for the rise in the cost of essential commodities and in the cost of living which will flow from the turnover tax.  There is, however, a particular section of the community that I believe has been forgotten, not only in this Budget but in the past few Budgets.  I refer in particular to retired personnel who will be severely hit by the turnover tax as well as by the rise which has already taken place in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Many of those people live on fixed incomes, either from pensions which have a diminishing value or from a pension and some income accumulated from past savings and at present invested.  They have got no allowance in the Budget to alleviate the additional burden which will be placed upon them by the proposed turnover tax.  Numerous cases are brought to my attention of persons in that category. Their pensions are treated for taxation purposes as earned income and they get the earned income relief, but many of them have accumulated some small savings and the income derived from the investment of those small savings is regarded as unearned income, and consequently the tax payable is higher.</P>
    <P>In recent years in Britain, the unearned income allowance was brought up from £600 to £800 a year. <Col N="495" /> I believe there is a very strong case for bringing up the limit here.  It would not cost a great deal of money and it would alleviate real difficulties and, indeed, real hardship in some cases.  We must remember that those persons are outside any social welfare benefits.  In most cases, they are also outside voluntary health insurance because they were too advanced in years when it was introduced.  Consequently, they are liable for tax as far as their income from earnings are concerned at the unearned rate.  They are not entitled to social welfare benefits or to participate in the voluntary health scheme.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a very strong case to be made in this connection. I have raised this matter on previous Budget discussions and on the Finance Bill, and if we compare the position of these pensioners with that of pensioners in Britain, we find that there is a still stronger case.  Naturally, most of these people are elderly and are incapable of earning anything extra through any position they may obtain.  They are beyond their capacity to work and few of them are able to undertake any part-time employment to supplement their pensions.</P>
    <P>I want to advert to a remark made by the Taoiseach in yesterday's debate which has been the subject of such comment and which probably shook some of the more lethargic Deputies in their somnolence.  The Taoiseach said that the economy should take a swing to the left.  This statement was probably made for the purpose of making a verbal concession to socialist theoreticians who may find temporary consolation in it.  It probably does not mean very much because, to satisfy the subscriber to the Party funds, he went on to say that it was not intended further to develop State intervention in industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Norton has said, it was only an oratorical pronouncement.  It was an attempt to <Col N="496" /> get the best of both sides.  It is well recognised that Governments, in order to retain support in a democracy, must keep to the left of centre.  The strongest example of that we have had in recent years has been the case of the Conservative Government in Britain.  Since the war, they have taken a decided left of centre approach.  That was necessary because of the great change-over after the war, the advent of the Labour Government and increased nationalisation and the fact that it was essential to keep public support by not nullifying any of the schemes introduced by the Labour Government.</P>
      <P>That was described in Britain during Mr. Butler's period as Chancellor of the Exchequer and when Mr. Gaitskell was alive as Butskell, which was regarded as a combination of Labour and Conservative policies.  The Taoiseach made verbal concessions in that direction, probably with his eye on North-East Dublin, but I do not think that means anything.  This country has operated for many decades a successful combination of private enterprise and State endeavour. I believe that is a sound and progressive programme which has returned the best dividends to the country.  It might be described as a pragmatic approach to the matter but it is the way in which it works and how it works that matters.  For that reason, I believe these verbal concessions mean very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want to see here is a progressive programme of development initiated and continued.  I was interested to hear the Taoiseach speak yesterday on proposals with regard to education which the Minister for Education proposes to make in the near future.  I have expressed the view that in the future this country must depend to a far greater extent on educated personnel, personnel technically trained, skilled personnel, personnel who have been trained to adapt themselves to meet the new situation.  We have few natural resources here except the land and any natural resources we have such as hydro-electric possibilities have been developed or are in the course of <Col N="497" /> development.  Compared with other countries, we have no great resources of raw materials or minerals capable of exploitation.</P>
    <P>We are, however, endowed with a people of high intelligence and considerable natural ability who are capable of being trained to a high degree of skill if they are afforded the opportunities.  They are highly adaptable and, when provided with the opportunity of education. have distinguished themselves in many spheres at home and abroad.  It is therefore right that compared with the subventions for other purposes, we should consider whether we have provided a comparable increase in the subventions for education.  By any standard, it will be seen that the investment in education in this country is materially less.  If we take the total sum provided for educational services in the year 1930-31, we find that it amounted to £4,697,000, or 21 per cent of the total Supply Estimates.  Thirty years later, in 1961-62, the total amount for educational services was £19,500,000 or 30.4 per cent of the total Supply Estimates.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, since the war there has been a far greater extension of expenditure in other spheres and the growth of State enterprise and State investment has meant a great increase in State expenditure.  Nevertheless, we find that 30 years ago, we spent 21 per cent of the total Supply Estimates on education and last year we spent only 30.4 per cent of the total for that purpose.  If we are to avail of our investments in the promotion of industry and exploit them to the full, we must depend for that exploitation on the competence and skill of the people who run these industries.  We must ensure that we can exploit that to the full and the only way it can be done is to increase the expenditure on education.  In France, the expenditure on education is expected to double over the next decade.  In Britain, the Robbins Committee Report which is expected shortly will, according to anticipation, produce revolutionary changes and it is likely that vast sums will be spent in Britain on education in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I shall revert now to a point I <Col N="498" /> made earlier, and it is here that we differ from the Taoiseach's view which is that as long as we are spending money, no matter in what direction we spend it, some of it will either return as taxation or will be brought back in some other form.  I believe it is vital that because of the shortage of capital and the heavy burden being imposed on the State through the necessity to service the debt, we should plan out clearly and in defined channels the role which State expenditure is to play so that productive enterprises will have priority, so that housing, hospitals and other services, education and its ancillary services, will get priority.</P>
    <P>Because of our limited national resources, we must train and equip our people to overcome the handicap of the lack of these resources so that we may exploit the skill, ability and adaptability of our people.  Great stress has been laid in recent years on the need for competitive efficiency, on the application of technological and scientific knowledge, in order to meet the challenge of our competitors, so that this country may be enabled to export goods and produce competitively against the best offered elsewhere. This can be done only if those who leave our schools in the future are better educated, better trained and equipped to meet the competitive skill and efficiency which the country must meet from outside.</P>
    <P>One matter I wish to refer to is the effect of the proposed turnover tax on betting.  I have already asked the Minister what was the estimated yield last year from the betting tax and he replied it was not possible to give an estimate. I think it should have been possible to do so because ample records exist of betting transactions. Betting transactions, as far as the revenue authorities are concerned, should be available from two sources: they have available the turnover accounts of betting in so far as betting shops are concerned and also the course betting and the totalisator betting in returns by the Racing Board.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it should have been possible at least to give an estimate of the amount secured from betting. Since <Col N="499" /> there is not, I want to give the Minister what I believe to be reasonably accurate figures and to raise at this stage the wisdom, or indeed the equity, of the proposal to apply this turnover tax to betting.  As I understand it, the total sum betted in betting shops is approximately £10 million. In respect of the sum betted with the totalisator and on the courses with bookmakers, that also reaches something like £10 million.  The Racing Board impose a levy at present on course bets of 2½ per cent, and make a deduction also in respect of totalisator bets.</P>
    <P>Those who are not familiar with the matter will consider that if anything is to bear a new tax, betting, which is non-essential, should surely do so.  We must remember, however, that already there is a direct tax on bets in betting shops and a deduction by the Racing Board in respect of totalisator bets and a course levy in respect of course bets with bookmakers.  I mention that so that those who are not familiar with it will understand the position.  Bloodstock, both breeding and racing, is one of the most valuable industries in the country.  It has a great many advantages. It provides a valuable export trade and gives considerable male employment, dispersed over a wide area&mdash;male employment, one might say, in many counties, spread over a number of establishments in a way that is most desirable and beneficial to the economy.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board last year contributed a sum of £250,000 in stakes. In addition, a contribution of £50,000 was made in respect of the carriage of horses to race meetings.  That, in round figures, is a total of £300,000.  In addition, stakes were augmented by contributions from owners and from executives&mdash;the authorities who run the racecourses.  All that was insufficient in the view of the racecourse executives to attract runners and to promote the welfare and expansion of the industry, which in recent years has been supplemented to a considerable extent by sponsored races.  Last year, on the basis of the existing levy, made up of a deduction from the totalisator and a levy of 2½ per cent on racecourse <Col N="500" /> betting, the Racing Board did not secure adequate revenue to meet the continued outgoings in respect of stakes and the carriage of horses.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge the Minister to reconsider this aspect of the turnover tax.  As I say, betting shops are taxed heavily already; the totalisator makes a deduction; and there is a 2½ per cent levy in respect of course bets.  The existing revenue in the industry is inadequate to meet the necessity to keep stakes at their present levels, and with the rise in the cost of running and maintaining racehorses and keeping them in training, it is not possible for the industry to run itself at the level at which it should be run if it is to attract the world-wide reputation which our bloodstock is attracting, particularly with the advent last year of the Irish Sweeps Derby.  Some years ago, during our term of office, when a discussion arose in respect of the sum levied on the Racing Board, it was stated the levy would be for a limited period only.  There was considerable opposition to the levy and the present Minister dropped that deduction when he came into office.</P>
    <P>This proposal will mean a permanent levy and in view of the figures I have quoted, which can be verified easily by the Minister, there is a great need to maintain this industry at the very highest level.  Even without this extra imposition, it will be difficult to maintain the present level because of increased costs, bigger outgoings.</P>
    <P>A development in recent years has been the expansion in the consumption of Scotch whisky in this country. I draw the Minister's attention to the need for expanding the output and encouraging our own domestic whiskey trade.  In the publication <i>Economic Development,</i> reference was made to brewing and distilling and at page 170, it was remarked that in the post-war period, exports of whiskey grew steadily from 1948 to 1951 reaching a peak in the latter year of 438,000 gallons, valued at £558,000.  It went on to say they declined steeply in the next three years but have since begun to recover.  The decline, I believe, was due to very heavy taxes which Deputies may recollect were <Col N="501" /> imposed in the 1952 Budget but what I want to direct the Minister's attention to is the increase which has occurred in recent years in the import of spirits from outside and the fact that this increase would indicate a very substantial trend in that direction, without any comparable expansion in home production.  In 1957, the total quantity of whiskey imported was 65,390 gallons but in 1962, it had risen to 151,000 gallons, while at the same time home production had only increased from 561,370 to 601,800.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention and effort is devoted to encouraging enterprise and industry and in assisting in its promotion.  This is an old-established industry which provides, like the bloodstock and breeding industry, male employment.  It draws its raw material from home sources.  It is eminently suited to the country and it has achieved a very good reputation for quality.  I believe we should examine the situation to see what measures are necessary or what steps can be taken to promote expansion of exports of our whiskey and to see what other factors contribute to the increased import of foreign-distilled spirits.</P>
    <P>The last comment I want to make is on the proposal in the Budget to tax conacre.  This should provide for the exclusion of widows.  Many widows, with or without families, but particularly those with young families, are unable to run farms and the only source of income they have is to let the land. The Finance Bill should expressly provide that these people will be excluded. They should be allowed to let land in conacre if they have no alternative source of income and it would be a definite hardship to make such a letting subject to tax.</P>
    <P>These are details that will be discussed between now and the Finance Bill but they certainly warrant serious and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an ádhbhar seo. Every sane, thinking person realises that a Government is expected to pay its way. There is only one method of doing that and it is the traditional one of imposing taxation to ensure that sufficient money <Col N="502" /> goes into the fund to provide for the various schemes a progressive Government would undertake.  This year is no exception and the Minister for Finance was faced with the need to find some means of providing sufficient money to ensure that at the end of the year many worthwhile schemes could be pushed forward and, what is also very important, that they could be paid for.</P>
      <P>He is providing up to £40,000,000 for the farmers.  Over 30 per cent of the people are engaged in that very important industry and I am sure nobody will say he is outstepping himself in that respect.  Farming is a very difficult occupation which depends even at home on weather conditions and abroad on fluctuating prices for farm produce. We must sell in highly-competitive markets abroad any surplus produce. we have and we must sell most of our farm produce in the cheapest market abroad in England.  Consequently, we have to subsidise some farm products and therefore for the present at least farming is a rather difficult occupation and must be helped by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>However, from this Government down the years, farmers received many concrete forms of encouragement.  In this way, they are given subsidies on fertilisers and every encouragement possible to improve the buildings on their land, improve methods of production and in general increase their output so that they will measure up to the high standard of efficiency required on the modern farm.  One of the most recent features of this is that the encouragement goes to the good farmer rather than to the lazy, indifferent or careless one.  As in other professions, we have some of those among the farming community and as a rule it is not among the smaller farmers they exist.  Nobody could question the wisdom of providing this amount of money for that very important section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is needed for education too. The previous speaker made some reference to it.  We know that any community, in order to survive and push ahead, must have education and money must be provided to ensure that those wishing to avail of education in wider fields will have an opportunity of doing <Col N="503" /> so.  Many of the old, dilapidated schools handed down to us must be replaced.  New national, vocational and secondary schools are springing up and they all expect grants.  The Government have no way of getting that money but by taxation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Education will very soon make a statement on this subject because I believe there is some overlapping in what we might consider as three watertight compartments in education in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government should be very much concerned about the housing or the people and this Government has at all times put housing as one of the principal planks in its platform.  We know that a people well housed are, in the main, a contented people.  Good housing contributes much to the good health and wellbeing not alone of the individual but of the community as a whole.  Very often it cuts down expenditure on medical services, hospitals and such institutions.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see any cutting down whatever, despite what other people might suggest, on this housing programme.  It should be the aim of the Government to continue steadily and progressively whatever building programme is in hands until every family in this country is housed in a reasonably healthy home.  To do that, money is required.  I should hate to see the people in my constituency return to the state of affairs which existed in 1956 and 1957 when the housing programme there, and indeed all over the country, collapsed for want of funds.</P>
    <P>I have been in close contact with many merchants who were owed as much as £3,000 because no money was available to pay the grants.  In my constituency, by a majority vote of the then county council, on which the Coalition Parties had the majority, overnight, in the middle of winter, the housing programme was scrapped. Many families were caught out badly at that time.  Either they had to abandon hope of a new dwelling or they had to proceed with its construction although they had not the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the demand for more and better telephone services.  In most parts of the country today we can see roads being torn up to ensure that underground cables and sufficient lines will be installed to cope with the demand.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is tackling that backlog of applications in a very efficient manner.  So much for houses, for education and for telephones.</P>
      <P>I could also refer, if I so desired, to the amount of money made available for land acquisition, for forestry development and to forestry development itself.  I could refer to the various schemes this Government have in mind and intend to carry out, such as better roads, fishery development, mining and industry but this may not be the occasion.</P>
      <P>This Budget provides many increases for the less fortunate citizens of this country&mdash;the old, the infirm and the very young. In the past four years, on the occasion of every Budget, Fianna Fáil increased the old age pension. This time, they have gone a step further.  Whereas hitherto there was no allowance for the first child, now 10/- a month is provided under the Children's Allowances Scheme.  For the second child 15/6 is provided; for the third child 22/6&mdash;an increase of 4/6&mdash;is provided; for the fourth child 26/6 is provided and for the fifth child 26/6 is provided.  Nobody can argue that these are not very substantial and important increases and that to give them it is not necessary to find the money.</P>

This is a practical way of doing it.  It is the way the old age pensioner will appreciate better than quite a lot of political lip service at chapel gates, and so on, bemoaning that nothing has been done for them. This is the place to do it and this Government, through a wise system of taxation, are providing the funds necessary to do it.</P>
    <P>It is almost certain that there will be an increase probably of 5/- in the contributory pensions.  We are not prone to boast about our accomplishments. We look towards the future.  Nevertheless we must be pardoned if we refer, for a moment, at any rate, to some of the records which some of the others have created during their time in office.  The last speaker mentioned betting, horses and so on.  It is not so long since there were catcalls arising out of the purchase of Tulyar, something that was intended to help the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>It is true in regard to both occasions but especially after the last occasion when the Coalition were in government, that they left the country in a deplorable state financially and not alone that, but the confidence of the people was gone and they were leaving by day and night.  Fairminded people will admit that there has been a vast change.  People can see everywhere new buildings being erected, new roads being made, more telephone services being provided, new schools, new factories, new houses being built, more forestry on our barren hillsides, more land being divided and progress being made in all sectors of the economy. That is the acid test of progress, the benefits which can flow to any community from having in office a Government who know where they are going, a Government united in their approach to the various problems which arise and a Government who are not ashamed or afraid to make unpopular decisions and to impose taxation so as to ensure continuation of the various services which are in existence and so as to enable the creation of greater employment and more opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for <Col N="508" /> Finance on his new turnover tax.  He has departed from traditional methods of taxation and it was a brave and bold step for him to take.  Had he been selfish, he might have taken another line.  However, one thing is certain, regardless of what Government are in office, the man who has charge of presenting the Budget in future will find that, due to the action of the Minister, there will be no unbalanced Budgets.  This new method should bring in the necessary revenue and enable this Government to continue the many worthwhile schemes which they have promised and have been carrying out down through the years and which will lead to a better standard of living for all our people.</P>

      <P>To anyone who looks back on the last few Fianna Fáil Budgets, this Budget comes as no surprise.  It follows the usual pattern of asking for substantial increases in taxation, giving very slight relief by way of social welfare benefits.  At Budget time, we have to listen to Government speakers referring to prosperity and the improved times in which we are living and which are the result of their term of office.  The previous speaker was an example of that but it is our job here in the Opposition to bring the Government spokesmen down to earth at least once a year.</P>
      <P>We must face the facts and the record of the Government.  There are 60,000 fewer in employment today than there were when Fianna Fáil took office in 1957, and we heard from a speech on Tuesday that 19,000 fewer were employed in agriculture in the past 12 months.  Therefore, we can see what effect the Government's policy has had on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that we in the Labour Party in the autumn of last year introduced a measure to the Dáil to make work on the land more attractive. We got no support at all for that measure.  Its purpose was to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board and give to the agricultural worker the protection of the Labour Court.  If that measure had succeeded, I believe the decline in agricultural employment which is going on at present would <Col N="509" /> be lessened considerably.  Even though there was an increase of 7,000 in nonagricultural employment in the past year, the fact remains that there has been a net decrease of 12,000 in employment and it is no excuse, as the Minister has tried to say during the Budget speech, to say that the bad weather had a lot to do with it over the past few months.  The figures show that there are over 4,000 fewer in employment in April this year than there were in April last year and over 5,000 fewer in April this year than in April, 1961.  There is no justification for any complacency in that respect. The figures show that 5.7 per cent of the insured population was unemployed. It was suggested that that percentage was nothing to be alarmed about but when the figure in Great Britain reached four per cent, it was considered most alarming.</P>
    <P>As well as the unemployment record of the Government, there is also the emigration problem.  When the Minister stated in his Budget speech that emigration last year was down to 20,000 people, he sounded happy about the position but I cannot see how anyone can be happy when there are still over 400 people per week leaving this country.  There are no really worthwhile plans by the Government to solve these problems of unemployment and emigration.  In my constituency, two flour mills were closed during the past 12 months and there was no provision by the Government of some other source of employment for these redundant workers.  The Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce just said people were not eating enough flour and that was that.  We feel that some action should be taken as a result of closures such as that of flourmills in rural districts.  Ignoring such developments will only result in a continuation of the flight from the land and the general emigration trend.</P>
    <P>We had the Government's White Paper on incomes.  Sufficient has been said about that already in a previous debate, but it is well to mention that, while that document was concerned with the effect on the economy of high wages, there was no reference whatever <Col N="510" /> to the tens of thousands of underpaid workers throughout the country. They are no concern of the Government whatever.</P>
    <P>Another record as a result of Fianna Fáil's Budgets has been the record increase in prices over the past few years.  The consumer price index rose by at least 4½ per cent last year.  Therefore, the benefits which last year's Budget gave to the old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients was more than swallowed up after a few months.  We have also the difficulty of being unable to obtain a steady increase in exports, even though our labour costs are very small compared with those of other countries.  Lack of Government policy in this respect caused this drop.  The Government are calling on the workers to close the gap which the Government themselves, in pursuit of their own policy, have widened.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the steady increase in social welfare benefits over the past few years, but ignored the more than steady increase in taxation over the same period.  The relief granted in social welfare benefits is a very small fraction of the increase in taxation imposed on the public. Since 1958, tax revenue has increased by about £35 million.  The amount of that increase devoted to increased social welfare benefits has only been about £2 million.</P>
    <P>The most striking feature of the Budget is the proposed turnover tax. Already we have a high percentage of indirect taxation.  This measure has been welcomed by all the Government speakers.  It has been said that Labour Governments in other countries favour indirect taxation and that the Labour Party in England favour this form of taxation.  That is completely wrong and misleading.  The position in Britain is that about 40 per cent of taxation is derived from indirect taxes. The Labour Party have always opposed taxation on essential foodstuffs, clothing, fuel and shelter.  They pioneered the present system of agricultural subsidies in Great Britain which has the effect of making foodstuffs <Col N="511" /> cheaper to the consumer than they would otherwise be.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party strongly oppose this imposition of a 2½ per cent turnover tax because it will definitely penalise the lower income groups.  It is no harm to recall the effect this tax will have on the everyday commodities people must buy.  It will mean about 2½d. extra on a stone of flour; 1½d. on a 1b. of butter; 1d. on a 1b. of sausages; 2d. on a 1b. of tea; 1d. on cigarettes&mdash;I could go on and on.  It will mean a higher cost of medicines and nourishment for the sick and poor.  It will mean increased fuel costs.  The application of the tax might also mean that many shop assistants could become redundant, because some of the larger shops are going to get this money by cutting down on staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the tax would increase competitiveness among shopkeepers, but competitiveness now means cutting down on staff and saving in every direction, usually to the detriment of the workers.  That aspect of it is therefore very serious and shops which at present employ large numbers of married men, and which already have serious difficulty in competing with shops who do not employ help, will be seriously affected by this tax, as will their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administrative cost of the tax is said to be less than one per cent, which is not surprising because it will be the shopkeepers who will do most of the administrative work.  One of the brightest features of last year's Budget was the speech made by the Minister for Transport and Power in which he explained the provision in that Budget for the reduction of ESB charges.  We all listened quite happily to him and went back to our constituents and told them that the special charges were being abolished and that the people in the rural areas would get supplies at a reasonable charge. Not alone did that fail to materialise but in a good many cases the <Col N="512" /> charges were increased.  As a result of this Budget, the charges will be increased again.  The good effect of last year's Budget which the Minister for Transport and Power envisaged did not materialise and now the ESB charges will rise again because of this 2½ per cent tax.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increases in this Budget, the old age pensioners were due at least an increase of 5/-.  They were due 5/- last year but they got only 2/6.  Possibly this 2/6 is the balance due to them so that, in effect, they should get at least 7/6 this year. Apart from the increases which the extra taxation is going to levy on the people, we must remember that, as I said, the price index figure has risen by over 4½ per cent during the past year.  An old age pensioner must spend at the very least £3 to £4 per week just to keep himself in the bare necessaries so that this increase is more than swallowed up by the increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spoke a great deal about savings but during the next five or six months, there is going to be a rush of buying.  Savings are going to be raided and there is going to be stockpiling.  People will raid their savings and buy whatever they think they will need in the next 12 months, before November 1st, so that there will be the opposite effect to what the Minister desired.  In last year's Budget, the tax on dancehalls was abolished.  I, for one, thought that this would result in a decrease in the admission prices to dances and that is why I did not oppose the measure in my speech on the Budget then.  The result has not been a decrease in admission prices but in fact prices have risen considerably during the past 12 months.  The people who go to dances, and they are people of all classes, have not benefited by the abolition of that tax.  That tax should not have been taken away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to fear for the employment of the <Col N="513" /> people working in dancehalls.  There was, I think, last year, and there was fear for those employed in the cinema industry.  I agreed wholeheartedly, and still agree, with the relief for cinemas.  With the greater competition from television, there was and still is danger of unemployment and redundancy in the cinema industry but nobody can say that there is this danger in the dancehall industry.  I can safely say that over the past five years the number of dancehalls has nearly doubled.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, I should like to make this remark.  When the result of the vote on Resolution No. 13&mdash;the Resolution giving effect to the 2½ per cent tax on everything, including food, clothing and so on&mdash;was announced the other day, there were clapping and shouts of glee from Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I think the putting on of that tax was a very sad event, and not an occasion for clapping or shouts of joy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>About three or four days before the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget, the Taoiseach made one of his rather long and woolly speeches in Dublin in which he said it would be necessary to increase the national income by £30 million to enable the people to enjoy the standard of living to which they were entitled.  He was making that statement in defence of one of the numerous White Papers that have been issued by the Fianna Fáil Government, in defence of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  It is worthy of note that if the Taoiseach intends to increase the national income by £30 million, one would have imagined that the Minister for Finance, when he came to make his Budget speech, would have given us some plans in regard to how the national income was to be increased.</P>
      <P>I do not want to weary the House by quoting very much from the Minister's speech but at page 45 of the Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be indefensible in our circumstances to introduce a tax which might threaten the prospects <Col N="514" /> of expansion of particular industries, or their very existence, and bring unemployment in its train.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is going to expand the national income by £30 million.  The Minister for Finance is on record as saying there will not be any taxation that will in any way affect expansion or create unemployment.</P>
    <P>The first thing to consider is the corporation profits tax.  The Minister for Finance looked surprised at the applause he got from those behind him when he finished his Budget speech. Does any reasonable Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government or any reasonable Deputy of the Government Party think that the increase in corporation profits tax, an increase in taxation of 50 per cent on all corporations, will not affect employment or industry as a whole?  It stands to reason that it will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is a better fiscal expert than I am.  He quoted figures to show that some corporations would be asked to pay tax to the extent of some £30,000 a year.  Is it not reasonable to assume that if they were not paying that tax that money would be ploughed back into the industry for the benefit of the industry and employment therein?  Despite that, the Minister says at page 45 that he will not do anything that would in any way interfere with expansion or employment.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the turnover tax. Great play has been made by the Fianna Fáil Party both before and since the Budget to the effect that there is no extra taxation on anything. In effect they are going to collect from the corporation profits tax, which will be damaging to industry and trade as a whole, enough money to carry on <i>pro tem</i> and on 1st November they will tax the things in respect of which they themselves have said taxation had reached the point beyond which they cannot be taxed to produce a reasonable return&mdash;petrol, whiskey, beer, cigarettes&mdash;every conceivable article. It is a good thing that there is an Opposition in this House to speak up and make it clear to the public how they are being gulled in this matter. It is absolutely certain that from 1st <Col N="515" /> November that taxation will be imposed, if this Dáil continues beyond that date.  Many people begin to doubt that it will; they think that is the day on which the Government have decided to get out and leave the wreck they have created to their successors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you getting worried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is worried.  If they remain in office, from that day on, every conceivable article will be taxed in spite of all the long and woolly speeches made by Ministers at chambers of commerce and so on to the effect that this is a Government that is making a drive to expand and increase exports, that we are living in a competitive age, that when the free trade area comes into being we must be competitive and face up to competition.  By this Budget they are doing the best they can to prevent in every way the expansion of our trade and exports.  That is the sorry record before the House.  The taxation imposed in this Budget is the highest that has ever been levied by a Budget introduced in this House and that is saying a good deal because Fianna Fáil have blistered the people from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education must have studied these things more closely than I have.  He must have discussed them in the Cabinet.  I am sure he will agree with me that, if this tax were operative in a full year, £12½ million extra would be taken from the consumer. In a competitive age such as we are in at the moment what the country needs is remission of taxation and a reduction, if possible, in national expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for responsible Ministers to come in here and to say, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, &ldquo;We have to get the money.  Where else could we get the money?&rdquo; What do we want all this money for? Why do we want to increase national expenditure?  If a Government which professes to be an adherent of private enterprise, want to establish and assist private enterprise the right way to do it is to reduce taxaction, <Col N="516" /> to reduce the burden on the people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening the Taoiseach was quoted even in his own paper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> as saying that the Fianna Fáil Government are going to the left.  What exactly that means, I do not know. Does it mean that we are going to have more State enterprise?  Does it mean that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be sent into this House with more Bills like the Irish Steel Holdings Bill, which he brought into this House the other day, asking for a further £2,000,000 capital expenditure on a firm which he could not give us any indication would be likely to produce a dividend or to compete in ordinary commercial circles?  Are we going to have an influx of such Bills? This is a serious problem for the country.</P>
    <P>I agree that we have to be competitive. I agree that we are living in a new age.  We are living in the age of free trade.  Even though the European Economic Community negotiations may be in abeyance for the time being, as certain as I am standing here, sooner or later we will have to face competition with other countries.  The United States of America, the most heavily protected economy in the world, into which you could not get a bantam's egg without having to pay a tariff on it, have decided to re-orientate their policy in regard to tariffs.  Trade discussions are shortly to take place under the Trade Expansion Act with a great many countries in respect of which the United States of America are dropping tariffs. They have done a <i>volte face</i> in regard to the tariff protection system behind which they have worked over the years. We have to work in free trade conditions and to do so our industries, private firms and even State industries must be put in a position of advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries.</P>
    <P>This Budget does not contribute towards that idea.  It does the direct opposite.  Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the Minister for Education, who is here now representing the Government, how do the Government propose to expand national income by £30 million?  There is nothing in the Budget Statement to indicate that <Col N="517" /> there is any plan good, bad or indifferent, to increase exports, to secure further trade, to expand agriculture, to expand industries, to secure new markets for exports.  There are no funds available.  There is no suggestion that ours is an expanding and increasing economy.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for Deputies on this side of the House to ask where are the Government going, what is their policy, have they any overall policy to meet the difficulties that every economy has to face today?  There are potentials for increasing exports and trade but there is no indication in the Financial Statement or in anything that any Minister or Fianna Fáil Deputy has said so far that Fianna Fáil have any plan by which to expand the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the requirements necessary for expansion.  One is a free inflow of capital.  More important than that is the retention, by every possible encouragement, of the currency, the funds, available to us in this country. It has been the habit of the farming community to place sums of money on deposit in the banks.  Everyone will agree with that.  It is the usual policy of the farmer, if he has £1,000 or £2,000, or even a smaller sum, not to invest it but to place it on deposit in the bank from which he can withdraw it any time he wants it.  He has hot money or fluid cash at his disposal. For that reason, the commercial banks have had considerable sums of money at their disposal and they have helped Government loans by producing the funds and credit necessary for the expansion of what is called the social infra-structure.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have been told that it is necessary for the banks to disclose what money they have at their disposal and the rate of interest paid on it.  That is a complete innovation and I assume the reason for it is that the Government are desperate for money and are looking around to see who else they can tax to get more money into Revenue to go on with what is called their policy.</P>
    <P>Has it occurred to anyone that in introducing this complete innovation, <Col N="518" /> they may frighten people away from putting money into the banks?  It is a fact that since that statement was made, there has been a flight of capital out of the country because people do not want to run any risk.  Heretofore, when that money was invested, it helped to build up our economy and now it may leave the country and the banks may find themselves short of fluid money, and if the banks are short of fluid money, everyone else will feel it.   This is a disturbance of our capitalist system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may counteract that the next time he addresses a chamber of commerce by saying that we are swinging to the left and becoming a socialist economy, but so far as I know, we are still a private enterprise economy.   The Taoiseach, having taken a little look to the left, jumped back to the right and said we were a private enterprise economy.  The Government ought seriously to consider whether it is expedient to force people to reveal what funds they have on deposit in the banks.  That will serve no purpose other than achieving a flight of capital out of the country.</P>
    <P>Capital is one of the things we want here.  The next thing we want is plenty of credit, so that we can fall back on the recognised sources of capital, which are the commercial banks, to enable us to carry on and expand and increase our economy.  Much depends on our foreign policy.  I know that what happened recently in regard to the European Economic Community was not the fault of the Government.  It was not their fault that we did not get into the Common Market, but it was their fault that they did not know we might not get in.</P>
    <P>Now that the Common Market negotiations have failed, it is necessary for the Government and the senior Ministers to formulate a foreign policy. When I speak of a foreign policy I am not talking of a political policy but a foreign economic policy to substitute for the set-back of our failure to join the European Economic Community. It seems to me that in trying to formulate such a policy to increase and expand our economy, the Government must look to the spheres in <Col N="519" /> which we are most likely to be able to expand.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Government to the fact that we have a favourable trade balance with one outside Government, although it is within the confines of this country. We have a favourable trade balance with the Six Counties.  They buy £21 million worth from us and we buy £11 million worth from them in return. Our balance with the United Kingdom, including the Six Counties, is that they buy £125 million worth from us and we buy £136 million worth from them. The deficit in our exports to the United Kingdom is offset by the remittances from our émigrés.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to expand and increase our economy, that is one avenue for expansion.  The Government should take their political courage in their hands and try to change the balance between the 26 Counties and the Six Counties from £21 million and £11 million to £30 million and £20 million.  Admittedly, that might be difficult for them because they have expressed opinions to the contrary very forcibly in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Government to other avenues of expansion which are open to them. We buy from the United States of America a considerable amount of goods.  We buy from them something in the neighbourhood of £30 million or £40 million worth a year and we have increasing exports to them which are growing all the time and are now up to £15 million or £16 million a year. There is a considerable source of expansion there.  That is one of the areas which should be tapped and developed in every way possible.  I see nothing in the Budget Statement to suggest that the Minister and his advisers are aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>We also have a considerable potential for exporting into the countries of the EEC.  They buy from us £11 million worth a year and we buy from them £40 million worth a year.  Our sales to the Six have been going up considerably and, with the increased economic prosperity within the Community, <Col N="520" /> it is possible for us to increase them still more.  Agricultural produce is in short supply and that is the very commodity we have to export.  Those are facts the Government should take into consideration.  I am being kind to them in telling them that there are some avenues to further improve our economy.  It should be possible for the Government to have another outlook besides coming back every year and saying: &ldquo;We want money.  How will we get it unless we put on extra taxes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was right when he said we should expand our economy by up to £30 million a year, but there is no doubt that these are all matters which should be considered in the policy adumbrated by the Government. They should be actively considered by the Government when formulating their policy.  I do not know if we are to take part in any of the international discussions going on at the moment. As soon as the EEC discussions broke down, the United Kingdom started to try to negotiate fresh trade agreements with Italy and Spain and most other parts of the world.  I do not know if this Government have any foreign policy at all.  I do not know if they are doing anything about looking for export markets&mdash;they do not tell us. We have had the Minister for Agriculture from Holland here recently.  We have Ministers going to London, I presume, to look for an expansion in our trade, but we have no information as to what happened unless the information has been given to Government supporters alone.</P>
    <P>I learn with satisfaction that the French Minister for Agriculture has been invited to Ireland by the Government and that he will come here during the Horse Show.  There are considerable opportunities for the expansion of agricultural exports to France, although France is herself an agricultural country, but I do not know if there are any negotiations in progress, or if there has been any attempt to revive the market for lamb that was there some years ago.  That market was initiated when we were in office and it was unfortunately lost because France had difficulty in her <Col N="521" /> balance of payments and was not able to pay for it.  You see how fair we are on this side of the House.  We do not accuse Fianna Fáil of having lost that market.  We do not make political capital out of such things.</P>
    <P>There are considerable opportunities for expansion of our exports and it would be helpful if the Minister would indicate if the Government are working along those lines, if they are alive to the fact that these are the things that must be done.  It is my experience, having had the privilege of going abroad for a good many years as an Irish representative at the Council of Europe, to be cognisant of the fact that all trade negotiations in Europe, in North America and in the new emergent countries are carried on at the political level. We do not know if our Government are alive to that fact.  We do not know if there are any negotiations in progress.  We only know that three Ministers went to London but we do not know what happened there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance comes from the same constituency as I do and he must be aware, as I am aware, that there is a meat factory in that constituency.  He probably knows that there is enough space under that factory to increase the production of dressed meat for export without the installation of any new machinery, but, like everybody else, they are limited in their markets.  There is considerable scope for the export of processed meats to all parts of the world but these markets have to be found and prepared. When the Minister is replying, would he tell us if the Government have sought markets anywhere, if they have tried to sell to countries other than those in which we have our traditional markets and the exports to which are regulated under the 1948 Trade Agreement ? Have we tried to expand these ? Have we tried to go into new avenues of production ?</P>
    <P>Unless the Government are prepared to do that, unless they are prepared to go out and fight for these markets, our economy will gradually fail.  There is no use in Ministers going to chamber of commerce dinners and making long <Col N="522" /> and woolly speeches about being competitive. The only way you can get markets is to go out and fight for them.  Everybody else is doing it.</P>
    <P>If this document here contains the considered policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, it means that they will be back in 12 months' time, if still in office, looking for more money.  By looking for more money, they will be looking for what is not there to be got.  They will have upset our economy to such an extent by these impositions that our national income will not have increased and our economy will not be buoyant and strong.  I think it is time the Fianna Fáil Government woke up to that fact.  We cannot make them do it because we have not the majority in the House, but the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party should realise that many of their Ministers have held office for a long time and they should bring it home to those Ministers that they cannot go on drifting in this modern competitive age.  If they do not do that, the best thing they can do is to get out as soon as they can.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear Deputy Esmonde tell the House that we will be needing more money as a result of our efforts in this Budget while all the previous speakers of Fine Gael told us that we were budgeting for a large surplus next year.  It is a great pity that more Fine Gael Deputies did not come in and listen to Deputy Cosgrave who showed some understanding of the situation and put forward some ideas which showed that he had made a comprehensive study of the situation.  What we find is that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party comes in here and makes a speech and the other members repeat that speech in different words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which Deputy Cosgrave said and with which I agree is that the building of houses for the working classes should take precedence over any other type of building.  I have spoken in that regard on many occasions.  I have quoted from the City Manager's report to the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation his excuse for the fact that building has <Col N="523" /> not been as rapid as we would like it in Dublin, in spite of the availability of money.</P>
    <P>One feature that has been apparent since Dr. Ryan's first Budget has been the provision of ample money to devote to housebuilding as well as to other essential services.  In that, and also in social services and in the matter of providing money for investment in industry and agriculture, there has been no neglect.  It is all very well to sit on the fence as a number of Labour Deputies have done, approve of the accounts and say: &ldquo;We approve of your spending this money but we do not approve of your raising it, or at least all of it.&rdquo; That line has been taken by the Labour Party for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the Budget this year that struck me most was that it was a talking Budget, not a voting Budget.  Last year, it was the other way round.  A precedent was then created, mainly by Fine Gael, and a major debate was initiated immediately after the introduction of the Budget.  For years, leaders of the main Parties made short speeches and then we went on to ordinary business, considered the full implications of the Budget and made our contributions to the Budget debate during the following days.  Last year, we had seven divisions altogether.  We voted on every little provision and I felt rather like a hobbyhorse going around the lobbies. The Opposition, of course, lost in every division, by a larger margin as the divisions proceeded.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to is that it has been the practice to distribute copies of the Budget Statement to the front benches on all sides of the House.  This year, one Deputy did not sit on the front benches but on the second last row and he was surrounded by fellows on the back benches and turned immediately to the provisions for taxation.  One of these Deputies having approached him, he went up to the very back seat and a man in the Press Gallery looked over, made a note, handed it to <Col N="524" /> another man in the Press Gallery who immediately went outside.  That was a most irresponsible act by Deputy T. F. O'Higgins.  Unless he is sitting in the front bench next year, he should not be given a copy of the Statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy going to make the law for the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a suggestion.  It was irresponsible and the only reason I can think of for it is that it was either irresponsibility that prompted Deputy T. F. O'Higgins to go up there and apparently allow the statement to go to the Press before the provisions were announced in the House, or else there must be some smell in the front benches that he did not like, having been there himself once as Minister for Health.  As I said before, the Labour Party approve of the amount of money we proposed to raise in the Estimates.  They voted for the raising of that amount.  The amount was subsequently increased by the provision of additional social services and it can be said that the one tax they voted against was that which provided the money for these services.</P>
      <P>They have criticised one tax but they have not told us whether or not they approve of the corporation profits tax.  They steer away from everything except this turnover tax which is expected to yield £3½ million in the current year.  The social services will cost £700,000 more, pensions £120,000 more and the new children's allowances will take £1,200,000.  This was expenditure that had to be faced and if we were to raise the money the Labour Party told us we should raise, naturally we must follow the Fianna Fáil policy as it has been followed over the years and see to it that the social service classes are not too badly hit by the raising of this money, the spending of which had the approval of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other matters I should like to refer to and which the Minister might deal with when he comes to reply.  One relates to the turnover tax and the list of exemptions.  I do not know whether the Abbey Theatre is included under the heading of education or not.  I have certain <Col N="525" /> doubts as to whether it is, but I think it is quite obvious that the Abbey Theatre, which is subsidised by the State, should be exempt from this tax because if it is included, it will cost money first, to collect the tax and then to give it back again with the other hand.  That is a matter the Minister might think about when considering the final draft of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have been confused regarding the turnover tax. They are confusing it with the purchase tax as applied in Britain and say it will mean a penny on the lb. of butter. The price of butter cannot be increased by the retailer without the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Act of 1958, which includes four items including bread and butter.  The retailer, if he wants to make up this 2½ per cent, will have to do so on sales other than the four items mentioned in the 1958 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy think the retailer will do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied the traders have sufficient ingenuity to increase their turnover in such a way that the general public will not be aware of the existence of the tax in relation to any specific item.  I am equally satisfied that by this time next year the Opposition will be wondering why they were so concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to the publicans later.  I am quite convinced that the traders in the grocery end of the retail business will have up notices saying: &ldquo;No change in prices here&rdquo;.  It is a day of impulse buying, or bulk buying as opposed to the type of sales we were used to and in which I was trained to in my apprenticeship days.  The day of the supermarket and the self-service store is definitely on the way in, so speedily in fact that it is causing considerable concern in labour circles because of its effect on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the licensed vintners, <Col N="526" /> I have a small suggestion to offer. Naturally they can manipulate prices and put the 2½ per cent on everything. I suggest they should co-operate not only with efforts to correct the balance of payments but also to further sales of home produce by putting any increases necessary on imported spirits and beers.  There would be no harm in charging, say, 2/6d. for a small Scotch, leaving Irish whiskey at 2/4d. I understand it is only 2/2d. in the country.  The same applies to imported gin.  Some of the finest gins in the world are made in Ireland.  In fact, they are used throughout America in cocktail competitions and so forth. There are three brands of larger brewed in this country.  The rest are only bottled here.  I feel certain that the publicans would have the goodwill and co-operation of the public if they readjusted their prices in that way and I hope when their association get together to consider what steps they will take, they will pay some heed to my remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán Dunne has given notice that he wishes to raise a certain matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this very important matter on the Adjournment.  It is desirable and very necessary that the House and the country generally should know that there are, at the moment, 37 farm workers on strike at the State farm at Abbottstown State farm, Castleknock, which is in my constituency.  Some of these workers are to be seen, or were to be seen, picketing outside the office of the Department of Agriculture, Merrion Street.  I am sure passers-by wonder what this is about or what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has devoted a good deal of his life to the promotion of the interests of agricultural labourers in <Col N="527" /> County Dublin and throughout the country generally, and who had the honour and privilege of being instrumental in securing the passage of legislation in other years beneficial to the farm labourers, securing for them in one instance the weekly half holiday, I take the opportunity of saying something on their behalf.  I urge the Minister to look at their case with the maximum sympathy.  I urge him to treat these men with equity and to be fair to them.  These workers are living and working practically, it could be said, in the city of Dublin. Abbottstown and Castleknock are on the perimeter and the men face living costs similiar to those faced by workers in better-paid industrial employment. Nevertheless, their wage rate is no higher than £7 10s. per week.</P>
    <P>I do not think any reasonable person will try to argue that this is a living wage at the present time.  It is far below what is required by a person in order to make any kind of provision for himself, even if he is a single man, let alone a married man with a family and family responsibilities. There is also the fact that these men have to work 50 hours in summertime and 47 in wintertime while the general run of workers beside them in other industries&mdash;and, it could easily be said, the majority of workers in agriculture throughout County Dublin&mdash;do not work hours as long as these.</P>
    <P>I know the arguments that have been used by the Department to keep wages down to this low level and I think they have always been totally unjustified. The principal argument has been, over the years, that a State body should not, in the opinion of various Ministers&mdash;and this includes Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government&mdash;pay very much more than the prevailing minimum rate which is applied by the Agricultural Wages Board in respect of agricultural workers in any particular county or portion of the county.</P>
    <P>So far as County Dublin is concerned, that is totally fallacious. <Col N="528" /> Farmers in the county do not care what wages the Minister pays to these farm labourers.  The County Dublin farmers know that their wage levels, in the main, are considerably in advance of this amount of £7 10s.  No matter what steps the Minister might take in the matter, their economy would not be affected.  The number of workers involved is only 37.  The amount of money involved in paying them an equitable rate and paying them the £1 which they demand would be relatively infinitesimal so far as the general running cost of the Department is concerned. Further, they are doing a very important job, working on a State farm, and in the main, they are men who must have specialised knowledge even to a greater extent than is ordinarily required by farm labourers. As most people know in rural Ireland, this knowledge is extensive.  In fact, it is now being belatedly accepted that the term &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; is a misnomer when applied to a man working on a farm.  It is coming to be accepted that a man working on a farm and who is fitted to carry out the general duties on a farm is as highly skilled a craftsman or tradesman as exists in industry or commerce or any other form of industrial activity.</P>
    <P>It is also sad to think that so low a wage should be paid to men performing this very necessary work for an organisation which can very well afford to pay a decent living wage. Even if they were given the £1 which they seek, it would not bring them within shouting distance of what constitutes a living wage in the area in which they live and work.</P>
    <P>On the question of hours, it is obvious the hours are far too long and should be reduced and brought into conformity with the hours applying in other public employment such as county councils and private employment such as industries in the vicinity and throughout the county.  I think the Minister should&mdash;and I ask him to do so&mdash;give serious consideration to their claim.  It is obvious that these men would not have taken this step, which is a very serious one for them, if they were not hard-pressed by the <Col N="529" /> times.  I urge on the Minister the need for immediate and sympathetic consideration of their case.  I urge him to give them a fair deal at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points affecting this issue which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  The first is that those men are not agricultural workers within the meaning of the Act because the Agricultural Wages Board Act does not apply to them.  The Minister is aware of that.  The second is that the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act does not apply to them; in fact, it is the Holidays (Employees) Act which applies to them.  The extraordinary thing about this is that the disputes that have culminated in this strike have been dragging on for quite a considerable time.  Numerous letters passed between the Federation of Rural Workers and the Minister's office about the issue and these three or four discussions took place.  Whether you can call that negotiation or not is another question in view of the fact that on every occasion before the matter was finally debated or the meetings were concluded, and in practically every letter we have received, the matter has always been concluded by saying that the Minister does not propose to give the increase or the concessions.</P>
      <P>What concessions are being sought? The answer is an increase in wages.  As Deputy Dunne has said, farm workers or the people referred to as farm workers are getting £7 10s. per 50-hour week in the summer and per 47-hour week in the winter.  A tractor driver gets £8 5s. for the same number of hours.  Possibly the Minister may say that is the rate which applies and he cannot give any other.  That is the tune his officials have been playing all along but in Department of Agriculture employment in the Botanic Gardens there are also tractor drivers and labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Botanic Gardens, the tractor driver gets £10 1s. 4d. per week as against £8 5s. per week for the man in the other job.  In fact, the tractor driver in the Botanic Gardens works 44 hours all the year round.  The <Col N="530" /> labourer in the Botanic Gardens gets £9 10s. 8d. for 44 hours.  Labourers in Abbottstown will get £7 10s. for 40 hours per week in the winter and 50 hours per week in the summer.  That is the same employment.  There is another place which they call Shantilly. The labourers there get £8 18s. per 44-hour week.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming those are wonderful rates of wages.  For State employment they are pretty bad.  However, when you compare them with what the people in Abbottstown are paid the comparison definitely shows that an attempt is being made to keep the man at Abbottstown at the lowest possible rate.  The Minister has stated&mdash;his officials have stated&mdash;in a number of his letters that of course the wage must bear relation to the amount being paid by farmers.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dunne says, the farmers in County Dublin &mdash; the farmers in County Dublin he referred to are those paying the minimum wage rates&mdash;are paying a minimum rate of wages of £6 15s. per week.  The Department agreed to pay 15/- over that.  The Minister and his officials must be aware that very many of the bigger employers in County Dublin are paying substantially higher than £7 10s. per week for a job of £6 15s. per week and very many of them are working very much reduced hours.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Department are sitting so tight on this issue unless it is that the same mentality rules which has already caused disputes in two other semi-State firms in the city.  We have a bus strike because &ldquo;You are semi-State and you must not get any concession&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>They got a bagful of concessions and they would not take them.  The Minister was not dealing with them.  The Radio Éireann Reporters must not get any concessions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Department of Agriculture say: &ldquo;You will get no concessions.&rdquo;<Col N="531" /> We are also looking for a reduction in the hours.  In this case, we feel we have an extra-strong argument because the Agricultural Institute refuse also to reduce the hours.  When we looked for a 45-hour week they said they could not give it.  We took the matter to the Labour Court and we got a recommendation for a 47-hour week all the year round.  The Minister could have said: &ldquo;If the Labour Court recommended it for the Agricultural Institute, to men who in the main are doing the same type of work as are the people of Abbottstown, is there any reason why the men in Abbottstown, should not also get a 47-hour week all the year round?&rdquo; So far, the Minister has not done that.  If the Minister is anxious to be helpful in this matter he might do that even at this late stage. It might then be possible to discuss the other matters at issue under a different set of circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Institute employees had the right to go to the Labour Court. The employees of the Department of Agriculture have not got that right.  I believe the Minister and his Department are deliberately holding down these people and have forced them to take strike action because they know they have not the right to bring the matter to a public tribunal.  If it went before the Labour Court I believe they could not do anything but what they have done with regard to the Agricultural Institute and, therefore, the question of the 47-hour week at least must be conceded.</P>
      <P>We have also asked for this pay scheme.  In 1963, is it too much to ask that the Department of Agriculture would give to its employees what the Dublin, Meath and practically every other decent county council in the country has given, namely, the difference between social welfare benefits and their wages for a minimum period of two weeks?  Is that too much?  Yet, we are told it cannot be conceded.  It would be a break with tradition, apparently, if it were conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a discussion took place with the Department's officials and when it was found they could not be moved on <Col N="532" /> the wages question, and were not prepared even to consider it, a suggestion was made that they might introduce a system which the Agricultural Institute brought in and which they thought, and I think have proved, is something that will help them as well as the workers and that is that a service bonus of 2/- a week would be given to the employees.  We said to the Department: &ldquo;If you are prepared to do the same for the members in the employment of the Department we shall recommend it to them because we believe it will help.&rdquo; It means that after two years' service they will get 2/- a week automatically, so long as they do their work properly, over a number of years up to a maximum of 15.  It would help to bring their wages along and to give them an interest in their work.  The Department said &ldquo;No&rdquo; as they have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to everything for the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, four members of the staff out there were promoted. We have no objection at all to promotion from the staff.  As a matter of fact, we welcome it.  The extraordinary thing is that the people promoted, as far as we can find out, were promoted to washing bottles, and so on, for experiments out on the farm. As soon as the promotion took place, the men immediately left the trade union.  I suppose that was part of the conditions under which the promotion took place.  Following that, their wages were increased to £8 10s. rising by 6/- per week to £9 2s.  Their hours were reduced from 47 in the winter and 50 in the summer to 36 hours per week.  They got sick pay, extra holidays and protective clothing.</P>
    <P>We are not grudging that to them. However, we resent that our members who are doing the really hard work out there have been told again and again: &ldquo;You are not entitled to anything more than the poorest farmer can pay to the worst worker he employs plus 15/- a week.&rdquo; Everybody else can be treated in a different way.  We shall not tolerate the situation and the men themselves will not tolerate the situation where they are being treated as second-class citizens. That seems to be the general attitude <Col N="533" /> where people engaged in agriculture for hire are concerned all over the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want, no more than we want and no more than our members want, a strike on a State farm.  I appeal to the Minister, having heard what Deputy Dunne and myself had to say here this evening, to accept the situation that there is something very much wrong.  I appeal to him to accept the Labour Court recommendation for the Agricultural Institute and to reduce the number of hours to 47 per week.  I appeal to him also to study the other matters which are under consideration. If he is prepared to do that, to grant the concession of the 47-hour week, I shall give a guarantee here that the pickets will be removed. The men will resume work if the other matters can be considered and discussed in a reasonable way by the Department and ourselves within the next week or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct right away the impression one could gather from some of the remarks made by Deputy Tully that there has been in recent times any departure from what has been the accepted practice and policy in my Department in regard to the pay of employees on State farms.  The practice has been, during the period of different Ministers, to do exactly what I am doing. In County Dublin, for example, the wages fixed for agricultural workers by the Agricultural Wages Board is £6 15s. per week.  The reasonably good type of employing farmer in County Dublin is paying 10/- more than that minimum rate struck by the wages board and we pay, as we have been paying all down through the years, 5/- more  than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in my discussing whether I think that is a good wage or not for the man who receives it, nor is there any point in my replying to the case that this is a State institution and in that sense that it should be isolated from what takes place elsewhere, say, in County Dublin, where Abbottstown is situated, or where any of the other State farms are situated all over the country, West Cork, Clonakilty, Athenry, Ballyhaise.  They <Col N="534" /> cannot be isolated from what is taking place on the ordinary well-run farm. These workers are looking after livestock, milch cows, tillage.  In these respective institutions they are treated in the manner I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of the Dublin Trade Union Council last December and we had a very full discussion on this matter.  Naturally my officials in the Department, in replying to the different requests and in the course of whatever discussions they may have had with the representatives of the men, must give effect to what is the general policy of the Department. There may be some point in blaming them if you can get away with it but it does not make sense to attempt to do so.  Speaking not altogether as Minister for Agriculture but as an ordinary farmer looking at a number of men working in Ballyhaise Agricultural College, knowing that it is the taxpayer who must pay for such agricultural institutions, that men are employed there to do a day's work, I would say their job rates are by far the highest as agricultural employment goes.  Nobody would suggest that if any farm labourer were given a choice of taking employment in Athenry, Clonakilty, Ballyhaise or Abbottstown, he would go to a farm instead.</P>
    <P>I would not want to be placed in the position of being the advocate of low wages but I cannot divorce myself from the facts as I see them.  It is not my ambition to see labourers of any class struggling with a small wage but how can anyone justify giving certain people a higher wage at the expense of the taxpayer merely because they are paid from the Exchequer? How could one justify treating workers in such State institutions in a manner different from that in which thousands of men who work for farmers throughout the country are treated?  A comparison is made between the employment given in these institutions and that provided by county councils.  I could make a case entirely against that.  If a man employed by an agricultural school behaves himself even reasonably well there is continuity of employment and some security. <Col N="535" /> He is convenient to his work and in most cases he has perquisites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking generally. I have fairly good knowledge of what happens in these institutions and I make that claim in the full knowledge that it can be sustained by evidence. There is no comparison between the worker who is employed in these State institutions and the worker who is employed by the local authority, who may have to travel long distances, have his meals in different places every day, who has no continuity of employment and who even while he is contributing to a pension scheme is not assured of the continuity of employment that a man has who is working on the land.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies will take this as a genuine expression of my own personal feelings.  I had no hesitation in giving expression to those feelings when talking to the members of the Dublin Trade Union Council.  Naturally they could not concede that these arguments were forceful but they are forceful.  There is no point in denying that the men who are employed in some of these institutions are not working too hard.  None of us, I suppose, in the same circumstances would work too hard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when working for institutions like these.  I have a fair knowledge of the conditions in those places and I know they are regarded as tops in agricultural employment and it is not right that they should be taken entirely out of the general groove of agricultural workers and treated on a much more generous basis from the point of view of pay, hours and conditions than the men who really carry agriculture in association with their farmer employers.  To think that a <Col N="536" /> Minister for Agriculture could make that his policy, whatever his own feelings might be as regards the pay of all those men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course it cannot be done.  I merely want to repeat that the policy we have pursued is a fair one. In County Dublin, for instance, the minimum rate fixed is £6 15; a fairly good employer will pay 10/- more and we put 5/- on top of that.  We shall continue to do that but it would be undesirable to divorce the farming activities of these institutions all over the country from farming in general.  I think the men are foolish to behave as they are behaving in this case.</P>

    <P>(ii)  The figures for 1960-61 and 1961-62 do not fully correspond with those for earlier years.  The 1960-61 and 1961-62 figures include, in the case of individuals within the scope of Pay As You Earn, the aggregate income of <i>those individuals only who were effectively liable to Income Tax.</i></P>
    <P>(iii)  The figures in columns (b) and (c) are subject to adjustment according as further discharges are made.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The figures relating to Corporation Profits Tax represent profits on which tax was actually charged and are exclusive of the non-liable margins of £2,500.</P>
