      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received a request to meet a deputation from the Offaly County Council; if he has agreed to meet them in order to discuss the present position in regard to the council's finances; and if he will make a statement in regard to the request made by the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month, Offaly County Council requested me to meet a deputation to discuss three proposals relating to local taxation.  As the proposals were not within the realm of financial possibility at this time, I could not see my way to discuss them and had the council informed to this effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach why, as a matter of courtesy, he did not receive the members of the Offaly County Council, more particularly when they have some commonsense proposals to put before him whereby the rates could be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals they put forward were the complete derating of agricultural land and the making of health and road services national charges.  If these matters <Col N="324" /> should come within the realm of possibility, they would have to be discussed with more than the members of Offaly County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Fine Gael have a proposal in relation to health services whereby the rates could be reduced by at least 5/- in the £?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that out of a total membership of 21, only four members of Offaly County Council expressed any dissatisfaction with the reasons the Taoiseach gave for not receiving the deputation?</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>While trade statistics relating to imports to Great Britain alone are not available, certain relevant data can be obtained relating to imports to Great Britain, including the Channel Islands, and the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>In the case of many commodities which have both an agricultural and an industrial content there is no way of deciding uniquely whether they are to be classified as &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; or not and, in fact, the criteria adopted in such classifications may, to a large measure, depend on the uses to which the data are to be put.  Two such classifications made by international bodies of imports to Great Britain and the Six Counties may be cited which give quite different aggregates.</P>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving for the years 1956-61, the latest available periods, the data for imports into Great Britain and the Six Counties (a) classified, in the Trade Year Book published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, as &ldquo;Food products, other agricultural products and forest products&rdquo; and (b) classified in Agricultural and Food Statistics published by the OECD as &ldquo;Food and agricultural products&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No similar analysis has, so far as is known, been published for such imports distinguishing country of origin and neither the basic information nor the resources are available to make the compilation.</P>

      <P>The last index to the Statutory Rules, Orders and Regulations for the years 1946 and 1947 was published on 25th February, 1954.

      <P>In view of the fact that there has been an increase of six points in the cost of living since February, 1962, would the Minister not agree that that, in reality, means a reduction in the income of old age pensioners, inasmuch as there is no corresponding allowance to meet the increased cost of living, and although the six points may amount to only 9d. or 1/- as far as old age pensioners are concerned, is it not a fact that that sum in itself is of greater importance to old age pensioners than perhaps the loss of £100 to a company director or somebody in the £1,000 or £2,000 income bracket?  In those circumstances, would the Minister bear in mind the circumstances of this group when preparing his Budget Statement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the volume of traffic through the door in question is considerable and as a result, despite regular weekly cleaning, dust tends to accumulate underneath the mats and to affect the free movement of the door.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,490,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payments of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate for a pretty formidable sum.  That does not alter the fact that this is not the occasion for any general discussion on agricultural policy as we are confined by our Rules of Order to the subheads set out in this Supplementary Estimate.  However, there are some matters arising from the subheads and from the Minister's statement in submitting them to the House on which I should like to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item in the Vote is the subscription to the World Food Programme. There are two programmes in progress&mdash;(1) the World Food Programme and (2) the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.  I understand that our contribution to the Freedom from Hunger Campaign is to take the form of providing technical assistance to the State of Tanganyika for the expansion of production there whereas the World Food Programme is for the physical distribution of food in certain parts of the world.  I cannot find in the Minister's statement to which I listened on Thursday last any description of the categories of food which it is proposed to contribute from this country.  Am I to understand that our subscription to the World Food Programme in this year is to be made in the form of a cash grant, leaving it to the Administrator of the World Food Programme to choose the character of food to be supplied under the World Food Programme, <Col N="352" /> or is it the intention that Ireland and every other country will make its contribution to the Programme in the form of foodstuffs which we elect to supply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that.  I should also be glad to know what foodstuffs it is proposed to contribute from here.  I take it that the bulk of these supplies will be going to tropical areas which, I assume, suggests that primary weight would be given to approaching the question from the point of view that in many of these tropical areas there is no absence of food but there is a deficiency of certain vital forms of nutriment and that that deficiency usually takes the form of a protein deficiency.</P>
      <P>I should be happy to think we were sending dried milk, of which I believe we have a great potential, as a part of our contribution, and I should be glad to know if processed meat which is being undertaken by the Irish Sugar Company by the accelerated deep freeze dehydrated food method will be available for this programme and, if so, whether such meat will constitute any part of our contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that this is a Supplementary Estimate and, therefore, the scope of our discussion is in some measure restricted, it is also true to say that it would be impossible to discuss a Supplementary Estimate of this size, over £4 million, without some reference to the general background in which it is moved.  I hear a lot of talk at present in a variety of circles about the inevitability of a vast exodus from the land of Ireland and an assumption that the day of the small farm is over.  That kind of talk largely flows in here from the Continent of Europe and also from the <Col N="353" /> United States of America.  It is urged upon us that in the sacred name of efficiency, we should reconcile ourselves to the complete disruption of the whole social pattern of rural life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to say most categorically that I do not accept that.  I have spent my whole life living in a community consisting of small farms from ten to 40 acres.  I assert these people can produce efficiently.  I assert that they maintain a social pattern far superior to that obtaining in countries where there are large blocks of land run by advanced methods of mechanisation which eliminate the human element practically entirely.  I further assert that the social pattern obtaining in Monaghan, Cavan, in the west of Ireland, in the south-west and in the north-west is viable and that it would be a great treason to our whole outlook on life if we accepted the doctrine that our future policy in regard to agriculture should be founded on the conviction that that social pattern is fated to go.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the population of these counties sent into the industrial centres of Great Britain or the development of large industrial concentrations in this country which will transform the property-owning rural community of Ireland into a new proletariat divorced from propertyowing, as is developing in so many of what are called the progressive countries of the world.</P>
    <P>The resources of the Department of Agriculture should be used to promote the interests of a property-owning rural community and not for the purpose of clearing people out of the rural areas and putting and end to property-owning farmers.  I believe that we in Ireland are right and the people who advocate a different philosophy abroad are wrong.  I would regard it as a terrible tragedy if we suffered ourselves to be manoeuvred into the assumption that we were wrong and the others right, because if we once permit the denudation of the land of Ireland of its population, that is a process which is irreversible.  We built up this property-owning community and we should <Col N="354" /> take especially good care to preserve it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when I look at this Supplementary Estimate, I ask myself what contribution can it make to that end.  The farm building scheme and the water supply scheme are very material contributions to the preservation of tolerable conditions in rural Ireland and the increased efficiency of property-owning farmers.  I am glad to see the two schemes with which I was intimately associated are apparently proceeding apace and I rejoice in the appropriation that is there for that purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the best schemes ever introduced was the water supply scheme and in that connection I want to raise a matter which is causing confusion. We in the Department of Agriculture inaugurated the water supply scheme in 1950 in connection with the Land Project and it was a great success, as anyone who understands rural Ireland appreciates.  It was then thought expedient at a later date to initiate a water supply scheme under the Department of Local Government and now there are apparently two water supply schemes operating side by side. That is not a satisfactory arrangement. It would be much better to have one water supply scheme and all our available resources-channelled through one scheme.  I cannot imagine that the necessity for the two exists.</P>
    <P>I have a natural preference for the scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture because it is operated with a better understanding of the circumstances of the people for whom the scheme is designed.  It fits in very well with the farm building scheme because the men who are actually in the field administering the farm building scheme understand the conditions and circumstances very intimately.  I would suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that some discussion should take place with the Department of Local Government so as to put an end to that duplication.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government scheme, I understand, involves the installation of sanitary services and a variety of other considerations as part of the water scheme, whereas the <Col N="355" /> Department of Agriculture scheme simply provided that if you brought the water into the kitchen you were entitled to a grant of 50 per cent.  It was perfectly simple.  There were no trimmings or elaborations about it and there were very few papers to be filled in.  If a scheme is to succeed in rural Ireland the simpler it is made the better. My experience of the Local Government schemes is that they are more elaborate.  They relate more to house reconstruction than water supply and have always involved a series of specifications which have to be conformed to before any grant is payable. That, in my experience, deters a great many people from the simple reform of bringing water to their kitchen.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the agricultural water supply scheme was that it was designed to help the women in the country houses of Ireland.  We were all familiar with the fact that in many country houses in Ireland it was a traditional occupation for women to have to go out and carry buckets of water long distances from the well to the house. I felt that if you once broke that tradition and persuaded the man of the house to instal running water in his own house it would be only a matter of time until the family would realise the advantages available from a water supply in the house and would expand it into the other sanitary conveniences that a running water supply would make possible.  I believe that is the right line to go on.</P>
    <P>If you begin in a small way you get the vital thing done, that is, the introduction of running water into the house.  If you require <i>ab initio</i> that there should be bathrooms and hot water supplies and a variety of other services of that kind installed, it operates, in my judgment, to discourage any installation at all, whereas if you content yourself with getting the water into the kitchen it is only a matter of time until the other amenities are added thereto.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest that the duplication of this scheme might be examined between the two Ministers and a decision taken as to whether the <Col N="356" /> grants for providing water supplies should not be a province of the Department of Agriculture and, if it is considered desirable, that the reconstruction grants of the Department of Local Government should be available for people who want to reconstruct their houses or make plumbing installations over and above the actual bringing of the water to the kitchen of the home.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the decision by the Minister for Agriculture to reverse himself in regard to the reduction in the grant to cover the delivery cost of ground limestone has yielded results.  The Minister will probably in retrospect agree that his decision to reduce that subsidy was a grave error of judgment and resulted in a very unfortunate decline in the delivery and use of ground limestone.  The restoration of that transport subsidy has apparently put the limestone scheme back on its feet because the Minister says in the course of his statement that he anticipates that over 1,000,000 tons of ground limestone will be put out this year.  That is a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>It was deplorable that the consumption of limestone declined and I rejoice that it is being restored even to the level of 1,000,000 tons a year, bearing in mind that, so far as I know, the land of this country could very well do with the annual application of twice that amount of ground limestone if we could persuade the people to put it out. However, it is some progress to have got back to the 1,000,000 tons level and I hope the Minister will exert himself to persuade the people to put out still greater quantities.</P>
    <P>When we come to the payment of the Pigs and Bacon Commission we find that the Minister explains what a heavy charge this is upon the Exchequer.  I regret that when the Minister had to refer to that fact he did not also refer to the fact that a similar charge is now falling on the Exchequers of Denmark and a number of other countries who used to protest that they never dreamt of subsidising their exports of pig meats and big dairy produce.  It is common knowledge to those of us who are intimately associated with these matters <Col N="357" /> that the Continentals are very much more devious about these matters than our Government ever were.  My experience was that if we wanted to meet the losses on exports we met them and put neither cap nor cloak upon the operation.  Several continental countries protested that they never did any such thing but when you came to examine into the matter closely you discovered that although they did not give a direct subsidy they had an elaborate system of rebates, levies and grants which in effect operated as a subsidy very often at a rate higher than obtained in this country.  But, within the past couple of years, I think, Denmark has herself been constrained very substantially to increase the direct financial assistance available for her farmers in respect of pigs and bacon and, indeed, dairy produce.</P>
    <P>What I want to suggest to the Minister is this: for good or ill, in my judgement, his new grading regulations for pigs, in fact, operate materially to reduce the guaranteed price made available for pigs by the Government of which I was a Minister.  When that guarantee was originally given of a minimum price for pigs there was also a guarantee given that that minimum price would not be changed without giving pig producers at least six months' notice.  When the Minister first took office in 1957, he gave six months' notice that he was going to reduce the guaranteed price of pigs by 5/- a cwt. and he did that.  I think in retrospect he came to realise that that was a very mistaken decision but now he has introduced an entirely new element into this whole situation by a very severe alteration in the grading system of pigs and by the introduction of a whole new series of grades he has, in fact, effectively reduced the price receivable by the vast bulk of producers for pigs by, I estimate, at least 10/- a cwt., if not more.</P>
    <P>I suggest to him if that is allowed to go on the net result will be that the whole system of producers delivering their pigs to factories will virtually disappear and you will have men out engaged generally on the operation of what is known in the trade as &ldquo;kettling&rdquo; pigs.  They will simply be <Col N="358" /> sent out by the factories to buy pigs by hand because no producer will face the new system of grading because he has little, if any, prospect of getting any substantial percentage of his pigs accepted as belonging to the highest price.  That ultimately may result in a very material reduction in the output of pigs, which I would regard as a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that the problem is that unless we produce a certain grade of bacon we cannot sell it anywhere and that that grade is attainable and we have got to attain it and that we cannot get it from the individual producers and that it is for that reason that this new grading scheme has been introduced, I think the time has come to face the problem and to approach it, if necessary, on radically new lines. We have one pig progeny testing station operation in Cork.  I do not know if the second progeny testing station at Thorndale has yet begun.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be going and probably we ought to have two more.  We ought to examine very closely the question whether the producation of pigs ought not to be developed on new lines.  I would not want to exclude anybody who wished to remain in it producing his own pigs and finishing his own pigs. We ought seriously to consider an intensive development of pig fattening stations, operated by people with high technical training, in pig houses scientifically designed to provide the best possible conditions for finishing pigs economically, from the point of view of food conversion, and efficiently from the point of view of getting the right kind of pig to qualify for the highest grade of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties at present is that no one really seems to know what is the best kind of pig house for finishing pigs.  There does not seem to be any answer.  I asked knowledgeable people in this country if they were in a position to give an answer to the question: what is the best type of pig <Col N="359" /> house?  There was a publication recently by An Foras Taluntais on this whole question, but when you read it carefully, the conclusion you are forced to is that no one really knows what is the best kind of pig house. There are large-scale producers in Northern Ireland in the very front rank of the business whose piggeries are diametrically opposed to one another in design and method.</P>
    <P>However, it seems to me that it would be very much easier for large central stations, with sufficient capital at their disposal, to finish pigs in accordance with the new grading systems, than it would be for the average small producer.  Nevertheless, I think the small producer has a very valuable contribution to make to increased pig production and it is a very critical contribution.  I believe that Mitchelstown Creameries or one of the southern creameries operates a scheme on those lines.  It is quite simple.  They get sows of a suitable progeny-tested strain; they give them to the small farmers in the vicinity; what is equally important, they provide progeny-tested boars which are available to the breeders; and they undertake to buy the bonhams from the breeders at, I think, ten weeks old, at 2/- a lb.  Apparently if you get bonhams bred from progeny-tested sows and boars it is a pretty good criterion of their quality and weight at ten weeks old.</P>
    <P>If a scheme could be operated on those lines, and those ten weeks old bonhams brought into fattening centres where they could be fed on the most economic rations, and the feeding restricted at the appropriate stage to finish them, I believe we might recover a great deal of what must otherwise be lost.  I have no doubt that side by side with that, you could get a number of individual producers who had the capital and technical skill to remain in the finishing business themselves. If we are to keep the average small farmer in the business, I believe development on the lines I am now suggesting is urgently necessary.  It might be undertaken by the existing co-operative societies, but if they are not prepared to do it on a sufficiently <Col N="360" /> extended scale, I think the Minister ought to promote, with the assistance of the IAOS, co-operative societies to undertake this operation themselves. If that did not work, I would be prepared to go further and urge that the Department should concern itself to set up certain units of this kind at the Department institutions at Bally-haise or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It should be done, and I am certain that if it is done, it will operate materially to reduce the burden of the subsidy which at present the Exchequer is called upon to bear, because we would have the highest proportion of top-grade bacon for export.  If we have the right kind of bacon, and if we develop our marketing procedure to get the same kind of marketing organisation going in Great Britain as the Danes already have, I would not despair that in due time we would not be more than a match for Denmark in the British market, but unless we take energetic measures now, quickly, to multiply the number of progeny-tested breeding centres, I apprehend that with the new grading regulations the whole pig production of this country may suffer a very disastrous check.</P>
    <P>Subhead K.15 deals with losses on disposal of wheat.  I am quite appalled by the situation which is developing in connection with the wheat crop.  I believe that when we took a decision in this country to produce wheat, it involved ancillary consequences, one being that the flour millers would pull their weight in making that policy as successful as it was in their power to do.  My experience when I was in the Department was that practically every year the millers said it was impossible to mill the wheat.  We used to reply: &ldquo;The wheat has to be milled; someone has to mill it; you hold yourselves out as being the milling industry of the country, and naturally we expect you to mill it.&rdquo;  After a lot of hugger-mugger and chewing the rag, they went and milled it.</P>
    <P>There were no conditions obtaining in 1960, 1961 and 1962 that did not obtain in 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957. In fact, the harvest of 1954 was one of the worst we ever had.  I remember the hullabaloo that the wheat was unmillable <Col N="361" /> and could not be handled.  We had not then heard of the Halberg test which, with a variety of other tests, have now been developed to make the whole thing much more complicated. In those days, the wheat was mouldy or it was dry and sweet.  We all knew that in certain years the quality of the wheat was not as good as it was in other years, but you could correct that substantially by segregating the wheat and by permitting a higher percentage of Manitoba to be used in the grist.</P>
    <P>In no year I remember did the millers ever succeed in getting away with the proposition that the greater part of the entire wheat crop should be rejected or sold abroad for one-third of its value as feed wheat.  That is a very recent development.  Last year, approximately two-thirds of the wheat crop was rejected as being unfit to mill at all.  Then we were faced with the extraordinary situation that Bord Gráin were constrained to sell this wheat abroad at about £16 10s. per ton and, at the same time, we were importing pollard from Russia at £22 a ton.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be the very nadir of sanity.  Pollard is a by-product of milling wheat into flour.  It seems to me utterly daft that we should be exporting feed wheat at £16 10s. per ton, while we import a Russian by-product of wheat milling at £22 per ton.  I am utterly unable to understand why, if that wheat had been milled at 50 per cent extraction rate, we could not have used the flour and sold the high-grade pollard resulting from that operation instead of importing pollard from Russia or elsewhere.  I am perfectly certain that, if the millers had been required to mill that wheat, it might have created difficulties&mdash;undoubtedly it would&mdash;but it would have been done and a very material saving to the Exchequer would have been effected.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that if the present policy continues, the situation will become quite intolerable, because the series of tests will be multiplied until eventually it will become impossible to get any of the wheat milled at all.  We will be faced, therefore, year after year with demands for millions of money to subsidise <Col N="362" /> the export of wheat at fantastic prices, which in fact should not be exported at all but should be incorporated into the grist of the flour for consumption in this country.  I am perfectly certain it is quite practicable to do it if everybody is prepared to pull his weight and forget some of the elaborate testing procedures evolved in the course of the past three or four years.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose we can ascertain&mdash; it would be a very interesting calculation to make&mdash;what the average price received last year by farmers for wheat was and what has been the average price received by farmers for wheat in each of the past five years.  I think if such a calculation were made, it would emerge that a figure probably below 60/- a barrel would be near the price. How long that situation can be tolerated I do not know, but manifestly the present procedures are most unsatisfactory and are resulting in appalling losses to the Exchequer and great inconvenience to the producers; and I cannot see that the milling industry is making a very material contribution to the solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is provision here for the recoupment of the administration expenses of An Bord Gráin.  That opens up the whole question of the procedure relating to the methods to be employed for handling the barley crop.  I see the Minister justifies some of his present arrangements by saying we are obliged under a reciprocal agreement with the Government of the United States to import 80,000 tons of maize per annum.  I do not profess to be familiar with all the details of the present system for the purchase and sale of barley, but I do get the impression very strongly that the millers have the best end of this stick.  They buy the barley.  They bought the barley when I was there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I distinctly remember sitting with a group of corn dealers from the South of Ireland and saying to one of them: &ldquo;It is no use saying to me you will buy all the barley if <Col N="363" /> somebody is ringing me up and saying he cannot get anyone to take it.  Will you name someone who will undertake to purchase any barley in the hands of any farmer who says he cannot find a buyer?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was purchased through Grain Importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember their finally choosing one of their number and saying: &ldquo;Very well; he will act as our agent.  If you have any difficulty, ring him up and he will provide a buyer within 24 hours.&rdquo;  I must say that system worked very well.  That is what we did.  I remember there was a regular Fianna Fáil ramp at that time.  Fianna Fáil farmers would be assembled to clamour they could not get anyone to take their barley.  They persuaded public-spirited TDs to ring up the Minister for Agriculture, but always, to their rage and fury, the barley would be taken within 24 hours. On some occasions when the indignant farmers were called upon, it was discovered they had not any barley at all.  All they had were resolutions from the local Fianna Fáil cumann expecting them to ring up the Department and say they could not sell their barley.  The scheme worked, however, and the barley was all taken up.</P>
      <P>A scale of charges was worked out which resulted, I admit, in feeding costs being dearer in Monaghan and Cavan than they might have been if there had been free import of grain. But that problem was met by fixing the fixed price for pigs, not in relation to the price of imported grain but in relation to the price fixed on the domestic market for barley.  Substantial justice was therefore done to all, and the system worked.  I understand that at present the system is that in consideration of the grain industry buying up all the barley, they are licensed to import quantities of maize and sorghum, and that on the sale price of these commodities, there is no control at all.  They make a very good thing out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether that is a satisfactory <Col N="364" /> arrangement I beg leave to doubt.  I think probably it is better to arrange all that through a central authority and permit everybody to participate in any advantage that might accrue.  I think our system was that Grain Importers brought in all the maize that came in and it was then available to anybody to buy that maize, if they took it in six-ton lots, at a flat price in any part of the country.  If the millers, therefore, tried to force up the price of maize meal, or maize meal mixtures, or compound feeds beyond a reasonable level there was always the controlling factor that the farmers or the co-ops could buy the maize at the same price as the millers themselves were entitled to buy it.  In fact, relatively little maize was bought in wagon lots, but the fact that it was possible to do so kept some control on the price charged by millers and compounders of feeding stuffs.  I believe that scheme worked out well.  I am not at all sure that the present scheme works as well from the point of view of the consumer of compound feeding stuffs or other cereals for the feeding of livestock.</P>
    <P>The last substantial item in this Supplementary Estimate relates to the marketing of dairy produce.  Here, again, I want to suggest that the time has come to take a second look at this whole business.  I think the co-operative business ought to be asked to re-examine this whole question and to determine whether under modern conditions it is possible to continue the operation of very small individual co-operative enterprises.  I make no apology for having changed my mind in this regard.  I used to believe, 20 years ago, that the social advantage of a small group of farmers operating their own enterprise, with intimate contact between the suppliers and management of their own creamery, outweighed any disadvantage that relative lack of efficiency involved owing to the smallness of the individual unit. I think now the balance has tilted in the other direction.  I think the relative inefficiency of such small unit production is now so important as to outweigh the social advantage that was involved.  I feel, therefore, that <Col N="365" /> the amalgamation of processing operations in the dairy industry is necessary and desirable and makes the investment of capital efficiently more possible.</P>
    <P>We have learned, I think, that the larger creameries in the country, with a number of branches, are able to pay a better price for milk, able to diversify their production much more effectively than the very small units can ever hope to do.  If that amalgamation were to take place the increased efficiency and increased economy of operation that would involve could make a very material contribution to the price receivable by producers for milk.</P>
    <P>Outside this House, Sir&mdash;I want to emphasise that&mdash;Fianna Fáil rejoice in repeating those silly lies that they believe are good propaganda.  One of them is that our Government offered the farmers of this country a price of 1/- a gallon for milk.  That, of course, is a silly lie which they hope by repeating sufficiently often to persuade some innocent people to believe.  I did adumbrate in 1950 a scheme associated with a minimum price guarantee of 1/-a gallon in 1950.  I would remind the House that if they refer to volume 197, column 24, of the Official Report they will see there the answer to a Parliamentary question asked by Deputy O'Keeffe; the Taoiseach, in reply, gave the estimated value of a pound in the year 1950 and the year 1962 and that would show that the minimum guaranteed price I was proposing in 1950 is the equivalent of 1/7½ a gallon in today's money.  But, even though that is so, what is even more important to realise is that the offer then made was an overriding guarantee of a minimum on the assumption that the markets then available would yield to the farmers a very substantial increase over the price they were then receiving for milk.</P>
    <P>It was a time when butter was still rationed in this country, when butter was still scarce in the world, when we were about to have opened to us an opportunity of entering extern markets for butter because a surplus was likely to emerge here.  It is not easy to remember all the circumstances surrounding agricultural policy at that <Col N="366" /> time, but at that time no one was allowed to export butter.  When I first took office the butter ration was, I think, two ounces per week.  Butter production expanded rapidly.  We were about to enter, or thought we were, the export market.  Butter was at a premium and it was desirable to release the farmer from the degree of restriction that was then imposed upon him for the advantage of the community as a whole.  In that connection a scheme was proposed for a limited period to bridge the entry into export markets again which, in effect, offered a Government guarantee equivalent to the present day value of 1/7½ a gallon, leaving it free to the creameries if they could get more for their suppliers, to pay them whatever extra price they were in a position to earn.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that regard should be had to that now.  I believe if every creamery were working at maximum efficiency it should be possible to pay the suppliers a higher price than they are at present getting. I know that even in my own constituency there is a differential of upwards of 2d. a gallon between the price payable by the smallest creamery and the price payable by the most highly efficient in that area.  I believe that if we could reorganise the co-operative dairy societies into larger units, and if they had at their disposal the most efficient methods of production, and if they could operate schemes such as are being at present operated at Mitchelstown, and some of the larger creamery units in the south of Ireland, for awarding a premium for quality milk, these reorganised dairy industries could materially diversify their production, possibly reduce the surplus of butter which at present has to be marketed in a world where there is a chronic glut of butter, and break into markets for other milk products which might secure a very much more remunerative return than we are at present able to get for butter.  But, if we are to do that, I cannot help feeling that we must reorganise the dairy industry itself and make available to it the capital requisite to carry out that reorganisation on terms they can afford to pay.  I do not believe that <Col N="367" /> would involve any insuperable difficulty. Possibly the co-operative movement would itself be glad to collaborate with the Government in carrying out such reform.  I suggest to the Minister that if he finds, as he appears to find, the present burden of the subsidies in respect of both pigs and the dairying industry to be a source of alarm and dismay to him, the suggestions which I have brought forward are worthy of consideration and could materially contribute on the pig front to strengthening our position in the foreign market and on the dairying side, to avoiding a sanguinary row with dairy farmers who have a legitimate grievance because, as the Minister himself knows, the price of creamery milk has remained stable since about 1955 and in that period the value of the £ which was deemed to be worth 14/5d. in 1955 has declined. The £ was deemed to be worth 11/10d. in 1962 and probably with the recent increase in the cost of living, 11/8d. or 11/9d. would be more accurate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for their product, they are receiving substantially less effectively than they were getting eight years ago and that after making due allowance in the Minister's calculations of increased yield and fluctuations in the price of calves and in the other relevant matters, the relevance of which, I am glad, has now been discovered because they were very remote from the minds of some of his colleagues for many years.  But they are relevant.  It is perfectly right to refer to the increased output per cow, the increased value of calves and all other attendant circumstances to which the Minister referred in his statement; but it remains that, with the stable price and the deteriorating value of money, the creamery farmer is in effect getting less for his milk than he was getting eight years ago.</P>
    <P>I think that is going to give rise to a great sense of grievance which will be extremely difficult to resist, particularly when the farmer looks around and sees other sections of the community not only claiming the increased remuneration to which the rising cost of living would entitle them but, over <Col N="368" /> and above that, an additional increase which they claim is their due as their share in what is said to be an expanding economy.  If that claim can be made with justice for others, surely the creamery farmer is entitled to make it on his own behalf?  If it were impossible to meet it, the Government would have no alternative to saying so but if there is a means of meeting a just claim, then the responsibility of the Government who fail for want of diligence and intelligence to meet it is a heavy one.  I suggest there is a means of meeting it.  If that submission is right, the sooner steps are taken to do what is necessary in order to make it possible to meet that claim, the better it will be for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to pursue this discussion further now because a further and better opportunity of examining the whole agricultural policy of the Government will present itself when the main Estimate is considered by the House.  In so far as this Estimate requires provision for the various subheads to which reference is made, we agree the money must be made available but I would ask the Minister to have regard to the matters to which I have referred when bringing this discussion to a close.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to sundry increases in Government expenditure on agriculture in a manner indicating that the farmer got these increases in real money values and real additions to his income.  Later in my contribution, I propose to deal with that aspect of the matter but at the outset I want to say that the large sums included by the Minister in his computations are not properly chargeable as such.  For instance, the huge amount that has to be met in respect of the bovine TB eradication scheme now in progress is, in my view, not a charge properly to be levied on the Irish farmer but one that should be met by the whole community because it is the defence of our main export. In that defence, the woman working in a hat shop in Grafton Street is as surely in danger of losing her job as the farmer who must keep his herd free of TB.  It is quite unfair politically <Col N="369" /> to infer that the farmer has got in cash income all the money the Minister says he has disbursed.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House, we should like to lend our support to, and express appreciation of such items as the £300,000 for the World Food Programme; the £10,000, our contribution towards the control of a new type of foot and mouth disease that is apparently endangering the Continent of Europe.  We would also like to express our appreciation of, and agreement with the increase of £1,000 in the contribution to the IAOS and the £2,000 increase in the contribution to the Irish Countrywomen's Association. There are certain departures and precedents in the vote for the Irish Countrywomen's Association to which I do not intend to refer but we commend them and would like to be associated with the approval of them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the necessity for the reorganisation and rationalisation of the creamery industry. Without doubt, that is absolutely necessary and, not only that, but however we do it, we must be in a position to control supplies of our dairy products on the export market.  We may find that very difficult to do at present but we must face it.  As far back as 28th March, 1962, I asked a Parliamentary Question regarding exports of creamery butter as reported at column 682 of the Official Report, Volume 194.  In 1957, the quantity exported was 306,694 cwt.; in 1958, it was 321,670; in 1959, 14,451; in 1960, 139,442, and in 1961, 295,536 cwt.  This shows that in a wet year, with good grass production, you get a huge surplus of creamery butter to export.  In a dry year, we have little or none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of this have been quite disastrous, even as far as this Vote which we are now discussing is concerned, because when limitation of imports of creamery butter into Britain-our best and, largely, our only customer up to this year-came to be applied, Britain accepted the proposal of the Committee of General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, commonly known as GATT, that <Col N="370" /> included a specific three years and we were unlucky enough to find in those three years the dry year, 1959, when we exported only 14,451 cwt.  As a result, the available quota we can secure, if the situation remains the same, in respect of the United Kingdom, our best customer, is reduced and the loss to the Exchequer considerably increased.</P>
    <P>This all happened at a time when the Danes were endeavouring, as they had publicly stated, to seek a variation of a maximum of two per cent in their butter exports to Britain.  If one looks at the figures of these exports from Denmark to Britain in the relevant period, one finds they succeeded. Whether that is a question of cold storage of butter, or whether it is a question of the amount of butter being increased, and an increase in the amount of dairy produce available, is something we have to consider.  I believe that perhaps an increase in cold storage might be the best approach because butter is a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; product; it is one on which you lose your money.  Therefore the diversification referred to by Deputy Dillon seems to be the way to do it.  Whatever is the way, we must accept the fact that the Supplementary Estimate as far as the payments to Bord Bainne which we are discussing today are concerned is a major problem in the structure of the industry today and that we as legislators have a duty to see what we can do in regard to that problem.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the price of butter during 1961-62, one sees that it was 220/- a cwt. but by 28th March, that figure had fallen to 194/- a cwt.  If you take 1961, you find that in round figures there was a loss of £3 million on butter exported, but 40/- a cwt. is £600,000 and we have all got around now to marketing butter under a brand name.  Immediately we have done it, we have begun to get a premium and every premium we get on selling our butter is a saving on Estimates such as this.  If we are the legislators, we must accept the blame&mdash;the Government must accept the major blame, and anybody else who had anything at any time to do with it&mdash;that we did not get down to this way of doing it. <Col N="371" /> The rationalisation of the creamery industry, long overdue, is probably the reason why it is quite difficult to get a trade name or a brand name for one's products, where you have a whole series of small creameries all producing butter that perhaps tastes or looks slightly different, and for that reason rationalisation is important.  Do not think that we on this side of the House have not been alive to the fact that marketing under trade names was the sort of thing that could avoid the impact of Supplementary Estimates such as this.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 15th March, 1962, I asked the Minister for Agriculture, at Question No. 17, what pilot schemes for the marketing of agricultural produce sold under its own brand had been instituted in Britain since the announcement of Ireland's intention to join the European Economic Community. The reply I got was:</P>
    <P>The great bulk of agricultural produce exported from this country to Britain bears an Irish mark or brand.  I have no official information about pilot schemes which may have been introduced recently by manufacturers or others to promote the sale of particular branded products.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, in my opinion, the answer on that occasion was quite untrue.  The Minister for Agriculture was not present and the Minister for Finance gave the reply.  He actually told me that I did not know what I was talking about.  Now we are well on our way to success with Kerrygold. Our butter was sold as a bulk product and our bacon was sold as a bulk product. If we have not got continuity of supply&mdash;which I proved is not there&mdash;to supply even one city or one shire, we can pick Liverpool or some other city and keep the windows and the counters and the shelves of shops in that city constantly supplied with our branded products ensuring that the same quality, the same taste and appearance pertains once we allow the brand to go thereon.</P>
    <P>On 20th March, 1963, I asked the Minister for Agriculture a similar question.  I asked him if, since a recent reply regarding pilot schemes for the <Col N="372" /> marketing of agricultural produce sold under its own brand, he had done anything to follow up the success of Kerrygold butter, by encouragement of further like ventures and if so, what action he had taken.  The answer I got was:</P>
    <P>The use of brand names in the promotion of sales abroad is primarily a matter for decision by manufacturers or exporters selling the products.  I have no official information about the introduction of schemes similar to that adopted for butter.  The importance of improved marketing is being increasingly appreciated and is being given a great deal of attention by exporting organisations and firms.  This trend is being officially encouraged.</P>
    <P>That to me seems a very lukewarm approach, a milk and water approach. You might almost call it a &ldquo;slithery&rdquo; one which might be a bit like bulk butter.  I believe therein lies the hope for a reduction in Supplementary Estimates such as this and, or, alternatively, an increase in the price to the Irish farmer.  That may mean certain stringent standards of quality, hygiene and all the rest.  It is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to see, and it is long overdue at this stage, that there is put in train a succession of events that will bring that about.</P>
    <P>We have here an increased Vote for farm buildings.  Not so long ago, I asked a question in regard to farm buildings for housing dairy cows and the reply I got was that general grants in regard to farm buildings were available, and indicating the grant per cow. It is not that simple.  As I see it, the position is that you may have to get around to giving a premium on the basis of good housing, good management and good milk and if you are to do that, it is probable that the Minister will have to indicate housing standards as indicated in the Dublin milk district.  Having done that, you will be on the road towards the standard, quality and consistency of quality that would appear to be the only hope for an increase in price and the marketing under brand names of our products at the best available prices rather than at the worst prices <Col N="373" /> available, as has been the situation heretofore.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the dairy industry, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, gives the diversification that is so necessary.  If we can get in more money for the farmers and need to provide less in subvention from the Government by channelling more of our milk production into cheese, chocolate crumb and dried milk, should that not be our aim?  Is there any indication in the Minister's speech of a progressive increase in the milk gallonage directed towards those higher-priced products? Is there any indication in it that the Minister, as the principal politician involved in the agricultural industry, has been seeking knowledge as to the markets available for chocolate crumb and dried milk?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister investigated what areas in Africa, where the production of milk is not practicable because of the activities of the tsetse fly, are in a position to purchase dried milk from us and, if so, how is he showing the way for the dairying industry to get into those markets for the sale of that dried milk and so avoiding the necessity for Supplementary Estimates of this kind? Has the Minister investigated the question of the export of a different type of butter to the Continent? It is said in a general way that the butter we export to Britain is a slightly lactic butter, slightly fermented, even though, by comparison with farmers' butter, most of us would hardly taste it.  However, we all know that for continental trade, we need a butter made directly from fresh cream.  I have no special knowledge, except what I have heard in a general way, of how true all this is, but the Minister should find out whether there is a market there and, if so, at what price.  If the present limitations on our butter exports to Britain continue for any considerable period, then further markets for all these products must be obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon remarked on this question of the minimum price of 1/-per gallon and said the comparative price today would be 1/7½d., but something that must be learned as well is that every farmer in this country believes <Col N="374" /> that an increase in production ends up, willy-nilly, one way or another, in a reduction in prices, and he has largely been proved to be right. An increase in the production of wheat resulted in a levy being imposed.  You had the machinery there, and you had it implemented not so long ago, whereby every increase in production which was brought about resulted in a levy. That policy is designed, apparently, as a political policy, to restrict production rather than to increase it, to level production off by a penal reduction in price because of increased volume.</P>
    <P>We have got to meet these questions from now on.  A much better method is the Danish one of levelling off at an optimum figure of exports so that you know that continuity of supply and constancy of quality at a given level are available to the purchaser.  I believe in increased production on Irish farms, even though that brings with it real political problems.  The difference between this side of the House and the Government is that we believe in the problems attached to increased production, that we accept those problems and believe they would be only of a very temporary nature because of the prospect of better markets, diversification and constant supplies which would get us better prices abroad, whereas the Government believe in a decrease in prices when production is increased so that you have got that limiting factor in expansion as far as the Irish farmer is concerned.</P>
    <P>We must therefore look to an increase in cattle population and I believe the number of heifers being mated, while greatly improved, is nothing like what it should be.  If you have 1¼ million cattle or more and a wastage of 250,000, there should be 500,000 heifers each year if there are 500,000 bull calves.  Even if the mortality rate in calves is high, there should be 500,000 heifers available each year and the greater number of those should be mated at least once or twice.  At the moment we have got as high as 200,000.  It is a good step forward but at the same time, I think the potential is far greater.</P>
    <P>As far as pigs are concerned, of course we have got round to a reorganisation <Col N="375" /> of the Marketing Board and here again it is quite clear there is a great necessity for proper marketing research.  The only way we will ever get that is by looking at the pig industry from two angles: first, from the point of view that the sow is the standby of the small farmer and secondly, that, without exception, the large fattening establishments find the farrowing of sows and their care and maintenance the most difficult part of their operations.  I believe that the principle now operating in Northern Ireland and England, and creeping in here, of the man who fattens large numbers of pigs giving out the sows and buying back the bonhams is the principle which will guide us towards continuity of a larger supply of pigs so that we will be able to guarantee the constant supply I mentioned in connection with milk.</P>
    <P>The cottier may have been satisfied in years gone by to keep two or three pigs and at the end of two or three months, to market them for a little profit, but in 1963, if the cottier keeps two or three pigs and makes a net profit of 30/- or £2 per pig, the woman of the house will not be satisfied.  There are easier ways of making that small sum of money or, alternatively, it is so small that the game is not worth the candle.  I feel that the institution of large fattening establishments with sows of a given breed, of a given quality, given out to small farmers, with, at the same time, a guarantee of the purchasing back of the bonhams, would make for the provision for the small farmer of the job he is best suited for and would enable the big operators to proceed at a much better rate than ever before.</P>
    <P>A situation operates in regard to the marketing of pigs under which the big operator has the power because when pigs are scarce, he has pigs and when pigs are plentiful he can still go to the persons he gave the pigs to when they were scarce and dispose of his pigs.</P>

    <Col N="376" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Scheme, 1963, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>In 1953, it was decided that a superannuation scheme should be brought into being for employees of Bord na Móna.  It was not until 1956 that the original scheme dealing with what were then known as general employees of Bord na Móna was introduced. That scheme was introduced during the period of the last inter-Party Government and Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time.  The scheme to which we are objecting is a follow-up for the regular works employees of Bord na Móna.  The first half of it is based exactly on the scheme introduced in 1956 but any comparison between it and the 1956 scheme, after that, is, I think, purely accidental.</P>
      <P>For those who do not know what a regular works employee of Bord na Móna is, I should like to explain that he is the man who actually keeps Bord na Móna in being.  He is the man who drains the bog, cuts the turf, keeps the machines in operation and supervises the work at bog level.  He harvests the turf and sees to it that the job is done. Without the regular works employee, Bord na Móna would not exist.</P>
      <P>It is just too bad that when a pension scheme to cover that type of worker was finally introduced about ten years ago the scheme should be of such a nature that it can be considered more of an insult to the worker than a benefit.  Perhaps it is a bit unfortunate that the Minister for Transport and Power is the person to whom I must direct my remarks this afternoon.  The Minister for Transport and Power is not directly responsible for what has happened in this case but the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was first introduced in <Col N="377" /> 1961.  It was submitted to the employees of Bord na Móna, the ordinary people who were recognised as the regular employees of Bord na Móna, and it was unanimously rejected by those people.  The trade unions, representing the employees, sent in numerous protests.  A group representative of the unions who are called, under the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Bord na Móna group of trade unions met the officials of Bord na Móna and put the points of objection to the Board.</P>
    <P>Since that time, several extraordinary things have happened.  One is that Bord na Móna, having at first sent out copies of the scheme to the people generally recognised as being the regular works employees, availed of the opportunity between then and now to dispense with the services of a number of people who would normally have qualified for pension.  That is something which should not have been allowed and would not have been allowed in the case of any other employees except semi-State employees. It is something of which Bord na Móna, the Department of Finance or the Department of Transport and Power cannot be very proud.  I do not know how far they share responsibility for this position.</P>
    <P>Many unfortunate people who in 1961 were informed they were coming under a pension scheme and were asked to comment on a draft of that scheme were laid off in December, 1962, and were not re-employed until the spring of this year when they were re-employed as casual employees. They have not been requested to make application to come under this scheme. They have been told they are not qualified for the scheme because the Board have not got continuous employment for them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the scheme itself. It was considered by the men and by the unions and it was unanimously rejected by both men and unions.  I think three meetings took place between Bord na Móna and the Bord na Móna group of unions.  The first meeting was held on 8th November, 1961, and there were two subsequent meetings.  All the matters were discussed <Col N="378" /> with the officials of the Board. A minute of the objections was submitted to the group to show that Bord na Móna had the objections down in black and white.</P>
    <P>Then the scheme was reconsidered. After a considerable period, it reappeared on the Table of the Dáil with one change&mdash;and only one change&mdash;in the scheme which originally had been rejected unanimously by the workers.  I do not know whether Bord na Móna or the Department of Transport and Power, or whoever will take responsibility for this, consider that it was a smart thing to do but I consider and the Labour Party and the workers in Bord na Móna consider that the least they were entitled to was to see the revised scheme so as to find out if it was any less objectionable to them than the original one.</P>
    <P>I understand the Board consider they were meeting the requirements when they submitted the original scheme to the men.  However, what was the point in submitting it to them if the men found it was completely unacceptable ? Surely anybody with any commonsense will realise that to resubmit that scheme and to say, in effect: &ldquo;There it is now: take it or leave it&rdquo; is not the way to get the cooperation of any workers in industry or in employment?</P>
    <P>The scheme was dumped back on us with the one small change that, whereas it had been intended in the original scheme that people over 55 years of age were to be left out of the scheme altogether, the people in question could be continued in employment provided they were in the employment of the Board at the time the scheme was adopted.  However, the biggest objection to the scheme was the rate of benefits.  While Bord na Móna may try to make the excuse that the amount which the workers are being asked to pay is relatively small, I should like to point out that the amount they are getting in return is miserly in the extreme. Most of these people are men who were formerly employed by local authorities in rural areas.  They got what they considered to be continuous employment with Bord na Móna.  Having left the employment of the local <Col N="379" /> authority before the Superannuation Act was adopted, they lost the right to a pension.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we all must admit that under the Superannuation Act the local authority pay a decent pension to their employees according to their length of service and give them credit for all service prior to their entry into the superannuation scheme.  In addition, the local authority scheme takes into account that in rural areas it might not be possible to employ people for 52 weeks of the year. Therefore, if a man is employed for 200 days in any year, he will be considered to be a pensionable servant of the local authority.  Bord na Móna will not do that.  Bord na Móna will designate a person as a pensionable servant by reference to whether or not he is employed all the time.  Provision is made for people who have a fairly lengthy break during their pensionable service but there is no provision for the man who will be off for up to three months in the year because Bord na Móna work on a seasonable basis and employ a far larger number of people for nine months of the year than they do for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The local authority superannuation scheme gives full credit for service before the scheme came into operation. Bord na Móna give half credit for such service and here is the result.  Take a man who is employed by a local authority at a wage of £6 12s. per week with 30 years' service, 20 years of it before the Act was adopted and 10 years after the Act was adopted. He will get a pension of £3 per week. If he is an employee of Bord na Móna with the same service, he will get the wonderful pension of 11/6 per week. If he has a wage of £7 4s., he will get a pension of £3 12s. from the local authority and 19/8 from Bord na Móna.  If he has a wage of £7 16s., he will get £3 18s. 9d. from the local authority and 23/8 from Bord na Móna.  If he has a wage of £8 8s. per week, he will get £4 4s. from the local authority or 27/- from Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There is another difference, too.  The Bord na Móna employee is being asked <Col N="380" /> to pay a small rate.  The suggestion is that because he is paying only a small rate, he must be satisfied with a small pension.  To give an idea of the difference, the man who will receive the marvellous sum of 11/6 per week pension from Bord na Móna pays 1/6 per week for the pension.  The local authority man getting a pension of £3 a week for the same kind of service will pay 5/- per week for his pension. Would it not be much fairer for Bord na Móna to charge a higher rate of subscription and in return give to the unfortunate man a decent pension on retirement?</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have tried to cover this up by saying: &ldquo;Of course, in addition to his pension, he will get a gratuity when he is leaving of £100, if he is over 55 years of age and £50 if he is under 55 and over 45.&rdquo;  If he is not 45, he will get no gratuity at all. I suppose the Board considered it unnecessary to take into account the length of service of the employee but surely it is not unfair to compare that type of treatment with that given to those who were in the superannuation scheme in 1956 and who were referred to as the general employees.  They are in fact the staff of Bord na Móna, including the clerical staff.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start a war between the indoor employees and the outdoor employees but it will be generally agreed that it is not helping matters when we find Bord na Móna giving this sort of treatment to one set of employees: &ldquo;Retiring salary means that pensionable salary payable to a member at the date of his retirement&rdquo; and: &ldquo;A member who retires after attaining the age of 60 years and who has completed a 10 years' pensionable service shall be eligible to receive a pension of amount per annum calculated at one-eightieth of his retiring salary for each year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of forty-eightieths, or £2,000, whichever is the lower, together with a gratuity of one-fiftieth of his retiring salary for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of one year's retiring salary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is given to the person who comes under the 1956 general employees' <Col N="381" /> superannuation scheme.  The man who retires under the 1963 scheme with a wage of, say, £9 to £9 12s., which would be fairly general, will get a gratuity of £100 if he is over 55 years of age and, if he has 30 years' service, a pension of 36/11.  I do not know what he is supposed to do with that.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister for Finance or whoever is responsible for this scheme is not aware that old age pensions are not paid in this country at 65.  Therefore, the man who retires at 65 must go to the labour exchange and sign for unemployment benefit.  If he is a single man, he will get 37/6 a week to put along with his 36/11.  He certainly will not spend his holidays in Switzerland or in Paris on that.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has expressed the opinion that it is not a good idea that people should have more income when they have retired than when they are working.  Personally, I can see nothing wrong with that.  It is a grand idea that those who have worked hard until they have reached the age of 65 years should be able to get a reasonable sum when they retire. The thinking of those who devised the scheme does not coincide with mine. The idea seems to have been that Bord na Móna employees should not be allowed on retirement anything like the wages they have received when working.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which must be commented on.  At present there is in operation the contributory old age pension.  I am one of those who consider that the Act under which that was introduced was a wonderful piece of legislation.  I have thrown all the available bouquets at the Government and the Minister who had the courage to introduce it.  The main feature of the contributory old age pension is that there is no means test.  The Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance, finding they could not get at the Bord na Móna employees through the contributory old age pension, all of whom will qualify for it if they live to reach 70 years of age, decided to apply the means test in respect of their pension <Col N="382" /> from Bord na Móna.  If there is a meaner trick than that, I have not heard of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know where to lay the blame for these things.  Bord na Móna have devised the scheme and the Minister for Transport and Power is here this evening and, I suppose, will defend it, but we all know that it is the Minister for Finance who has the responsibility for deciding what will and what will not be included in the scheme.  Will the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Transport and Power be prepared to contend that a man who has given 30 years' service and who has been paying into a pension scheme while in employment should be penalised when he reaches 65 years of age because he will receive a contributory old age pension at 70 years of age? Is there any reason why the employee should be told: &ldquo;We are terribly sorry but because you will be getting a contributory old age pension when you reach 70 years of age, we have to cut down the pension you receive from your employer, for which you have worked and paid, and we will be able to give you, if you have 30 years' service and a wage of £9 12s., a pension of only 36/11 per week?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In case the Minister might say that I have been unfair, I shall take the case of a man who has a wage of £12 a week.  A local authority employee who is earning £12 a week and has 30 years' service, will receive a pension of £6 per week.  The fact that he will be able to continue working until 70 years of age, if he is sound in health, does not alter the situation.  If he has to retire at 65 years of age, he can draw unemployment benefit until he reaches the age of 70.  The man who is working for Bord na Móna and who earns £12 a week and has 30 years' service will receive a pension of 54/3 per week.  Incidentally, he will have paid at the rate of 7/4 per week in respect of that pension.  I cannot understand the mentality behind this pension scale.  Those who devised it had a warped mentality.</P>
    <P>The people who are working out in the bogs are not armchair workers. They go out to the bogs during the day and in the production season, <Col N="383" /> they do their shift right through the night, cutting turf.  Without these people, there would be no Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna exist because these people work as well as they do. Somebody sitting in an armchair has decided that these people should not be entitled to a decent pension, that they must take the crumbs.  The pension scale certainly would not encourage them to retire but the big stick is used and they must retire, whether they like it or not, at a certain age.</P>
    <P>There is another bait thrown out, which I have referred to already and which is particularly mean.  Those workers who avail of this scheme will make application and if they are designated workers, they will be full-time and will be practically guaranteed employment.  No matter how much the worker may dislike the scheme, the laying off last Christmas of the long service workers for one reason or another did have the effect that those people who are invited to take part in the scheme and who, if they had a free choice, would not touch it with a 40-foot pole, feel that if they do not go in, they will not get continuous employment with Bord na Móna.  That is a despicable approach by any semi-State body.  Either they go in or others will be invited in and they will lose their employment.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the people who were invited to offer their views on the original scheme in 1961 and who have since been laid off&mdash;most of them have been re-employed now and have been told they do not come under the scheme&mdash;are being shabbily treated.  It does not matter whether the scheme is good, bad or indifferent.  In effect, if the Board retained them for another 12 months and then decided that they did not want them for one reason or another, they would have to pay them a gratuity on retirement. They took the easy way out and laid them off before the scheme was put into operation.</P>
    <P>The people I am talking about are not the people who just rambled on to the bog a few months ago.  Many of them came on the bog in the early <Col N="384" /> years.  Bord na Móna are becoming more and more mechanised and the stage has been reached where most of the persons employed are able to handle machines but they should not lose sight of the fact that originally the labour force was made up of good strong workmen who were not afraid of work, who went out and worked on the bogs when it was difficult to work on the bogs, who shovelled mud and silt out of the bottom of the drains in the bogs and that but for these people it would not be possible to carry out the work that Bord na Móna are doing now.  The thanks that Bord na Móna are prepared to give these men is shown by their action last Christmas, when they laid off some men two days earlier than normally to show them that they were not the same as other men, that they were not going to be brought back again, that they were no longer full-time employees of Bord na Móna.  They were discarded as far as employment and a pension scheme, bad as it is, were concerned.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the pension scheme was very badly handled by the people responsible for it.  I have referred to the scheme introduced by Deputy Norton in 1956.  That scheme was for what were referred to as the general employees.  That scheme, apparently, was a good scheme.  That scheme offered much better benefits to the employees than are now being offered.  This sort of thing, where people in authority try to prove that those who work at manual labour and those who work out in the country are different from, an inferior race, to those who carry out administration, should be frowned on.  I do not think the question should have been dealt with in the way in which it was dealt with.  The people concerned have been treated very shabbily.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some idea as to how the figures were arrived at, why the figures I have quoted are considered to be fair pensions for people being sent out of employment, and why the very many objections which the men themselves and the trade unions representing the men made to the scheme in 1961, in discussions with the officials of Bord na Móna&mdash;and I assume they were <Col N="385" /> put before the Minister's Department &mdash;were not considered when the final scheme was being drawn up?</P>
    <P>Finally, would the Minister say whether he considers he was within his rights in instructing Bord na Móna to put the scheme into operation without further reference to the men concerned, and whether he considers he was within his rights in putting the scheme into operation on the day on which the number of days allowed for tabling a motion for its annulment expired?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that this utterly ridiculous Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Scheme, 1963, be and is hereby annulled.  It would be a great shame if this scheme were allowed to pass unchallenged in this House.  The people who conceived this iniquitous scheme were petty-minded indeed, and it shows the regard they had for the employees of Bord na Móna when the brains of Bord na Móna ordained that they should get the grandiose pension of 11/6 per week after 30 years of the most arduous employment one can find in the country to-day.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that a semi-State body such as Bord na Móna would seek to give a lead to the nation in the formulation of a superannuation scheme.  It is very undesirable that many employees of Bord na Móna should be bereft of a pension at the end of their working days.  Many enlightened employers have formulated very good pension schemes in cooperation with the trade unions, and more pension schemes are in process of formulation.  I hope and trust that they will not take as an example the kind of scheme devised by Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said of many Acts that they were not worth the paper they were printed upon.  Never was that truer than it is of this superannuation scheme which should be taken out and burned forthwith.  I hope that when the division bell rings, the Opposition, united in defence of the Bord na Móna workers, will reject this absurd scheme which has been referred to as an insult to the men.  It is, in <Col N="386" /> every sense of the word.  An attempt is being made to foist this scheme upon the Bord na Móna workers.  It was rejected unanimously by the unions representing the men, but nevertheless it has appeared on the Table of the House and is being implemented and foisted on the workers, regardless of their wishes.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there is an intimidatory approach to this whole issue.  The workers who accept this superannuation scheme without question will be given continuity of employment in so far as possible.  That is the carrot which is dangled before the noses of the men.  The Board were careful to state that they were not guaranteeing full and continuous employment, but that an effort would be made to give full employment.  What of the men who, in conscience, and as reasonable men, want to reject this scheme?  If they dare to reject it, or if it even becomes known to the officials of Bord na Móna that they cast any aspersions on the scheme, they are &ldquo;for the sack&rdquo;&mdash;they will be ignominiously dismissed.  That, to my mind, is a particularly scandalous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who takes the trouble of reading this pension scheme must come to the conclusion that it cannot go unchallenged, that it must be rejected. It is laid down that the men must retire at 65 years of age.  The old age contributory pension is not payable until the age of 70 years and yet the Minister lays down that these men must retire at 65 years.  I am not challenging that.  Indeed, I feel that many workers in Bord an Móna, by reason of the arduous and difficult work they have to do, will not be able to continue until they reach 65 years, but when they are forced to retire, they will have to struggle on, on a miserable pension, until they get the contributory pension.  We believe that the means test was used with great rigour in formulating this scheme.  We believe it is being applied to Bord na Móna workers with a vengeance.  That was never the intention of the Minister for Social Welfare or of this House when legislating for the contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> The more one reads this pension scheme, the more one is disgusted that in this day and age, having regard to the high cost of living, anyone would offer this kind of pension to any man. What kind of hireling or underdog does the Minister consider the Bord na Móna worker to be that he has the audacity to have this scheme printed and put on the Table of the House? These are the people who made Bord na Móna what it is today, not the efficiency experts who went in with their machines.  These are the men who worked up to their waists in water, who cut drains and who hewed out the turf and saved it, and made Bord na Móna the semi-State body of which we were all proud, until now.  They deserve better than this from an Irish Minister of State.</P>
    <P>After working for 30 years, a worker with a wage of £6 a week will get a pension of 11/6 per week.  A comparison has been made between the Bord na Móna pension scheme and the pension scheme of the employees of local authorities.  Anyone who looks at the two schemes will see the odious comparison.  We are all proud of the pension scheme applicable to the employees of the local authorities.  We should like to see them getting more money, but in comparison with the Bord na Móna scheme, they are extremely well off.</P>
    <P>For every 200 days a council worker puts in with his local authority, he is given pensionable service.  It is well to dwell on the comparison between the kind of pension to which he is entitled and that offered to the employee of Bord na Móna.  A local authority employee with £6 a week and over 30 years' service will get £3 a week pension.  The Bord na Móna employee will get 11/6d. per week. On a retiring wage of £7 4s. with 30 years' service, the local authority employee will get £3 12s. a week.  The Bord na Móna employee will get 19/8d. On a wage of £7 16s. a week, the local authority employee will retire on a pension of £3 18s. 9d., while the Bord na Móna employee is being offered 23/8d.  On a wage of approximately <Col N="388" /> £8 8s., the local authority employee will get £4 a week.  The Bord na Móna employee will get 27/- a week.  A wage of £9 a week is rather high for a Bord na Móna worker.  He can come out after 30 years on a pension of 36/11d.</P>
    <P>These figures bear no relation whatsoever to the cost of living in Ireland today.  With the fall in the value of money and the tendency of prices to increase, how are these men expected to retire and live on in the twilight of their lives in even frugal comfort on such pensions?  In compiling this scheme the Minister is compelling these men to exist on a subsistence level. They will be forced to seek home assistance in order to keep body and soul together.  I congratulate Deputy Tully on his exposition of this national scandal.  I am sorry every Deputy has not read this iniquitous document to see how an Irish Government can treat State employees in this day and age.  They have set a very bad headline for employers.  At a time when unemployment is very high&mdash;we have 60,000 unemployed&mdash;and when redundancy in industry is rearing its ugly head on every side, there is great need for retiring pensions and redundancy pay funds to compensate people for loss of livelihood.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted, therefore, that such a bad headline has been set by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance in formulating this kind of pension scheme. I know of very many firms and industries at present in the process of negotiating retiral superannuation schemes for their workers.  Some of them have done it on the basis of paying the whole cost with no contribution from the employee.  They deserve gratitude for that.  Here we have a State body which extracts a minimum of 1/6d. a week from the employee, offering him in return a pension of 11/6d. a week after 30 years' service.  That kind of pension scheme must be rejected by this House. It would be doing the workers and the nation a great disservice to allow it pass unchallenged.</P>
    <P>I understand this is the last day on which the Dáil has the power to <Col N="389" /> challenge this pensions scheme.  If it is not challenged successfully today, it will become law tomorrow.  It will be foisted on the Bord na Móna workers against their unanimous wishes.  The unions representing the men have rejected it unanimously. Despite that, it is being foisted on them.  They are being dragooned and intimidated into accepting it.  If they do not accept it, they are threatened with dismissal.  It is not fair, equitable, just or democratic.  That is why we challenge it with such sincerity and enthusiasm, and hope that it will be annulled this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of exaggeration in the comment of the members of the Labour Party about this scheme.  It is a pension scheme which bears some reasonable comparison with those applied by other State bodies.  It is based on the Turf Development Act, 1953, which was passed by this House.  The Act provides that Bord na Móna must contribute an equal amount to the employees' for pensions and that the pension must be based on actuarial considerations.  It clearly lays down that it applies to the permanent employees of Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna, the Minister for Finance and I worked within the ambit of that Act, which was passed by this House and, if I remember rightly, approved by nearly everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna are obliged to consider all representations during a given period made by employees and to make any such alterations as they are able to.  Then, having considered all the representations made to them, they proceed to submit a scheme to the Minister for Finance and myself.  It is quite wrong to suggest that this scheme is being put into operation under the threat that the men in Bord na Móna who do not agree to it will lose their employment.  It was clearly envisaged when the Act was passed and the trade union representatives have been well aware ever since 1953 that it applied only to permanent employees. All the suggestions that have been made that the whole of this <Col N="390" /> scheme is somehow being steamrolled upon the employees is entirely wrong, bearing in mind that the Act has been in force for a very considerable time and that every employee of Bord na Móna, either by himself or through his trade union representatives, has been able to acquaint himself of the conditions under which the scheme would be formulated.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the 1956 scheme as compared with this scheme. Under the 1956 scheme, applying to the general employees, the Board may pay into the superannuation fund a sum equal to the worker's contribution. There is no essential difference in that regard between the general employees scheme and the scheme as it applies to the present group of workers, manual workers.</P>
    <P>Again, the suggestion is being made that a large number of men were got rid of at the end of the last season in some way in order to deprive them of the benefits of the scheme.  Bord na Móna have had very big bog development works in hands over the years. Developments will inevitably be less in the future.  Unfortunately, because of that, workers have to be let go and they cannot be considered therefore as permanent employees.  The bogs will go on being developed until, under present conditions, and having regard to Bord na Móna's present technical knowledge, the last bog comes into operation between 1969 and 1972.  As these bogs become developed and as the drainage work is completed, inevitably fewer people will be employed. That has been made perfectly clear to everybody for a very long time.  The workers have been fully aware of the position.  First of all, Bord na Móna operate under terms of the fiercest competition with other fuels, particularly with coal, and more particularly now with the cheaper grades that have been coming in recently. Secondly, development must inevitably lead to some degree of reduction in the labour content on the various bogs.  There is nothing really serious, I think, and there is no question of a threat being suddenly exercised.  The position has been known to the employees through the whole period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Comparison has been made with local authority pensions schemes.  It would be quite impossible, I am afraid, for either the Minister for Finance or me to accept that comparison.  The local authority scheme is not an actuarial one.  The local authority contribution is a joint one levied from local taxation.  Nothing is produced by local authorities in competition with other things.  The local authority is in an entirely different position from a company obliged by statute to pay interest, repay advances on capital, in direct competition at all times with other forms of fuel.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna scheme is, as I have said, an actuarial one in which a superannuation fund is created and vested in trustees.  If the scheme were to be improved under existing legislation, that would inevitably mean an increase in the contribution from the workers and an increase in the contribution from Bord na Móna.  Quite apart from Bord na Móna's capacity to pay greater contributions, having regard to their economic position, we took, I think, the best advice we could as to whether the workers could be asked to pay any higher contributions than those already envisaged.  Making a comparison between their contributions and those of other manual workers in State bodies, I think a reasonable balance has been struck, though it is extraordinarily hard to make comparisons of the variation in the different types of schemes&mdash;for example, the CIE pension scheme in which the employee's contribution does not vary according to his wage or length of service, or the ESB pension scheme under which those concerned do not receive social welfare benefits. There, again, it is difficult to make a comparison.</P>
    <P>I want to dissociate myself entirely from the statement that Bord na Móna are treating their manual workers as if they were inferior beings. Bord na Móna are well aware of the service given by workers all through in the development of Bord na Móna and of the very high rate in the growth of activity secured through co-opera-tion between staff, industrial consultants <Col N="392" /> employed for continuous periods, and the directors of Bord na Móna. They are well aware of that.  This scheme is the best scheme that can be devised in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is also untrue to say that the Minister for Finance used the advantages of the new Social Welfare Act providing for contributory pensions as a means of beating down the Bord na Móna workers.  I have never met any attitude of that kind with the Minister for Finance or with any of my colleagues. Naturally, once that contributory scheme came into operation, involving contributions by employers, by workers and by the State right through the whole length and breadth of industry and distribution, regard had to be had to the benefits obtainable under the 1962 Act.  But there was no suggestion of beating down the workers.  In fact, the drafting of that scheme made it easier to arrange for a pension which, in the circumstances, would seem to be the best that can be devised.</P>
    <P>Comparisons are, as I have said, very difficult to make as between one scheme and another.  I can, however, give one comparison to the House as an illustration.  In the case of the Bord na Móna worker who joins the scheme at 18 years of age and has no prior service, according to his grade of wage, the contribution will vary from 2/6 to 8/6 a week.  In addition, he will pay 5/3 for social welfare contribu-tion&mdash;47 years at 5/3 and five years at 5/5; and he will retire at the age of 65.  If he is a married man, he will receive from age 65 to 70, £6 10s. 1d. per week.</P>

      <P>From age 70, he will have a total of £7 7s. 7d. a week.  An ESB manual worker who enters the ESB at the age of 20 will have 45 years' pensionable service.  Most of <Col N="393" /> them seem to opt for a supplementary pension unit in addition to the basic pension, a sum of £300 on retirement, and the total contribution is 5/4 per week as compared with something which varies from year to year, which begins at 7/9 and ends up at 13/9. That worker will receive a pension of £261 per year, something just over £5 a week, and he will receive a lump sum of £300 on retirement.  These comparisons are difficult but they show that people coming into Bord na Móna will have a pension that does not compare unfavourably with that received by ESB workers doing the same kind of work or in the same kind of grade.</P>
      <P>CIE workers have two alternatives for securing a pension.  For a contribution of 8/3, they will receive a pension of £5 13s. 6d. at age of 70.  An ESB manual worker who enters the scheme at age 45 years with no prior service and who wishes to have his lump sum on retirement and to secure an additional pension to the basic one provided under the scheme will pay a total contribution of 16/5 a week.  His pension will be £203 per year, about £3 16s.</P>

      <P>I have given some reasonable comparisons between a Bord na Móna worker with shorter service and a Bord na Móna worker with longer service and the same for ESB workers.  I have tried to show that there is a reasonable element of comparison and that element, I admit, is there because of the advent of contributory old age pensions which has obviously largely increased the total pension of the Bord na Móna worker and has to be taken into consideration in dealing with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The Social Welfare Act was passed in order to add to old age retirement pensions of the whole community and above all, it would be something which would mean more to the lower paid people in the lower grades of wages, than to those in the higher grades.  As the Deputy knows, it was designed <Col N="395" /> with that in view and the contribution of the State&mdash;this not being a scheme paid for entirely by workers and employers&mdash;was meant to be a transfer, if you like, of some proportion of the total income of the community in order to build up pension levels, of those working for lower wages, comparatively speaking, in manual employment, and those semi-skilled, than the rest of the community.  That was the whole purpose of the scheme.  With that in view, and in view of the State contribution, I cannot see how it can be said that the Minister for Finance forced a bad pension scheme down the throats of the Bord na Móna workers when the whole purpose of the Social Welfare Act was exactly as I have described.  It seems to me to be fair enough to include the contributory old age pension in arguing this matter out.</P>
      <P>I have explained the scheme and answered the charges made by the two Deputies.  It is quite impossible to prove that if you consider the social welfare benefit element in the pension, this scheme is out of line with those of other State bodies.  Naturally we should all like to see higher pensions and we hope Bord na Móna will progress and prove successful but they have a very tight run in front of them for the next 20 years because of competing fuels and the comparative prices of coal and oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all this, there is involved the usual question that is so difficult to settle or find a way around.  If we do anything out of line from what is in the Act, we immediately increase the cost of Bord na Móna and the cost of electricity goes up and eventually the people getting these pensions would pay more for electric current in their houses.  That argument can be used indefinitely but I think it right to suggest that we must try to confine these schemes within economic limits.  At the same time, the pensions are reasonably comparable and I think nobody can deny that.  There may be anomalies here and there.  Perhaps if you look at various rates of pensions for various workers for various periods of service, some point can be found where one pension is not equivalent to <Col N="396" /> another in another State company but having regard to the whole position, I think it is as good a scheme as we could make it under the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to give the Minister the credit of saying that I think his half-hearted effort to justify this scheme is an indication that it has been forced on his Department by the Department of Finance.  However this scheme came to the House, it now qualifies for the distinction of being the most miserable and miserly scheme introduced in the 41 years of the existence of this House.  The Minister has put upon his shoulders the responsibility of defending the meanest and most miserable scheme with which the House has ever dealt.</P>
      <P>Let me be frank about this.  I am told that top officials of Bord na Móna are thoroughly displeased with this scheme and that they would not attempt to justify it themselves in public.  The Minister has to do it because he is a Minister.  I am told the top officials of Bord na Móna would not defend this scheme.  I have been informed that Bord na Móna submitted a much better scheme and that it went to the Department of Finance where it was emasculated.  Now this miserable ghost comes out of the Department of Finance and is offered to the turf workers as the best we can give them in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used a phrase to the effect that we must make these things as reasonably economic as possible. When I had a scheme put to me in the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1956 dealing with the administrative and clerical staff, I took as the basis of it the normal pension scheme in the State service.  Every civil servant today, no matter what rank he holds, once he is a pensionable officer, has his pension calculated on the basis of one-eightieth of his salary on retirement for every year's service, plus a lump sum of one-thirtieth of his salary for each year's service, subject, in the case of the one-eightieth, to forty-eightieths, or half his salary, and in the case of the lump sum subject to a maximum of forty-five-thirtieths, or one and a half year's salary.  Let us <Col N="397" /> take any officer, even the messengers in this House, in any Department of State.  They are entitled to one-eightieth of their wages on retirement for each year's service subject to a maximum of forty-eightieths, or half their pay, for pension purposes and as well they are entitled to a lump sum based on one-thirtieth of their salary for each year's service subject to a maximum, as I have said, of forty-five-thirtieths.  In other words, any pensionable officer in the State service is entitled, after 40 years' service, to a pension of half his salary on retirement and to a lump sum of one year's salary and ten-thirtieths of that salary.  That is the entitlement.</P>
    <P>That is the basis which I felt was a reasonable basis in 1956 and the 1956 superannuation scheme enshrines that and gives to the administrative, clerical and supervisory staff of Bord na Móna a pension based on these sound principles, principles which were first established under the 1909 Superannuation Act which is still continued in this country for everybody appointed since 1909 and is still continued in Britain as well.  However, when it came to dealing with the pension scheme for the ordinary workers of Bord na Móna &mdash;the men who went out on the bogs, in muck, slime, filth and silt and got down into the trenches and tried to shovel turf which was almost indistinguishable from water to make drains &mdash;an entirely different scheme was adopted.</P>
    <P>There is no justification whatever for discriminating in the principles of a pension scheme applicable to the clerical staff and that applicable to the field staff on the bogs.  The calculating principle ought to be the same.  The mathematical operations, as the basis of the scheme, ought to be the same. If there is any difference in pay that will show itself in the pension.  There should be the same principles for the Secretary of a Department as for a pensionable messenger in the Department. When we come to Bord na Móna we have to have a caste system.  We have to have a certain pension scheme for clerical, administrative and other people.  I do not begrudge them the scheme; I approve of it.  I think it was a good scheme for them but it is nothing short of a scandal, when <Col N="398" /> you come to deal with the ordinary man on the bog, the man who goes into the deep trenches and works from eight to ten months in windswept bogs in any kind of clothes with which he can clothe himself, that when he comes to 65 we have to have this miserable scheme so that he will not get too much money between 65 and 70.</P>
    <P>I think it is a scandalous pension scheme.  Let us examine what we are doing.  The average wage for the ordinary bog worker is about £10 per week.  He may get more in some weeks than in others but he has a large proportion of wet-time on the bogs with the result that he may have higher wages than £10 in dry summer weather. When he gets a lot of wet weather he has to endure a lot of wet-time so that he would have an average of £10 per week.  What is he going to get from this scheme of Bord na Móna?  If he has 20 years' service on the bog at present and gives another ten years' service on the bog his pension will be 28/-per week.  To get it he will have to pay 5/4d. every week if he is employed by Bord na Móna.  That is 28/- after he has given a total of 30 years' service on the bog.  After the scheme comes into operation the pension will be the magnificent sum of 42/- per week.</P>

      <P>After 30 years' service on the bog, after this scheme comes into operation, he will get a pension of 42/- a week and he will have the privilege of paying 5/4d. a week for it. You can imagine what this world is going to be like in 30 years from now. The sum of 5/4d. is going to be paid for a pension which he will get 30 years hence, if the bogs are there. That is a contemptible offer to make to these unfortunate men without whose stamina, backs and muscles it would never have been possible to develop the bogs.  Yet after all they have given in order to develop the <Col N="399" /> bogs, after the hardships they have endured, this is the miserable offer made to them.</P>
      <P>There is no set of circumstances associated with Bord na Móna which justify them in paring back to these miserable limits.  Let it be said for them, however, that I have been told they do not justify this scheme themselves, that this is something which has been cooked up in the Department of Finance and apparently that is the best that can be got out of the Department of Finance at the moment. Will the Minister say whether Bord na Móna put up a better scheme than this?  Has this been attenuated since Bord na Móna put up a scheme?  I have been informed that this is the only scheme the Department will sanction.  At all events, no matter whose creation it is, the scheme is the most miserable thing that has ever been pushed into this House and endorsement sought for it.</P>
      <P>What justification is there for treating the ordinary worker, the dedicated man&mdash;and dedicated he must have been to have worked under the conditions that operated on the Bog of Allen or in North Mayo; only a sense of dedication would keep him there&mdash;in such a way that after giving 30 years' service to Bord na Móna under these appalling conditions which would try the physique and mentality of anybody, the best the Board can do is to provide one scheme of 28/- a week and another of 42/-?  The authors of this scheme ought to be ashamed of themselves.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister why, if it is possible to give to some of the top people in Bord na Móna half their salaries as pensions after 40 years' service, plus a lump sum of one year's salary, we cannot give that to the fellows down at Robertstown, those at Lullymore or at Ballydesmond in the briquette factory?  How is it we can afford half salary plus a year's salary to the people in Fitzwilliam Square and allow this to happen to the people down in the bogs of Kildare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not come to that portion yet.  The Minister ought to be on the stage as a conjuror, throwing these pounds around, deceiving the simple people listening to him. The Minister says it is true these are only crumbs, this 28/- and 42/-, but he says to those men: &ldquo;Wait until you come to the age of 70 and see what we have in store for you then.&rdquo;  What is in store for them?  Alive at 70, a bog worker gets the contributory old age pension for which he is paying every week, and though he is paying for it every week, the Minister thinks he is entitled to calculate the pension which the man will get at 70 as a reward for the services he gave to Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is paying as much as other workers in whose case there will be no reduction in pension.  Why have the pensions of bog workers been reduced when you are giving the full pensions to others who are contributing? You are treating Bord na Móna workers as one class and all other workers as another.  The other classes will get their pensions at 70 without any reduction in their ordinary pensions, but in the case of Bord na Móna workers the Minister says: &ldquo;We will cut your pension and give you a small rate because of the fact that you will get a contributory old age pension at the age of 70.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are they singled out?  Is it just because they have worked on the bogs that they are being classified as second-class citizens?  If this means <Col N="401" /> anything at all, it is a means test.  A means test is applied to the pensions of these people and they are told they must be satisfied with a small rate of pension if they are to qualify for the contributory old age pension.  In other words, they are told: &ldquo;We cannot allow you to earn too much in pensions because if you do, you would be getting too much at the age of 70, taking the contributory old age pension into account.&rdquo;  It is the most despicable economics I have ever heard of and is obviously an effort to cheat the bog workers out of the pensions to which they have contributed all the years they have worked for Bord na Móna.  They are entitled to those pensions without any adjustment; they are entitled to reasonable pensions for the services they have given and towards which they have contributed so much.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme applicable to the clerical and administrative staffs of Bord na Móna, a person with 40 years' service and £3,000 a year gets an annual pension of £1,500 and a lump sum of the salary for one year and one-third as well.  If we can pay that to the boys in Fitzwilliam Square, how is it we can pay only 28/- and 42/- to those people working on the bogs?  The Minister has not attempted to justify it because there can be no justification for it or for his departure from the general principle of paying pensions of eightieths in accordance with the well-conceived and generally operated practice in every Department of State, based on the service a person has given.</P>
    <P>This will not be the last the House will hear of it.  I challenge the Minister to take off the Whips and see if he will get it through.  The only way he will get it through is by compelling the members of his Party.  If the Whips were taken off, this scheme would be annulled and negatived.  I suggest that even the members of Fianna Fáil should claim some liberty and freedom from the Party organisation which would compel them to go into the lobby and force those unfortunate bog workers to accept these miserable pensions while other comparable <Col N="402" /> workers can get substantially higher pensions.  I do not begrudge them to those other workers, but I do object to one principle for one body of workers and a different one for another, for a body of workers who operate in the grime, the slime and the silt to try to regenerate the bogs of this country.  The Minister should go back to the Department and get somebody better and more decent to suggest a scheme.  The House ought not to lend its name, and Deputies ought not to lend their individual names to the imposition of the most miserable scheme I have ever seen in this House.</P>

      <P>It is quite manifest the Minister has not justified this.  He may have found it difficult to deal with all the figures but he manifestly has not read his brief and has made no case at all.  This scheme runs to 21 pages and involves elaborate actuarial calculations, but on the face of it, a bog worker who has 20 years' service enters the scheme and works on for ten years, paying 5/4 a week, and then qualifies for 28/- a week.  If a man enters the service of Bord na Móna tomorrow and works for 30 years, paying 5/4 per week into a pension fund, at the end of that time, he will receive £2 2s. per week.  I would certainly want to have it proved to me how that approximates to equity, and I suggest to the Minister that his contribution to the discussion is well calculated to create the impression on the House that he feels no measure of enthusiasm for this proposal at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the case, as put by Deputy Norton, that there is a distinction between the basis of treatment proposed for manual workers on the bogs and the executive or administrative officers in Bord na Móna under the pension scheme of 1956 has been met.  I do not think many Deputies would wish to be on record as approving this scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that a sensible settlement of this situation would be to withdraw the scheme or to consent to have the <Col N="403" /> motion annulling the scheme passed and then to refer the scheme to a Select Committee of the House who would examine it and report back as to what, in all the circumstances, would be fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's philosophy, as adumbrated by him, that a State company has only one duty, that is, to apply to its employees the hardest maxims of cold economic law.  I think that is a very inadequate and antediluvian principle.  I suggest to the Minister that no private employer would long be tolerated who dealt with his employees on that basis. I do not think any of us would wish to have the reputation of proceeding on that basis.  That is the ancient argument.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest the Minister accepts the logical conclusion of that argument but remember that that is the argument advanced against Lord Shaftesbury when he suggested that women should not be used for hauling coal trucks in the mines.  It was suggested by the mine owners that the economic exigencies of the situation required that women should be so employed and that it was a slander upon the mine owners to say that the women were harnessed to the trucks when the fact was that the trucks were harnessed to the women.</P>
    <P>That is on the records of the House of Lords in England.  I am sure that the man who advanced that thesis believed he was merely conforming to economic laws.  Time and experience have proven that Lord Shaftesbury was right and that the man who thought himself an orthodox economist was wrong.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the duty of the State as an employer is to set a good standard for its employees.  I hope the Minister accepts that proposition.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the difference between 42/- a week, which is the pension proposed, and some relatively modest increase of that sum.  Expressed in actuarial terms, this may not involve a very serious charge at all upon the resources of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what the actuarial implications of providing a more reasonable standard of pension would be.  I am perfectly prepared on behalf of our Party to sit down with other members of a Select Committee of this House to examine this scheme not from the point of view of cold economic laws such as are adumbrated or appear to be adumbrated by the Minister's intervention but on the criterion of what would be fair and equitable in the light of all the circumstances.  If that is done, we may be able to find common ground.</P>
      <P>We simply cannot wash our hands, like Pontius Pilate, and declare that this is no concern of ours.  The legislation under which this scheme was formulated imposed on this House the ultimate authority.  The Minister is not in a position to say here, as he has so often said: &ldquo;This is a function reserved to the board appointed by statute of this House to operate this enterprise.&rdquo;  This is not a function reserved to the board.  This is a function laid upon the board to formulate a scheme and to lay it upon the Table of this House&mdash;and the approval of this House is deemed to be forthcoming unless, within 21 days, a contrary opinion is expressed.</P>
      <P>The House is now being asked to express a contrary opinion.  We have two widely divergent views of how the scheme will operate.  No intelligent Deputy will think the less of his colleague for stating openly that to plumb effectively the actuarial implications of a pension scheme of this kind is beyond him without expert advice. The Minister has made a contribution. The members of the Labour Party, fortified, I presume, by actuarial inquiries by their trade union organisations, have advanced their estimate of what this scheme will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not know precisely <Col N="405" /> where the truth lies.  It is extremely difficult to envisage every contingency that can arise under so exhaustive a pension scheme as this appears to be. However, one thing which appears to me to be perfectly reasonable is that, before asking the House to express approval of a scheme, we ought to be supplied with more information about it than the Minister is prepared to give us today.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;Very well; I shall accept the motion; I shall consider the scheme and submit it to a Select Committee of this House for examination&rdquo;, I am perfectly prepared to accept that.  However, if the Minister says: &ldquo;There is nothing I can do about it&rdquo; in respect of a scheme which, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to be mean and inadequate, I shall vote in favour of the motion to annul the scheme.  I think that, from every point of view, it would be better if we refrained from that exercise.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to assume that anybody in the House accepts the doctrine that the legislature of this country should endorse what we believe to be an inadequate and unfair pension scheme on the ground that we cannot afford to be fair.  I do not believe it is true or right, or that we ought to go on record as doing it.  Having listened to the Minister with attention, I am afraid that is the substance of his case for this scheme.  I think what the Minister can fairly be understood to have said is that this scheme is not much good but it is the best we can do.</P>

Put that in the context of what Deputy Norton said&mdash; I do not believe he said it lightly&mdash; that he believes the board of Bord na Móna itself put forward a more liberal pension scheme and believed <Col N="406" /> they could operate it but that scheme was turned down and an emasculated version of it was laid on the Table of the House and the Minister was sent in to defend it.  Surely that justifies rational Deputies in asking that the matter be referred to a Select Committee for informed examination so that when we are called upon to record our views in the lobby we may do so with all the information available at our disposal?  If the Minister is prepared to do that, we shall recommend the Labour Party to accept this point of view.

My conscience compels me to support this motion and I do not want to hear the Minister defending these pension proposals of Bord na Móna on any balance sheet basis.  Bord na Móna are already being subsidised by the people.  They are being subsidised by every user of electricity.

When those same people got into office, the first thing they did was to close down every Bord na Móna works in my part of the country.  If these people go down to north Mayo, they will get their answer very quickly. They closed down everything that was in it and it was only when there was a change of Government that these works were reopened and the question of pensions arose at all.

The fact remains that thousands of workers are employed by Bord na Móna and it is nice to know that we shall be able to give pensions to those people.  If the Opposition were in office, there would be nobody to whom to give pensions.</P>
      <P>There are certain things wrong with Bord na Móna but there are many things right with them.  When a Deputy says here that we are subsidising Bord na Móna, I should like him to understand that, as far as I know, any money which Bord na Móna gets from this House and from the State has to be repaid with interest. That is a very important point. Furthermore, from the Book of Estimates, it will be seen that Bord na Móna are at the moment getting very little, if any, money from the State. They are standing on their own feet and are one industry which has proved it can stand on its own feet, that it can develop the bogs of Ireland and sell its products economically to the State and that, along with selling its products economically to the State, can give colossal employment within the State. That is something that would not happen if the gentlemen who are in Opposition were in control.  They must be completely lacking in common sense if they think they are hoodwinking the workers of Bord na Móna or anybody else.  They are only hoodwinking themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the most reasonable pensions possible to Bord na Móna workers.  Bord na Móna workers are probably the people within the State who are most entitled to consideration.  If we go back even to the time of the passing of the Turf Development Act, we can imagine the state in which this country was at the time.  We can see the number of power stations which existed on our bogs and the number of people who worked there.  The credit for the <Col N="408" /> strides made&mdash;and I am speaking independently of all Parties&mdash;no matter what the Labour people in front of me may say, must be given to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>To come to the issue which we are debating tonight, as I interrupted the Minister for Transport and Power during his speech to say, I am sorry for him because he was in a very unenviable position.  First of all, he was trying to defend something which he must know was wrong. Secondly, he obviously had not the facts and figures with which to defend it.  Thirdly, he was trying to make a point, one which cannot be accepted in this House, that, when we are taking into account pension schemes in future, we must take into account the amount of contributory old age pension. <Col N="409" /> That is a principle that will never be accepted whether it comes from this Minister or anyone else.  It is a shocking state of affairs to find a Minister trying to defend something, first of all, by saying that the actuarial records show that it is not possible to give a better pension and then saying that, of course, the contributory old age pension must be taken into account and to try to lump together that pension which they will get and for which they will be paying from Bord na Móna and the pension which they will get from the State and for which they will also be paying, and to say that those combined compare favourably with the pensions of the clerical staff in the office and with those of civil servants.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Norton said, none of us begrudges the pensions which civil servants are getting.  We think they are earning them but we in these benches will never allow anybody, let it be Minister of State or anybody else, to try to make out that the people who are, in fact, doing the work are not entitled to a more just reward than is proposed here.  I repeat what I have said twice already, that but for the workers on the bogs the officials of Bord na Móna would have no reason for existence.  While the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, introduced a fair scheme for the officials, the Minister for Transport and Power has allowed his name to be linked with a scheme which certainly will not bring much credit to him or anybody else connected with it.  I am sorry for the Minister.  I thought he was doing his best to defend something he knew was wrong.  I was amazed to find him comparing what Bord na Móna workers would get if they worked for the next 40 years, until the year 2003, and relating that to 1963 standards.  If the rules of order allowed, I would suggest it was a dishonest approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave another comparison also.  I gave a comparison with lesser service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave comparisons of 30 years and 40 years <Col N="410" /> and 40 years would bring us to 2003 and God knows where any one of us will be when that year comes.</P>
      <P>The point the Minister made about the relationship between the contributory old age pension and Bord na Móna pensions is the kernel of the situation.  I would appeal to the Minister not to oppose the annulment of this Order.  He knows in his heart that the Order is wrong.  He knows in his heart that this scheme is not welcome and is being forced on the employees of Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Deputy Treacy was not correct when he said that Bord na Móna employees are being forced into accepting the scheme through fear of dismissal.  Without one word about dismissal being said to them, it is a fact that Bord na Móna workers feel that those who do accept the scheme will be retained in employment. The Minister, if he knows anything about Bord na Móna, knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, it is unfair that in this discussion we cannot get at the real nigger in the woodpile.  The nigger in the woodpile, in my opinion, is the Minister for Finance.  It is rather unfair that a Minister such as the Minister for Transport and Power should have to try to bolster up an argument in favour of a scheme that is so bad. Deputy Dillon said that he was not quite sure whether or not the comparisons which have been given here are fair.  I can assure him that the figures we have given are taken from the regulations, from Bord na Móna's own documents and, compared with the pension scheme for local authority employees, the Bord na Móna scheme is a shocker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has tried to make the case that the employees of Bord na Móna would be paying a smaller contribution and referred to the contribution being paid by other State and semi-State employees.  If the Minister wants to have the amount of social welfare benefits which they will receive at the age of 70 counted in, he must count in what they are paying for them, that is, 5s. 6d. a week.  If we add to that the contribution towards the Bord <Col N="411" /> na Móna pension scheme, the true cost becomes apparent.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the scheme had been introduced a few years ago what would have happened.  If the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power had their way, would we now have an attempt made to take from the roadworkers the pension scheme they got?  If we were to follow the same line of reasoning, if it is contended that a Bord na Móna employee who is getting £10 a week and who has 30 years' service should be satisfied with 46s. 3d. when he reaches 65 years of age, it follows that it must be contended that it is wrong that a county council worker who has the same service should be able to get £5 8s. per week.  The Minister is on very dangerous ground.  The Labour Party must oppose his attitude.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again to allow the annulment to be made, to have another look at this scheme, to see if there is a possibility of doing the decent thing and not to let it go out from the House that the members of Dáil Éireann accepted a scheme which suggested that a person whose wages were £6 a week, after 30 years' <Col N="412" /> service, would have to be satisfied with a pension of 11s. 6d., particularly having regard to the fact that the old age pension does not become applicable until the age of 70.  If Bord na Móna have their way, according to the scheme laid down, they can knock off employees at 60 years of age and 65 years of age.  There is not much other employment in rural areas.  Such employees could finish up without even the entitlement to a full old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been using figures which would suggest that the contributory old age pension invariably includes an allowance for a wife.  Many of these employees were never able to afford a wife on the wages they were getting.  They are single men.  Their pension will be £2 5s. per week.  Whether or not they will survive until the year 2003 and what the pension will be then, I do not know, but I would say that even in 1963, those who are retiring might feel that, perhaps, they would be better off without having the name of the pension which Bord na Móna are attempting to wish on them.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,490,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payments of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was saying that, as in the marketing of milk products, there was a need for proper research in the use of brand names in relation to our pig meat and bacon and into the certainty of productivity for marketing abroad. Again, as in the case of milk products, the volume in the latter has not been constant.  While the quality may have been good, particularly since the institution of the grading system introduced by Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, at the same time we did not get credit for that quality, credit in the shape of pounds, shillings and pence, because when the trade was built up the fact is we no longer had anything to export.</P>
      <P>In the normal cycle, there is, first of all, a great increase in the number of sows with a resultant increase in bonhams and fat pigs.  Notwithstanding the grading system introduced, because there were too many pigs, or a larger number of them available, the price dropped.  Now that pig cycle seems to have started all over again. The latest figure shows a six per cent decrease in the number of sows.  If we cannot remedy the situation we will find ourselves back on the old road and the old road did not get us the highest price or, more important still, the premium.  Taking it any way you like, whether as a saving to the Exchequer and the taxpayer, or an increase to the farmer, the price obtainable would indicate that justice demands an increase to the farmer, if you can get it, but you will never get it until there is a standard quality and an improvement in breeding.  That could be achieved possibly by the establishment of pig fattening stations from which sows would be issued to the small farmer to do the job the large producer will not undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious, however, that the small producer will no longer be satisfied with a small profit on a small number of fat pigs, and all that we can offer him in present conditions is a small profit.  The real answer is in the large number.  If we establish pig fattening stations by direct State intervention or ministerial encouragement, <Col N="418" /> as has been suggested, we can provide for the small farmer, who depends for quite a large part of his income on pigs and sows, the certainty of a profit. Some people will disagree with that but the more specialised job is the pig fattening particularly if one intends to work to a certain grade.</P>
    <P>Losses on wheat are included in this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister has indicated that not all the losses are included and a further sum will appear in next year's general Estimate. Wheat is a particularly difficult part of our farming economy.  Only since 1953 has there been a constant surplus of, or enough, Irish wheat in the grist.  In December, 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government produced its departmental paper on the quantity of wheat we could use in our grist.  The figure was 300,000 tons.  Subsequently it was reduced to 280,000 tons.  Now it is 265,000 tons.  If the practice is to introduce wheat into the grist at a relatively high price in relation to the industrial wage structure, the reduction in the consumption of flour and home-baked bread, which is a dying art really, is something that reduces the price to the farmer and his opportunities for sale.</P>
    <P>The first thing that must be said is that there is grave doubt in many people's minds as to whether or not there has been enough constancy in approach and enough fair play all the time in so far as judgment of quality is concerned.  If you look at the percentage included in the grist, which is how the miller must look at the quality, there are strange divergencies from what we might expect.  For instance, in 1952-53, at the stage when this continuing surplus had first appeared, we had a bad year and only 38 per cent of the Irish wheat went into grist.  The relevance of this is that the more that goes into grist, the less loss there is to the Exchequer.  If more had gone in the previous year, less money would require to be voted now.</P>
    <P>In 1953-54, the figure was 71 per cent; in 1954-55, 68 per cent.  That was one of the worst harvests.  In 1955-56, it was 74 per cent.  When you come to 1958-59, it is 18 per cent, after the harvest of 1958.  Every harvest brings <Col N="419" /> its own difficult problems but it does not appear logical to me that after the rotten harvest of 1954, you could still proceed on a basis of about 70 per cent and avoid loss to the Exchequer and the farmers and that in the year 1958-59, which represented the bad harvest of 1958, you had only 18 per cent.  In 1959-60, we had a reduction in the quantity of wheat and an increase in the quantity of barley and we had 58 per cent for grist.  In 1960-61, when again we had a bad year, the percentage came down to 33 and then went up to 65.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will be the outcome of this year's operations but it appears there is grave doubt in the public mind as to whether the same judgment was accorded the wheat in every year, bearing in mind the different problems of different wheat harvests.  That is something the Minister might dwell on when replying, something which might be looked into.  I am also convinced that there is an opportunity for saving if our bakers will produce greater variety of bread. In general, but particularly in the country, we do not get the variety of bread to encourage a greater use of it. The more bread we use, the less will be the loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are three subheads in this Vote and under subhead 4 come <i>ex gratia</i> payments to growers.  Here again is the same situation.  If more of that wheat had been included in the grist, there would be less need for <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  Everybody doubts if sufficient wheat was included in the grist.  On 20th March last, I asked the Minister if it was a fact that at the end of the season it was found that the method of testing for maltose in the Central Laboratory, which was set up last year as an intermediary between the millers and the farmers, had a constant error in its results.  Because of this, I believe that much wheat was sent out as unmillable which, if the result had been correct, would have been accepted as millable.</P>
    <P>With laboratory tests of lots, you are not in a position to produce an absolutely certain result in respect of any one lot.  I believe that laboratory <Col N="420" /> testing by the maltose method, the method specified as the deciding factor in one part of the wheat quality problem, is something that depends very largely on the taking of samples. I think the ready-made Hagberg test, which was a quick test of maltose content, was similarly subject to the taking of samples and that you could take two samples from the same lot of wheat and very often get different results.  It is possible for the miller who wants to buy in one parcel to be right four times out of five and that is sufficient for his purpose in getting his parcel together, but it is rather hard luck on the fifth farmer whose test proves wrong.</P>
    <P>Even with careful taking of samples and the utmost care in laboratory tests, I think that situation can arise and therefore, while this arrangement was made between the NFA on behalf of the farmers and the millers, it might be better next year to cut out laboratory tests completely and use them only for the information of those who had to put together the wheat and get maltose content for the purpose of making successful bread.  That is my honest opinion.  It may find favour and it may not but I give it because I believe it is true and not in any spirit of criticism of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The recoupment in respect of the export of wheat is something that must be looked at also, because, while I agree with the Minister who indicated in his speech that you cannot feed 100 per cent wheat to animals, that you must produce a rational balance, that it is too strong and must be thinned down by the addition of other cereals such as barley and oats, at the same time, I question that on the figures he supplies it is necessary to export wheat this year at all.  Losses on export are very considerable and the arrangement at present operating is already subject to grave doubt.  While the responsibility is the Minister's and when you make arrangements with different bodies, I agree it is not possible to make speeches about them here afterwards giving every detail just as it happens.  Parliament is a place where there is a searching Opposition, which is as it should be, but there is <Col N="421" /> grave public unrest about the arrangement whereby the Federation of Irish Feedingstuff Manufacturers gave up their right to import to importers, distributors who were then granted the right to import all coarse grains in return for which they were prepared to take up the barley crop at a given price and market it within the country or export it, if there was a surplus.</P>
    <P>This criticism has been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, inasmuch as nobody knows what are the prices of the offals coming in but on barley, there is a loss and that loss must be made good through the profit on imports.  An operation such as that must not only be just but it must be seen to be just.  I am a member, or at least my firm is a member, of one of these groups.  I imply no dishonesty or anything like that, but it is necessary that justice should also be seen to be done.  I also question whether or not it is necessary for such a concession to be given to a particular group within the country just, shall we say, to provide the money to take up the barley at harvest time.  The provision of money for such an operation in a basic industry is not of such great difficulty.  I am not suggesting that an agency such as An Bord Gráin might be a better thing but it is something that could be investigated. I feel that the misgivings which a lot of people have are justified inasmuch as people are entitled to know whether or not they are getting the best bargain that can be got for them.  That is not a vicious criticism of the Minister or of anybody else but it is a fair appraisal of the situation.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister adverted in what I would describe as a rather derogatory fashion to the efforts of certain farmers' organisations to get some increase in remuneration for their members.  The whole basis of forward movement is agreement, and cordial agreement, between the Minister and the farming bodies.  The Minister in his circulated speech referred to various pronouncements made recently by some people who claimed to speak for the farming community.  I take it that these were pronouncements made by the ICMSA and the National Farmers' Association. <Col N="422" /> The Minister is quite unwise to treat them in that fashion.  Whether the Minister likes it or whether I like it, they are the people who speak for the creamery farmers.  There is no other group which speaks for them with the strength and representation of those two groups and there is no vying for power between each group in this particular representation.  It is something they are both doing in their own way for their own members, just as perhaps a claim for increased wages might be made in some industry by the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union working together for their members in the same concern.  That is the context.  There is no reason why there should not be two such organisations with their members to support and particular duties to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister also produced a lot of statistics.  He said that the increase in the yield per cow was from 370 gallons in 1953 to 460 gallons this year.  I accept his figures as the figures he got from his Department or from the various Government sources, but if the starting off point was 370 gallons it is a pretty poor show that the figure now is only 460 gallons.  When he says that the return per cow was £41 in 1962, the last year for which he had figures, and was £32 in 1953, he is talking about gross income.  Whenever one looks at a balance sheet the gross income and profit figure is a very nice academic one but it is not worth a hat of crabs until you get the net income.  Incidentally, the Minister claims this as a result of Government policy.  I would not claim it and our Government were in power for a period during that time.  I would say it was as a result of the activities of the farmers' organisations, the greater education and interest in the land which they generated.  They provided better housing, feeding and breeding and as a result got this increase.  But I would not claim it and neither should the Minister.</P>
    <P>Against the increase to £41 per cow, you have to put all the increased costs since 1953.  Remember that between 1953 and 1963 agricultural prices were exactly the same.  The agricultural <Col N="423" /> price index, taking the base year 1953 at 100, varied in the last year from 96, 97 to 100.6 and I think at one stage it went over 101 so that as far as a practical appraisal of the situation is concerned the farmers in general get the same price as in 1953 with far greater costs.  The Minister's statement of an increase to £41 is on the basis of that, that they must pare from that £9 per cow for greater costs.  I do not know what the Minister finds but I find that my production costs for milk are up by 30 to 40 per cent during that period.  Perhaps I am lucky to be in the Dublin milk sales district where there are more stringent regulations as to the production of milk.  That all costs money but by and large we are a bit better off than creamery farmers at the moment despite the extra regulations and we are entitled to be.  At the same time, my costs are up by 30 to 40 per cent and if the Minister works it out and pursues his statistics to their logical conclusion, then, instead of having an increase in net income, he will have a considerable decrease.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech then proceeded to the question of supports which the farmer received.  He talked about the relief of rates on agricultural land.  There was, last year, a relief of rates to the extent of some £2½ million. Sometimes when I meet members of the Fianna Fáil Party, we talk about these things and recently a couple of them admitted that they felt that the Fianna Fáil Party got bad value out of this operation because it was mainly the larger farmers who got this increase.  That is a political statement. I do not know whether it is right or wrong, but anyone who is a member of a local authority and has been through the rates operation this year, as I have been on two local authorities, is quite satisfied that, when the eventual figures are compiled for the whole country, it will be found that almost all the increase in grants last year on the rates for agricultural land will have been swallowed up in an increased poundage rate.</P>
    <P>That, perhaps, is something which is proceeding but you must remember that the farmers did not go out to <Col N="424" /> march in every town in Ireland until they were practically at the end of their tether.  They did not just go out because there was 1/- or 2/- on the rates one year.  They went out because there was a continual increase on agricultural land and they could not bear it any longer.  They got some relief, but in the following year, according to the figures we have available so far, this was to be wiped out by an increase in the poundage rate.  It is all right to say that the farmer does not pay income tax, but he is, on the other hand, the only person who is paying a rate or levy on his stock-in-trade as well as paying rates on his farm buildings, his farmhouse, on his green fields, on his cornfields, on his entire holding.</P>
    <P>So that particular argument of the Minister is exploded.  The Land Project is down but I should like to deal with that later when we get to the question of savings in this Vote.  Talking about agricultural research, the Minister probably included Marshall Aid money.  I do not say he did but perhaps he did.  At page 6, the Minister mentions the income per farm family member.  Again, he is talking about gross income.  Take four family members: father, mother, son and daughter, on a typical farm.  As well as the gross income we must also take the costs before you get down to the £1 the daughter has to spend on clothes, the £1 the son has as pocket money or the money the father and mother have to run the home, and to make subtractions from the Minister's figures.</P>
    <P>I do not think he has proved at all that there is an increase in the real remuneration of the farming community, their sons and daughters, since 1953.  When you take the question of costs as against increases in gross incomes, even accepting the Minister's figures, you must also take the increase in the cost of living and the decrease in the value of the £.  You must grant that the value of the £ is now only 10/11 as compared with 1945.  Does not that again explode the Minister's statement that the farmers are better off?  The Minister was wrong and unwise in producing that theory.  I do not think he will succeed in convincing <Col N="425" /> them in the country that they are better off, because they know they are worse off.  Any improvement in production is a result of their own efforts and of encouragements given by all Governments, including the Minister's.  There are savings which have decreased the amount of the Supplementary Estimate and the first one mentioned is the saving under E3, on page 202 of the Book of Estimates, which deals with the improvement in poultry and egg production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I referred to it was that the amount of the Supplementary Estimate, which is £6,015,000 odd, was decreased by the savings at subheads E3, K7, K11, KK11, K13 and M4 by £1,524,985, but if you, Sir, rule that I may not discuss these savings, then it is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly all right.  They can be discussed on the main Estimate.  Therefore, I say the Minister, in introducing this Vote, was wrong in saying that the farmers were better off.  He has failed to convince them and no matter what he says in reply he will not convince them.  I feel also that the amount of effort which should have been put into agricultural marketing and into maintaining constancy in supplies has not gone in and that we have waited too long from 1957 until now for the reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board and of An Bord Bainne.  I feel that we are starting a long time too late.  I submit that certain aspects of Government policy indicate that the Minister is going easy on matters introduced by the Opposition, such as the Land Project, and that this is a great pity.  Anybody who sees the amount of land requiring rehabilitation throughout the country will realise a lot remains to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Deputy Norton asked some days ago if anybody knew what the Minister's policy is.  That is a big question.  Is it his policy to increase agricultural production in the items I mention&mdash; in pigs, in milk, in grain?  Is his policy to deflate production so that you have lack of faith in increased production because with it you will face lower prices and difficulty in marketing?  Are the Government prepared to face up to the initial difficulties there will be in subsidisation of agricultural exports until we can ensure our reputation through constancy of supplies?  The Minister has not convinced me, the Dáil or the people that he is making any effort towards increased production and, therefore, the Government must be adjudged a failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to make a brief comment on the closing words of Deputy Donegan, let me assure him it was not my intention &mdash;I should say, perhaps, it was not my hope&mdash;in my introductory speech to secure an admission from members of the Opposition that they approved of what I had said or approved of all I intended doing.  The purpose of my speech was not to prove that the farmers were tremendusly well off or that they were not legitimately entitled to make claims and demands of one kind or another.  My speech was really designed to place on record, in face of a tremendous amount of misrepresentation, what the real facts of the situation were, without, as I said, gloating over them in any shape or form.  Every figure that is given, every comparison that is made, every year that is selected is selected but not for the purpose of making a case from my point of view.  If you take one of the years that have been selected, it will be conceded that I selected that year because it was a very bad agricultural year&mdash;bad because of the elements and because the Almighty ordained that it should be bad&mdash;but I selected it, too, because it was my first year in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to those who are <Col N="427" /> legitimately entitled to complain on behalf of the farmers that there is no figure in that speech of mine that can be controverted.  I admit quite freely&mdash; why should I not&mdash;that farmers are entitled to organise themselves in whatever way they wish and to make their demands, supported by reasonable arguments or otherwise.  When Deputy Donegan takes umbrage at the language I used in expressing myself in my opening speech, and regards the words I chose as condemnatory, I must say that he or they&mdash;if they do&mdash;has or have a very tender skin.  They speak, of course, for the farmers; I speak for the farmers.  I have often sat in conference with them.  I never want to take away from their effort and their intention but when organisations such as these go a wee bit too far and indulge in extravagant talk and proceed to deny the facts, then it is only natural that at some point or other the Minister for Agriculture should publicly state the facts.</P>
    <P>Any man in this office will admit&mdash; if he speaks the truth&mdash;that in dealing with the different organisations which claim to speak for farmers, they are not in all cases as fair as they should be with a Minister for Agriculture&mdash; and I am putting it mildly.  Although I have not the reputation of a man with the best temper in the world, I have very often held myself in control under the greatest provocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>What on earth would have happened if the Minister had not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  As has been said, I believe there should be some degree of understanding between these organisations and the Minister who represents and speaks for the industry in the Cabinet.  If I wanted to be critical of their activities and of some of their pronouncements, I could have been critical over the years. While I am sure they were not engaging in these activities with the intention of injuring agriculture, just as I can prove the figures I have given, I could have established, with evidence that is incontrovertible, that some of these efforts on their part were not <Col N="428" /> conducive to assisting the agricultural industry or any of its producers.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely that a Minister for Agriculture should do his best to keep the relationship as good as possible. However, it would not be any harm if those who speak for these organisations would keep in mind the fact that they, too, have a contribution to make. When they come before a Minister to speak about agricultural matters and the interests of those engaged in that industry, they should bear in mind that they are speaking to a person who has a knowledge of the subject, too.  He might not have the knowledge of a technician but he has a knowledge of the subject to the extent which practically all of them have and he has an interest in the welfare of the industry, apart altogether from the responsibilities he holds as Minister. It is rather aggravating to find oneself described as a person who is without interest and to have figures and arguments advanced that are not accurate to establish the case which it is sought to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter to which I wish to refer briefly is the whole question of milk and milk prices.  I have said this before but it is well established practice in this House that speeches are repeated year after year.  Sometimes I find it difficult to select different words to repeat something which must be repeated.  I have always felt myself inclined towards those who are engaged in milk production.  I realise it is the most important branch of the agricultural industry.  So many things depend upon it.  That is particularly the case at present.  Everybody agrees that the right policy is to encourage, to educate and to support our farmers to treat their land properly so as to improve its carrying capacity; to provide better farm buildings and a modern water supply; to reclaim the land and to fertilise it; to make use of the generous provision which the State offers in respect of all of these things, including lime.  That must mean that the land will ultimately improve to the point where its carrying capacity will also be increased.  If it did not have that result, we need not be enthusiastic about the effort.  Some <Col N="429" /> time ago, I had to take a motion in the Seanad which proposed that the Government should give a subsidy on calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am the first to transgress in this respect, but if I am, I shall not transgress for long. When that matter was being discussed, my reply to those who made that proposition, and my reply to a proposition which was made later to me by the NFA on the same lines, was this: there is no way that I know by which to achieve that desirable end more effectively, more efficiently and with less waste of organisational effort than through the price of milk.  However, when all the implications connected with the price of milk are considered, most people who are milk producers will realise what this problem is, the difficulties to be confronted there as far as milk products and the disposal of surplus products are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is no easy way out of that.  I have often explained here the factors that must be kept in mind.  One of them&mdash;and it is a wonderful thing to have&mdash;is that there is a high consumption of butter here, the second highest in Europe, maybe the world.  The level of the price here is fairly high and even if there were the choice of increasing the price of milk those who are producing milk and selling it cannot be indifferent to the ultimate result of increasing the price of milk.  If the price of butter increased as a result, would it have the effect of decreasing at home the consumption of butter, with the other attendant risks that would arise, the attendant expenses that would be incurred and the risks of marketing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal can be achieved in the way of increasing our livestock population, if our farmers will continue, as I hope they will, to make use of the aids available for the improvement of their land.  A great deal can be done to increase the cattle population and one can see the good effects. However, the marketing problem is there and when Deputy Donegan was <Col N="430" /> talking, for example, about our failure in the past to market whatever surplus butter there was&mdash;there was a number of years in which we did not have enough, not to speak of having a surplus&mdash;he seemed to think there was a tremendous amount of neglect on the part of the Department because they did not set about marketing it in the form in which Bord Bainne have decided upon recently, which I am glad to say appears to have been successful so far.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong and entirely unfair, however, for any Deputy or anybody outside the House who has not had an opportunity of examining the facts to go away with the idea that such an approach was never thought of before.  Of course, it was. Before ever Bord Bainne was even established it was thought of but when a surplus of butter came it happened that the market for that surplus of butter was substantially in the neighbouring Six Counties, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Antrim, Down, Armagh and Derry.  We could sell the greater part of our surplus there because they were our own people.  They knew our butter.  They knew the conditions under which it was produced.  They knew its flavour and they were prepared to give more for it than for any other butter.  Some time after that, about 1957, this question came before me and I can tell Deputy Donegan and the other members of the House that I was as anxious as anybody would be to get the greatest possible price for our surplus butter and prepared to take a risk in the marketing of it in order to secure that end.</P>
    <P>I had to ask myself a simple question. Here were people who wanted our butter.  They did not want it except in bulk.  They were giving us more for it.  Why should we not hold that rather than adopt the packaging system and try our luck somewhere else? That question came before me and I decided in favour of retaining the market there.  If the circumstances were the same tomorrow&mdash;they are not today nor are they likely to be tomorrow&mdash;I would make the very same decision on the same set of facts.  The position has changed, of course, since <Col N="431" /> the introduction in Great Britain of the quota system.  It changed radically in that regard.  An Bord Bainne did wisely.  They did what I would have done and what the Department would have done, I suppose, at any time during a period when they had surplus butter for disposal, if that question came up that has come forward recently.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that to take away in any fashion from the efforts of those who are now charged with this work but it is only right that the facts should be put straight and I am putting the facts as I personally know them to have been over the years since 1957 when we did come into a surplus of butter.</P>
    <P>It is not, then, for want of understanding or appreciation of the importance of this business that there has ever been any hesitancy on my part of contribute, if I could, to see it treated, if not generously, at least fairly, but there is no means by which you can talk yourself out of many of the problems that exist in relation to the marketing of milk products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made reference here today to a matter that has been referred to from this side and by myself on a number of occasions.  I am very glad that he did because I had never any desire in the case of Deputy Dillon or of any other Deputy to pin down on him anything more than he had made himself responsible for or to misrepresent the situation in any way.  I am referring to the letter which he issued to the co-operative societies in 1950-51.  I have a copy of it in the Office.  I never claimed that that letter contained a policy decision by the Government as to what the price of milk should be.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that I resented. Since it was his letter, dictated by him, signed by him, containing a proposal which he recommended to the co-operative movement for their acceptance, making it clear that if they did not decide to accept it, it was their responsibility, putting the onus on them to say yes or no, I never wanted him to admit more than what was in that <Col N="432" /> document but I never felt that he was justified in referring to me and to those who may have otherwise made use of it as wanting to put over on the public a lie.  I did not, in any case.  As far as I am concerned, I am glad that Deputy Dillon made the contribution on the subject which he made in the course of the debate on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Turning to this matter of pig production, the marketing of pigs, and the problem that exists in relation to it, I do not think there would be much disagreement between my view and the view of those on any side of the House who are interested in this industry. Just as I regard the production of milk and milk products, I regard the pig industry as a tremendously important one for our people.  I am not saying this in a critical way&mdash;we all change our minds; perhaps we do not change our minds often; it would not be wise to appear to be a shuttlecock in political affairs and economic matters&mdash;but Deputy Dillon gave me the impression that he had changed tremendously quickly on this question of the pattern our pig production should take in future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should not mention this now because I have not armed myself with the Official Report of the debate on an Estimate of mine some time after I had introduced a grant towards the erection of larger piggeries by co-operative societies and private individuals all over the country but I seem to think that on that occasion Deputy Dillon warned me&mdash;and I thought there was a good deal in the warning, although in my case it was not necessary. He seemed to think that I was turning to the idea of the mass production of bacon pigs rather than production by the traditional method which obtained on the small holdings and the giving of help to the smallholders and their families to secure a modest living.  That was exactly my own notion and that is exactly my own notion yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances have changed a little with the new grading system.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we will take all these things into account.  I know it is <Col N="433" /> not relevant to the discussion but in this case also it has been mentioned in the course of the debate and I suppose I can briefly refer to it.  When we talk in terms of small holdings and the disappearance of small farms and all the influences that are at work outside and the thinking of many people as to the need for the enlargement of farms, and so on, and when we show our resentment of that line of thought, I do not know how, on the other hand, you can switch around to your pig and bacon industry and say: &ldquo;We are going to mechanise this business and we are going to leave only to these small producers who were helped in their struggle for a living, not only the breeding of young pigs but in certain cases the finishing of pigs.&rdquo;  If we cannot get something profitable such as the breeding of pigs and the finishing of pigs in which the small holder will engage, I can see no substitute that will ensure that he will be able to get the modest income he requires.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when, with the approval of the Government, I decided to introduce grants for piggeries for cooperatives and private interests and those who went in for this type of business, I had in mind that they could make a number of useful contributions. I dreaded the thought&mdash;and I dread it still&mdash;of the bacon producing business being handed over entirely even from the bonham stage, to that kind of effort.</P>

      <P>I hope not.  I said I thought&mdash;I am speaking from memory &mdash;that a number of these scattered throughout the country would be helpful in many ways, that there would be continuity of supply, that there would be a demonstration to those who were engaged in the business, whether as cooperatives or otherwise, of the size of the unit that would prove profitable, and so on.  All the time I hoped that <Col N="434" /> our small producers and finishers throughout the country would take advantage of the grants to increase the size of their finishing piggeries.  I hoped that some of the small farmers I know best would increase the size of their piggeries, say, four or five times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any useful information on that, but I will come to it later.  As I say, the thought I had in mind was that we could induce our smaller producer to increase the size of his unit so as to increase his earnings, whatever they were, three or four times per annum. I had the belief, and I have it still, that there is no organisation which can be set up that will produce pigs as economically as that type of man, if you can induce him to fit himself out with housing accommodation which will serve that purpose.  That is why, as I say, in introducing this scheme of grants for larger units, I feared that someone would get it into his head that I, as Minister, had abandoned all hope for that kind of person, and that I was turning instead to an effort that would result in our producing perhaps the same number of pigs in a limited number of institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister speaking of producing or finishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When I talk about producing, I have finishing in mind. I was in West Cork and I attended the opening of one of those concerns and I heard people supporting the idea that the small man was the ideal man&mdash; which I agree he is&mdash;to produce bonhams, but I would not like, if that were conceded and if that were finally <Col N="435" /> the practice, to see that state of affairs to which I refer coming about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's new grading will produce that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of grading difficulties and the experience of those who have been engaged in the finishing business since these efforts were made to improve the quality and standard, I admit that you cannot do something like this without hurting someone.  You do not want to do that. It is not a question of deliberately setting out to injure someone, or making it more difficult for him to make a profit, but this is a very keen and competitive business.  You know that the quality and flavour of the bacon you are exporting are in all probability &mdash;almost of a certainly&mdash;better than most but there is still something lacking.</P>
      <P>Before any of these changes were made, as I pointed out in the course of my remarks when introducing the Supplementary Estimate, I and my officials had many consultations with other interests.  The fact that a Minister mentions that he has had consultations with other interests does not mean that they agreed with what he indicated he intended to do, but those discussions are held for the purpose of arriving at a clearer understanding of their points of view.  If someone has to take a little bit of a knock, you try to do the best you can to make it as easy as possible for him.</P>
      <P>I do not remember&mdash;and I am sure that all down the years people before me have discovered the same, and will after me&mdash;an occasion on which if something had to be done, some decision had to be made, or some change had to be effected in your long term interests, someone was not at my elbow saying: &ldquo;Do not do it now; we are not ready for it.&rdquo;  To some extent, it may be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If you listen to those promptings which are well-intended, if you heed them all the time, and if you allow them to guide you and <Col N="436" /> restrain you from making a decision, when you know yourself that the facts demand that changes must be effected you never get a decision.  What is more important, you know that people will never really prepare themselves until they have to.  It is my experience that, while they may make some feeble effort to see a point of view, no matter what warnings or exhortations are given, they will never settle down to prepare themselves and to say: &ldquo;Now we are ready for this.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We made these alterations because we felt they were necessary.  I believe they are necessary and that they will prove useful in the future.  They were made also because the taxpayer had to come to the aid of this important industry in a very substantial way.  It was only reasonable that, when we found ourselves feeling the pinch in a big way in respect of disposing of this surplus, we should try to put our house in order and make some contribution towards cutting these losses.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into all the steps being taken and all the hopes we have in respect of the progeny testing going on and the results we hope these efforts will bring before long.  We made that decision appreciating that in certain cases very severe hardship would result to the producer.  We made provision&mdash;it may not be completely adequate to meet his losses&mdash;to cushion the producer so as not to discourage him if he happened to feel the pinch more at a particular time than at another.  I would ask pig producers to realise that we are pressing this forward.  All my life I have heard people say: &ldquo;You cannot go on; we are not just ready.&rdquo;  But the stage is ultimately reached when you have to make a decision to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that decision must be made in such a way as to make the least possible dent in the earnings of those whose business depends on the production of this commodity.  At the same time, you must go ahead steadfastly, knowing that only in that way can you achieve the position for our bacon that we know we are capable of securing.  All my life I have heard people talking about what the producers <Col N="437" /> in other countries can do and the standards they can reach and asking why we cannot do it here.  Every Deputy, especially if he has had any connection with agriculture, has heard these statements.</P>
    <P>I feel certain we can do as good as the best of them.  It is a matter of deciding to make a firm start.  Now we have made it.  If it has injured a section of the producers, I would not want them to think that will continue. I believe they are entitled to say with us in this House: &ldquo;We are making an effort to put our house in order and to put our produce on the market as good and as efficiently as any other country.&rdquo;  That is what I am aiming at here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves pigs, does he not feel a certain sense of guilt in not having produced a single pig progeny testing station in seven years?  Does he not think it is an essential prerequisite to getting the new breeds of pigs that we should have the pig population pretty widely progeny tested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like blaming the other fellow for delays of one kind or another.  This is a world in which you see that sort of thing happening.  I am inclined to lose my patience when I see the time it takes to get many of these things going.  However, I think another progeny testing station will be ready about May&mdash;I am not sure&mdash; and we have plans for another.  Sometimes it is not so easy to get these buildings completed.  That is all I want to say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point made by Deputy Donegan which I resent because it is not true.  The figure given in the speech in respect of the expenditure on the Land Project was less than in 1953 when Sections A and B were in operation.  I could have <Col N="438" /> left that figure out if I wanted.  I did not leave it out because I was delighted the figure was so substantial, having regard to the fact that only Section A was in operation for the past few years. In my view, that established a different point altogether from what Deputy Donegan was trying to prove.  I can assure the House that, if a scheme were a good one, never in my life would I do other than operate it enthusiastically.  That is so in this case. I am more than pleased that, notwithstanding the fact only Section A has been operating, we are now spending almost as much on Section A as we did on the two.</P>
      <P>Let me now deal with a few matters raised by Deputy Dillon.  Our contribution to the world food organisation is 840,000 dollars&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>£300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of which 240,000 dollars is in cash and 600,000 dollars in food.  The 600,000 dollars for food consists of 500,000 dollars worth of milk products, mainly butter, and 100,000 dollars worth of meat, vegetables, sugar, cereals, and the products of AFD would, of course, also be acceptable under this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what I have already said, I can scarcely dissent from that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of water schemes was raised also.  That was one of the first things I set about after I went back to the Department.  I dislike seeing the same type of skill being divided between two Departments. That is objectionable because one has a certain amount of work done by an official of the Department of Agriculture and a certain amount of work done by an official of the Department of Local Government.  Having too many officials tripping over one another can have a demoralising effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set about remedying the position. I found it most difficult because when two schemes, designed to serve the same purpose more or less, are administered by two different Departments, the more difficult the situation becomes as the schemes develop.  I think, however, <Col N="439" /> that we have now made a fair division of the work.  As far as the dwellinghouse is concerned, the Department of Local Government make grants and they must, therefore, inspect and so on.  If the owner decides to extend the water from the dwellinghouse to his out-offices, then it becomes a matter for us.  Roughly that is the agreement we have made.  It will come into effect in a short time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the contribution towards agricultural research. It comes from the good old taxpayer, the person who has to foot most of the bills in the long run.  I am very greatful to the House for the way in which this Supplementary Estimate has been treated.</P>
