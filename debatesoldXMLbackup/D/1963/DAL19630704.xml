      <P>I cannot quite do that but this is as far as agreement has been reached.  It has been agreed to take the Finance Bill on Tuesday next when the House will meet from 3 to 10.30 p.m., Sections 1 to 39, inclusive, and any amendments thereto. On Wednesday, 10th July, the House will meet from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.  All sections up to Section 44 inclusive and amendments thereto are to be disposed of by 12 noon.  Sections 45 and 46 with amendments thereto will be disposed of by 8 p.m. and Sections 47 to 65 and amendments thereto are to be disposed of by 10.30 p.m.  On Thursday, 11th July, the House will sit from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. to take the remaining <Col N="286" /> sections of the Finance Bill in Committee. On Tuesday, 16th July, the House will meet at 3 p.m. until 10.30 p.m. to take the Finance Bill on Report Stage and amendments thereto. On Wednesday, 17th July, it has been agreed to take the Finance Bill on the Fifth Stage, the motion to be put at 10.30 p.m.  No business will be taken on these days except the Finance Bill, except if the Finance Bill should end prior to 10.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9th July, other business may be taken thereafter until 10.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the Dáil should adjourn on Friday, 19th July, for the summer recess, but I am not in a position to inform the House as to the business or hours of sitting for Thursday, 18th, and Friday, 19th.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 227:</P>
      <P>To add to the section new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) An appeal shall lie from every determination of the arbitrator under subsection (1) of this section to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the county where the land, or part of the land which is the subject of a claim for payment of compensation, is situate.</P>
      <P>( ) Rules of Court shall provide for appeals under subsection (2) of this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section is drafted, it does not provide for an appeal from the award of the arbitrator.  Furthermore the section does not specifically say that any Rules of Court are to be made, and if they were not made, there <Col N="289" /> would be legal disorder in regard to this matter.  We think it desirable that there should be this right of appeal from the award if a person feels aggrieved, particularly having regard to the effect of the Minister's amendment last night in respect of a nil award. This amendment is to ensure that in the process of law the individual's democratic rights are safeguarded, and that some Rules of Court will be laid down to provide for appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1919 Act, it is laid down that in land acquisition cases, the findings of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both sides.  There is, of course, an appeal to the High Court on points of law, but only on points of law, and in a rather exceptional circumstance, the arbitrator may have a case stated on something which is agreed and put to him by both sides to the dispute.  This principle of the arbitrator's award being final and binding in land acquisition cases has operated satisfactorily since 1919 and we have not found in all those years any real grievance in that respect.  There is no reason to expect that difficulties will arise in relation to this measure and I suggest to the House that the provision be left as in the Bill which, in my estimation, is the best way to approach this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that the Valuation Act of 1919 has not been found always to work satisfactorily. There are instances where its operation has proved unfair.  As regards an appeal to the High Court on a point of law, the amount of compensation might arise on that.  Under this legislation, appeals are likely to be more numerous.  Much more control will be exercised by planning authorities in regard to property throughout the country and if the determination of appeals were to lie only to the High Court, this would certainly result in long delays in the clearance of business.  Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the appeal should lie to the circuit court in the area in which the land is situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the 1919 Act cannot in general be said to have <Col N="290" /> always worked out quite fairly in every instance.  We are now at the stage in which the State, by legislation, is interfering more and more in the rights of individuals where property is concerned. Concomitant with that, we should, I think, make every legal provision we can to ensure fairplay through the least costly machinery from the point of view of the individual affected.  It is for that reason we say appeal should lie to the circuit court. That court is readily available and there is less risk of prolonged delays. That machinery will also be less costly on those who use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was reviewed as late as 1960 and no change was then proposed, despite the fact that we had had 40 odd years of experience from the time of the passing of the 1919 Act.  The provisions in that Act actually covered the practice that had existed in many cases for over a hundred years previously.</P>
      <P>With regard to arbitrators, official arbitrators are appointed, one might say, by the courts.  They are specialists chosen because of their knowledge of land values and other factors.  The official arbitrator is appointed by the Reference Committee.  Indeed, I think that is the reason why in these arbitration matters over the years, there has not been anything like the difficulty and troubles that could have been anticipated.  In general, real satisfaction has been given all round.  The findings of the arbitrator are binding on both sides and that can be as much of an advantage to the landholder as it is to the body concerned in the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the arbitrators appointed by the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Reference Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Colonel Winters not arbitrator for a long period?  I thought he was appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He was appointed by the Reference Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was an obligation on the Minister to appoint <Col N="291" /> panel of arbitrators from which the interested parties could agree upon one.  In fact, what happened was Colonel Winters was the only person nominated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood there was a statutory obligation on the Minister to appoint a panel of arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Reference Committee consists of the Chief Justice and the president of the Surveyors Institute, or some such body.  There may be a third and that third person would also be legal personnel.  The Reference Committee is the body which draws up the panel upon which the parties to the dispute can draw. So far as Colonel Winters is concerned, he was the only one put forward by the Reference Committee and, therefore, the only arbitrator available to the Minister and to the disputing parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the legislation was that this body should provide a panel so that there could be agreement amongst the parties to the dispute in respect of one member of that panel of eligible persons.  We have been operating under a system in which there is, in fact, only one arbitrator. Deputy Jones's amendment suggests that people should have a choice, that they should be able to go either to the circuit court or to an arbitrator drawn from this panel.  I imagine it would mitigate the objections of Deputy Jones to the section as it stands if there were a guarantee that in future there would be an adequate panel of arbitrators.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us as to whether there is a prospect of an adequate panel being provided now that this substantially new burden will be put upon the arbitration machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are slightly behind the times.  The panel went out of date in 1960 because of certain complaints made by various Deputies, chiefly Deputy Sweetman, I think.  The Property Values Arbitration Act was brought in in 1960 and provided that <Col N="292" /> this Reference Committee should provide an arbitrator or arbitrators.  That is the position at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that makes it all the more necessary to consider favourably Deputy Jones's amendment?  One of the most sacrosanct principles of law and equity is that the contending parties shall have the right to go to somebody with judicial tenure, that is to say, someone who is utterly independent, and, even if his decision is subsequently displeasing to the Executive, there will be no right in the Executive to exclude him from his judicial functions in the future.  If this body to which the Minister refers appoints <i>ad hoc</i> for each case an arbitrator, is there not a serious danger that, if the person appointed gives a decision which is harshly criticised by the Minister for Local Government for the time being as grossly at variance with the intentions of the Town Planning Act, that that person will be fixed at once with notice that the likelihood of his being appointed for a further arbitration, presumably on a fee basis, will be very hypothetical?  On the other hand, parties may say they are quite prepared to accept an arbitrator operating under those conditions and they do not apprehend any such problem as being likely to arise.  There can also be somebody who believes he might have a case for compensation or for exceptional treatment if he had access to an independent judicial person.  He might want to go to a circuit court judge.  Does the Minister see any particular objection to adding a circuit court judge to the panel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have not fully grasped how independent these arbitrators can be.  It is wrong to say that the Minister has any part in their choosing; it would be wrong to deduce from the situation that if a Minister or Ministers should be dissatisfied with the operations of an arbitrator, the arbitrator might not be called upon at a later date and that in that way he would be given notice of ministerial criticism and dissatisfaction to the extent that if he did not pull his socks <Col N="293" /> up and do the work as a Minister thought it should be done, he would be out.</P>
      <P>An arbitrator has in fact a judicial tenure in the sense that no Minister can dispose of him.  He is not on a fee basis but on a salary, so that he is independent of all Ministers and all Departments and may not be removed by any Minister.  He does not have to depend on a fee for any particular job.  In so far as that aspect of Deputy Dillon's argument is concerned, no fear need therefore be held.  I agree that if the position were as Deputy Dillon fears, it would be a serious matter and could lead to just what he has outlined. However, it is not so.  An arbitrator's appointment cannot be put in jeopardy because of a decision with which some Minister may not agree.  The arbitrator will in fact be in a very independent position, and rightly so.  He is completely free to decide according to his own expert knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain I was reading amendments Nos. 227 and 228 together.  Amendments No. 227 provides that an appeal shall lie to the circuit court while amendment No. 228 provides that the circuit court should be added to the panel for arbitration purposes.  Perhaps when we come to the latter amendment, the Minister will consider the argument I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another sideline in relation to the Reference Committee to which I should perhaps refer here.  The full Committee shall consist of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors Institute.  That is the full membership of the Reference Committee whose obligation it is by the law of the land to provide and appoint official arbitrators on whom any or all Departments may call whenever disputes arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 228:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 49, line 37, after &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by the Circuit Court&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the question of compensation and the compensation payable under the section as it stands relates to agreements or to compensation awarded by arbitration.  We seek to have added here the words &ldquo;or by <Col N="295" /> the Circuit Court&rdquo;.  I have already mentioned the provisions under the 1919 Act as far as the arbitrator is concerned, and I cited a case where, in arbitration, an individual suffered a serious loss through being unable to appeal to the circuit court where a much higher award would have been given.  In these compensation cases, the circuit court is competent to be added.  It is a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>This Bill when it becomes an Act will not be dealing with isolated cases. The powers of direction will be increased and enlarged immensely so far as property all over the State is concerned.  The Minister knows that in a good many cases the rights of the individual will be interfered with in this respect.  He must anticipate that a large panel of arbitrators will have to be appointed if cases are to be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the arbitrator who will be appointed will be there in a permanent capacity, and one can appreciate the reluctance there would be, naturally, to any more than a limited number, but if they were to be  limited, the provisions of this measure could not be worked expeditiously. The circuit court is available and competent to deal with these matters.  It has been able to deal with matters of land valuation as between citizens.  We suggest our amendment provides a ready fashion for dealing with appeals where compensation is involved.  It will provide a process which will guarantee to the individual  speedy solution of his dispute with the planning authority and, at the same time, enable the Act to work with expedition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The insertion of these words would not have any meaning and therefore there would be no point on putting them in.  I should like to emphasise that the Reference Committee consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors Institute, so that the appointment of an impartial arbitrator or arbitrators does rest in the hands of two of the very top of our judiciary.  Further than that, I cannot <Col N="296" /> see what assurance one would have by merely referring it to the courts.  After all, we are going to refer to the courts which are presided over by such people as these.  We can surely feel quite satisfied that the Reference Committee, composed as it is of three people, two of whom are the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, will appoint the best arbitrator available, an arbitrator who will be specially qualified.  If more than one arbitrator is required, it will be their obligation also to ensure that such are made available at whatever time they are required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <P>Of course, what the amendment seeks to do is to have the relevant portion read &ldquo;When the amount thereof has been determined by agreement or by arbitration or by the circuit court&rdquo; and the insertion of these words brings in the circuit court as an alternative means of providing the method of determining compensation. You have the agreement method, the arbitration method and then you have the alternative of the circuit court to determine compensation.</P>

      <P>The principle of this amendment is to provide an alternative to the proposal that there should be an appeal to the circuit court from the findings of an arbitrator as was suggested in amendment No. 227.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House decided not to allow an appeal from an arbitrator to the circuit court, then we want to make this case.  We are dealing with the property of individual citizens.  The local authority or the planning authority places some restriction or imposes some duty on the owner of the property which causes him a loss which must be measured by an impartial tribunal so that the owner may recover the measure of his loss from the local authority or the planning authority, whoever they may be.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Well, he can either sit down and agree on a sum, <Col N="297" /> and once agreement is registered, he can recover it as an ordinary debt, or he can ask for an arbitrator, in which event, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors Institute will name a man to undertake the duty of arbitration and his findings are binding on both the planning authority and the aggrieved party.  &ldquo;And,&rdquo; the Minister says, &ldquo;we can trust the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors Institute to choose a suitable man.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure we can, but I am thinking of one of my constituents who is required to part with a piece of his front yard as a result of a road-widening operation.  He feels that he is holding the rough end of the stick and that there is arraigned against him the county engineer and all the officials of the county and that he is fighting a desperate rearguard action to protect his own interests against all the panoply of the local authority or the planning authority.  As the situation obtains at present, the way he looks at it is that the arbitrator is chosen and there then turns up the same expert who has functioned as arbitrator repeatedly before, a man who is quite familiar with the county engineer and the local authority officials, and who is continually hearing local authorities and planning authorities putting their sides of the case but who never before has heard the problem of a particular individual who is living in particular circumstances such as the claimant believes himself to be.</P>
      <P>The important thing to bear in mind is that where we are dealing with property and matters of compensation, the universal rule applies with particular emphasis: justice must not only be done, but it must be seen to be done.  We should do everything in our power to carry conviction to the mind of a person from whom property is being taken that the compensation he is receiving in exchange is fair and just, and is being fixed by someone who is just as far removed from the planning authority as he is from the claimant to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that 30 or 40 per cent <Col N="298" /> of the cases in which an aggrieved party is represented by a competent solicitor will be settled by agreement. The solicitor will say: &ldquo;Look, do not waste money going to arbitration.  You may get another £5 note but you will lose more by going to arbitration than by having a sensible settlement.&rdquo; Probably in another 40 per cent of the cases, the solicitor advising his client will say: &ldquo;The best thing you can do is go to arbitration and you can depend on getting a fair deal.&rdquo;  There may be a very small minority of cases in which the client will say: &ldquo;I want to go to the courts.&rdquo;  Why should we prevent them?</P>
    <P>Is the circuit court not an admirable tribunal for the purpose of assessing compensation in respect of the value of a piece of land.  Who is afraid of a circuit court judge?  Why should a planning authority be afraid?  Why should we be afraid to send a planning authority to a circuit court to be judged?  It is not clogging up procedure. It is a very expeditious and convenient form of arbitration.  I submit to the Minister that the circuit court judge would be a much more expeditious arbitrator than an arbitrator appointed under the procedure envisaged in this Bill.  I think it would provide a very comfortable feeling for any small minority of persons who do not like arbitration and who feel that, if they went before a circuit court judge, substantial justice would be done.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister feel it inexpedient to add the circuit court judge to the panel of arbitrators envisaged in this Bill?  Bearing in mind that we will be dealing with a lot of small property holders, it would be a useful tribunal to have.  In respect of all the substantial cases that will arise, no one will want to go to the circuit court, but for the minority who may feel that it would be a safer and a more comfortable tribunal for them, it appears to me that the circuit court would be expeditious, convenient, and on every score, unobjectionable. I suggest to the Minister that he should add the circuit court to the panel of available arbitrators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking issue <Col N="299" /> with Deputy Dillon on all he has said but, as I have already said, I feel this amendment is meaningless as applied to the section, because no provision has been made for recourse to the circuit court to determine the award of compensation.  This section really deals with the recovery of the amount of the award already determined as compensation, and it does not in any way determine the amount of compensation payable.  Therefore, since the circuit court did not already come in to the determination of the compensation award, the putting in of the circuit court in this context just does not make any sense.  It is valueless, useless and completely out of context.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 54, line 5, to add to the end of paragraph (c) &ldquo;so however that such ancillary services shall not be such as will compete with services provided by private enterprise&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This section gives very wide powers to the planning authority.  The amendment seeks to limit these powers in such a way as to prevent them form interfering in any way with private enterprise works.  Subsection (2) of the section provides:</P>
      <P>A planning authority may provide&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  sites for the establishment or relocation of industries, businesses (including hotels, motels and guest-houses), dwellings, offices, shops, schools, churches and other community facilities and of such buildings, premises, dwellings, parks and structures as are referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection,</P>
      <P>(b)  factory buildings, office premises, shop premises, dwellings, amusement parks and structures for the purpose of entertainment, caravan parks, buildings for the purpose of providing accommodation, meals and refreshments, buildings for providing trade and professional services and advertisement structures,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  any services which they consider <Col N="304" /> ancillary to anything which is referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection and which they have provided,  </P>
    <P>and may maintain and manage any such site, building, premises, dwelling, park, structure or service and may make any charges which they consider reasonable in relation to the provision, maintenance or management thereof. </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ancillary services&rdquo; could be interpreted as the actual carrying on of shops.  If you provide a shop building, and speak of providing ancillary services to the shop building, the section might be interpreted in such a way as to enable the planning authority to undertake business which, properly, is the right and domain of private enterprise or ordinary commercial enterprise.  That is very undesirable. The activities of the planning authority should not in any way interfere with the ordinary commercial life of the country.</P>
    <P>We are aware that various semi-State bodies have engaged in the provision of shops ancillary to the service they originally provided.  If in the provision of hotels, motels and amusement parks, we widen the position in respect of ancillary services, that would be very unwise.  We seek to limit the interpretation of ancillary services so that they shall not include services so that might reasonably be provided by private or commercial enterprise. The planning authority should not be allowed under any guise to compete with private or commercial enterprise.</P>

But when we talk here about ancillary services, we are not talking about setting up shop.  We are talking about services ancillary to the developments already mentioned, factory buildings, office premises, shops and dwellings. This would mean the provision of water, sewerage and gas mains.  It might even mean district heating, such as is operated in other countries, and <Col N="305" /> would include such things as caretaking of houses.

      <P>(3)  Subsection (1) of section 15 of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, is hereby amended by the addition of `or alternatively, being a planning authority within the meaning of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, satisfies the Court that, in case the reversionary lease would be a lease of the whole of the land, the land or any part of the land is situate in an area in respect of which the development plan within the meaning of that Act indicates objectives for its development or renewal as being an obsolete area or that, in case the reversionary lease would be a lease of part of the land, that part or any part of that part is situate in such an area'.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 232:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 54, line 29, to add to the end of the subsection &ldquo;provided that an offence under section 52 of this Act may be prosecuted by a member of An Garda Síochána&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>In this section we are dealing with the prosecution of offences under the Bill. By our amendment, we seek to ensure that what is intended in the Bill will be effective, inasmuch as the Garda will have the right to prosecute for offences under Section 52.  Section 52 deals with the throwing about of litter and so on.  This section before us provides that where such an offence occurs, the local authority may prosecute.  We want to add that offenders may be prosecuted by a member of the Garda Síochána.  In saying that, I readily concede that the Garda have too many duties on them in the ordinary way.  Their duties have been extended to include participating in the taking of a census and such other duties. However, they are the people who have the expert knowledge and technique in regard to obtaining names and so on.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the planning authority could provide the people to ensure that the provisions of this section are kept.  Where people throw litter about, I do not think any planning authority could provide a horde of officials to look after the matter. But the ordinary guardians of the law are in every area, and by this amendment we seek to give them the power to prosecute under Section 52 of the Bill.  The amendment is necessary if the section is to work.  Even in a large urban area where you have an authority having officials of its own, it would not have them to the extent that they could deal with this matter in the fashion the Garda could deal with it. I suggest this amendment is necessary. It would be meaningless in regard to Section 54 unless the planning authority are to employ a large number of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In your parks in Dublin, there are attendants available to stop the throwing about of litter but if you take the streets of this city, one must assume <Col N="308" /> that the Corporation of Dublin have not sufficient personnel to ensure that litter will not be thrown about with impunity.  The Garda are available and they have the technique to deal with this matter and to handle the public. I think it reasonable that they should have the power to prosecute under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is merely to put beyond any doubt that a local authority or planning authority may act in the manner specified in the following subsections as here described. The putting in of the amendment as suggested by Deputy Jones is unnecessary, for the good reason that under Section 52 it is an offence to leave litter in a public place.  An offence under that section may be prosecuted in the district court by any person acting as a common informer. No special provision is necessary in order that the Garda Síochána will have the power to prosecute or to pull people up for the disposal of litter in this manner.</P>
      <P>This section is merely an elaboration of the powers contained in Section 52. If we did not have this section, the planning authority might be questioned as to their right to act in the matter at all.  This is an addition to Section 52 and it puts the right of the planning authority to deal with the matter beyond question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister does he seriously think that people will act as common informers under Section 52?  I know that civic virtue should impose on all of us the obligation to see that such things do not happen but if we are to leave the onus on the common informer, it will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But we do not. Section 52 makes it an offence to leave litter in a public place and therefore the Garda are expected to enforce the law as in the case of any other offence.  In Section 78, we are making provision for the planning authority to do the same and putting beyond any doubt their right to act as any other person might act.  We are giving them the right to take action in this matter rather than putting the onus on the public to act the part of <Col N="309" /> common informer.  This is in addition to the general supervision the Garda will have in this matter and it gives a special place to the planning authority to make arrangements to enforce the law under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider it desirable, if the planning authority is to employ officers for this purpose, that they should wear uniform? Suppose the Minister or I were at the seaside and the planning authority appointed some excessively officious person and such a person approached us in ordinary clothes and demanded our name and address, are we not entitled to ask such a person to produce his warrant of authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that, but is it not a rather alarming experience for an ordinary citizen to be approached by a neighbour who apparently has no official function and asked for his name and address?  Is it necessary to add this category of person to the Garda Síochána at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities may not have the personnel at their disposal to make effective the cleaning up of any public place frequented by many thousands of our people in our all-too-short summer periods.  This section enables planning authorities to make special arrangements in special circumstances of which they will be fully aware and of which we might not be aware.  That is the idea of supplementing this, so that if the normal process of the law is not effective and cannot be made effective without undue strain on the personnel available, and if the planning authority are not satisfied that they are getting the service necessary to pursue the matter fully, they will have specific powers to make alternative arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that would be covered by the local authorities themselves.  To put in the obligation that these people must wear a uniform might possibly defeat the very <Col N="310" /> purpose for which they are appointed. While we expect that they will be uniformed and recognisable, I do not think we should make it a legal obligation on the planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose we are abroad on the beach at Dieppe or Brighton and a man in ordinary clothes comes up and purports to enforce the law. If we live in this country, we have the right to demand that such a person produce his warrant of authority but, having some experience of the strange adventures one can have in a foreign place, we are more likely to tell him to go to hell, only to find that under subsection (3) we have committed an offence which, on summary conviction, makes us liable to a fine. It is dangerous to create a body of persons with an official position, if they have no outward sign of it, and give them power to question people in a public place. Everybody is presumed to know the law but few do.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, the corporation take the precaution of providing that a parking attendant wears a distinguishing mark. I think every parking place in Dublin now has an official attendant during certain hours and when he goes off duty, a variety of rather uncertain-looking characters infest the vicinity and do nothing but haunt the place. For strangers, are we introducing the new principle that these unofficial persons will enjoy the protection of the law, if, in fact, they have concealed on their person a warrant or authority in writing?  If we think it desirable to prescribe that a parking attendant in Dublin should wear a distinguishing mark, we should provide that the local authority, desiring to supplement the Garda Síochána with special personnel for the enforcement of the sections referred to here, will also cause to be worn some mark as distinguishing as that worn by parking attendants in Dublin.  If you do not do that, awkward situations will arise.  If that simple precaution is taken&mdash;it must be reasonably simple when Dublin city is already doing it&mdash;much unnecessary inconvenience could be avoided. Perhaps it could be done by regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were to be done, regulation certainly would be the only way in which it would be desirable to do it.  I do not think it would even be desirable to put it in regulations if we were to suggest, at the same time, that they should have some distinguishing mark.  I could give half a dozen reasons why, in many instances, these people should not be in uniform. Uniform will not make the man and the point mentioned by Deputy Dillon just now tends to show that they do not improve very much by having a uniform.  The other point is that there is &ldquo;a handout&rdquo; to the uniformed parking attendant while you do not give anything to these people except your name and before you give it, you may ask and receive proof that he is duly authorised.  Surely that is not asking too much?  If a uniform is desirable, local authorities would be the best people to determine that.  At present they have public health inspectors and there are many good reasons why they should not be in uniform.  It would defeat their purpose if they could be seen coming. Everybody could get things cleaned up and put in proper order and something that had been going on for the previous month would be immediately stopped and when the inspector walked in, he would find it had ceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Is that not what we want to do under this section, to make people pick up litter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not pick it up and dump it again as soon as the official has passed.  In the case of dangerous litter such as broken bottles on beaches, some of that is accidental.  If there is glass about with children around some is bound to be broken but there is no doubt there are thugs who take pleasure in littering our beaches, particularly at weekends when people have left bottles behind.  They delight in smashing them on the beach and there is not much point in having people from the local authorities on guard in uniform when that type of thug is about.  They will do nothing when they see the guard or the officer but as soon as he has gone, they will <Col N="312" /> smash the glass.  They will cease if they see him coming.  They cannot be brought to book because it is too difficult to establish who did it.  In those circumstances, the uniform could be a liability.  There are circumstances in which a uniform could be useful if they are appointed in any numbers by local authorities.</P>
      <P>I suggest we leave the position as it is and not even permit ourselves to put it in regulations.  If it is felt necessary, it can be done by way of instruction or circular advising local authorities that in the normal way a uniform or distinguishing garb should be worn by those whom they appoint but we should not make it obligatory on them to have a distinguishing mark in the performance of this duty and be so recognisable as to defeat the purpose for which they are appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases, the only way to prevent them is to detect who is causing them.  In the ordinary way, a uniformed man walking about will remind the ordinary law-abiding citizen but it will not prevent elements doing damage when his back is turned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the element I have in mind, if the man produced his authority, it would not deter them in the least.  I have some experience of beaches where beach guards are on duty.  If they go about in ordinary bathing togs and tell people it is dangerous to bathe, it has no effect.  They must identify themselves as beach guards, whereas if they were properly equipped with a special top to their togs, it would convey immediately that they had an official position when approaching people.  Lives have been lost because of this.</P>
      <P>While health inspectors go around in civilian clothes, we have in Waterford what are known as borough constables.  They are in uniform and they stop people putting rubbish outside doors.  When they appear, they are obviously officials and do not have to produce credentials.  They find out where there are people dumping stuff or where there is a menace to public health, and they are very effective.  I put it to the Minister that he should meet our suggestions from this side and accept the amendment.  It would be a deterrent and that is the great thing.  Bottles would not be broken and litter would not be scattered if a man were there and the people had the idea that that man could take their names and have them prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the position of tourists coming here?  They are a growing number.  Take a French family, a Belgian family or a German family on the beach, at a fair ground, a camping ground or anything else, who offend against the litter section of this Bill.  An anonymous man comes up to them and remonstrates with them. Possibly they get excited and ultimately they are asked for their names and addresses.  Of course, they know nothing about subsection (3) and the man puts a piece of paper before them which they are unable to read or understand.  On the other hand, if I am on a French beach or a Belgian beach, somebody walks up to me with a cap on him marked <i>garde municipale</i> or something of that kind.  The ordinary presumption is that that man is acting <Col N="314" /> under some municipal authority and is entitled to do what he proceeds to do.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister it is not a good thing to multiply the number of persons who may come and talk with the public in civilian clothes.  The public are entitled to some notice that they are dealing with a person vested with authority.  I do not believe that Section 78 will be widely used.  I imagine most of the municipal authorities will depend on the Garda Síochána to enforce the law.  However, if municipal authorities do consider it necessary to supplement the uniformed Garda for enforcement of this section, the persons authorised by the municipal authority ought to wear some distinguishing mark.</P>
      <P>It is dangerous and a bad arrangement to authorise persons who are not wearing official uniform to approach or remonstrate with ordinary citizens and it is liable to give rise to serious misunderstanding and, I want to put it to the Minister, liable to give rise to serious abuse.  Suppose you get some ordinary fellow with no good purpose in his mind advancing on somebody and threatening to prosecute him for having deposited litter, and exercising a form of blackmail, saying: &ldquo;If you give me 10/-, you will hear no more about it.&rdquo;  That can and will certainly happen, and all the person can do is to say: &ldquo;Produce your authority&rdquo;, whereupon the fellow can turn on his heel and walk away.  He has represented himself as nothing and he has no authority at all.  He simply says the person has broken the planning law and then can walk away when he is asked to produce his authority.  What offence has he committed?  On the other hand, if there is a prescribed band to be worn on his arm or cap, as a mark of municipal authority, and he fraudulently seeks to imitate it, then he has probably committed an offence in itself by making that fraudulent pretence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister quite deliberately that I regard with grave apprehension the authorising of ununiformed persons to enforce regulations against the public at large.  It is susceptible to grave abuse and I am <Col N="315" /> prepared to go as far as to say that it could become a very real danger.  I am certain that on continental beaches, it would be a very real danger.  There have been brought to my attention a variety of situations in which people have been approached by individuals at continental resorts when the greatest danger attended them.  I do not think that it is likely to happen on any large scale here in Ireland in view of our general social pattern and background but it is a bad principle.</P>
    <P>A person authorised to question individual citizens ought to bear some external mark of the authority with which he is vested.  It is not sufficient to say that on an occasion such as this the only precaution the citizen has to take is to demand that the person questioning him produce a warrant of authority.  There is no parallel between this and the case of the health inspector.  In regard to anybody coming into your premises, the presumption is that he is coming into the establishment of a responsible citizen who is fairly well acquainted with the law and certainly knows that nobody has the right to go into his home to interrogate him without specific authority from the Oireachtas. The first thing you do when any person comes into your home or enters your business premises to ask you questions is to ask: &ldquo;By what authority?&rdquo;  It is perfectly normal experience for us all that he produces a warrant of authority from the Department of Local Government, the county council, the Department of Agriculture or one of the various Departments which have supervisory functions.</P>
    <P>It is quite another thing for a man to approach you in a public place, when perhaps you have your wife and children with you, and to start interrogating you without any exterior sign of his authority.  I put it to the Minister there is nothing embarrassing or offensive about a park attendant or a car park attendant or anybody wearing an official uniform, coming up to a family and remonstrating with them. It is quite another thing if an un-uniformed person does it.  I put it <Col N="316" /> strongly to the Minister this is a matter which requires further and more careful consideration.</P>

      <P>Before Section 80 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where the Minister gives any decision or determination in proceedings on an appeal or on any matter referred to him under this Act any party to such proceedings may, accordingly as rules of Court may prescribe, either appeal therefrom to the Circuit Court or require the Minister to state and sign a case for the opinion of such Court and on any such appeal to the Court the Court shall have power to make such decision, direction or order as it thinks fit and any such decision, direction or order shall be binding on the Minister and on the parties to the proceedings. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for contingencies where there is no appeal to the High Court except by way of the Minister referring the <Col N="318" /> matter to the High Court.  Except for the provisions of Section 5, there is no provision in this Bill for the correction of a ministerial misinterpretation of the provisions of the Bill.  Subsection (3) of this section entitles the Minister, and only the Minister, to refer a matter in which a question of law arises for decision by the High Court.

There is not much use in continuing a discussion indefinitely when manifest agreement between us cannot be reached.  We take the view quite definitely that in matters such as are here set out in the amendment, there ought to be appeal from the decision of the Minister to a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  We believe that if such appeal is not provided, a great many persons will feel a sense of grievance and will have the conviction that they are being denied rights which they had every reason to believe were held sacrosanct by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not at all satisfied that the denial of such right of appeal in this Bill may not give rise to constitutional proceedings for the vindication of the people's right to approach the courts under certain contingencies specifically set out in the Constitution.  We believe the safe and prudent course would be to provide for such appeals where aggrieved parties wanted them and none of the arguments adduced in the course of this discussion has altered our view that the existence of such appeals should be provided for and that it is a serious interference with the constitutional right of citizens to attempt to exclude the courts from the determination of such matters as <Col N="319" /> are provided for in this legislation. We are convinced that sooner or later this right will be vindicated and restored. We would prefer to see it done in the body of this legislation.  If it is not done here, we believe it will be done elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In matters of law, the courts; in matters of planning and planning policy, the Minister, answerable to this House.  I am not suggesting the courts should be taken out of the normal determination of matters legal and the interpretation of our laws.  All I do say is that planning and planning policy is for the Minister answerable to this House and to the country for his actions while matters of law are for the courts.</P>

      <P>We feel very keenly about this.  As the Leader of the main Opposition said, if provision is not made in the body of this legislation, then the position is bound to be tested constitutionally.  In matters of planning, the Minister seems to regard the planning authority as sacrosanct. Under the various schedules of the Bill, regulations can be made controlling the citizen in relation to a great many things.  I referred the Minister to a situation which arose outside this country when it was sought, under town planning, to control people. The individual concerned was an architect. He erected a structure to his own design and the planning authority ordered him to desist.  The case was tested in the courts and evidence was taken from some of the most eminent architects.  They disagreed entirely with the views expressed by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>There should be a right of appeal to the courts in matters like this.  To deny any individual the right to challenge the planning authority is surely a very serious infringement of the liberty of the individual.  As the Leader of the main Opposition has said, there is no purpose in pursuing this matter further.  It seems to be useless. It is regrettable that the provision should not be included.  That decision is bound to be challenged.</P>

      <P>I do not at all subscribe <Col N="320" /> to the idea that because the courts are not included in matters of planning policy, we are in any way taking from the citizens of the country any right, constitutional or otherwise, they now enjoy.  They have recourse to the courts on matters of law in respect of this or any other Bill. Naturally, that is being continued. With regard to their rights being trampled upon, let us look at the paraphernalia for their protection in regard to the matters we are now discussing. There is, first, the local authority decision determined by the manager on the advice of his technical officers. If they are dissatisfied, they have recourse to the elected body which controls the manager.  If they are still dissatisfied, they have the right of appeal to the Minister and an oral hearing takes place.</P>
      <P>If they are not satisfied after that, they have recourse to the members of the House to put the screws on the Minister, or put the skids under him. If they are still dissatisfied, and some will be, because no matter what is done, there will still be some people who will be dissatisfied, and if they feel they are being denied some right in law, or that the law is being misconstrued or misinterpreted, they are as free as the air to have recourse to the courts.  I cannot see where trampling on the rights of the citizens can arise in a matter such as this.  If I did, I would be wholeheartedly with those who are now making this case from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy T. Lynch is not here because, as a matter of interest, speaking on Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the operation of the disqualification order, as reported in the Official Report of 10th May, 1961, at volume 189, column 206, he said:</P>
      <P>With all due respect to the Bench and the courts, we should leave as little as possible to the discretion of the judges and the justices.  It would be better, when this Bill is passed, that the section were definite and gave proper guidance to the justices. I appeal to the Minister not as a lawyer but as a layman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> I merely quote that as a sideline on <Col N="321" /> this attitude of mind.  I am trying to distinguish between matters of law and matters of planning.  I think the safeguards that exist on matters of planning are such that no one can reasonably feel they have been done down. They are given an opportunity in every possible way to get the best of what is going.  I also assert that it is much more the job of the Minister with his advisers, and the local authorities with their advisers, to determine the merits of planning, and that we should not expect the courts, the judges and justices to determine matters relating to planning policy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 235:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 55, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) that the person hearing any reference or appeal in whole or in part on oral evidence shall not be an officer of the Minister's Department who has served in that Department within five years next preceding his appointment to hear a reference or an appeal&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the person hearing this appeal will not be an officer of the Department &ldquo;within five years&rdquo;.  Since, during the progress of the discussions on this Bill, any appeals to the courts in the ordinary way have been ruled out, we think this is an essential amendment.  The person delegated by the Minister to hear these appeals should be absolutely free to exercise his discretion as an appeals officer.  He should be removed from what I might call the influence of the official mind in any matters relating to town planning. Therefore, the amendment suggests he should not be an officer of the Department of Local Government or, if such an officer, should not have served in the Department for a period of five years preceding his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions during this debate, we have been dealing with what we believed to be the individual type of review that should take place.  We have not got the Minister to accept that.  We pointed out that the success of this Act will depend on the measure of confidence the citizens have in it.  If they are to feel that somebody in the Department, serving at the time of the appeal, somebody dealing with <Col N="323" /> town planning, is to hear the appeal, then ordinary citizens will feel that the dice is loaded against them.  In justice to the official hearing the appeal, there should be no imputation so far as that individual was concerned. He should be quite free and detached, while having the necessary experience to provide the type of information the Minister would require.  This is something which we feel is very necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The wrong stand that is being taken, and I deliberately say &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; is the assumption that the inspector hearing the appeal on behalf of the Minister is in fact anti-appellant before he starts.  That in turn would indicate that the Department, the Minister, the local authority and the inspector would be in a line-up on one side and the poor appellant all on his own on the other.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Neither I nor any other Minister would condone injustice being done by a Departmental official&mdash;even if the official wished to do it&mdash;to any individual of the State.  That is the first thing I want to make clear.  The Minister is the person to whom the appeal lies; the inspector is appointed by him and on his behalf to hear the evidence submitted and he is not asked for nor does he make any decision on what he has heard but is expected to report back to the Minister a factual record of both sides of the case.  It is arising from that factual record of the two sides of the story that a decision is taken which the Minister must stand over and defend.  He is not going to defend a decision taken unjustly by an official against anybody in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one aspect.  The other is that there may be 400, 500, 600, 700 or 800 such appeals&mdash;and I think there are likely to be some 600 or 700 appeals in the not too distant future. If this amendment were accepted, we would place ourselves in the position that we would immediately rule out as unavailable the people best qualified to do the job on behalf of the Minister. We are not over-blessed with a large number of this type of person with this type of qualification, and <Col N="324" /> that fact related to the volume of appeals which is expected could leave us in the position &mdash; if we were debarred from appointing those whom we have at the moment &mdash; that we might not be able to get, and probably would not be able to get, as many people as required.</P>
    <P>Then we would be forced to do one of two things.  We would be forced to slow down and delay appeals until the number of people we were able to get could get around to the appeals, or we could appoint people who were inferior in knowledge and who could not be regarded as being very competent and therefore a greater injustice could arise, because of the incompetence of people on whom we forced these jobs since we were debarred from appointing the best we would have available in our Department.</P>
    <P>As the House appreciates, as the Bill stands, we may go outside and we might get somebody from outside and I am asking that the Bill should not be changed so that we may not appoint those who have been employed in the Department in the past five years.  It does not mean that the Minister may appoint only those, but the amendment would require that the Minister should not appoint those and must go outside.  That could be a distinct hindrance and could bring about the very injustice which Deputy Jones feels might arise under the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 236:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 55, line 40, to add to the subsection &ldquo;and a person giving evidence at any such hearing or appeal shall have all such immunities and privileges as if he were a witness in the High Court&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection deals with the hearing of oral evidence and provides for the taking of evidence under oath and so on.  We think that the provision in this amendment is very necessary for the protection of the ordinary relations which exist between the client and the solicitor.  It is natural that a person appearing at such a hearing should be <Col N="325" /> assisted by a solicitor.  These transactions between client and solicitor have always been regarded as confidential and could not be disclosed to any tribunal or court without the client's consent.  Paragraph (b) (iv) of subsection (7) of Section 80 makes it an offence to refuse to give evidence or produce documents.  That would mean that the position that has existed in regard to confidential information between solicitor and client would cease and could be brushed aside.  The failure to produce confidential documents passing between them could be regarded as an offence.  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment as we feel it is a matter of principle. I hope, without any further pressing, the Minister will be prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there is nothing to say that they will have to answer anything which they would refuse to answer in a court of law.  The provisions are pretty standard&mdash;they are recognised as operating in various types of inquiry.  I appreciate what Deputy Jones is seeking, but it is already there, though not necessarily stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue here is quite simple.  If you require a man by statute to give evidence on oath, you place upon him a very peculiar responsibility. If the statute requires him to give evidence on oath, he can claim absolute privilege, but if you have an inquiry where nobody is on oath, then it is only proper you should apply the prudent restriction that he enjoys only qualified privilege.  It is then open to anybody to say: &ldquo;That man got up and maliciously sought to defame me at the inquiry.  He did it maliciously to injure me and not for the purpose of the inquiry at all.  He did it because he was not bound by oath.  He rendered himself liable to no penalty, though, and therefore used the occasion solely for the purpose of defaming me.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> On the other hand, if you call a witness and oblige him to testify under oath, he feels bound to reproduce the truth as he knows it.  If he departs from the truth, he is liable to criminal prosecution for the criminal offence of perjury.  But he cannot then be made amenable to all sorts of civil actions for slander and libel and defamation. The distinction is, to my mind, clear and simple: if the witness is not obliged to give evidence under oath, he should enjoy only qualified privilege; if he is required by statute to give evidence under oath, he ought to enjoy the same privilege as he enjoys in the High Court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, because the appropriate sanction against the person giving evidence under oath is to prosecute him for perjury if what he says is not true&mdash;it is not to sue him for slander or the like.  I suggest that on this principle the amendment is sensible and should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that witnesses are protected against claims for defamation, their statements having been made in all good faith and honesty.  That is what we anticipate as being the right of any person called to give evidence under this section. Protection also will be given so that persons may not be forced to answer certain questions.  They could not, for instance, be forced to answer questions that might incriminate them.  What I am wondering is whether the reference in this amendment might not, in some unforeseen way, tend to restrict the protection of witnesses to some degree more than does the section without this amendment.  With a view to having a further look at it, I would suggest leaving it over to Report Stage. If Deputies want this&mdash;it does not make any difference as far as I can now see &mdash;and it does not minimise the protection witnesses have now without the amendment, I should be inclined to accept it.  Without having a further look at it, however, I would not be prepared to do so because it might have the effect of restricting the protection already available to witnesses.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (2) (c):</P>
      <P>for the furnishing to the Minister, by any person so appointed, of a report on the oral hearing and for the consideration by the Minister of the report before he gives his decision. </P>
      <P>Does the Minister see any reason why a copy of such a report, made to him by the official who has conducted the oral hearing, should not be made available to the parties joined in the hearing before the official concerned? If either party is to have a fair opportunity of raising before a court his rights in respect of some legal matter in which he might think the Minister has gone wrong, would it not be reasonable to provide that he should have made available to him a copy of the report made by the person who conducted the oral hearing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While some of these reports might be published, I am afraid I could not undertake that all of them would be so published, for the reason that their contents could in fact be confidential to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am not clear on, though I would not press it unduly.  The relationship between an official and the Minister is strictly confidential, but these persons may on occasion be acting in a dual capacity, that is, when they are acting as arbitrators. There is a queer duality here on the question of appeal.  Does the inspector act as the agent of the Minister or has he a kind of quasi-judicial position?  If he is simply collecting information for the Minister, then the relationship between Minister and Departmental official is preserved.  If, on the other hand, he is simply chosen from the staff of the Department or from any other source, that special relationship does not exist and it does not seem unreasonable that parties desiring to appeal to the High Court on a matter of law should have access to a copy of the inspector's report. Perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that these inspectors <Col N="328" /> reporting back&mdash;being civil servants or not does not really matter but particularly if they are civil servants&mdash; would be inhibited to a great degree if they felt their reports to the Minister would be given the full broad light of day.  They probably would feel constrained not to give the full picture in all its colour which, for various reasons, might not please everybody.  A slight little shift in the Government of the day, for instance, might be to an inspector's disadvantage in this respect. There are all sorts of things that could affect the true reporting, as it were, of these inspectors back to the Minister if it were certain the report would be published in full.</P>
      <P>In order to conform to an earlier agreement which we reached to extend six weeks in section 5 to three months, it is the intention to extend the period in this section to a like time.  That would be by way of amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I already raised on previous sections what I could describe as exemptions which are being given to the State in this matter. All that is required of the State in these matters is to consult with the Minister if there are objections.  The planning authority has not any power in so far as the operations of various organs of State are concerned.  I have in mind, for instance, the Office of Public Works or the Land Commission. These bodies are being exempted, perhaps not in full but certainly in part, from compliance here, as I read it.  Before they construct or extend a building, they shall consult with the planning authority to such extent as may be determined by the Minister but if any objections are raised by the planning authority and are not resolved they will then consult, on the objections, with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the planning authorities find themselves in the position that these bodies may move in and not comply with the reasonable requirements of the planning authority?  Will the Minister inform the planning authority of the objects these bodies might seek to carry out in the area of the planning authority?  What rights will the planning authority have if they disagree with the type of development which, say, the Land Commission or the Office of Public Works propose to carry out?  I have already mentioned a building erected by the Office of Public Works in a town in the West of Ireland.  It is erected on the edge of the street in such a fashion that if <Col N="330" /> any development is to take place in that street the private citizen will suffer.</P>

Up to the present, the State were entirely free to do as Deputy Jones said.  We say: &ldquo;they shall consult&rdquo;.  They have no option: they must consult with the planning authority.  The degree of consultation will be determined by the Minister.  If objections raised by the planning authority, after consultation, are not resolved, the matter is brought to the notice of the respective Ministers of the Department of Local Government and of the other Department concerned.  They will then consider the matter at issue.  If they fail to resolve their difficulties and objections as between the points of view of the two Departments and the planning authority then, like any other difference of opinion between two members of the Government, the matter will go to the Government for decision.</P>

      <P>No.  The first thing is consultation.  There would be no such thing as an application and decision. The representative of the Department proposing to do certain development would go along to the appropriate man in the local authority.  They would have a general discussion of what was proposed. The local authority man might say: &ldquo;We do not think that is right&rdquo; and the Department's man might feel they had to have this.  That unresolved situation is referred to the Minister for Local Government, who has consultations with the Minister of the other Department concerned to try to resolve it.  The last step would be reference of the dispute to the Cabinet for final decision, and that decision would be communicated back to the planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend up to 31st March, 1966, the period in which the erection, enlargement or improvement of buildings may be completed in order to qualify for a rates remission under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Acts 1954 to 1960. The Bill will also extend for the same period of three years the time within which farm buildings may be built or improved in order to qualify for the 20 year rates remission under the 1960 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parent Act&mdash;the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954&mdash;gave a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years on the valuations of new buildings and on the increased valuations of existing buildings that were enlarged or improved on or before the 26th July, 1956.  The remission applied to the total increase, including any increase attributable to previous improvements taken into account in the course of the revaluation.  The completion date for works to qualify for the rates remission was extended up to the 31st March, 1963, by amending Acts passed in 1956 <Col N="337" /> and 1960.  The rates remission so provided applies to all buildings such as offices, factories, shops, houses, hotels, etc., which do not qualify for a remission under any other statute.  Paragraph (b) of section 1 of the Bill has been included to provide that buildings which obtain a rates remission under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, will not be entitled to an additional remission under the Acts now being extended.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, granted an exemption from rates for a period of seven years in respect of the erection, enlargement or improvement of farm outhouses and outoffice buildings.  In view of the steps being taken by many farmers to effect necessary improvements in their farm buildings, particularly in connection with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, it was felt that there was a case for making a more generous concession in relation to the rating of these buildings.  For this reason, the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1960, extended the period of rates remission in respect of farm buildings from seven to 20 years.  This extended remission was related to buildings built or improved between the 1st April, 1960, and the 31st March, 1963.  Since the longer rates remission was introduced, the numbers and amounts of the grants paid under the Department of Agriculture Farm Buildings Scheme have increased substantially and a big volume of construction work on farm buildings is now in progress.  The period for the completion of these buildings in order to qualify for the 20 year rates remission is accordingly being extended by section 2 of the present Bill up to the 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>Rates remissions under Local Government Acts have been operative in one form or another since the 1st April, 1920, and have generally been regarded as an effective encouragement of constructional development.  It is considered that the existing concessions in this regard should now be continued for a further period and this is proposed by section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> While I have no doubt that the provisions of this Bill will be welcomed by the House, nevertheless I should point out that it covers only one aspect of the complex structure of Local Government finance.  The whole question of local taxation and finance is being methodically reviewed at present and it is possible that in due course the examination may bring about changes in rating law, both generally and especially in regard to remissions of and exemptions from rates.  The completion of the investigations and the consideration of the findings will necessarily take some time. Meantime, it would I think be undesirable to make any drastic alteration in existing rating practices.  For this reason the present Bill proposes to maintain the existing position in relation to an important body of rates remissions for a limited period within which the general issue of such rating concessions can be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This is certainly a desirable measure.  The Minister, in the concluding paragraphs of his speech, mentioned why he is dealing with this on a temporary basis.  On a previous occasion, he told the House that this review was taking place in regard to the whole question of rating and valuation. That is most desirable.  Questions were recently asked in the House about the effect on valuation and rates of improvements to buildings, but that is something we can deal with again. The provisions of this Bill should encourage improvement of facilities on rural holdings.  I should hope the Minister will not find it necessary to come back again with a temporary measure and that instead he will have something more permanent by the time the provisions of this measure expire. I hope the review is being actively pursued in his Department and any other Department concerned.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to this measure as we think it desirable to encourage modernisation and improvement of dwellings by giving this type of remission, particularly to people on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Jones, all I can say is that I also hope <Col N="339" /> that during the currency of these temporary remissions and arrangements, it will be possible to arrive at some more comprehensive rearrangement of the local taxation basis.  The Economic Research Institute, as the House is aware, have been considering this and, in fact, they did furnish us with an interim report.  We are awaiting further reports from them and in addition, my Department and I have been working on this matter for the past couple of years.  That should lead to the establishment of a basis on which we would hope to obtain a new deal on the whole question of local finance.  Just how long it may take, I do not know.  I can only hope, with Deputy Jones, that it can be done within the currency of this temporary measure, which is three years.  I would not go further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This short Bill amends the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, for the purpose of enabling repayments of amounts advanced to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Central Fund to be waived where the Ministers for Finance and Lands are satisfied that such a course is desirable.  Any amount waived must, however, be made good out of voted moneys and will therefore appear in the Fisheries Estimate for consideration by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the establishment of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara by the 1952 Act advances totalling approximately £1,500,000 have been made under that Act.  The bulk of those advances has been for the provision of boats and gear.  Before 1952 similar advances were made to the Sea Fisheries Association and Deputies will recall that a <Col N="340" /> sum of £186,000 in respect of a deficit appeared in the Fisheries Vote for 1961-62 and was described as follows by the Minister for Lands in the House on 20 July, 1961, columns 1503 and 1504:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The object is to seek approval of the House for the writing off of a deficit in respect of advances made to the former Sea Fisheries Association for the provision of boats and gear.  Advances totalling £408,500 were made to the Association for that purpose in the period of more than twenty years up to its dissolution in 1952.  These advances were made from the Fisheries Vote and were repayable by annuities, the amount repaid each year being appropriated in aid of the Vote&mdash;as, for instance, at subhead G.4 for the current year.  In contrast perhaps I should mention that advances to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not pass through the Vote but are made from the Central Fund and appear &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; in the Exchequer Account published regularly in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Neither the Association nor its successor, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, has been able to recover all payments due for boats issued to hire-purchasers&mdash;some of whom, unfortunately, have utterly failed to meet their commitments.  In the worst cases it has been necessary to resume possession of the boats and reissue them at a loss.  In this way losses have been accumulating over the years and the annuities due to the Fisheries Vote have been falling into arrear.  Had the liability to the Vote been reduced as each loss occurred, the total amount written off would be much smaller than the figure of £186,000 which is inflated by the inclusion of interest that has been accruing over the years.  At long last, however, consideration of the matter has reached the stage at which this deficit can be formally wiped out.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will, of course, continue to repay to the Vote advances made to the Association in so far as they correspond to the value placed on assets still remaining. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> As the Minister then said, neither the Association nor the Board had been able to recover all payments for boats issued to hire-purchasers.  In this Bill it is proposed to face up to that fact.  The various incentives in the Government's Programme of Sea Fisheries Development published last year are, of course, aimed at remedying that situation but, before the introduction of those incentives, over £100,000, due by hire-purchasers and related to the advances made since 1952, had proved to be irrecoverable. The Board have, however, gone on repaying the advances received by them from the Central Fund.  It is only reasonable that we should provide the necessary statutory machinery to enable us to make appropriate reductions in the amounts repayable by the Board and to specify the amounts waived in the Fisheries Vote.  That, as I mentioned at the outset, is the purpose of this Bill which I recommend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill but I feel that the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has presented this measure indicates that there is not the degree of prosperity in the fishing industry which the Parliamentary Secretary appears to indicate in his speeches outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the standard of living which our fishermen enjoy today and which they have been enjoying over recent years does not enable them to pay back to the board the amounts they received by way of advances for boats or gear.  I should like to hear a little more from the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to this matter.  If our fishermen in the past have experienced a great degree of difficulty in paying for the boats or gear which have been given to them by the Board, how much greater will that difficulty be in the future when they are left entirely to the mercies of the fishmonger?  Whatever difficulty there was in regard to buying boats and gear under the system which prevailed up to recently, there will be even more difficulty in the future, unless the Government are prepared to face the situation more courageously. <Col N="342" /> They have not done so in the past and now that a problem has presented itself in relation to payment for boats and gear for fishermen, a new approach should be made by the Government in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary on whose recommendation these sums will be waived. I should like also to know if before waiving any of those sums, the board must have decrees from, say, the district court for sums which are irrecoverable. In other words, if the fishermen are unable to meet their instalments in respect of the advances and interest due to the board, must the board obtain a court decree to satisfy themselves that no goods have been returned, that the money is not available and that they cannot possibly recover it?</P>
    <P>I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to enlighten us a little further in regard to Section 3 in respect of amounts, the repayment of which has been waived.  Could he give us any details as to the amounts waived and for what purpose these amounts which will now be covered by this Bill were waived by the board?  We all have some sympathy and understanding for fishermen who cannot meet their commitments to the board but an expression of pious sympathy is insufficient. However, when we have to express sympathy with the fishermen who cannot meet their liabilities in this matter, we must only come to the conclusion that the fishing industry in general has been rapidly declining in recent years and that the standard of living which our fishermen have does not enable them to pay their way.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of attention is focussed on the Parliamentary Secretary as indeed on the Minister for Lands as to the circumstances which warrant the introduction of this measure.  I certainly have no objection to the terms of this Bill but the fact that it is necessary is not very encouraging for the success of the Parliamentary Secretary's policy in relation to sea fisheries.  May I say that the money advanced in the early days to the old Sea Fisheries Association was money <Col N="343" /> well spent and devoted to a very good purpose.  Although I have no objection to the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary could have enlightened the House to a much greater degree, more particularly in regard to Section 3.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to listen to Deputy O.J. Flanagan who comes from an area where, I am sure, a great many people depend on fishing. I do not think he has a clue as to what fishing means to an ordinary man on the coast.  My attitude on this Bill is completely different from his.  If we were to take the attitude Deputy O.J. Flanagan has taken, that because we are giving money to the fishermen, that shows they are on the brink of poverty, it would be a poor look-out for the farmers who are being spoonfed with millions of pounds every year.  I cannot see how any Deputy can deprecate the fact that at last something is to be done for our fishermen.</P>
      <P>Fishing in this country is only in its infancy.  Up to recently, there was very little else to be seen around our coasts except curraghs, which are outmoded. It is only right that we should take some steps to ensure that fishing will expand instead of pursuing a policy of contraction as has been pursued for quite a number of years.</P>
      <P>I am also of the opinion that, far from allowing Bord Iascaigh Mhara to continue its activities of purchasing fish as it has been doing for some years, the fisherman would much prefer to deal with the fishmonger and sell his fish in the ordinary way without any restriction.  That appears to be the position, and I spent a good deal of my life in the fishing business so I should have some idea what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to letting out boats, there should be some policy whereby these boats will be let out on the basis of a 20-years repayment period and that in the assessment of the repayment terms, proper insurance cover will be included in the charge.  Most fishermen do not know the first thing about insurance. They have no bargaining power.  Now a boat that is let out may be wrecked inside an hour.  I suggest any boat let out should be insured by An Bord <Col N="344" /> Iascaigh Mhara and the insurance premium should be included in the instalments payable by the fishermen.  The premium should, of course, be as reasonable as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of ambiguity in this Bill.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain further when he comes to reply.  Far from curtailing the fishermen, he should go out of his way to expand facilities for them.  We trip over ourselves in getting facilities for farmers and we ignore our fishermen. We spend millions on drainage and refuse to provide landing facilities for the fishermen around our coast.</P>

      <P>I suppose Deputy Leneghan is not really to be blamed for not knowing what this Bill is all about, seeing that it was only circulated today.  There is not a penny in this Bill for fishermen.  This is a Bill designed to write off deficiencies that have arisen over the past 20 years. Now Deputy O.J. Flanagan and I dealt with this problem for many years and what I should like to know is can we ever reach a stage at which this old backlog of deficiencies and defaults will be finally disposed of, once and for all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have that more fully explained.  So far as I know, the income of the fishermen today ought to be ample to enable them to pay regularly the instalments due on their boats.  If their income is not sufficient to enable them to do that, I want to know why.  When I was Minister in charge of Fisheries, we bought all fish of a demersal character from the fishermen at a guaranteed price, subject to the reservation that if they went out and caught excess quantities of whiting, when they were acting in a pelagic way, we reserved the right to sell that whiting by tender. Otherwise, they had a guaranteed price for all their fish and a guaranteed market.  Under that system, from their monthly cheque for their landings there was deducted a certain sum to meet their instalments: the balance <Col N="345" /> represented their profit for distribution between the owner and the crew.</P>
      <P>That system worked equitably and well.  In a sense, it was analogous to PAYE, in that the fishermen had their instalments deducted from their monthly cheque.  While they did not fall into arrears, they certainly never got themselves caught up in a burden of insufferable accumulated debt.  By the development of that system, the development of ever-growing arrears was effectively arrested.  We were all the time, of course, carrying an old balance of arrears which had arisen many years previously, and which is still being carried in the books.  What figure are we now dealing with exactly? Is this the old carry-over from the Thirties and the war period?  When we write off whatever sum it is intended to write off now, is that an end of it?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us when did this accumulation arise?  Does it relate to a period of ten or 20 years, or has it been growing all the time?</P>

But we should not imply, as Deputy Leneghan seems to be deluded into believing, that this Bill represents a burden cast upon the Exchequer by the fishermen round our coasts.  They had as much to do with the German trawlers as the people walking the streets of Dublin had; in fact, they had a great deal more to do with them for they saw more of the trawlers than the fishermen ever did.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, and avoid this money collecting interest in the books.  The present sum then we have in mind to be written off is approximately £186,000.  If that finally liquidates this folly, well and good, and let us resolve now that these kinds of follies will not be perpetrated again.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary an assurance that we have reason now to believe that the boats on hire purchase to the fishermen will not fall into arrear again.  If there is a tendency for the payments to fall into arrears currently, we should ask ourselves why.  I am proud and happy to remember that when I last inquired into the average income of the fishermen who were purchasing boats, they were doing very well.  I remember in particular an official who worked in a bank in Killybegs.  He used to see the fishermen coming in and lodging their takings in the bank.  He resigned from the bank, took a boat, and went out from the bank to the sea, because he had come to the conclusion that he could do better fishing with a boat in Killybegs than behind a counter in a bank.  I think that was admirable.  I am delighted with it.  I am told he did extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot feel any sympathy with men who are doing as well as I would wish them to do, not paying the instalments on their boats and gear.  It seems to me improvident for men who are getting a good income not to pay for their boats and gear.  While all of us who were associated with fisheries have a soft corner in our hearts for fishermen, it is not reasonable or right to appear to endorse the action of a man who is in enjoyment of a good income and does not meet his legitimate obligations.  My experience of the Fisheries Branch and Bord Iascaigh Mhara is that no fisherman who meets with misfortune, loses his nets, or <Col N="348" /> meets with any unforeseeable catastrophe, is ever pressed for that month's instalment or met in any unsympathetic way.  There are special hazards associated with sea fishing which only experienced people can correctly evaluate.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to reassure us that while there is this flexible element in the powers enshrined in the Bill, he does not anticipate that there will be further losses of this kind, by way of default. Frankly, I have lost contact with the system whereby fish is now sold.  My whole policy was based on the proposition that if the men went out and got the fish, they should have a guaranteed market on the pier when they brought the fish in.  Their obligation was to go out and fish and bring in the best variety of fish they could, and when they landed it safely at the quay, it was our responsibility to attend to the marketing.  That is what we did in the old days with the Sea Fisheries Association and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. So far as I am aware the system worked well.</P>
    <P>There were periods in which the catches of our fishermen were not adequate to cater for the Irish Market. We reserved to Bord Iascaigh Mhara the exclusive right to import fish and, of course, we all knew that on these imports of fish substantial profits were made, but any profits made on the imports of fish were put into a fishery development fund.  That fund was to be used subsequently for the benefit of the fishing industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I understand that whole system has been swept away and that there is a new system.  Our system had the advantage that there were deductions from the fishermen's receipts in order to meet the payments due on boats and gear, and it meant that fishermen had unlimited credit to get gear or anything else they required.  How are the payments made now?  Who makes them?  How are the fishermen selling the fish?  What guarantee have they?</P>
    <P>We set up a pilot fishmeal plant in Killybegs, and it was further developed by a German firm into a more substantial undertaking.  That factory was primarily established for the purpose <Col N="349" /> of promoting herring fishing.  It is important that we should keep our minds fixed clearly on the policy underlying that decision.  At the time the fishmeal factory was established, the herring fishing industry contained one element of risk and danger for the fisherman, and that was that if he brought in a large boat-load of herring, he might find there was no market at all for herring on the date he landed it.  In those circumstances, we wanted to be able to say to the herring fisherman: &ldquo;It does not matter about the state of the market.  We will take all the herring you land at fishmeal price, but you will never be faced with the situation of having laboured to catch them and then having to throw them back into the sea.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A very strange thing happened in 1957 or 1958.  Herring disappeared from the North Sea, whereupon herring became a scarce commodity.  So far as I know, since that date, herring are a scarce commodity.  Where we used to be plagued with a fairly frequently recurring surplus, now you can sell all the herring you can land.  That is one of the mysteries of fishing.  The trouble is that any week, or any month, herring may disappear from the coast of Ireland, and it would be difficult to find out where they had gone.  No one seems to have any explanation for it. Of course, that has been a very welcome development from our point of view.  The disappearance of herring from the North Sea, and the consequent European shortage, makes a fishmeal enterprise look almost fatuous, but it is only made to look fatuous in the eyes of those who do not understand anything about the problems of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Of course we are glad we have not got to fall back on the fishmeal price. Of course we are glad that all the herring landed by Irish boats are saleable on the fresh, or salted, or cured, markets.  Of course they are very desirable developments, but we would have been wrong to let our fishermen go out of the herring fishing business in the years when there were recurring gluts, by failing to provide any alternative outlet.  I do not think it can be doubted that it was the <Col N="350" /> knowledge that it was the policy of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Government to make provision against recurring gluts that induced our fishermen boldly to equip themselves, and go out and fish for herring which are now saleable in season and out of season.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate most emphatically that I was responsible for initiating the fishmeal policy in this country, that in the same circumstances I would do precisely the same thing, that I am quite satisfied the decision to do that resulted in our fishermen staying in the herring business, and that we should be thanking Providence instead of lamenting that the fishmeal factory now finds itself in difficulty in getting supplies of raw material.  When I set up that factory, that was the purpose for which I set it up: to create a situation in which it would find it extremely difficult to get raw material.</P>

      <P>We are now in the happy position that herring are being profitably sold on the normal market, but it is no harm to remember that at any time the old situation could reassert itself.  As it is, we must keep our men in business by providing them with the same guaranteed outlet for surplus herring as the fishmeal factory was initially established to provide.</P>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us a brief survey of the sales system and tell us how far he believes the new system of selling fish will operate to ensure that arrears on boats and gear will not accumulate again.  I think our system of marketing provided a fair reassurance against a serious deterioration in the arrears position.  I should like to be reassured that this new marketing procedure provides the same kind of guarantee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon in his emphasis on the necessity for having a basic floor price in respect of fish landings.  He confined his remarks purely to herring landings and indeed, at the time he spoke of, there was a problem in regard to the disposal of herring landings.  The situation has improved considerably in regard <Col N="351" /> to the herring trade since then and the problem now is in regard to the disposal of fish of other varieties around our coast.  For that reason, we have extended the basic guaranteed or floor price for fish of all varieties.  We have, out of the Fishing Industry Development Fund, of which he spoke, provided that fishermen at any point around the coast can transport their fish free of charge to fishmeal outlets and are guaranteed thereby the basic fishmeal price.  That applies to whiting and all other varieties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very doubtful that we should apply it to whiting.  It is preventing people from going out to fish for high-class fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the general selling problem, I would say that there is no selling problem in regard to fish at the moment, nor has there been for the past 18 months. There is a growing home demand and a growing world demand for fish.  We have services in the form of fishmeal and processing factories that will guarantee basic outlets for the fishermen. In addition to that, on the ordinary selling market, there are a large number of private firms, many more than formerly, now actively competing with one another for the fishermen's catch.  I would say that this situation where you have a number of private buyers competing with one another for the fishermen's catch, and which is improving in that respect, is in fact benefiting the fishermen as it can only result in better prices for them.  That has been the experience around the coast for the past 12 months.  Last year, fish landings increased by ten per cent and the export of fish and fish products went up by 30 per cent over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan referred to the question of proper facilities to enable fishermen to buy their boats.  We initiated proposals which have now been in operation for the past 12 months which provided that the period of repayment for these boats was extended to 15 years.  Fishermen are now charged a reduced interest rate of four per cent over 15 years and as well 25 <Col N="352" /> per cent of the cost of a new boat is given by way of free grant at the initiation of the hire purchase deal.  As an incentive to the fishermen to improve and increase his hire purchase repayments, we provided that, if he concludes these in ten years instead of the 15 years set out in the hire purchase agreement, he gets a bonus of ten per cent of the cost of the boat paid to him at the end of ten years, so that that bonus represents a target which he can aim at.  If he effects the repayment within the ten years, he gets that substantial bonus which in the case of the small boat, say the 32-foot lobster boat, which costs £3,000, would be £300 into his pocket.</P>
    <P>One of the problems referred to by Deputy Dillon was the question of fishermen's incomes.  He referred to a particular case where a man left a bank and was able to make a substantial profit from fishing.  I am aware of similar cases and we are attracting into our training scheme people who, in the ordinary course of events, would go into the more fashionable lines of business.  Now they are coming into the fishing business instead.  The problem we are facing is the discrepancy between the people who can make a very good living and the people who do not seem to make a good living from fishing.  You have, say, ten per cent to 15 per cent making an excellent living and say 20 per cent to 30 per cent making a medium living and then you have the people at the bottom of the scale who, for one reason or another, are having difficulties.</P>
    <P>Our problem is to raise the level of the people in the last category by way of advice, help and training, to a higher level of income.  That is why we have initiated the advisory scheme analogous to the agricultural advisory scheme which has operated successfully for some years.  We have introduced this scheme which involves training fishery officers who will be permanently located at various centres around the coast.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have been given a budget with the objective of bringing to the fishermen the most modern and up-to-date techniques, the best way of fishing with their boats, and in general, to bring <Col N="353" /> them all the up-to-date information necessary for them to catch and land more fish and to sell to greater advantage. However, all of this discussion is really outside the terms of this measure before the House&mdash;and indeed I dealt with most of the matters which have been raised on the debate for the Fisheries Estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am coming to the measure before the House which deals with a backlog of events in the past since the passing of the first Sea Fisheries Act in 1952.  Some of these matters arise out of the three German trawlers to which Deputy Dillon referred, which were disposed of at a basement price and, in respect of the original purchase price, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are still repaying to the Exchequer by reason of the advances given to them by the Exchequer; and hire purchase boats which have been resumed over ten years by reason of default in payment and which were later disposed of by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara at a loss and in respect of which Bord Iascaigh Mhara are still making repayments.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the payments on which fishermen defaulted over the past ten years.  In their efforts over the years to get things moving An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have had to dispose of certain assets.  For those assets, they are still making repayments to the Exchequer in respect of original advances.  This Bill is purely confined to this simple question of providing that, where such advances have been made by the Exchequer, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will now be relieved of repayment liability in respect of such advances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy be <Col N="354" /> patient?  In addition to what I have stated, there is provision that Section 18 of the Principal Act&mdash;which made it mandatory on An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to make those repayments to the Exchequer in respect to any advances to it&mdash;be now amended by Section 2, to provide that in any case in the future where a similar situation may arise in relation to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara activities&mdash;and in any development activities to raise the industry and build it up, there may be losses in respect of works engaged in as a result of Exchequer advances&mdash; an order may be made by the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the Minister for Lands, providing for relief for the Board in respect of advances due.  There is the safety, of course, that these orders will come before the House, because repayments of which the Board are relieved by reason of such orders must be displayed in the annual Fisheries Vote. The Oireachtas will be made fully aware of the amounts involved in relief to the Board by reason of the fact that an equivalent amount will be displayed in the annual Vote for Fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to ensure that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara can carry out their development projects free from the encumbrance of any debt liability in respect of assets which they no longer possess.  In the future, as in the past, there may be, in the course of the Board's development plans, losses in regard to assets which the Board may have to dispose of.  In such case, it is only proper the Board should be relieved of Exchequer liability in respect of assets they no longer possess.  As I have said, the relief must be fully displayed for the House in the annual Fisheries Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am not clear on is this: I understand the writing-off of the German trawlers, but in reference to boats, what seems to happen is that we recondition a boat and give it to another fisherman when the present holder has fallen hopelessly in arrears in instalments.  We repossess the boat and then re-sell it on the same principle.  Why should there be a substantial loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is.  By the time the boat is reconditioned and sold to somebody else, we might get 50 per cent of its original value, sometimes less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is a second-hand boat which you must try to sell on the hire-purchase system to the second fellow.  I take it I am right in saying that the other fellow has been in default for something like three or four years and that he has stopped caring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rule, I suppose you warn him to pull his socks up, but by the time you repossess the boat it is too late.  It was the same when I was Minister for Agriculture: I was too late, and Deputy Flanagan, as Parliamentary Secretary, was also too late.  I feel you ought to take the boat when three or four instalments <Col N="356" /> have not been paid.  Of course, we never did that, the result being that the boat deteriorated.  In present conditions of fishing, I think we ought to be somewhat more Draconian than heretofore because the measure of the deterioration of these boats is a rebuke to us all.  Is there a set system of disposing of these boats?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, having regard to the fact that the early identification and subsequent wider use of proven bulls in AI centres is of vital importance in cattle-breeding in this as well as in every other country in the world today, he will take steps to avoid having a licensed secret society in AI, and ensure that, if and when proven bulls become available at Clondalkin and at all cattle breeding stations in this country, up-to-date information will be made available, as is the position at most AI centres at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the reported statement referred to by the Deputy.  Apart from any views any AI station may have about the publication of progeny test results, or the administrative problems resulting for a station from such publication, my Department&mdash;which cooperates with the AI stations in progeny-testing&mdash;is of the opinion that as results become available they should be circulated for the information of all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken any steps to show his disapproval of the statement by the Chairman of the Dublin District Milk Board in regard to his attitude to progeny-testing generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the statement carefully.  I do not believe that those who have expressed concern about the contents of that statement really understood what the manager of the concern had in mind.  I do not violently disagree with many of the views he expressed.  Neither do I suspect or find any attitude adopted by the individual concerned of concealing the results.  However, there is something to be said in favour of not publicising unduly the limited results we have so far obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the purpose of the whole exercise of progeny-testing is to identify the better bulls and so induce the farmers to make wider use of these bulls?  Is the hesitation here not due to the fact that little or nothing has been done in this progeny-testing station since 1948 and only a few bulls show merit and, consequently, we are afraid we shall be asked for them and them only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have deliberately set out to make my attitude clear on this matter.  I am also conscious of the facts as they are known to exist.  When you have only a small number of animals on test and when you get from some one of this limited number what seems to be an attractive result, then, if you unduly publicise that result, it can have the effect of turning public opinion very much in favour of using that animal, often resulting in introducing a nominated service which would be much more costly to those who use the semen from it.  While you are doing that, there may, at the same time, be other animals of the same breed not under test who would be equally good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is no.  The position is that heretofore all teachers were required to reach the standard necessary for the bilingual certificate at the final training college examination in Irish in order that they might be regarded as qualified national teachers on the results of that examination. Two years ago, as part of the emphasis which I desired to place on the spoken tongue, I decided that candidates then entering the training colleges would not be required to qualify for a bilingual certificate at the conclusion of their training course in 1963.  I substituted for that qualification a provision that within five years of the date of the commencement of their service as national teachers they would be required to obtain a certificate of competency in oral Irish.</P>
      <P>To assist them in their preparation for the latter certificate and with a view to encouraging them to spend periods practising the speaking of the language with native speakers, I initiated a scheme whereby a grant of £15 would be paid for a month's sojourn in the Gaeltacht.  Teachers are free to avail themselves of this grant three times in all.  They are not compelled to do so.</P>
