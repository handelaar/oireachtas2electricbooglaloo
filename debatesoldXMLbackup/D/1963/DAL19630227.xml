        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Taoiseach if he will state for each company in the Shannon Airport Industrial Development Estate the total freightage exported and imported (a) by air and (b) otherwise for the past twelve months, or to the latest date for which figures are available.</P>

      <P>(a) The total weight of goods exported by air in the year 1962 by all the concerns in the Shannon Airport Industrial Development Estate was 406 tons.  The corresponding figure for goods imported by air was 495 tons.  It is not <Col N="350" /> the practice to reveal information relating to individual concerns.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total value of Irish goods exported to France each year since 1st January, 1959, and the three main items of export; if he will give similar details regarding imports from France during the same period; and if he can now indicate the approximate drop in the value of Irish exports to France for 1962 owing to the order preventing export of working-type horses, aged seven years and over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving details of our imports and exports to France in the past four years on the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the exportation of working type horses, the Official Export List distinguishes only between bloodstock and non-bloodstock types, and does not classify non-bloodstock horses by age.  It is, therefore, not possible to relate the decline of nearly £337,000 in the value of the exports of horses, other than bloodstock, precisely to the categories covered by the order.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  TOTAL value of domestic exports to France in each year 1959-1962 showing the three main items of export.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland is reported to have said in the Northern Commons on 14th February, 1963 that the general health services in Éire are below the level in Northern Ireland, and that one could envisage the day when the standard might be raised in Éire; and whether he has any statement to make in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that, in relation to health services essential for the prolongation of life or the restoration of health, the standard in this part of Ireland is inferior to that in the northern part of the country.  It may be the position that a particular speciality is, marginally, better developed in the north than it is here, but the converse would also be the case.</P>
      <P>The statements quoted in the question were made in the context of the case of a young man from the northern part of the country injured in a playing field accident here.  This young man has been, and is still, under treatment at the National Rehabilitation Centre at Dún Laoghaire.  I am advised that this Centre offers facilities for treatment for injuries of this nature which are not available elsewhere in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Having mentioned an individual case, I am sure that Deputies would wish me to assure the patient and his family of our sympathy and of our hope that his recovery may be speedy and complete.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the object of these questions is to elicit information as to cases in which action was taken, by way of revision of boundaries of dispensary districts or changes in the numbers of doctors in districts, which resulted in alterations in the work load of district medical officers during the past five years.</P>
      <P>I propose to reply in the form of a tabular statement to be circulated, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The statement (Part A) gives information as to dispensary districts which have been revised during the past five years.  It explains the object of the revision, shows the number of eligible persons and the numbers of district medical officers in the districts before revision and in the districts as revised. It also supplies (Part B) information as to districts in which, without revision of the boundaries of the district, additional district medical officers have been appointed in the past five years and as to the one such district in which the number of district medical officers was reduced.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that, in general, the result of these changes has been to reduce substantially the work load of the doctors concerned and in no case has there been a significant increase in the work load, except in one case where, for reasons of his own convenience, the doctor desired the change.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

            <entry>This Order regularised the position regarding dispensary services in Ballyfermot housing area which comprised portions of the Clondalkin and South City No. 5 (New Kilmainham) Dispensary Districts.  For some years prior to the making of the Order constituting the Ballyfermot Dispensary District, the area had been regarded as a separate entity by the Dublin Board of Assistance and had been served by four district medical officers.  At the time the Order was made there were approximately 13,623 eligible persons in the area.  The number of eligible persons in the Ballyfermot Dispensary District at present is 13,365.  The district is now served by five district medical officers.</entry>

            <entry>This Order divided the Cobh Dispensary district which had previously been served by two doctors into two separate dispensary districts with one doctor serving each district.  The Order was made at the request of the Health Authority to regularise the division of the area between the district medical officers and to afford a more equitable distribution of eligible persons between the two district medical officers.  Prior to the making of the Order there were 699 eligible persons in the part of the Cobh Dispensary District then known as Cobh No. 1 and 1,345 in the part of the District known as Cobh No. 2. Following the making of the Order the numbers of eligible persons in the Cobh No. 1 and Cobh No. 2 Dispensary Districts were estimated at 968 and 935 respectively.</entry>

            <entry>The purpose of this Order was to facilitate the appointment of two additional permanent district medical officers to the Limerick Urban Dispensary Districts, which comprised the Limerick County Borough area.  The five Limerick Urban Districts were amalgamated to form one dispensary district entitled the Limerick City Dispensary District and the number of permanent district medical officers serving the area was increased from five to seven.  The new arrangement will facilitate any further necessary adjustment of the areas allocated to the district medical officers as the making of a Statutory Order will not be necessary to effect such adjustment.</entry>

      <P>The possibility of utilising some of the vacant bed accommodation in the Dublin region for accommodating mentally retarded children has been under discussion on a number of occasions in recent years between officers of the Dublin Health Authority and officers of my Department. The last such discussion took place in December last.  Various possibilities have been considered but, so far, no feasible scheme has emerged. The matter will be kept under active consideration.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the problem is a difficult one.  Many of the difficulties are enumerated in the White Paper on the problem of the mentally handicapped published by my Department in 1960.</P>
      <P>The number of places available in the special institution for mentally handicapped children has been almost doubled in the past ten years and proposals have been approved which will provide about 300 extra beds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the reference in Question No.  10 is to health inspectors.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of health inspectors in the service of Dublin Corporation, i.e., in Dublin city, was the subject of a hearing before the Labour Court in April, 1958, and the Court, in May, 1958, recommended the grant of substantially improved scales of salary.  The increased salary scales recommended were, with my approval, applied by the Dublin Corporation with effect from 1st June, 1958, to health inspectors employed in their area.  Those rates were subsequently applied to all health inspectors on a national basis, including those employed in Dublin county, including the borough of Dún Laoghaire, under the seventh round of salary revisions with effect from 7th September, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised salary scale was offered by the managers at the eighth round stage, with effect from 1st August, 1960, which was the earliest date from which eighth round increases were applied to staffs in the local authority service.  This offer was the subject of an application to the Labour Court <Col N="378" /> in relation to health inspectors employed in certain areas outside the Dublin area.  The Court, on 30th March, 1962, upheld the offer and recommended its acceptance.  By August last, this scale had been applied generally outside the Dublin area, though a few health authorities have not agreed to the degree of retrospection recommended.</P>
    <P>The health inspector staff employed by the Dublin Health Authority, including those engaged on duties in the county and in the borough of Dún Laoghaire approached the Labour Court separately, and following a hearing in July, the Court, on 16th August last, issued a recommendation for an improvement for those inspectors in the salary scales offered by the managers.  I notified the Dublin Health Authority on 20th instant of my approval to the application to the health inspectors concerned, with effect from 1st August, 1960, of the revised salary scales offered by the manager, which are in line with the basic scale upheld by the Labour Court in March, 1962, and of the increased salary scales recommended by the Court in August, 1962 with effect from the date of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>It will thus be apparent that the decision in regard to salaries of the Dublin health inspectorate was not affected in any way by the recent White Paper.</P>
    <P>In regard to Question No. 11, I would direct the Deputy's attention to my reply to Deputy Rooney's question on 6th February, 1962.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Question No. 13, five applications to the Minister for Health for sanction to increases were received from health authorities between November, 1961, and the 30th March, 1962, on which date the Labour Court recommended acceptance of the offer made by the managers to the staff.  These applications, and a further six received in April and early May, 1962, were all sanctioned on 16th May, 1962.  Applications from the remaining health authorities, other than Dublin, were received at various dates up to August, 1962.  These were all sanctioned within one to nine days of their receipt.  The application for sanction in respect of <Col N="379" /> the Dublin health inspectorate was made on 8th September, 1962.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, further to a statement made by the Taoiseach on 21st February in Limerick, that the introduction of new forms of taxation may be necessary, he will now make a statement giving details of what particular new forms of taxation the Government have at present under consideration for introduction in the near future; and whether any decision has yet been reached as to the introduction of any specific new form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Necessary increases in expenditure on public services such as agricultural aids, education, health, social welfare and the service of the public debt have created the need for increased revenue.  Recent experience suggests that it will not be possible to meet this need simply by raising the rates of tax on the traditional revenue-earning commodities and that a new form of taxation will be necessary. Furthermore, it is clear that the Exchequer has become unduly dependent on taxing a small number of commodities, consumption of which is liable to be seriously affected by changes in demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, been considering the various forms of taxation in force in other countries on sales, purchases and services.  While they have not reached a final decision, they are at present disposed to believe <Col N="380" /> that a broadly-based sales tax would be most suitable.  I expect to be in a position to go into detail in my Budget speech in April.  I may say, however, that the Government would not intend to bring any new tax into effect until later in the coming financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The current pensions increases involved a greater volume <Col N="381" /> of work than any previous pensions increase because it was necessary on this occasion to carry out a detailed recalculation of every pre-1955 pension. As I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on the 22nd of November last the amount of increases unpaid cannot be known until the outstanding cases have been calculated and payment authorised.  As regards the pensions payable from Votes with which my Department is concerned, however, payment of the increases has now been made in full in most cases.  Advances have been issued in the balance of the cases and final authorisations are in course of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the average period of time which elapses between the date of retirement of a civil servant and the first payment of his pension; whether the calculation of such pension is carried out prior to, or after, retirement; and whether he will take steps to have civil servants' pensions calculated in advance of their retirement dates in all cases where the date is known, with a view to eliminating any gap between retirement and receipt of pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that pension awards are issued in most cases within three weeks after retirement. Provided that the pensioner applies in writing for payment, so that the Paymaster General's Office can verify his signature and address, payment of his pension will be at the end of the month.  Where retirement occurs late in a month, it may happen that payment will not fall to be made until the end of the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as Civil Service pensions are payable in arrear, it follows that an interval must elapse between the date of retirement and the date of first payment of pension. It has been found more satisfactory to calculate pensions immediately after retirement when final particulars of pay, service, absences, etc., are available.  In some cases where difficulty arises in determining the correct <Col N="382" /> amount of superannuation, there may be delay in issuing the award but in any case where the officer has actually left the service every effort is made to effect payment in accordance with the above procedure, or, if this is not possible, to issue an interim award of superannuation to the pensioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it is quite clear that the officer must retire on reaching the age limit or where the Department has decided that he must retire because of his health or other reasons, surely it should be possible to calculate the amount of pension to be paid to such an officer and there should be no delay between the payment of salary and the payment of pension?  In many cases the period of three weeks mentioned by the Minister is exceeded, with the result that the officer concerned is embarrassed.  Perhaps the Minister could arrange some system whereby the pension will be calculated on the information in the Department's possession, information that is not likely to change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the pension is paid monthly, there may be a delay of up to four weeks until the month is up. If a person retires early in the month, he does not get the pension until the end of the month.  Therefore, there may be a delay of three or almost four weeks.  He gets his gratuity immediately, or he has the gratuity, which, as a rule, is a substantial sum to carry on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not do that now, I have seen the newspaper article referred to by the Deputies.  Because of its special place in the cultural life of the country, the Abbey Theatre has received State assistance for many years past.  These grants have taken the form of contributions towards meeting losses in the working of the theatre from year to year.  These losses have arisen mainly because, in competition with other forms of public entertainment, the types of plays presented by the Abbey Theatre in fulfilment of its particular role, have not always proved financially profitable.  I see no reason for the type of inquiry suggested by the Deputies and have no intention of considering any system of State subsidies for the Irish theatre in general.  In addition, a certain amount of State assistance for Irish drama is already being afforded by the Department of Education, and Roinn na Gaeltachta and by An Bórd Fáilte.  The question of accommodating other theatrical groups in the Abbey Theatre is primarily one for the management of that theatre.</P>

Would he ask the management of the Abbey Theatre to send the Abbey Players down the country where there are theatres willing and anxious to have them?  There has been no Abbey tour for years and years.  Even though the Abbey Theatre might not be getting the support here in Dublin we would wish it should get, or might only be getting the support it deserves, is the Minister aware that, down the country, the types of plays <Col N="386" /> produced in the Abbey Theatre are played to full houses?

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>), <b>Mr. Rooney</b> and <b>Mr. Donegan</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture his reasons for the recent change in the regulations regarding the export of live horses; and if he considers that the decision to prohibit the export of horses over five years old is in the best interests of the Irish farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these arrangements, prior to the date mentioned, resulted in a loss of about £10 a head minimum to the Irish farmers and that this further restriction will mean even greater losses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are three processing factories in this country and I am aware, too, that on the other side of the House in the Deputy's Party, when it was announced some years before that permission would be given for the slaughter of horses, great play was made of the fact that no effort resulted in respect of the establishment of any of these business concerns.  Now that they are established, one would expect after their establishment that some order would be made affecting the number of horses allowed out of the country. Such an order was made by me in 1960 and I fixed the age limit of seven years over which a horse could not be exported.  I let it be understood at the <Col N="392" /> time that in a reasonable period, I would review that decision.  I was not asked to review it but I have reviewed it and I have changed the age limit from seven to five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If on what the Minister conceives or says he conceives to be humanitarian grounds, he decides to prohibit the export of horses, surely there is a corresponding obligation on him to require the domestic factories to pay the same price as these horses would fetch for export or to bridge the gap by a suitable Government contribution?  Is it reasonable to impose a penalty on the producers for what, as Deputy Clinton says, the Minister considers to be humanitarian grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a horse of another colour.  I am surprised at how all the Blue Cross campaigners of whom I have had experience have come to change their attitude in this matter.  In fact, I did tell the Deputy that the considerations that played on my mind when I first made the order prohibiting the export of horses of under seven years of age were very active ones and I tried as best I could, <Col N="393" /> consistent with doing what was right and fair, to ensure that the price of horses would not be determined by any monopoly.  It is a strange thing in this House that when a Minister obviously takes that line, he must be subjected to all sorts of misrepresentation as if he had not a problem to contend with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is simply this.  If the Government decide to restrict the export of livestock from this country and as a result the price of that variety of livestock declines, surely there is an obligation either on the monopoly that controls the slaughter of these animals at home or on the Government to see that the price secured by the producers is not reduced for the benefit of the export monopoly?  Either the Government ought to provide a subsidy to bridge the gap or require the domestic monopoly to pay the export price for the livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no proper analogy at all, and the Deputy knows it very well.  It is quite a distortion of the real position.  An order was necessary at the time these three factories were established.  I was faced with the question of whether I should put on a total prohibition.  That thought, for several reasons, did not ring true or genuine to my mind.  I then marked the prohibition at seven years and I said: &ldquo;I can have a look at this.&rdquo;  I made that known.  Now I have had a look at it and I have reduced it to five years.  I was under fire for two or three years on this question, at a time when some of those cross-examining me now were blowing hot and cold. They were not thinking of this as a serious problem, although it was a serious problem.  I have no doubt that the way in which I am handling it is the right one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dismantling of industrial tariffs among themselves by the member countries of the European Free Trade Association will result in the gradual loss of the tariff preference which most of our industrial exports have enjoyed in the British market over the products of the Continental member countries of EFTA.  In the markets of these latter countries, our industrial exports will be at a disadvantage, where tariffs are applied, as compared with the products of the member states which will eventually be tariff-free.</P>
      <P>The effect of the EFTA tariff reductions on our exports of industrial goods will depend on our ability to produce and market goods which, by virtue of their quality and price, can, in the case of the British market, compete on level terms not only with the domestic product, as they have been doing with increasing success in recent years, but also with the products of the Continental members of EFTA.  As regards the latter countries, to which our exports have not been substantial, it will be necessary if we are to maintain or expand these exports to overcome the tariff advantage which most of the products of the member states will enjoy.</P>

      <P>Road authorities have been advised in 1956, and again late in 1962, that they should review the roads under their control in regard to hazards of this type, for example, where a public road runs along a bog rampart or beside a canal, and, where it is feasible to do so, to mark the road edge of dangerous stretches with a specified type of reflectorised marker. Where accidents of this type are likely to occur at docks, wharves and quays, local authorities generally have no right to interfere with access to the working portion of the quayside.  It is a matter for the authority responsible for the harbour or wharf, not the local authority, to survey any dangerous site under their control and to decide, in the light of the use made of the place and the traffic hazard it presents, what steps to take.  I have no doubt that the appropriate local authority will co-operate in any such examination with the harbour or other authority involved.  More positive results are likely to ensue from particular investigations of that kind than from a general examination, and I am aware that such particular investigations have been made and preventive measures taken in individual cases.</P>

      <P>Members of the House will have learned, with deep regret, of the unexpected and untimely death on Saturday last of Deputy Jack Belton.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Only a few days previously, he had been in attendance here in his usual good spirits and&mdash;by all appearances &mdash;in normal health.</P>
      <P>Kind and generous, genial and good humoured, the late Deputy was extremely popular on all sides of the House.  His contributions to our deliberations were always helpful and constructive.  His interests were many and varied, and housing and allied matters were of special concern to him. He will be sadly missed by his constituents, for whom he was an able advocate and in whose interests he was a tireless worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He became a member of this House in 1948 and was returned at each general election since then.  He was a <Col N="412" /> member of the Dublin Corporation for many years, and, while still a young man, was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin.  It was a well-deserved honour.</P>
    <P>Apart from his activity in public affairs, the late Deputy distinguished himself on the sportsfield, and he will be remembered as a good sportsman in the truest sense of the word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 33 to 35 and to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the manufacturer pays to the owner of the copyright a sum on account of the amount of the royalty equal to five per cent. of the ordinary retail selling price of the record in respect of which the royalty is payable and gives to such owner an undertaking to pay to him the amount of the royalty determined under the said section 31 less the sum aforesaid and such owner gives to the manufacturer an undertaking to repay to the manufacturer the amount (if any) by which the sum aforesaid exceeds the amount of the royalty determined under the said section 31.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to meet a point raised by Deputy Colley.  He referred to recordings of musical and other works that had already been made, or adaptations of recordings, and to the fact that in the case of royalties payable in respect of the making of these recordings, no minimum sum was laid down.  I suggested in the course of the Committee Stage that a minimum sum or percentage was not necessary, that that was a matter that could be arranged between the person who owned the copyright and the person who made the recording, but, in deference to the argument made by Deputy Colley, I have decided to introduce a minimum of five per cent failing <Col N="415" /> agreement or pending agreement between the parties.  I think this amendment meets the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Minister whether there is a similar limitation in Part V on the charges which may be made?  I referred on Committee Stage to the fact that in recent years the Performing Rights Society had very substantially raised their charges and, as I understand it, there is power under Part V of the Bill.  When we were discussing this matter an Committee Stage, it was in relation to this section, Section 13, and the Minister undertook to bring in the amendment which has now been introduced, which limits the amount of the royalty to five per cent.  Can I find out whether there is any limitation or any prescribed maximum charge which may be made in respect of, say, matters that fall within Part V of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The five per cent refers only to a recording right.  I think the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave on Committee Stage referred to charges by the Performing Rights Society under a scheme of charges proposed by them. I explained on that occasion that such a scheme was capable of submission by aggrieved parties, that if there were a group of dancehall owners or other people who were aggrieved, they could submit the scheme for adjudication by the Controller, but the five per cent does not apply to what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as it now stands, following amendment in Committee, with regard to the date from which the copyright of a film or cinematograph work runs, a doubt has arisen as to whether the section as it now reads would conform with the requirements of international Conventions to which Ireland is a party.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete certain words after the word &ldquo;published&rdquo; so as to ensure that <Col N="416" /> the date of publication from which the copyright will run will conform to the accepted interpretation in international Conventions to which we are party.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the owner of the copyright in any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work authorises a person to incorporate the work in a cinematograph film and Radio Éireann broadcasts the film, such broadcast shall not, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, infringe such copyright.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where Radio Éireann broadcasts a cinematograph film in which a musical work is incorporated, the owner of the right to broadcast the work shall be entitled to receive an equitable remuneration from Radio Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Costello raised some point on this section on the Committee Stage.  I have considered its provisions, and the amendment now proposes to give the section a much more limited application.  In fact, it relates only to films which Radio Éireann may broadcast. The section with the proposed amendment sets up a presumption that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, such a showing will not infringe copyright in any work that has been incorporated in the film which <Col N="417" /> the Authority has the copyright owner's permission to show.  I do not think I need explain it further if Deputy Costello is satisfied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I introduced amendment at the instance of playwrights, the purpose being to ensure that a register of performances of dramatic works would be kept in places throughout the country in which they were performed so that playwrights <Col N="418" /> would have the opportunity of ensuring that proper royalties were paid.  The purpose of this amendment is to require that those registers should be kept only where the plays are performed opposite audiences who pay, the main purpose being again to free Radio Éireann from this obligation. Without excluding Radio Éireann, they would have to keep a register of performances of those dramatic works performed in their theatres and studios which would be subsequentially performed anyway on the television screen or on sound broadcasting.  I do not think it was ever intended that we should impose on Radio Éireann the obligation to keep a register of this nature, nor did the playwrights seek it.</P>

      <P>I understand the object of the amendment is not to require Radio Éireann to keep this register.  That may be a laudable amendment but I wonder is the effect of it to go any further.  Does the Minister consider that by this amendment this register of dramatic works might not have to be kept if in fact it was alleged that the performance was not a performance for which an admission price was being paid?  Would it not be preferable, in order to remove all doubts, to refer specifically to the case of Radio Éireann as we did in an earlier section to make clear that the section will oblige persons to keep this register?</P>

      <P>Normally speaking, copyright is preserved only to ensure that the composers of the work or the owners of the copyright will be paid a reasonable sum for the use of the work.  There are many occasions when the work is played opposite non-paying audiences, for example, in schools or for other purposes of that character. I specifically mentioned Radio Éireann <Col N="419" /> in this context only as an example of proprietors of schools and other such places who would be obliged otherwise, where no charge was being made for performances, to keep a register and there would be no object in doing so.</P>

      <P>I think the section is a fair and good one, but I was rather wondering whether in fact the proposed amendment was perhaps going to extend beyond its intention to certain circumstances where persons might be organising a theatre club and might find that whilst they would be under a responsibility to pay the copyright fees, they would be under no obligation to keep the register required by the section.</P>

      <P>I might at this stage perhaps deal with other points raised in respect of which I have not introduced amendments but I will be able to satisfy Deputies who raised them, I hope, that amendments are not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> Deputy Sweetman raised the question whether the definition of a photograph given in the Bill was sufficient to include a negative, which forms part of the photographic process.  I have had the definition examined and, as the House is aware, it is in the widest possible terms, namely, any product of photography or any process akin to photography, and I am assured that that includes the word &ldquo;negative&rdquo; without any question of doubt.  That, I think, should satisfy Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>The other point raised was in relation to ephemeral recordings.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who raised this matter; he suggested that Radio Éireann, in fair dealing with recordings of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, should be obliged to keep the composers, and other people like that, informed of the making and the destruction of these ephemeral recordings. I have looked into the suggestion and, in all the circumstances, it would, I think, impose a rather unnecessary burden on Radio Éireann.  In the first instance, Radio Éireann would require a period of six months within which to be relieved of the obligations, which they would incur for infringement of copyright without the protection given here.  Six months is a reasonable period in which to be allowed to keep these recordings without being responsible for infringement of copyright.  They become responsible, of course, for payment of royalties when they produce these recordings on the screen or in their ordinary broadcasts.  As a rule, it is the practice of Radio Éireann to publish their programmes in advance but, even where they cannot do that, the performances will be widely known throughout the country and there would be no danger that Radio Éireann would want to escape the consequences of their performing these works from the point of view of paying proper royalties; everybody would know they had played these and, in the circumstances, I have decided that the fair dealing in these matters provided for already in Sections 12 and 14 is sufficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello raised a point in regard to appeals.  In the case <Col N="421" /> of appeals in Britain, in certain circumstances appeals are made to a three-man tribunal whereas, under this Bill, we provide only for appeal to the Controller.  The reason advanced by Deputy Costello was that a single person, irrespective of who he might be, might establish a precedent for himself or might embark on a line of reasoning that would be against the interests of the copyright owners, or against public interest generally.  I need only repeat what I said on the last occasion.  The decisions of the Controller are appealable to the High Court.  If, therefore, the Controller is going off the rails in any series of decisions, it will be possible to have any one of them brought before the High Court.  The Controller has extensive powers in relation to all kinds of commercial property, such as patents, trade marks, industrial designs, etc., and he is a man of experience; he is the most experienced man we have in this State to deal with these matters. I suggest there is little danger that the Controller would perform his work in any way inferior to a three-man tribunal.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Costello was in regard to costs of actions taken by or on behalf of people whose copyright had been infringed. Deputy Costello argued that, in the case of flagrant breaches, we should specifically provide for such in the section.  I undertook to examine whether the Deputy's argument should be met and I have decided that we already have substantially provided for flagrant breaches.  In the first place, the provisions in this measure are based on the Courts of Justice Act of 1936 and the circumstances in which High Court costs will be allowable in an action that could have taken place in a lower court are the same as those governing actions in respect of any other property rights.  I do not think there is any valid reason why we should put copyrights in a special position.  Under Section 22, as I have already pointed out, additional damages may be awarded for flagrant breaches.  Under Section 27 criminal proceedings can be taken against persons who knowingly infringe.  In all <Col N="422" /> the circumstances, I think the provisions relating to flagrant breaches are adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of appeals to the Supreme Court. These are stated in the Bill to be taken only in the case of an appeal on a point of law.  Having re-examined the matter, I find there are identical provisions in the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1960, and in the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960.  The Deputy's fears, if he still entertains them, will be dispelled by the knowledge that, if the High Court refuses to give leave to appeal on a point of law, that decision is, I understand, appealable to the Supreme Court and the practice is that the appeal on that issue to the Supreme Court is treated as the appeal on the merits of the matter itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt every Deputy thinks that, if his suggestions or amendments were accepted, the Bill would emerge in more perfect shape. I am no exception to that rule.  I am sorry the Minister did not see fit to accept the suggestions I made on the Committee Stage, suggestions which, I think, would lead to improvements in this Bill.  I do not think this Bill is by any means a perfect piece of legislation and I would hope that, if it were shown in practice not to be working out fairly and reasonably, the Minister would be prepared to bring in suitable amending legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why we are particularly concerned about this piece of legislation is that copyright law is not the type of law which becomes a burning political issue but is inclined to be left dormant for a good number of years.  The experience here has been that for nearly 40 years we have left our existing legislation untouched.  For this reason we should take particular care as to the type of procedures we are going to adopt in the future.  While I indicated certain doubts about the procedures that were to be adopted in the Bill, I made it clear that I did not refer or intend to refer to any existing person or existing organisation for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish now to deal with the points which were raised on the Committee <Col N="423" /> Stage and to which reference has now been made by the Minister.  The first matter concerns the question of ephemeral recordings.  The Minister explained the practice by which Radio Eireann has a weekly record of its operations sent to organisations which are concerned with composers' interests. I was constrained to point out to the Minister on Committee Stage that there may be individual writers or authors who are not in any copyright owners organisation and who will not be in a very privileged position.  It seemed to me that it would not involve any great administrative difficulty if we were to provide in this Bill that the date of the destroyal by the authority were made known to the copyright owner and the date of its broadcast.  The object of that would be to ensure that no mistakes would be made.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I do not for a moment suggest that the existing broadcasting authority will deliberately take away any person's rights or deliberately deprive the owners of copyright of the remuneration to which they are entitled.  However, we are legislating now for probably a considerable time in the future.  Authorities may change and Telefís Éireann may change its statutory set-up.  In these circumstances, it would probably be of assistance to the individual owners, say, persons who had written a play or produced a book or a poem, if this legislation were amended as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>It is not an answer to that suggestion to state that it is well known what is put on Telefís Eireann and Radio Eireann, because we are concerned not so much with persons who live in this country but with owners of copyright whose works may be put on Telefís Eireann or Radio Eireann but who may be residing abroad.  It is an unfortunate but a well-known fact that many of our Irish authors seem to find it necessary to reside outside where normally the beams of Telefís Éireann would reach or where normally the <i>RTV Guide</i> would have wide circulation.  Therefore, the Minister might consider again whether it would be possible, perhaps in the Seanad, to meet the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> I should like also to repeat the points I made on Committee Stage concerning the formation of the tribunal which will hear any disputes that arise concerning copyright fees.  This, of course, is a matter of livelihood to owners of dancehalls and owners of copyright musical works.  It is also perhaps a matter of livelihood to owners of other halls and to owners of dramatic or literary works which have been composed by them.  Therefore we should take great care that the best possible machinery for arbitration is set up.</P>
    <P>It is not an argument against the suggestion which I have made to say there is always an appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Controller. Appeals to the High Court are unfortunately expensive matters.  Very frequently persons who have had the experience of arbitration, although they may feel aggrieved by the result, feel it is not worth while going any further.  Their spirit may be dampened by their experience before an arbitrator or before a lower court and so injustices are done and go without remedy.</P>
    <P>While I repeat what I said on Committee Stage that I do not in any way cast the slightest doubt on the ability or integrity of the person who is proposed to be the arbitrator in these matters, I do think that, as a matter of principle, a tribunal of three is a better board to determine these important property rights.  As I have indicated, these are not trivial matters. Our experience in other fields&mdash;I am not referring at all to industrial property or trade marks&mdash;would bear out the view that it is undesirable that one individual over a number of years should virtually control the arbitration court in a given field.  I do not wish to be more specific than that but I think Deputies know exactly what has occurred in other fields and the unfortunate thing that can happen when one person alone has what amounts to a monopoly in determining arbitration cases.  The fact that an appeal to the court lies is not a sufficient safeguard.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which the Minister made references was the new Section 23 of the Bill.  I am concerned <Col N="425" /> that we should ensure here that persons who deliberately break the copyright in any work should not be permitted to do so with impunity.  Circumstances might arise where, if the Bill as drafted is enacted, it might be simpler for a person wilfully to break the copyright rather than meet his legal obligations.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I would anticipate will arise as to the meaning of a &ldquo;flagrant&rdquo; breach.  This is a matter which will have to be determined sooner or later by the court.  It is possible to envisage deliberate breaches of copyright which may not be flagrant. It may amount to an international breach but may not come within the description &ldquo;flagrant&rdquo;.  In those circumstances the remedies for a flagrant breach would not exist and the copyright owner might find himself in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the section as drafted follows the provisions of the Courts of Justice Acts for similar types of circumstances but it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction between copyright action and ordinary rights of property where litigation is involved, particularly the difficulty of proof of copyright ownership which may from time to time arise and is practically automatically put in issue.</P>
    <P>What I have suggested to the Minister is that wider discretion than exists at present should be given to the High Court where actions are commenced there.  I think the position at the moment is that the High Court is pretty restricted in the way its discretion has to be exercised.  I feel that my suggestion is a reasonable one: that the High Court should have greater discretion than it is now given where breaches of copyright have occurred, where difficulties of proof are involved, and where a breach has occurred which may not be a flagrant breach.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there has not been a great deal of litigation of this type in the courts.  To my knowledge, there was only one case where exemplary damages were given in the Irish courts. A sum of £50 was given for exemplary damages in one case quite recently. In the English courts, when there were flagrant breaches, larger sums were <Col N="426" /> given as exemplary damages.  I would anticipate that the majority of the cases will not come under the provisions of Section 22 but in general in circumstances where a person may decide to take a chance, not involving any flagrant breach but with the deliberate intention of evading responsibility, I feel that instead of seeing that persons who have deliberately infringed a copyright will not do so, we may, in fact, be bringing about the opposite effect with the legislation as it is now drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether there is much action the Minister can take in regard to a matter to which I should like to refer but I think it is something that should be kept under observation at any rate. A great deal of the revenue secured from charges in this country in respect of copyright so far as imported materials are concerned is exported to a country that is not, so far as I am aware, a member of the Berne Convention. To that extent, the balance of advantage lies heavily in favour of that country and the people who make charges in respect of recordings of one sort or another derive very substantial benefits.  There is no comparable benefit which we can secure because of the fact that copyright does not exist in that case and the charges which are made are not, therefore, subject to any of the Conventions dealing with copyright.</P>
      <P>Obviously we cannot compel any country to become a party to the Berne Convention and to comply, if it does not wish to comply, with the established international Conventions to which we are a party.  Because of the very substantial sums which are charged and the considerable revenue secured from charges made here, I think it is important that this matter should be kept under observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our primary interest is to protect our own people in this matter, and while it is obviously to our advantage to have international standards of copyright recognised and implemented, nevertheless, many of the fees paid here are paid, as I said, in respect of recordings made and produced in a <Col N="427" /> country that is not a party to the Berne Convention, and to that extent the substantial sums which are paid are, if you like, exported, and we get no comparable advantage.  It is a matter that might be the subject of periodic review, at any rate, to see whether there is any procedure available now, or will be in the future in specific cases of that sort where we pay certain fees in respect of recordings made in non-member countries, by which we might decide on special charges, or allow special concessions to persons here who are obliged to pay for these recordings.  Subject to that reservation, I think the measure constitutes an improvement of the existing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, regarding the operation of resale price maintenance in the supply and distribution of hand knitting yarns.</P>
      <P>I propose to give here a summary of the Commission's report of their inquiry into the matter, which has already been circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Commission reported that by far the greatest share of the market was supplied by the three largest home manufacturers.  Imports were relatively small, and were subject to 33? per cent customs duty, except in the case of some speciality yarns which are not produced in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the larger manufacturers allowed wholesalers, through whom 95 per cent of their distribution was made a discount of 15 per cent off the price to retailers, who in turn received 23 per cent on cost if they <Col N="428" /> adhered to the list price.  A second manufacturer listed prices which allowed wholesalers a 17 per cent. margin and retailers 23 per cent.  The third manufacturer distributed mainly through wholesalers, who marked-up 9 per cent for sale to retailers; this firm's suggested prices would give retailers a margin of 33? per cent. Settlement discounts of from 3¾ per cent to 5 per cent were also provided for by all three concerns.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry, these three manufacturers testified that they supported the policy of resale price maintenance. At that time, however, none of them was enforcing such a policy, because they considered that as the bulk of their sales was through wholesalers, enforcement would not be practicable. Some of the wholesalers who gave evidence also expressed themselves in favour of resale price maintenance, although they stated that it would be very difficult to apply and enforce it.</P>
    <P>It was disclosed at the inquiry that one of the largest manufacturers had introduced resale price maintenance in 1956, following representations by wholesalers.  This firm applied the policy principally to the wholesale trade, through which they made the greater part of their distribution but also to some large retailers whom they supplied directly, and they enforced it to the extent of withholding supplies in a number of cases.  In 1961, they announced their intention of abandoning the policy as its operation was not effective, due to the non-cooperation of some wholesalers. However, they still refused to accept orders from some traders from whom supplies had previously been withheld, and continued to advocate price maintenance at wholesale level.  The firm also stated that they considered that if extreme price cutting were again to cause inconvenience to their trade they might have to take further action against it.  As this firm was in a position of some dominance, and their products were stated to be in considerable popular demand, any trader who was refused supplies by them would be placed at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The Commission were of opinion that the operation of resale price maintenance by this firm unreasonably restricted competition in, and entry to, the trade in hand-knitting yarns and retarded the development of a competitive price structure; also, that the attitude of the firm concerned, and of other manufacturers and wholesalers, to the principle of resale price maintenance in this commodity could lead to an extension of the policy if suitable circumstances arose.  The Commission accordingly recommended that individual resale price maintenance at all levels of the trade in hand-knitting yarns should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>As there was no evidence of the operation of a collective system of price maintenance, the Commission made no recommendation in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order concerned.</P>
    <P>The arrangement in the case of confirmation Bills is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be subject to amendment by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their Report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions contained in the Order.  I am satisfied that a statutory control is required to curb any tendencies towards actions which might be in restraint of reasonable competition in the trade in this commodity. Accordingly, I recommend this Bill to the House in the confidence that its enactment will prove beneficial both to the interests of traders, and to the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to confirm the Restrictive Trade Practices Order, Hand-knitted Yarns, 1962. The Order was made on the recommendation <Col N="430" /> in a report of the Fair Trade Commission dated 4th April, 1962.  The Commission, at paragraph 45 of the report, said there was no evidence of an attempt by manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers to operate a collective system of retail price maintenance in nylon stockings and the Commission were of opinion, in paragraph 46, that there were no restrictive trade practices tending to operate against the public interest.  The Commission, however, found that there was a policy of retail price maintenance in relation to hand-knitted yarns by one manufacturer and that that policy tended to have the effect of restricting entrance to the trade. They felt that this was contrary to the public interest.  The Commission recommended the making of an Order in the terms presented to the House by the Minister which is based on the recommendation made in page 36 of the report.  We have no objection.</P>

      <P>There could be instances where the Minister would not be prepared to give the full 80 per cent.  I am satisfied that 80 per cent will be the usual amount.  I am satisfied that, if a scheme is accepted as being economically sound, the 80 per cent will be granted.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that there could be very close conflict of interest.  Let us take an example.  When the Minister examines a file he might find that a proposal of this nature was passed by the Waterford County Council on a vote of say 16 to 15, or some narrow margin.  Further more, on our advice, he might be in doubt about the economic justification of giving the entire 80 per cent.  Then there is the position if the local authority gave the 30 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister might decide on giving 70 per cent.  I do not see it arising. It is catering for an eventuality which is unlikely to arise.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary put the words right into my mouth.  I am sure he must have some experience of this, say, with county councils.  I shall take my own county council in the Waterford constituency where East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet.  Therefore, if there were a division between the eastern and western county councils, and it were a close issue, the Parliamentary Secretary says the Minister might decide not to give the 80 per cent because of the closeness of the issue.  I submit that that is all the more reason why he should give the 80 per cent because the majority of the county councils voting against it would do so on the point of what the charge would be on the rates.  If they were going to get, say, 80 per cent, and the rates would pay 20 per cent, it might be bad enough for a whole lot of them.  However, if they thought <Col N="433" /> the Minister had the power to reduce the grant from 80 per cent to, say, 50 per cent, then there would be a breach.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill.  The majority of the sections were in the old Bill.  I give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for bringing the 80 per cent to the surface. At the same time, there is no use in having a leaden weight tied to the 80 per cent, so that it can be sunk at will to 40 per cent or 30 per cent. Would the Parliamentary Secretary meet me now if I put in an amendment on the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I would not.  I am in the same position as Deputy Sweetman when he introduced the 1956 Coast Protection Bill.  I used the exact words he used&mdash;&ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;&mdash;for the self-same reasons, although I do not think he went into detail about them.</P>
      <P>On the question that the Minister might take cognisance of a close issue at a local authority meeting and, as a result of close voting on a proposal, might not agree to the 80 per cent that would not be entirely correct.  The Commissioners would have the press cuttings of such a meeting.  The consideration would be not so much the closeness of the voting as the economic merits of the proposal.  In other words, each project will be judged on its merits.  I am satisfied beyond yea or nay that the majority of the cases which we know of, if they reach us and are promoted by the local authority, will qualify for the 80 per cent.  If the Deputy, nevertheless, wishes to put down an amendment on the Report Stage, we can discuss it further.</P>

It might well happen that a wealthy concern or State or semi-State body would be located on a stretch of the coast or adjacent to a damaged railway line, harbour, and so on, and might contribute, themselves, in order to get the scheme there.</P>

      <P>If the House will agree, we can take amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together. The three are really drafting amendments. Amendment No. 4 clarifies the position in relation to the taking over of a new or improved road or bridge by a local authority.  The section covers interferences with public roads and bridges.  Where the Commissioners, in dealing with a public road or bridge under this Act, confer substantial advantages on the public by way of new works or improvements, the local authority will contribute such part of the cost as the Minister for Local Government shall certify.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (5) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>(5) (a)  Where the Commissioners carry out maintenance or improvements at Rosslare Strand, subsections (3) and (4) of this section shall apply as if the maintenance or improvements were referred to in section 20 of this Act and the council of the county of Wexford were the promoting authority.</P>
      <P>(b)  In the foregoing paragraph&mdash; the reference to maintenance at Rosslare Strand shall be construed as a reference to maintenance in proper repair and effective condition of the coast protection works at Rosslare Strand in the county of Wexford which were commenced by the Commissioners in the year 1957;</P>
      <P>the reference to improvements at Rosslare Strand shall be construed as a reference to any improvements to those works executed by the Commissioners which appear to them to be minor matters properly capable of being regarded as maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that a scheme of coast protection was commenced at Rosslare Strand in 1957 and will probably be completed in 1964.  The estimated cost of the scheme is £120,000.  The works being carried out are of such a nature that, on completion, they will require very careful maintenance.  It is intended to treat the scheme as if it had been carried out under this Bill.  The Wexford County Council have contributed approximately 25 per cent of the estimated cost and, as I have stated, their contribution <Col N="438" /> will be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Bill.  No specific statutory authority is required for this adjustment.</P>
    <P>Statutory powers are required, however, in relation to maintenance, and the purpose of this amendment is to provide these powers.  This section provides that a promoting authority will pay to the Commissioners: (1) half the costs and expenses incurred in connection with a scheme which does not proceed; (2) the full amount of the costs and expenses incurred on the maintenance of a completed scheme; and (3) the full amount of the costs and expenses incurred on works which become necessary in the event of abandonment.  Provision is made for contribution by other local authorities towards the amounts payable under (1), (2) and (3) and by harbour authorities towards the amount payable under (2).</P>

That will have to be done.  In regard to the percentage payable in respect of works that have been carried out, Cork County Council have already paid 100 per cent.  We want that cut.  We say they should be responsible for only 80 per cent and that work done by them for the protection of Cork county from coast erosion should be treated as having been done under this Bill in the same way as Wexford is being treated in respect of the work they have done at Rosslare.  There will be no objection to that.  I should like to know if that can be done now or on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The representations received to date by the Department of Local Government and my Office have all referred to storm damage.  I should like to remind Deputies of the provisions of Section 2 of the Bill, which enable a county council to investigate and have a report prepared on any proposals for coast protection work.  I mentioned the last day it would be a good thing to determine the scope of the Bill and the kind of work that could be covered by the definition of coast erosion.  We have devoted a good deal of thought to this and we have come to the conclusion that we cannot improve on what is in the text already in subsection (3) of Section 2, which enables a county council to initiate a scheme &ldquo;if satisfied that land within the county is being progressively damaged&rdquo;&mdash;progressively damaged&mdash;&ldquo;by the continuing encroachment of the sea, as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms, and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property....&rdquo;</P>

The bulk of the money expended has been expended on putting up parapet walls to prevent constant and recurring erosion by the sea.  I pointed that out to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We are only looking for the same treatment as has been given to Rosslare and Wexford County Council.  We are entitled to the same treatment, unless the Parliamentary Secretary is bringing in a Bill contrary to the Constitution, <Col N="440" /> which provides for equal rights for all citizens.

      <P>I want to make a plea on behalf of Wicklow town for the period from 1957.  I take it that special treatment is being given in this amendment to Rosslare from 1957. We also have had this problem in Wicklow town.  As far as I know, a scheme involving the expenditure of something like £5,000, 75 per cent of which was a State grant, was made available to Wicklow in 1958 or 1959, and as Deputy Corry said, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and I do not see why Wicklow should not benefit.  After all, in an urban area where one penny is worth £44 or £45, it is a greater hardship, in my opinion, on the people in that area to contribute the balance than for the county at large, so that if the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to consider an amendment from the Cork Deputies, I hope he will be prepared to consider an amendment from me also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Electoral Act, 1960, gave effect, with some minor modifications, to the recommendations in the first Interim Report of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law.  The present Bill has been prepared to implement generally the recommendations in the Second, Third and Final Reports of the Joint Committee, except those in regard to qualifications and disqualifications for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These, together with the machinery for dealing with election petitions, will be the subject of further legislative proposals&mdash;in the not too distant future, I hope.  While the Bill is based principally on the findings of the Joint Committee, the opportunity has been availed of to deal with a number of other points, not covered in the Joint Committee's Reports, in which amendment of legislation now in force seems to be necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have received with the Bill an explanatory memorandum which sets out in some detail the changes which the measure proposes to make in existing law.  The Reports of the Joint Committee describe very fully the changes which that body recommended and the reasons underlying their recommendations.  I do not propose, therefore, to present to the House at this stage a lengthy exposition of the various provisions of the Bill. Instead, I will advert briefly to some of its more striking proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> We have followed as closely as we could the Joint Committee's recommendation that the legislation to implement its proposals should repeal the previous statutes in full, avoid legislation by reference and be self-contained. This has made the Bill a long but, I hope, an intelligible document.  Its length is further increased by the necessity of keeping the presidential, local elections and referenda codes in step with the Dáil code.  Apart from the obvious desirability of doing this to avoid confusion on the part of candidates, returning officers, agents and the general public, the maintenance of uniformity between the different codes is important because of the special provision in Part VIII for the holding of different types of election on the same day.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will represent a very considerable reduction in the mass of legislation dealing with elections.  Apart from the wholesale weeding out of the pre-1923 Acts, the number of post-1923 Acts dealing with the registration of electors and the conduct of Dáil elections will be reduced from twelve to four, including the present Bill.  The other three Acts are the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1933, which has a provision bearing on disqualifications for election to the Dáil inappropriate to this Bill, the Electoral Act, 1960, and the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1961, dealing with constituencies. This reduction will make the task of consolidation, which was the Joint Committee's ultimate aim, very much easier.</P>
    <P>The number of Acts dealing with the conduct of presidential elections and referenda will be reduced to the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, the Referendum Act, 1942, and the present Bill plus the applied provisions of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  The law on the conduct of local elections will be contained in one set of regulations instead of being scattered, as at present, over more than a dozen different Acts, and a tangled mass of orders and regulations which only the expert can unravel.</P>
    <P>In addition to eliminating the complexity and the deadwood, the Bill attempts to remove obsolete provisions <Col N="445" /> from the electoral code.  It has been framed in relation to the conditions and standards of our day.  Where this approach so requires, there has been no hesitation about discarding provisions&mdash;some so long established that they appear to be an integral part of the scheme of elections&mdash;which serve only to complicate the process of registration and election.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Section 5 in Part II of the Bill provides accordingly for the registration as Dáil electors of persons so qualified.</P>
    <P>In the case of local elections, it is proposed to allow every person aged 21 years or more who normally resides or occupies property in the area of a local authority to be registered there as a local government elector, irrespective of whether or not he is an Irish citizen.  At present a person who is not an Irish citizen can be registered as a local government elector only if he has occupied property in the area of a local authority for six months, or is the wife of such an occupier, and is a British subject.  The number of non-citizens who will receive the local government franchise as a result of the proposal will be small, but considerable simplifications in registration procedures will result from the change,</P>
    <P>The old provision for disfranchisement of persons as part of the penalty for certain electoral offences&mdash;which does not, I am afraid, hold for anybody the terrors it may once have had&mdash;will be abolished by a number of repeals in the First Schedule and instead the more tangible penalty of heavier fines or longer imprisonment will be provided. Some rationalisation of procedures will result.</P>
    <P>With the abolition of the provision for the registration of Dáil electors where they occupied business premises, which served only to complicate registration without any compensating advantage, every person over 21&mdash;<Col N="446" /> apart from soldiers, certain inmates or patients in hospitals, county homes and prisons&mdash;will be registered where he was ordinarily resident on the qualifying date.  If he is a non-citizen he will be registered only as a local government elector.  Electors who occupy for the qualifying period, other property in addition to their residences will, also be registered as local government electors in respect of that property, if they are not already so registered in the local authority area where the property is situated.  The object of this proviso is to ensure that nobody is registered more than once as a local government elector in the area of a local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that for registration purposes an elector's age is to be taken as his age on a date to be specified in regulations.  The intention is to specify the date on which the register of electors is published or comes into operation, thus continuing the arrangement, made under the Electoral Act, 1960, which allows eligible persons reaching the age of 21 by that date to be included in the Register.</P>
    <P>At present, the work of preparing the register of electors and jurors lists is shared between officers of local authorities, for most of whose functions I am the appropriate Minister, and county registrars, for most of whose functions the Minister for Justice is the appropriate Minister.  This divided responsibility, at both local and central levels, as might be expected, is not satisfactory and the Joint Committee considered that registration work could, with advantage, be brought within the ambit of the one authority, subject to one Minister.  The Committee accordingly recommended that the work should be transferred entirely to local authorities whose members are elected by those registered in the register and who can, therefore, be presumed to have a direct interest in its compilation.  To safeguard the rights of electors, the Committee further recommended that county registrars should adjudicate on claims for and objections to the inclusion of names in the register.  Effect is being given at Section 7 to these recommendations. The concentration of registration work under one roof will enable some further <Col N="447" /> rationalisation of procedures to be effected and the greater resources of local authorities, both in staff and equipment, should be of particular benefit.</P>
    <P>As another step towards rationalising registration, the complicated arrangements for dividing costs between the State and local authorities will be replaced by a straightforward 50-50 sharing of expenses.  A saving to local authorities, estimated on the basis of figures for a recent year, to total about £10,000 annually will result.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, which deals with the conduct and costs of Dáil elections should, I think, be welcomed by the electorate, by returning officers and staffs and by candidates at elections. The requirement, dating back to the Ballot Act, 1872, obliging a candidate to obtain the sponsorship of ten electors causes unnecessary trouble and inconvenience alike to the candidates, to sponsors and to returning officers. This is now being discarded and in future a candidate can nominate himself or can be nominated by any elector in the constituency for which he proposes to stand.  Severe penalties are proposed for nominating a candidate without his consent and, together with the £100 deposit, these should ensure that there is no abuse of the new and simpler nominations procedure.  It is also proposed to require the returning officer to give a decision on a nomination paper within an hour after it is handed to him instead of waiting, possibly for days, until the time arrives for the ruling on nominations.</P>
    <P>Returning officers are not a court of law and cannot judge whether a person is qualified or disqualified for election.  They have, in fact, not tried to exercise this sort of jurisdiction. The Bill will put the present practice on a clear statutory basis.</P>
    <P>To discourage the nomination of persons who are not qualified, nomination papers may contain a brief summary of the principal qualifications and disqualifications for election and a candidate or his proposer may be required to subscribe a declaration that he has read this statement and believes the candidate to be qualified. <Col N="448" /> There will be penalties for false declarations.</P>
    <P>Particulars of candidates' political affiliations will appear on the nomination papers and will be included on the ballot papers.  Voters will thus be in a better position to identify the persons for whom they intend to vote.</P>
    <P>Another proposal which I feel will be generally commended is that for the elimination of the pink tendered ballot papers given to voters who have been personated.  Although only a hundred or so of these papers are used at a general election, thousands of them must be printed and distributed to presiding officers.  They are not counted except in the event of a petition. The new arrangements will cut out this waste of printing and will provide for the inclusion of the tendered ballot paper in the count.</P>
    <P>The elimination of practically all provisions for oaths or affirmations in connection with polling is a further streamlining of procedures.  The penalties for voting in another person's name, or voting twice, or for a candidate or the agent of a candidate acting as a companion to a blind or incapacitated voter will, of course, remain.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most striking change which is being made under Part VII of and the First Schedule to the Bill is the abolition of the limitations on the amount of the expenditure which a candidate may incur or the number of persons he may employ in furthering his candidature at a Dáil election. These limitations originated a century ago when the electorate was much smaller than at present.  The Joint Committee felt, and I am in complete accord with their view, that the assumptions on which the limitations were based are no longer valid.  The limitations are at present admittedly ineffective and to try to make them effective, even if anybody thought that desirable, would require the most elaborate and far-reaching controls. The Bill, therefore, proposes to abolish them.</P>
    <P>The changes made in the Dáil code will be incorporated, where appropriate, in the law relating to presidential and local elections and to referenda.  A new proposal included <Col N="449" /> in the presidential elections code is that for a special tribunal to consider objections at nominations other than objections to the form of the nomination paper.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill sets out to codify and modernise the law relating to local elections.  It is visualised at Section 85 that local elections will be held on the same day throughout the country.  The present system under which different days between 23rd June and 1st July, inclusive, are fixed by different authorities has led to a dispersal of interest.  If one polling day was fixed for the whole country the publicity given to local elections would be more concentrated and would lead to a greater public interest in the elections and possibly to a higher poll.  Greater public awareness of local elections should be prompted also by the power to be given to local authorities by section 84 to issue polling cards.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted the intention to require a candidate at a local election to lodge a deposit.  This move will tend to curb a form of abuse which has manifested itself at some local elections.  Candidates have stood for election who could have no reasonable hope of being elected; such contests involve the electorate and ratepayers in inconvenience and expense and should be eliminated by the introduction of deposits, sufficiently large to deter irresponsible nominations but not large enough to prevent the candidature of anyone who sincerely believes that he has a prospect of being elected.  Of course, if his belief is justified in the eyes of the electorate, he will get his deposit back.</P>
    <P>I feel it would be ungracious of me to conclude without paying tribute once again to the splendid work which was carried out by the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law.  Our task in preparing the present measure for your consideration was immensely facilitated by their deliberations, extending over more than a year during which they examined in detail all aspects of the franchise and registration of electors, the conduct and costs of Dáil elections and the expenses falling on candidates at these elections. In years to come, their reports will <Col N="450" /> undoubtedly be regarded as a milestone in the development of the Irish electoral law.  I trust that the House will indicate their appreciation of the work of the Joint Committee in the most evident manner &mdash; by accepting this Bill in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tribute the Minister has paid to the Committee that did the spadework in regard to the Bill which is now before the House.  In paying tribute to the members of the Committee, I should like also to pay tribute to the officials of the Minister's Department who worked so hard in preparing suggestions and collecting information in regard to the Bill.</P>
      <P>From this side of the House, in general, we welcome the measure as being timely and necessary.  The electoral law in this country has been for many years contained in various pieces of legislation and there was a good deal of reference and cross-reference. In the Bill, approximately 80 Acts of Parliament dealing with the conduct of elections are being repealed.  The principal piece of legislation that is to remain is the 1923 Act.  It is a great tribute to the draftsmen of that period that that Act remains as the principal piece of legislation to which we will refer in the course of our amending of the electoral law.  It is, perhaps, to be regretted that we did not succeed in producing one comprehensive Bill which would obviate the necessity for cross-reference even to the four Acts to which the Minister has referred.</P>
      <P>There are a number of features of this Bill which will require very careful consideration.  They were carefully considered by the Joint Committee on Electoral Law Reform. In the main, the recommendations of the Committee have been accepted but there are a number of proposals which the Joint Committee saw fit to make which it is not proposed to implement in the Bill.  I would invite the Minister to tell the House why it is that these recommendations of the Committee are not being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I would direct the Minister's attention at this stage.  It is in regard to the withdrawal of nominations.  In that <Col N="451" /> regard, a power is being given to a returning officer which, in my opinion, is too wide, too great a power to confer. I would invite the Minister to have a further look at the provision:</P>
    <P>....provided that the returning officer may accept a withdrawal effected by a notice signed only by the person presenting it if that person is registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency for which the candidate was nominated and the returning officer is satisfied that it would not be reasonably possible for the candidate also to sign the withdrawal.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Bill to which I would direct the Minister's attention is the fact that in the conduct of local elections, the making of a polling scheme is a reserved function of the local representatives.  They have the right to ask the Minister to make changes in regard to the electoral areas. In the cities of, say, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, where there is one electoral area at the present moment, if I read the measure aright&mdash;and I speak subject to correction&mdash;the Minister here seeks to take the power unto himself, without reference to the locally elected representatives, of recreating the wards in these city areas.  I can understand that if a local authority, having considered the matter, request the Minister to make these changes, he would be giving effect to the popular demand as expressed by the elected representatives, but if the Minister decides to take unto himself this power without having been asked by the locally elected representatives, then I suggest the Minister is doing something that is unwise.  It is something that we have complained of time and time again in regard to the rights of elected representatives in another portion of this country and I would hope that there would not be at any time a piece of legislation going through this House of which it could be said at any stage that there was an attempt to gerrymander an electoral division, that the elected representatives of the people had not asked for such a change.  I invite the Minister to comment on that aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> In regard to the conduct of the poll, in Sections 26 and 27 there is a seeming anomaly.  Under Section 26 an individual coming in to claim a vote may only be required to answer certain questions without being sworn, if the presiding officer so determines as being the proper course for testing his validity to vote.  We are removing here the power which did repose in a presiding officer, on request, of putting to the person questions and making him affirm solemnly or on oath.  That power is now being removed.  The questions may be put to the individual but he may not be required to swear or affirm.  It has always seemed to me to be a power that should not be lightly used but it has always been considered a useful deterrent to personation. Whereas that is the position under Section 26, in contrast, under Section 27, blind, in capacitated and illiterate voters may be subjected to the process of swearing.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to 21st December, 1960, should have the rent allowances which were paid to them treated as pensionable emolument just as members serving since December, 1960, enjoy that right.&mdash; (Deputy Ryan.)</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure 17 minutes will be more than adequate for my requirements.  As was stated by a number of people, including myself, on the last evening this matter was debated, there seems to be no valid reason why those Gardaí who retired prior to 4th December 1960 should not receive the same consideration <Col N="453" /> from the point of view of pension as do those who retired after that date. The number involved is approximately 2,500.  The cost to the State of doing what this motion asks would be relatively small and it would be a diminishing cost over the years.  It is not a cost which might increase.  The numbers are growing less year by year. The case for it is all the stronger because of that.  It is quite true that the Garda Representative Body had been pressing this claim since 1952 and it does not seem logical that, when the decision was finally taken to credit retiring Gardaí with £1 per week rent allowance for pension purposes, that decision should apply only to those who retired since 1960.</P>
      <P>Those who are applying for this benefit under this motion are those who, as was stated the last night, in fact established civil law and order in this State.  They are the people who joined the Force when it was not popular in some parts of the country to do so and it is on the record, in fact, that not alone were there threats used against some of these men but attempts were made to burn them out and bomb them out.  We are all aware of that.  But these people established law and order very successfully and they subsequently served under a Government, the members of which had opposed the setting up of the Garda Force in the early days.  From that point of view, the Minister will, I think, agree that it is very important that these people should not now be left under the impression that it is because they became members of the Garda Síochána so many years ago they are now being treated in this discriminatory way.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware, perhaps better aware than most of us, that in other countries police forces get credit for rent allowance when their pensions are being computed.  When the case of the Revenue Commissioners v. Guard White came before the Courts it was decided that the rent allowance formed part of salary for income tax purposes.  Surely it is only reasonable that salary for income tax purposes should also be computed as salary for pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say they are getting the concession now.  Those who are retiring now are getting it admittedly, but that is not an answer to the case where the older Garda pensioners are concerned.  In fact it makes the whole position so much worse because it seems grossly unfair that those who retired before the operative date of this change are in fact receiving a lower pension anyway.  Added to that, they must now suffer this further reduction because they are refused credit for something which is now recognised, and has been recognised since 1960 as part and parcel of their emoluments.</P>
      <P>The fact that it was as a result of arbitration that the decision was given should have influenced the Minister when he was fixing the operative date. Had it been merely something he himself decided to give, one could understand that he would be entitled to make terms as to the date of commencement. In fact, this decision came as a result of arbitration and it was therefore mandatory on the Minister, but he certainly got his pound of flesh when he insisted that only those who retired after December 1960 would be credited with the allowance.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Minister could not at this stage give the very small concession asked.  Pensions have been increased for other people.  Last year, we had a long discussion here on pensions and rates of pay for another branch of the Department of Justice and the sky was the limit.  Surely, when we are dealing with people who nobody can claim are overpaid, people who did a very hard job and did it well, our aim should be to treat them in a christian way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what way one looks at this motion, one comes back to the vital matter: first, the number involved is relatively small&mdash;2,500; secondly, that number will diminish over the years&mdash;it does not involve a recurring liability which will be building up&mdash; and thirdly, the people concerned are mostly people who helped to establish the State, who helped to establish the civil law of this State and who made <Col N="455" /> the country at that time possible to live in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust this motion will not be treated as an expression of the whim of one Party or another or made a controversial matter.  Deputy Tully mentioned that a mere 2,500 are involved and that, therefore, it would mean a mere £2,500 taking it as £1 per head.  In Dublin city, a sum of £11,500 is equivalent to a penny on the rates and I shall leave it to the Minister, who is very good at arithmetic, to work out the calculations involved in the one-fifth of a penny represented by £2,500.</P>
      <P>The last speaker paid an eloquent tribute to the work done by the old members of the Garda.  I agree their task at times was anything but pleasant.  However, I confidently leave this matter to the Minister who is big in heart.  I do not believe anyone else could handle it better.  Deputy Tully stated that in other countries this allowance is included but the all-important point is the matter of dates which have caused so much trouble, dates before and after.  While I have not always agreed with everything done by the Garda Síochána, they have proved themselves to be not only efficient officers but excellent representatives of this country in all branches of sport who brought the name of this country to the forefront all over the world.  It is not merely a question of whether the proposer or the supporters of this motion will gain anything from it.  It is a question of justice which would be a scarce commodity in this country, were it not for the efforts of the people about whom we are talking.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I should congratulate Fine Gael.  I have always had a great opinion of their political sagacity, if I had nothing else on which to congratulate them.  I do not know if there was ever a motion before this House to which so many Fine Gael members put their names.  It is the sort of motion in respect of which, as far as they are concerned politically there is everything to be gained and nothing to be lost and, therefore, I expected all their <Col N="456" /> names to be down.  Of course, Labour not wanting to be outdone went even a little further than Fine Gael were inclined to go.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, in speaking here on the motion earlier, said that the Garda are the one branch of the public service who are compelled by law to contribute a certain percentage of their pay to their pensions and that other branches of the public service are not compelled to make any contribution at all.  That is true, of course, in regard to the Civil Service as a result of a settlement made on salaries and wages many years ago when their contributions were removed, and in more recent times it was done for the teachers. I could well imagine its being said at a future date if the Garda are getting an increase: &ldquo;You are now contributing 2½ per cent to your pension and you are seeking a five per cent increase. Why not make it 2½ per cent. and wipe out the pension contribution? The result would be the same and we shall not have the inconvenience of deducting this 2½ per cent.&rdquo;  I do not think there is much in that point. In the local service, on the other hand, the superannuation remains, and remains at five per cent in nearly all cases.  There are certain exceptions which I may come to again.</P>
      <P>There are a very big number of employees in the local service, something like 22,000 who, Deputy O'Higgins believes, have a right by law, being civil servants, to have their pensions calculated on salary plus rent allowance, if that allowance is given. There is no foundation for that statement at all.  I do not know if rent allowance is given in any case but if it is, there is certainly no law behind the matter which says it should be reckoned for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Tully pointed out later on, some few years ago, a settlement was made in respect of certain employees of local authorities under which the allowance that was counted for rent became pensionable but that was only in certain cases, and it really brings them into line with the present position as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned.  As Deputies are aware, if members of the Garda Síochána go <Col N="457" /> into a house owned by the Board of Works or by the Government, they have to pay rent, but even so, that does not prevent their having that rent counted for pension purposes.  However, there is this difference to be noted that in the case of the Garda Síochána, the provision is 2½ per cent, whereas in the local authorities it is five per cent as a rule; in certain cases and for a certain length of time, three per cent was the contribution from mental hospital attendants but now it is back to five per cent.</P>
    <P>Prior to 21st December, 1960&mdash;just to state the history of the position as accurately as I can&mdash;rent allowances paid to members of the Garda were not reckoned for pensions.  An agreement was reached at that time by the Conciliation Council, and it was decided in that agreement to merge the rent allowances with pay.  At that time, of course, there were many categories of Garda, officers and so on, and whether they were living in the country or in the city, the rent allowances given at that time varied greatly according to the place of residence and rank.  A comprehensive settlement was made giving an increase in pay to the Garda and the officers, and it was laid down that they would pay rent in future for whatever premises they might occupy.  Even a single Garda taking lodging in the barracks was charged for that lodging as well.</P>
    <P>As I say, that agreement applied from 21st December, 1960, and I think it is the agreement on which this debate largely depends.  Like every other agreement of its kind, this agreement dated from that date, 21st December.  So far as I am aware, no agreement of this kind has ever been made retrospective.  It applied from the date the Garda were paid the new rate of pay and from that date also each Garda paid rent, if he had rent to pay to the authorities.  The pension of a Garda retiring after that date would be calculated on his pay at the time of his retirement.  If a Garda retired, say, in January, 1962, he would have a higher pension than a Garda who retired early in December. That, of course, is a common occurrence in the Civil Service and, I take <Col N="458" /> it, in employment generally, because where a pension is calculated on retiring pay, those who retire immediately after an increase in wages or salaries have a very big advantage over those who retired before the increase.  That has applied up to the present time.</P>
    <P>There were a few exceptions to that rule, and in case some exceptions might be cited, I want to say that exceptions have not been made, so far as I can find, except where commitments were entered into.  If there had been a commitment in that agreement, and if it had been part of the agreement that this would be retrospective so far as pensions were concerned, for a year, or two years, or all time, of course that agreement would be carried out.  There was no such clause in the agreement.</P>
    <P>We sometimes agree here in the House to give an increase in pay to the Civil Service and the usual procedure is that if I, or whatever Minister is here, say that the increase will come in on 1st August&mdash;the usual date &mdash;and if a Supplementary Estimate is brought in, that increased pay is given from 1st August even though the legislation has not been passed.  In fact, legislation relating to increased pay from 1st August last has not yet been passed or debated in the Dáil although it has been introduced.  As I say, that agreement came into operation on 21st December, 1960.  There was, of course, a revision of pay and since then, there was the eighth round of wage increases.  That did not alter the position because the eighth round of wage increases purported only to increase the pay of the Garda much the same as was done in various other parts of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This motion seeks to give an increase in pensionable salaries on the same basis as 1960 to the oldest living pensioners. As I say, that was not provided for, and neither is it usual that a thing like that would be done.  It would entail the retrospective granting of pay increases involving recalculation of pensions from the date of retirement on the money then paid.  It would be very difficult to find out what rent allowances each individual <Col N="459" /> was entitled to at the time of retirement. The rent allowances varied according to rank and location and I think they varied through the years. To go back over all the pensioners for all time would entail an examination of each individual to find out what rent allowance he had at the time of retirement and trying to recalculate backwards on that basis what his amended pension should be.</P>
    <P>In our last increase in pensions, what we provided for, and what will be provided for in the Bill which I hope to bring before the House in the very near future, is that the pension of each individual public servant, whether civil servant, teacher or Garda, will be brought up to what he would have had if he had retired on a date towards the end of 1955, taking into account the people in his grade, at his level of increments, and so on.  That was a very big job because it was the first time an increase in pensions of that nature was given.  Before that, all the increased pensions were on a percentage basis.  That was a comparatively easy matter and could be calculated in a few days.  It was an attempt to bring the older pensioners up to a particular point, and give them pensions equal to those of their colleagues who retired at that date in 1955.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we gave a five per cent increase to them, and to those who retired between 1955 and 1960, a six per cent increase was also given. That was part of a general revision, and I expressed the hope when bringing it in that we would, as the years go by and Budgets permit, bring the level of pensions forward perhaps a couple of years at a time and that, say, when the next Budget would permit, we would bring them up to the 1959 level or some such level and eventually try to get them into relationship to other pensions, but whether that relationship would be on the basis of equality or parity or whether it would lag somewhat behind I cannot say at this time.</P>
    <P>What we are asked to do here is to give exceptional treatment to one class and for one reason.  I am sure that if I were to think over the various groups <Col N="460" /> that are drawing pensions, I could think of circumstances attaching to some groups that might merit the same consideration as is being given by some speakers to these Garda pensioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a point about the pensioners who have been paying the 2½ per cent.  The men who retired before 21st December, 1960, had not been paying a contribution on the rent allowances and, therefore, it is not true to say, as some Deputies have said, that they have paid for this.  They did not pay for it.  I do not think that is an important point because, as I am going to point out later, these men will probably be reached.  What the time will be, I cannot say.</P>
    <P>Insinuations have been made here that the Government have been unfair to the Garda pensioners.  I want to say about that that in the last revision of pensions, they were brought up to the 1955 level.  They then got six per cent on that and, between 1955 and 1960, they got six per cent, apart from those other increases.  It has added up to the point where the Garda as a class have received an increase of 15.9 per cent in their pensions while the civil servants as a class have received 12.8 per cent.  I mention that to show that there has been no discrimination against the Garda and that they have done better on the whole than other similar classes.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the rent allowance can be recognised only when a general revision is made bringing them up to the level of their colleagues who retired after 1960.  They will automatically be brought up at that stage and will receive equivalent treatment to other classes of State pensioners.  The principle we have adopted in our last round of increases in pensions is to equate pensions with some date relating to the time they have retired.  That is done in accordance with what we can afford to contribute. On the last occasion, we took the end of 1955.  It is hoped that that procedure will be repeated in Budgets to come, when the Budget position permits it, and eventually these men will be reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Another point argued by some Deputies was that the allowance given to the Garda for their rent was taxable. It is argued from that that the allowance should be pensionable.  I do not see anything in that argument. There must be many people outside who are taxed on their incomes, including rent, and they may have no right whatever to a pension.  These two things do not connect in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said that the Garda would fare much better through arbitration.  In the eighth round, the matter of their increases was decided by conciliation.  That means that the Representative Council of the Garda Síochána were agreeable to the amount decided on and accepted it on behalf of the Garda generally.  That must be taken as meaning that they got a recommendation with which they were satisfied and that they accepted it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins read a letter from the Minister for Justice to a representative of the Garda pensioners. I should like to say that I do not accept Deputy O'Higgins's interpretation of that letter.  However, apart from that, I am sure that the Minister for Justice, when writing that letter, which was a sympathetic letter, had no idea that it would be handed over by a representative of the pensioners to the Fine Gael Party to be used as political propaganda against the Government.  I do not like lecturing junior Minister but I hope the Minister for Justice will be more careful in future and know whom he is writing to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but handing over letters is a different matter.  The Fine Gael Party may serve their own <Col N="462" /> political purposes by using these letters but it does not serve the Garda position. Deputy Coogan said that we were politically opposed to the Garda in the Civil War period.  That may have been so and Deputy Tully followed it up by saying that we should be more careful for fear we might be accused of discriminating against them.  We have done more for these Garda pensioners than the Coalition Government did before 1954 and 1957.  As I have already stated, in our last distribution in increases of pensions, we gave the Garda 15.9 per cent and we gave the civil servants 12.8 per cent.  I would like to assure the Deputies and the people concerned that we intend to continue to do justice to these people. In fact, we have done a little more than justice.  On account of the way correspondence has been used in this House, we will have to be more careful about what we write and keep our counsels to ourselves.  We will listen to their representations and keep our counsels to ourselves.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should say that I do not think there is a case for this at all. There is no case that can be made in equity and there is certainly no case in law.  Deputy Tully made the case that the cost would not be very much and that it should be conceded.  The cost is not exorbitant.  It is something like £55,000.  It is not insignificant either.  We oppose the Fine Gael motion because it is not called for in equity or legally.  Therefore, I must ask the Dáil to reject the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Deputy is disappointed with the Minister's speech.  I think he is disappointed himself because the manner in which he has dealt with the motion is unworthy of him.  Certainly it does not show any great regard for the ability or administrative capacity of his colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister has adopted the attack technique in asking for the rejection of the motion, not having any other argument.  He said he has never seen a motion with so many names to it from Fine Gael.  If the Minister would go to his archives or to Lower Mount Street, he would find many Fianna Fáil motions with just as many names&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He would find examples many times over and for less worthy objectives.  The case for these people is simple.  Up to a certain point, in Garda salaries the rent allowance was not reckoned for income tax purposes.  Then there was a change and it was so reckoned. Surely, when that occurred, there was a change in the whole circumstances? When it was regarded as part of the pay and emoluments of a Garda, surely it was part of his pay?  Therefore, in equity, it was part of his pay for pension purposes.  It is as simple as that.  The Minister for Finance himself admits the equity of that by his 1960 Order.  We have been asking him to rectify what the Government fail to do, knowing that it ought to be done.  We are giving him the opportunity.  We are helping him to do what he was convinced should be done from 1960.  We are giving him the help to do it prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose we were opposing it.  Suppose some Fianna Fáil Deputy or number of Deputies brought in a motion and that we in Fine Gael opposed it.  The <Col N="464" /> Minister could very easily say: &ldquo;Because there is no unanimity upon this matter, I cannot accept it.&rdquo;  Therefore, he should be glad of the opportunity we have given him.  He asserts that one of the reasons he cannot consider it is that there is not precedent.  I do not know any word in Government or Civil Service vocabulary as abused as that simple word.  It is the greatest defence that any Minister has when he wants to do nothing and when he wants to reject something he is convinced should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice was convinced of the equity of this claim.  The Minister for Justice asserted that he urged and made representations to the Government and to the Minister for Finance to accede to this request but that the Minister for Finance did not do so.  For what reason?  I would say, again, the reason was financial; that it was not just opportune.  We get merely a repetition of that this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there will be a grading-up.  He says there will be a general review and a levelling-up at a later stage.  &ldquo;In 1960, we brought it up to the 1955 level; we shall bring it up at a later stage.&rdquo;  Is that not &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;?  The people affected are becoming fewer and fewer every day.  They are now the honoured retired servants of this State.  I should not like to suggest for a moment that the Government could be charged with having any hostility to the Garda: I do not think they have. I do not think there are any grounds for such a suggestion because no force in any country in the world ever served the elected Government of their country as loyally as our Civic Guards.</P>
    <P>The elected Government here, in the years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, could rely fully on the Garda to carry out the law as it then existed.  We might not like some of their conduct but still they did it.  They might not like it themselves but yet they did it because it was the direction of the elected Government of this country.  Today, we are told there is no comparison between the Civil Service and the Garda.  I do not think we want a comparison.  The truth of the matter is that, generally speaking, the Civil Service rates of pay at all times were considerably higher <Col N="465" /> than the Garda pay in the relative ranks.  I doubt if even the Commissioner had the equivalent pay of an Assistant Secretary of any Department but he should be so graded, approximately.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there never was any housing&mdash;except in very special circumstances, as the Minister says&mdash; or rent allowance to civil servants but there was to the Garda.  The Garda were put into barracks as single men. They had to occupy them and their pay was less because they had this living accommodation, no matter whether it was good or bad.  We know that when the Civic Guards were instituted in this country, they took over any of the old barracks that were left and they had to go into all sorts of houses, which they had to accept and they had to work under most adverse circumstances.</P>
    <P>The all-important point to remember is that the courts have decided that for the purpose of income tax the rent allowance is taxable.  That is the established position and, that being so, it automatically follows that if it were calculated for income tax purposes, it should also be calculated for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the sum involved is not small.  The larger it is, the greater the obligation to pay because the greater is the amount these people are being wrongfully denied.  If it were only a small sum, the Minister could say that when it was distributed over 2,000 people, it would be a matter of small concern, but when the case is substantiated that there is a large sum involved, I submit that makes the case for payment all the more urgent because the larger the amount retained from those people, the greater the injustice.  I assert there should be no hesitation on the part of the Minister in carrying out the wishes of his colleague in the Department of Justice in this respect.  The Minister for Justice was convinced it should be paid; the Government were convinced it should be paid when they brought in the Order of 1960, but they said it did not apply to the men of yesterday but only to the men of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I submit it is all-important that not only should justice be done in this case but that it should be seen to be <Col N="466" /> done.  These men rendered valuable service to this State.  It is a tribute to them that they went out and did their duty since the time of their formation and that they were among the very few police forces in the world to do so with only a baton.  Thank God, they still go on duty with the baton as their only form of defensive and offensive weapon&mdash;the baton and the notebook &mdash;and I have heard many people say that the notebook was even more dangerous than the baton.  Be that as it may, they discharged their duty in a very unselfish and reliable way and I do not think it is too much to ask that the Government reconsider the whole question.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance is rejecting this on his own.  I believe it is a Government decision and it is for that reason that I appeal to the Government to reconsider this and see that justice is done to these very faithful servants.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Minister's entire case was that the Garda are well treated.  That is a relative matter. To the person who has nothing, £5 a week seems a lot of money; to the person who has £2 a week, a man who has £7 a week appears to have a lot of money.  When the Minister says that Garda allowances were increased by 15.9 per cent during the period when Civil Service allowances generally were increased by 12.6 per cent he is again making comparisons that should not be made.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with this argument: the Minister said it would be establishing a precedent, that there never had been retrospection in cases such as this.  I do not want to be taken as making an attack on it, but I wonder if that applied in relation to former Chief Justices' pensions?  Mind you, the award in that case was a substantial one.  Whether it is a month, three months or three years, I submit the principle has been admitted and, therefore, should not be rejected in this case.  This proposal may be rejected on any other ground but not on that one.  I submit to the Minister and the Government that they should reconsider this whole question.  These men will not enjoy these benefits for eternity: they are human beings and their lives will come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy MacEoin in the appeal he has made to the Government.  It is unfortunate that a matter of this kind, which has to do with the very elementary and simple right which should be accorded to a limited body of men who carried out a very difficult and at times very dangerous task in former years, should become a political issue.  Perhaps there is a lesson in what has been said here this evening for other organisations, a lesson about the manner in which they should approach politicians and the extent to which they should put dependence on one Party or another.</P>
      <P>There is nobody in this House who is not anxious to see justice done to the ex-Gardaí.  The question is one of the mechanics of the thing.  The Minister for Finance has stated he rejects the proposition on the grounds of equity and lack of precedents.  These are terms I have heard called into use many times when, in fact, the real reason was that it meant the expenditure of more money, and the question arose as to where that money was to come from.  It is not outside the capacity of the Minister for Finance, surely, to find the relatively small amount, £55,000, required to meet this demand, and I would appeal to him and to the Government to try to find that money between now and Budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any lack of goodwill towards the pensioners concerned on the part of any Party here. Members of Parties on both sides of the House are at one in their anxiety to see that justice is done here. Accordingly, I find it difficult to understand why it should be made a political issue.  I certainly do not think it is a matter that should be put to a division, particularly in view of the general agreement there is that it is purely a question of the mechanics involved in trying to induce the Minister to do something.  He has said something will be done in the future. I urge him to do it in the forthcoming Budget.  I would ask that the matter be left that way instead of creating a position which will do no good whatever to the pensioners concerned.  If this matter becomes an issue and there <Col N="468" /> is a division in this House, the people who will suffer will not be the members of the House or the members of political Parties.  The people who will suffer will be the Garda pensioners, whom most Deputies here are anxious to help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for this motion has been well and thoroughly made.  I rise to support it because I believe we are dealing with men who have given excellent service to this State.  That service should be recognised as well as the State can possibly afford to recognise it.  These men in their time did not receive anything like the pay, or, indeed, the conditions, the men we have at present are enjoying.  Nevertheless, they did an excellent job.  At the same time, they lived in quarters that were often very poor and they had none of the comforts, amenities and privileges the men of the present have.  I realise the situation in some cases today leaves a good deal to be desired.  Nevertheless, great improvements have taken place over the years.</P>
      <P>These men did their job well.  They mixed with the people.  They knew the people intimately.  In their time, it can be said, there were very few unsolved, serious crimes.  That was so because, whatever else they were, they were first-class policemen.  That is what we want and that is what we should acknowledge now.  I am told that a man who retired ten years ago receives by way of pension approximately half the amount given to a man of similar rank retiring today.  Surely no case can be made in justice and equity for that distinction?  Surely the man who served the country over a long and difficult period is at least entitled to similar treatment now in his retirement as the man retiring today?  I think that no case can be made against that.  Any attempt to make a case against it cannot be based on justice and equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things that can be said about these men in the past&mdash;the difficulties under which they lived, the lack of transport facilities, the poor accommodation and the poor pay. During their time, their pay, comthank  <Col N="469" /> paratively speaking, was very small. Nevertheless, they went about their work and did a good job.  Here we have them to-day being very badly treated in retirement.  Nobody can say that the people retiring to-day are over-rewarded for their services.  Yet they get twice as much as the man who retired ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not know how anybody can stand up and defend that position.  Certainly, I would not like to be the Minister for Finance who tries to make a case for the continuation of that situation.  I want to support the motion and exhort the Minister, as other Deputies have done, to grant what it seeks.  The sum involved is said to be considerable and, as Deputy MacEoin said, that fact indicates the extent of the injustice and it indicates also the obligation that is ours to meet it.</P>

      <P>In common with the other Deputies who have appended their names to this motion, I feel that in accepting it we would be merely doing justice to the members of the Garda Síochána affected by its terms. It has been truly said that these men in their time rendered remarkable service to this country.  Any disability they may be suffering from now in relation to this matter should be rectified.</P>
      <P>The terms of the motion are clear and the case put forward is, to my mind, an unanswerable one.  The remarks made by the other Deputies supporting this motion have set out the reasons for its being tabled.  We feel that in asking the House to agree to it we are merely asking for justice in relation to this matter.  I wish to join with the other Deputies in appealing to the Government to meet the just and fair demands outlined in the motion.  If they do so, they will be merely giving to these people their just rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been circumstances in which special measures have been introduced from time to time to meet the legitimate requirements of some sections of our public service who, for some reason or another, have been omitted from benefits conferred on <Col N="470" /> colleagues.  It is in these circumstances we feel we are not asking anything too great.  The cost involved would be very little, but it would mean a lot to these men who rendered such valuable service.  We feel we are not asking anything outrageous but something reasonable and well merited.  We feel the Government would be acting quite reasonably in accepting the terms of the motion and providing for the increased pensions and gratuities outlined in it as being fully deserved by the members of the Garda Síochána. I have nothing to add except to submit that in these circumstances the Government should accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I thought some Deputies might overcome their embarrassment and express their support for the motion.</P>
      <P>The floor is strewn with Aunt Sallys of the making of the Minister for Finance, which the Minister for Finance put up and knocked down. He is a very good marksman, as we know from experience, in knocking down Aunt Sallys.  However, I do not think that kind of marksmanship is good enough where it is a matter of serious consequence to many people who have given their best years in unselfish service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to comprehend the attitude of a Deputy like Deputy Dunne who queries the wisdom of dividing on this matter.  I have little patience with anybody who comes into this House to express support for a motion and states that we should not vote on it because the Minister is not prepared to accept the motion.  If we find a Government denying justice to a section of the people, we must make it clear that we disagree with the Government and there is no way in a democracy in which that can be done so effectively as going into the Division Lobby.  Earlier in the debate, the Minister for Finance shrugged his shoulders, which supported a worried head, and mumbled that there was no need for a division.  I suppose we are expected to understand from that that the Minister was not unsympathetic <Col N="471" /> but where a matter affects people who may be dead by the time justice is done to them, one cannot stand idly by and see a continuing injustice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while we have no desire to lambaste the Government, and while we have no desire to cause anybody political embarrassment in relation to a matter which is above politics, we must declare where we stand in this matter so that there can be no doubt about it.  These men are entitled to this small modicum of justice, if not from this Government, then from the Fine Gael Government when they assume office, because if we go into the Division Lobby to vote for this motion, we commit our Party beyond yea or nea to the giving of this pension allowance to the retired members of the Garda Síochána.  I have no hesitation in declaring that that is the intention of my Party when returned to power. If Fianna Fáil want the credit for doing it, now is the time to do it.</P>
    <P>This is something which is in no way affected by the Government's White Paper and their claim for a pay pause.  This is a claim which has been made for several years.  It is one which the Minister for Finance indicated was something which sooner or later would receive his favourable consideration. Last year, he received a deputation from the Garda Pensioners' Association in connection with the overall scheme of rent increases for all sections of the public service.  At that time, as on previous occasions, the Association made a special case for the rent allowance and the Minister then did not, as far as I am aware, make all the empty arguments which he made against this motion tonight.</P>
    <P>We are aware that later on the Minister for Justice went on record as supporting this claim.  If that is the situation, we feel that now is the time to grant it.  The Minister for Finance stated that this is something which had to be considered in the light of the general budgetary situation but last year it would appear there was more money in the Government pocket than there is this year.  Last year, the Minister was unable to do <Col N="472" /> it so we have had another 12 months of injustice.  It is quite clear now from the Government's attitude that we will have a further longer period of postponement.  It seems to me that whenever the budgetary position is likely to permit an increase in pensions, it will be in a period of inflation when there is more money stirring but by the time that inflationary period comes about, the pensioners will be in a worse position. They would therefore need to get a tremendous increase to cover all their losses and the amount of money which the Government would require would be doubled.  Hence we would have another time lag before giving to the pensioners the amount to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>This is not something which has to be considered in relation to the overall public pension situation.  This is something related to a very small number of people, to the members of the Garda who retired prior to 20th December, 1960.  The Minister stated, quite rightly&mdash;we accept his contention&mdash;that this debate rests on the agreement of 20th December, 1960, and he then added an <i>obiter dictum</i> that no such agreement is ever retrospective. In our motion, we are not asking that the increase be made retrospective. We feel in justice that it should be retrospective certainly to 20th December, 1960, but we have not asked for that because we felt that the best way of getting the Government to accept the motion, without the need for any lobbying or any division, was to be perfectly reasonable in our approach.  Therefore, we asked for something which the Government could give and which the Government could not say created a precedent.  But, as Deputy MacEoin said, there is nothing in the law of this land which makes it impossible to do something unless there is a precedent there for doing it. If that were so, we would be wasting our time as a Legislature and the Government would be wasting their time in making up new policies&mdash;trying to think up new ideas.</P>
    <P>In the whole pension code over the years, as the Minister acknowledged, we have improved step by step.  We are beginning to close the gap between <Col N="473" /> pensioners now retiring and people who retired years ago.  I hope the day will come when we will be like many of the nations in Europe who are members of the European Economic Community where pensions are not based on what a person was earning at the date of retirement but upon what people of equivalent rank now serving are receiving.  That is accepted in most enlightened democracies in these days, but for some reason we have continued to regard as sacrosanct a pension plan devised during the Franco-Prussian War.  If we accept this motion, all we will be doing is giving to men who retired on or before 20th December, 1960, what every person who has left the Force since then has received.</P>
    <P>How much will it mean per man per year?  One must accept an average figure because, as the Minister pointed out, there were different rates of rent allowances, depending on a person's location or his rank, but it would be roughly £35 per year per man.  The cost to the State would in this year be about £60,000.  Unlike any other financial commitment the State may undertake, this is one which would be declining year after year until the last of those pensioners had gone to his eternal reward.  This is not something which could possibly increase, because there is no person to whom it would apply who like the worm could double himself or treble himself and, therefore, multiply the claims which could be made on the State.  If it is not done this year it is going to be done some other year, so why not now?</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to draw a parallel between the contribution made by the Garda and the contribution made by local authority employees for pension purposes.  If I am right&mdash; and I am sorry that the Minister is not here to put me right if I am wrong&mdash;it is only local Government officials who were recruited since 1948 who are making any contribution towards their pensions, so that the majority of local authority employees are not making any contribution.  The Minister's argument in that regard is, therefore, not as accurate or as overwhelming as he pretended it to be.  The Minister has <Col N="474" /> conceded that there have been several cases where wage claims have been compromised by abandoning the provision for contribution to pension schemes.  It is quite likely that the same will happen to the local authority employees, and, indeed, it would appear to be a sensible thing, because there is hardly any employee in the private sector who has to make contributions similar to those which State employees of this kind are asked to pay.</P>
    <P>Another of the Aunt Sallys which the Minister for Finance put up was that he saw no justification whatsoever for arguing that the rent allowance should be calculated as a pensionable emolument because the State regarded the rent allowance as part of wages or salary while men were serving in the Force.  The reason he advanced for that was that there are many people paying income tax who never receive a pension at all.  Of course, it is perfectly true, but I am going to put a question to the Minister: can he quote to me any case of a person whose pension is based upon what he earned having a reduction made in his pension in respect of that proportion of his pay which was notionally compensation to him for his rent?  He would not find it throughout the length and breadth of this or any other country.  If he wants to analyse this income tax argument let him do it properly and objectively.  He will find that there is no case where emoluments were regarded as wages or salaries for pension purposes where the rent element was left out of it entirely.</P>
    <P>If it were, we would have this situation&mdash;it is taken as a rule of thumb that the cost of housing in most cases represents between one-fifth and one-sixth of a man's income.  That covers the outgoings he has to pay on his house.  If every Department of State were to find itself in a situation where the State said: &ldquo;We are going to reduce your pension by one-fifth or one-sixth because while you were serving and receiving wages and salaries, one-fifth or one-sixth was for rent allowance, and therefore, we are going to reduce your pension by that amount&rdquo;, there would be an outcry and a march upon the Dáil and all the Garda serving in the city would not be able to hold them <Col N="475" /> back.  There would be a hue and cry, and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were in Opposition, would be putting down a motion with great speed and fighting for it with greater vigour than we are for this small portion of justice for a reducing number of people.</P>
    <P>That is the Gilbertian situation which the Minister for Finance states he is unable to change, a situation which he says is based upon reason so that it is unreasonable to argue otherwise.  Of all the thin arguments advanced, the thinnest of the lot was the assumed fury of the Minister that a letter from the Minister for Justice should have been quoted in this House, when that letter was sent by the Minister for Justice as Minister to the Pensioners' Association.  The Minister knows well that such letters are public property and are intended to be public property.  If the Minister wishes to convey to any group of people in this State that he is sympathetic to their proposals or claims and by so doing wishes to get the kudos for the support he is giving to that claim, then he is entitled to that kudos, and if anybody reads that letter in Oireachtas Éireann, it is only advertising the Minister.  It is only giving wider publicity to the fact that the claim has the Minister's support, and he intends that whenever it is approved, even if by a Fine Gael Government, he will get the credit for it and he will be the first to read that letter in this House.</P>
    <P>This onslaught upon elderly men who tried properly to engage the support of all the people in this House is unworthy of any Minister, and particularly of the Minister for Finance, and it is done by him only because it is the only escape door he can find from the very shabby situation in which he found himself here today. The only hope the Minister for Finance has is that when the taste of this debate has passed away, Fianna Fáil can keep going around along with Deputy Dunne saying that the Minister would have given it if Fine Gael had not read the letter from the Minister for Justice in the House stating that that Minister was in support of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I can see that the Minister for Social Welfare finds the situation somewhat amusing.  I have no doubt that he is embarrassed.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance came into this House intending to reject this motion and was just delighted to have found some little artificial manoeuvre that could be used.  We are not going to allow the Government away with that kind of thing, and I do not believe that the Garda Pensioners' Association will accept it either, because otherwise it will be the end of Parliamentary democracy in this country, the end of free speech and of the right of free association and of everything except to go crawling to the Fianna Fáil Party in order to get anything.  If they had not come to all Parties in this House to correct the situation dealt with in this motion, would they be in any better position?  We know now that they would not.  We know that from the letter of the Minister for Justice and from declarations by the Minister for Finance from time to time.  The situation is that the Government are annoyed and irritated that we should have put down this motion in order to get even the small share of justice which these men are entitled to and have been entitled to for a long time.</P>
      <P>In order to find some argument for his attitude the Minister stated that it would be impossible to implement our motion because to do so would mean very difficult inquiries and calculations to discover what amount each particular person would be entitled to.  If that is the only worthwhile reason the Minister can advance, I think that the association will be prepared to compromise and accept for each retired member of the Garda an average figure for the increase, just as serving members have agreed to an average figure being included in their pay in lieu of rent allowances. I am quite certain the Association will find a way for the Minister to get out of that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> I just want to end by pointing out that the agreement of December 1960 was made between serving men and their representatives at conciliation level.  The pensioners were not represented at that meeting but members of the Garda received certain rights there. We believe that those rights should be conferred on those who, because God put them into this world before that, had retired before the 20th December, 1960.  We should not hold their age against them.  They served the State well and are deserving of this small degree of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the sections of the Bill which deal with questions that may be put to voters when they come to the poll.  I referred to the fact that there was a departure from the proposal of the Joint Committee in this respect.  In the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill, that matter has been adverted to in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee did not recommend the abolition of the oaths and affirmations which a presiding officer may put on polling day as to the age or identity of a voter...</P>
      <P>Most people who have experience of elections would agree that one of the greatest safeguards against personation has been the deterrent inherent in an individual having to subscribe to an oath or affirmation.  The Joint Committee, having discussed this matter very fully, considered that that safeguard should remain.  I cannot see why it is proposed to remove that safeguard in Section 26 and retain it, for a different type of voter, in Section 27. One would imagine that the consideration of uniformity would have commended itself to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees that the right of an individual to vote is one of the fundamental safeguards of democracy. <Col N="478" /> A person who, on coming into a polling booth, finds himself deprived of his vote, feels very much aggrieved. We should not lightly remove any safeguard which has been embodied in legislation up to now.  In those circumstances such a person got a tendered ballot paper.  Under this Bill he will get an ordinary ballot paper. I would again indicate to the Minister that we feel very strongly in regard to this matter and consider that the oaths and affirmations should not be abolished.</P>
    <P>With regard to the compilation of the register, the recommendations made by the Joint Committee which are being implemented in this Bill are very proper and very sensible.  The local authority is the body most closely in touch with this work and the provisions maintain the chain of connection between the Minister, his Department and the local authority who have been carrying out this work through the rate collectors.  The Joint Committee gave this matter a great deal of attention.  The publicity given by the Department during the past year to this question of registration and what it means for the individual has been most useful.  It has brought home to the public the necessity for being alive to the fact that registration is most important if a person is to retain his right to vote.  Anything which the Department can do to publicise that fact would be most desirable.  In the making of regulations in regard to the registration of electors I would ask the Minister to have due regard to the suggestions made by the Joint Committee in regard to administrative action.  There were 11 such recommendations, contained in pages 51 to 55 of the Second Interim Report of the Committee.</P>
    <P>The recommendation by the Committee in regard to the fee payable to rate collectors, if implemented, would lead to a better register.  The best safeguard an individual can have is that the person compiling the register feels that the work he is doing will be sufficiently rewarded rather than that he should be penalised for a bad register.  The power exists for penalising an individual who does not prepare a <Col N="479" /> register properly.  In most things in life it is far better to offer an incentive for the better type of work rather than a deterrent against the slovenly type. I would suggest, then, to the Minister that he might consider that matter in regard to registration.</P>
    <P>In regard to cost, it would appear that it will be borne equally as between the Department of Local Government and the local authority concerned in the compilation of the register.  It does strike me that the local authority enter into it inasmuch as the register of jurors is also based on the register but I would point out that the register would have to be compiled in any case and I would ask that as far as possible the heavier portion should be borne by the Department in view of the fact that the register has to be compiled in any case for Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee considered at great length the question of notification of births by the superintendent registrars in various areas to the authorities compiling a register.  After lengthy deliberation, they did not consider it wise or feasible that that should be done in so far as births might be recorded in places outside the area of the local authority compiling the register, but there is no such good reason as to why, for instance, the superintendent registrars should not be compelled to supply to the authorities a list of deaths that have taken place within the 12 months.  That would help in large measure to keep the register up to date.  It would be much easier for the superintendent registrars to supply a list of deaths than to supply a list of births.</P>
    <P>The count facilities are also dealt with in this Bill.  I am glad that there will be uniformity under this measure in regard to ballot papers marked other than by figures.  Hitherto such papers were disallowed.  I think everyone with experience of counts is aware that voters often mark ballot papers with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or by writing &ldquo;one&rdquo;, &ldquo;two&rdquo;, or &ldquo;three&rdquo;.  There was no measure of agreement on such papers as between constituencies.  I am glad that under this measure provision is <Col N="480" /> made for validating such papers in future.</P>
    <P>With regard to facilities at the count, there are, of course, limitations as to the type of building which may be available in different areas.  I am sure the Minister will impress on the registrars the necessity for securing the most suitable building to enable those present at the count fully to satisfy themselves as to the validity of the count at all stages.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, an elector will be registered where he is ordinarily resident; he will be deemed to be where he was last resident unless he notifies to the contrary.  That is a wise provision.  The degree of uniformity for the whole country is very desirable from every point of view.  When the Minister comes to make regulations in regard to registration, I am sure he will have due regard to the dates the Committee recommended would be the most suitable in regard to registration and the receipts of claims and objections. These were very fully considered by the Committee and, for very good reasons, they recommended certain changes.  I trust the Minister will give effect to these.  We shall have an opportunity of discussing them again inasmuch as these regulations will have to be laid on the Table of the House for approval.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the provisions with regard to the limit on expenses.  It is time logic applied to the situation.  The register of political Parties is a new departure.  It was felt this would lead to more reality and give the electorate a better opportunity of making a choice.  Why the Bill has departed from the recommendation of the Committee in regard to the individual who wishes to describe himself in, as the Committee said, five words is something upon which I should like to have some explanation from the Minister.  Why such a candidate should be described as &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo; instead of being described in the five words recommended is something I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Self-nomination is very desirable. Everybody who has been a candidate in an election is aware of the tension which exists in case the proposer, <Col N="481" /> seconder, or assentor to the nomination might turn round and fail to sign the paper in the proper way or not, perhaps, have the proper number, and so on, on it.  These provisions bring the whole matter more into line with modern practice.  Indeed, this Bill could serve as a model in this regard.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with forfeiture of the deposit was considered very extensively by the Committee.  The Committee, having deliberated at length, felt that the fraction ought to be reduced from one-third of the quota standing to a candidate's credit at the end of the count to a quarter. Why the Bill has departed from that recommendation I do not know.  I am sure the Minister will give us some explanation as to why he has seen fit to make that departure.</P>
    <P>There was again a lengthy discussion on the hours of polling.  It was felt that a large section of the electorate did not vote because the hours did not suit.  The Committee suggested the hours should be 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. all over the country.  The Bill departs from that recommendation, making it not less than a 12-hour period between 8.30 a.m. and 10 p.m.  A period of 12 hours is, I think, long enough and I do not believe any greater efficiency will be obtained by extending the period.  Why the period should be changed to 8.30 a.m. to 12 midnight requires some explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Those are the principal changes to be noted in the Bill in regard to Dáil elections.  In regard to local elections a deposit is being required of the candidates.  This is an innovation and, perhaps, a desirable one.  The other sections dealing with local elections are, in the main, following recommendations which have been made here in regard to the conduct of Dáil elections.  They should lead to a greater interest and a greater facility in the exercise of the franchise by people in local elections.  The provision whereby the candidates are free now to represent any area within the ambit of the local authority is a useful departure and does make for the wider type of representation to which <Col N="482" /> the voters have been accustomed in Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill as a simplification of the electoral law and an introduction of well worthwhile innovations into it.  I regret it has not been found possible to bring all the electoral law into one piece of legislation on this occasion but at least the work of the Committee over the 12 months has not been wasted, and the Minister says this measure will be followed at a later stage by some other piece of legislation.  I should like to pay a tribute to the Committee for their work in this respect and to the officials of the Minister's Department in relation to the valuable suggestions which they brought before the Committee for its consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in congratulating the Joint Committee on the work they have done.  It shows evidence of having been accomplished by men who are aware of the kind of problems with which this Bill seeks to deal.  The Minister and his Department should be thanked for the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill and which makes it easier for us all to get a bird's eye view of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of democracy since Dickens wrote about the Eatonswell elections has created many problems in trying to ensure that the people's voice is translated into proportional representation. The enormous expansion of the electorate since that time has added to the problems even in the rather minor matter of the inability of the officers or staffs at polling stations to establish the identity of voters.  That is the particular difficulty in the cities. The system of proportional representation makes the exercise of the franchise harder for the electors.  The British electorate, with only two or three candidates on the ballot paper, have only to mark a cross in front of one of the names and their task is relatively easy.  English people have spoken to me about the difficulties of electioneering in this country and the difficulty of marking a ballot paper.  A lot of their opposition to PR is possibly due to the fact that they are not intelligent <Col N="483" /> enough to use it.  Our people are and have shown that kind of intelligence. On one notable occasion, the House will remember, our people were able to sort out the issues very well.  Two different propositions were issued to the voter at the one time and the difficult phrasing used in connection with one of them made the task of the voter a difficult one, but the voter worked it out.  In the average constituency there are about ten candidates and the voters sort them out all right.  The problem of the county boroughs is being attended to in this Bill.  The Minister has been given power to make the voting papers more manageable by dividing areas, which is a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker about the sacrifice of the deposit and I think the reduction of the proportion of the vote to a quarter from one-third is still punitive enough to prevent frivolous candidature and would not be too punitive for a certain kind of candidate who may not have Party funds at his disposal, who would be a desirable asset to any Parliament and for whom defeat would be a serious financial loss.  As we all know, for the kind of candidate I have in mind the loss of the deposit is only part of the loss in electioneering which is not an inexpensive business.</P>
    <P>One other criticism I have to make is in relation to the extension of the hours of polling.  I have in mind that a number of our polling stations are in schools which do not have lighting facilities.  It is very undesirable that voting should take place in dark or near dark.</P>
    <P>At last we have begun to look at the facts of life and are allowing the use of Party names on the ballot paper. This is an excellent development which makes it much easier for all concerned but particularly the voter.  There was always the problem of candidates with similar or near similar names.  The Party label will help in this case.  I certainly think the word &ldquo;non-Party&rdquo; is a better word to use than &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; because the word Independent&rdquo; always had for me <Col N="484" /> a connotation of superiority which my experience of Independents does not justify.</P>
    <P>The best men in Parliament have always been men in a Party.  I do get tired occasionally of those who sit on the sideline with that smug superiority over those who have to sit behind or in the front bench and bear a Party label.  If democracy is to work at all it can only work with a Party system. If a man comes in here as an Independent or as a non-Party man in future, I hope, he would want to be an extremely good man to be any better than the average of the Independents of whom I have had experience.</P>
    <P>The fifty-fifty sharing of the costs of providing the register is fair.  The scrutiny of electoral costs is another phase of the facts of life and it has no relation whatever to conditions to-day.  I hope there is no danger that a Kennedy or a candidate of that calibre will come on the Irish scene and sweep the electorate with great wealth but there are values outside money values which we cannot measure. No one can say how useful it is to a political Party to have a great newspaper behind it.  Who can measure the public relations provided by a paper of that kind to the candidates, no matter how unsatisfactory they may be as public representatives?  The support which the <i>Press</i> newspapers give to candidates is a support that can never be measured by the electoral authorities and bears no relation to the facts of life as we know them to-day.</P>
    <P>The proposal to add a supplement to the register is an excellent one.  All of us have had the experience that no matter how often the registrar publishes notices that the register has closed, there are always those who are not on it and dead men still masquerading as electors.  This is a useful and sensible provision.  I am particularly pleased with the improvment this will make in local government elections.  The deposit which will now be required by a candidate in a local government election is quite important.  It will put an end to the experience we all have had of completely frivolous candidatures.  In the city of Cork, we can always count on getting eight or nine of them in a <Col N="485" /> local government election.  They are an added difficulty in a ballot paper that may already contain 60 or 70 names. These frivolous candidatures bring the total up to 80 or 90 names.  Most people tire when they reach the 19th or 20th name and I think in the last local elections the ballot paper in Cork had 78 names.  In that regard, the Party label is going to be a great help to the voter, now that Party politics are part of the local scene.</P>
    <P>The most valuable contribution in the Bill is the power it gives to have the voters notified of where their votes are.  Doing that is likely to improve the turn out from 30 to 40 per cent of the electorate which is the best we have been able to get in recent times.  If it is made easier for the local government elector to vote, he will vote.  That ignores the case that can be made against me that if he is interested enough, he should vote.  Human beings are not like that.</P>
    <P>Our system of local government has earned a bad name but I would say that the inherent taint of corruption or near corruption has now almost completely gone.  That inherent taint made it appear to the public generally that the local representative, on the whole, was not worth voting for.  Anything that makes it easier for the voter to improve the quality of our public representatives is a great step forward.  Such a great amount of the work of government has now been moved on to the shoulders of local representatives that it is very desirable that those who take part in local government should be of the very best quality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think it is an excellent document.  I think it is a fine thing to get this simplification of the electoral law and if there are any further steps to be taken, they should be taken as rapidly as possible.  We can all put our fingers on instances of weakness and if the achievement of good public representation is to be secured, with all the benefits it can bring and all the things it can put an end to, the simplification of the electoral law and the fairness of the electoral system are most important constituents. The machinery of democracy is quite as important as the theories or the philosophies of the system.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Electoral Bill.  It eliminates many of the restrictions which have existed heretofore and it gives an opportunity to any ambitious man who feels that he should go up for election to do so. I am pleased that a person has not now to be living in the area in which he stands for a local election.  That was the case in Dublin for a number of years and I am glad that the system is being brought into line with modern requirements.  The idea of having property in one area and living in another is a fairly logical approach to the matter.</P>
      <P>The fact that a man will have to deposit a certain sum of money when standing for election to a local authority is adding some dignity to candidature for local elections.  People do not take much interest in local elections, notwithstanding the fact that local councillors take a very active interest in the life of their district.  A lot of work has to be done by local councillors in their areas and, collectively, at their meetings.  I hope the changes in respect of the voters at county council elections will encourage people to take an interest in local affairs.  The only time we hear anything about local affairs is at the time of the striking of the rate.  I am not going to bring the rates into this, but I should like to see something in the Bill to encourage people to take a greater interest in local affairs.  In recent years, we have had very small polls at local elections.  From time to time, a councillor is asked to do almost the impossible.</P>

      <P>In general, I welcome this Bill, subject to reservations.  I have misgivings on two or three aspects of it.  I thought Deputy Barry might have told us something of the system that operates in Cork city in relation to the registration of voters. For several years past, those of us working in Dublin have noticed official announcements put in by the registrar in Cork&mdash;large notices in the paper&mdash;advising people in the Cork constituencies of the necessity to register before a certain date.  We have been rather envious that this notice has been confined to Cork city.  More credit to the Cork registrar and the Cork people responsible for this enterprising and quite expensive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for national publicity advising people of the necessity to register, to examine the electoral lists to see whether or not their names are on it.  All of us who stand for election in Dublin city are very familiar with the person who comes along to you on polling day to protest he has not got a vote and to ask you to do something about it.  Of course, nothing can be done.  The reason for that is that the present form of statutory notice which appears in the paper, put in by the registrar of electors, takes about three inches in the legal notices.  If the Minister would on a nationwide basis engage in publicity <Col N="488" /> at the appropriate time of the year, a very useful purpose would be achieved.  It is important that all who are entitled to do so, who have the necessary qualifications as to nationality and age, should have their vote at election time.  There have been far too many complaints on this score in the Dublin constituencies in the past.</P>
    <P>I have misgivings about the rights of self-nomination which are being conferred in this Bill.  I believe the necessity to acquire the signatures of eight sponsors in the past was a guarantee against a crackpot candidate. At least he had to find eight persons to sign his nomination paper, even if they were only his relations. We now have the position where any crackpot can go along at election time and fill in his own nomination paper. I do not think that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I have not studied the Bill in close detail and I am not in a position to say whether or not it is correct to say, as the last speaker did, that the Bill is taking a more liberal approach to the question of spoiled votes.  A distinguished gentleman who was city sheriff and returning officer in the city of Dublin for many years, the late Dr. Lorcan Sherlock, established a certain code which perhaps was not in strict conformity with the provisions of the Electoral Act now being amended.  A guiding rule which he adopted was to allow any vote which clearly indicated the wish of a voter.  A vote marked with a single &ldquo;X&rdquo; was, under the provisions of the present law, an invalid vote; but it was the practice under Dr. Sherlock, on the ground that the voter's intention was clear, to allow such a vote.  I hope the Minister can give us an assurance that this reasonable interpretation of the law will be permitted in the future.  There still are surviving amongst our electors today many people who when they first voted did so under the old British system by marking an &ldquo;X&rdquo; against the name of their chosen candidate.</P>
    <P>Again I have misgivings about the provisions which remove the affirmation and oath in cases of attempted personation, which it has been customary to apply.  Elections now, <Col N="489" /> goodness, have become much tamer affairs than they were, even up to a few years ago.  There are some people who believe that personation can be attempted and sometimes is attempted on a fairly large scale in this city at times when there may be a very keenly contested election.  Anything being done in this Bill to make it easier for a person to steal another's vote is a retrograde step and the form of challenging a suspected personator, requiring him to make the affirmation and, if necessary, take the oath, served a very useful purpose in the past.</P>
    <P>There are many other minor matters with which perhaps it might be more appropriate to deal on Committee Stage, such as the need in urban constituencies to control the abuse of publicity, or near intimidation of persons approaching the polling booths by what I would call, for want of a better name, shouters.  These congregate outside the approaches to the polling booths on election days, passing out handbills and pestering people who are going in to vote, who have already made up their minds whom they are going to vote for and who know their candidates, but who are subjected to all sorts of harassment as they approach the polling booth.</P>
    <P>Because one candidate or one Party engages in this form of activity, we all have to do it.  We all have to see to it that there are youngsters outside the schools with dirty pieces of paper with our names on them, because this has been the practice, and it is difficult for any one candidate or any one Party to set the precedent of departing from it.  If we could find some way of empowering the returning officer or the police authorities to ensure that the approaches to our polling booths for, say, 100 yards would be free from molestation, I do not think anybody would object to it.  It would make the experience of voting, of discharging one's duty, much easier than it is at present.</P>
    <P>In Dublin a few years ago, certain persons of English origin who had lived and voted here for 20 to 25 years, suddenly found that their names had been removed from the voter's register. I want to know from the Minister if <Col N="490" /> there is anything in this Bill to ensure that that sort of thing will not happen again.  The question of clarifying the rights of British citizens, in particular, those born in the North of Ireland, is something which needs to be looked into.  They are not foreigners as are French, German or Dutch people.  If we go to England, we are accorded the right to vote in a very short time and indeed in this context I would say that I regret that the Joint Committee which examined the electoral law did not see fit to confer on Irish citizens living in England, temporary emigrants, the right to vote in Irish elections, if necessary, by post.  Other countries confer such rights on their citizens who live abroad.  Australia is one example. Some time ago, there was a notice in our Irish papers advising citizens of Australia to attend at their Legation or Embassy on a certain date to comply with certain electoral formalities. A very strong argument can be made for permitting our citizens who are temporarily outside the country to continue to vote, if necessary, by post.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say on this Bill which in general terms I think is a good one.  I recall that after the last general election candidates of all Parties in my constituency in Dublin undertook, at the request of the returning officer, to see that the system of paying the expenses of the returning officer and the salaries and fees which he pays to his staff would be revised. He made the case that his scale of fees was very niggardly.  It is very important to ensure that at elections in the future we will continue to have first-class personnel carrying out the official functions, functions which have been carried out in the past in Dublin, at any rate, and I am sure throughout the rest of the country, in an exemplary manner.  It would be very unfortunate if a niggardly scale of remuneration in any way militated against that state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister and the Select Committee appointed to go into this whole matter. There are a few features in the Bill on which I wish to comment.  I join with previous speakers in welcoming <Col N="491" /> the power given to local authorities to issue voting cards.  Undoubtedly that will help to stimulate interest in local elections.  On the question of registration generally, I should like to see some provision made to enable a section of our community who, because of their vocation, have been disfranchised in previous elections, namely, commercial travellers, to vote.  It has been represented to me that a large number of those men leave Dublin city early on Monday morning and do not return until Friday evening or Saturday morning.  It is the normal practice to have general and local elections on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  It should be possible to compile a register and to give them a postal vote in the same way as Army personnel and members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which enables long term patients in hospitals and institutions to vote. It has been an undesirable feature in the past that patients and even persons resident as members of the staff in such institutions were unable to participate in an election.  I hope that when an election takes place, it will be possible for the returning officer to make provision for a ballot box to be placed in institutions of that nature.  I have in mind our sanatoria and other institutions situated on the fringes of cities.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision which simplifies the procedure in regard to blind persons voting.  The Bill enables a companion to help him complete the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>The appearance of Party affiliations on the ballot paper is a progressive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the question of registration.  I understand that regulations have been made which may provide a more suitable time for people to claim their votes. As matters stand, the period in which people who are not registered must complete their forms and make their claims ends on 22nd December.  It has been the experience generally in the city that that is not a suitable time, and I hope that an appropriate time will be fixed as a result of this Bill. <Col N="492" /> I should also like to see better provision made by publicity or otherwise in regard to large numbers of people in urban areas like Dublin who unfortunately are not registered.  It has been represented to me that there are people occupying premises with restrictive covenants against subletting or taking in lodgers.  They take in lodgers in contravention of these regulations and as a result when the registration officer comes around, the names are not filled in in the forms.  It is only when a general election takes place that the occupants of such houses find themselves without a vote.  Some steps should be taken to deal with that situation.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs play their part in informing the public by radio and television of the importance of registering for voting purposes, but something should be done to extend that publicity to bring the matter home to those people who, through no fault of their own, are being deprived of their votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not studied the Bill except the gist of it published in the press but I will certainly examine every section of it on Committee Stage because that is the important stage of a Bill such as this.  I have, however, certain views and would like to express them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I am not at all agreed that candidates' names should appear on the ballot paper in alphabetical order.  Why should a man because his name begins with A, B or C have the advantage of getting several hundred votes never intended for him?  It is idle to suggest that that does not happen.  All of us who attend the counts can see that people start from the top of the ballot paper and mark one, two, three, four and so on down to the end.  Many of these people do not know what they are doing.  They just know that they have the power to vote and that they have a day out.  If there are several such people and there are candidates whose names begin with A, B or C, they are going to knock out someone at some stage and one of them will become a member of the House or of a local body although that is not the real will of the voters. <Col N="493" /> These things just happened because a person was lucky enough to have a name beginning with A, B or C.  I do not think that is fair.</P>
    <P>My name begins with S, at the very bottom of the ballot paper.  I have overcome that but only because I reached the stage where my name had become a household word and the voters knew what they were looking for.  In the early stages when I was trying to put my name over like any other newcomer, I was up against it. I can say that I missed being elected to Dublin Corporation on one occasion in particular on that account because of a man just in front of me who was fortunate to have a name that put him on the top of the ballot paper.  I knew that if he was eliminated before me, I would get the bulk of his votes because he was from my locality and was actually getting the votes that would come to me or anyway they would have gone between the two of us.  This man had the advantage and I was eliminated.  I believe that the loss of my corporation seat, at that time was due only to the fact that he was fortunate enough to have a name commencing with A, B, or C, whereas mine was at the bottom of the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>Why should that be?  If there are several hundred people who have not the intelligence to understand this point, why should we not all share in that?  Why should only some people share in it?  I know that some people deliberately changed their names to Irish in many cases so that they would appear at the top and not at the bottom of the paper?  It has been done. Why should some people profit because there are hundreds who are a bit stupid?</P>
    <P>I have even said that there should be a circular ballot paper, but that perhaps would confuse them.  But at least when candidates are nominated, they ought to be summoned to a meeting and all their names should be put into a drum and as they are taken out they should appear on the ballot paper.  There should be no advantage for some people whose good fortune it is that their name commences with A, B or C, because the will of the people is being defeated. The people who vote intentionally and <Col N="494" /> knowing what they are doing might be actually a majority, but because a few hundred people do not understand this point, the candidate is deprived of what the majority intentionally willed, that he should be the winner whereas he automatically becomes the loser.  If there are hundreds of stupid votes, let us all share in them.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies, I have a great deal of experience of elections.  I was reared in politics.  I was in the Fianna when I was a child.  I know how elections are fought.  Personation profits the Party but the individual suffers. The surest way a person can get away with personating is to have the card of the registered voter.  Possession of the card gives the personator confidence. The agents are afraid to challenge. Parties have the great advantage of having committee rooms in every area.  I cannot afford to have a committee room other than my house. When election day is approaching, the followers of the Parties, knowing that such a person is sick and that another person has gone away, rush to the committee rooms and hundreds of cards are handed in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this business. Whether they are used is another thing. They came knocking at my door.  I had no one to personate, even if I wanted it.  The Minister should provide serious penalties in the case of a person found in possession of another person's card within the precincts of a polling booth. That would help considerably in abolishing personation.  I am speaking with knowledge.  In every area there is a director of canvass, the IO of the area, who knows everything that is going on.  The others might not know what is going on.  He is able to issue the cards to certain people who volunteer.  That does not happen in all cases but it does happen in lots of cases.  Whether the personator takes an oath or not, it should be a serious offence to be found in possession of another person's card in a polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time, I have expressed the opinion that persons of 18 years of age should have a vote.  In some <Col N="495" /> countries, they have a vote.  The view has been expressed that such persons are not sufficiently mature.  I cannot accept that, in view of the fact that a man can be conscripted and forced to serve his country at 18 years of age, that at that age a man cannot plead ignorance of the law and can be dealt with under the law to the extent that he can be hanged for certain offences against the law.  Marriage is legal at 18 years of age.  It is an extraordinary position that a man of 18 years of age can be married and have children but cannot vote.  In the past, a person had to have so much property to be eligible to vote.  All along the line the right of the individual to vote has been granted only grudgingly.  Whether the people responsible like it or not, they will have to face the fact that this right to vote will come in time.  It may be that there is a fear that the swing caused by giving youth the right to vote would not be in the interests of certain persons or might favour certain policies or certain people but that is no excuse for withholding the right.  A youth of 18 years of age should not be held responsible before the law if he is considered too ignorant for the purpose of registering a vote.  Old people may suffer from senile decay but they can vote.  I shall say no more on that point.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the name of the Party appearing on the ballot paper.  It would benefit certain weak Partymen.  A candidate must get his name before the public.  If everyone knows about you, you have a good chance of election.  The weakness of a new Party candidate is that the public may not be familiar with his name. This provision will help the new men. Persons who might not otherwise get a vote will collect a few hundred as a result of this provision.  I have no objection.</P>
    <P>On the question of having a proposer, seconder and eight assentors, I agree that that should be done away with, although Deputy Byrne thinks it is not right.  He said any &ldquo;lug&rdquo; can go up.  Birds of a feather flock together.  If there is a &ldquo;lug&rdquo;, he will have other &ldquo;lugs&rdquo; and there will be enough to put eight names down on the paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Nut&rdquo; is the word the Deputy used, or something like that.  If he is a &ldquo;nut&rdquo;, he will have other &ldquo;nuts&rdquo;.  There was one objection to the necessity to have eight assentors. Somebody would write down his name giving the initial &ldquo;G&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Gerald&rdquo;.  The name appeared differently on the ballot paper.  On many occasions I would have to carry out the whole procedure a second time. The names must correspond exactly with the names on the ballot paper.  It is as well to abolish the provision.</P>
      <P>It is provided that candidates for local elections will put down a small sum of £10.  That is a good thing.  Ten pounds breaks nobody and it will keep people from making a nuisance of themselves.  Some people put down their names for fun.  I know one man who put his name down because he had a grudge against the corporation officials.  He had not the slightest intention of fighting the election.  No one likes losing £10 and this provision will have the effect of eliminating the type of person to whom I have referred. A serious candidate will have no difficulty in getting £10.  This provision will reduce the numbers on the ballot paper and make voting so much easier for the voter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in homes and hospitals will in future be allowed to register.  In the past, the well-to-do could be brought by car.  Now all will be enabled to vote because they will be permitted to post their votes.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the danger of these votes being collared by some clever person in the home, hospital or institution.  I appeal to him to consider the danger, too, of pressure being used to get these people to vote a certain way.  In the old rotten boroughs, the voters admitted they had to vote for the landlord or run the risk of losing their job or their land; the landlord was there to watch the way they voted.  We do not want a recurrence of that sort of thing.  I urge the Minister to take steps to ensure that these people in homes and <Col N="497" /> hospitals will not be imposed upon by any clever gentlemen.</P>
    <P>The real work on this Bill will be done on Committee Stage.  I should like to emphasise again the unfairness of printing the ballot paper alphabetically. Candidates whose names begin with an &ldquo;A&rdquo;, a &ldquo;B&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;C&rdquo; get hundreds of votes not intended for them, and the man who would be the people's real choice is robbed.  It is hard to have to say this.  If my name began with an &ldquo;A&rdquo;, I should not like to hear this argument either, but the present system is not fair.  I approve of the Party affiliations being shown on the ballot paper.  I believe I was beaten in one election because there were two candidates with the same name and when surplus votes were distributed, half went to one and half to the other.  In fact, the two were not of the same Party and it was quite obvious the voters were confused and did not know for whom they were voting.  I lost a seat in the early days that way because another man in my area got at least 300 votes which were never intended for him.  I was eliminated because of that.  This change is for the better.  People will in future know for whom they are voting and they will have a much better opportunity of indicating their will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Sherwin in relation to the alphabetical order of names on the ballot paper.  He mentioned, quite correctly, that a man named &ldquo;Walsh&rdquo; may change his name to &ldquo;Breathnach&rdquo; in order to get at the top of the ballot paper.  I suggest the papers should be printed in rotation, and candidate No. 1 should appear as candidate No. 2 on the second ballot paper, and as candidate No. 3 on the next, and so on until he comes to the bottom of the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve of the provision whereby the name of the Party will be shown opposite the candidate's name.  That will give voters a better opportunity of voting for the Party of their choice. I met a supporter of the Fine Gael Party after the last Dublin Corporation election.  He told me there was very little literature at the polling booth, but he felt fairly confident and <Col N="498" /> he went in and got his paper, believing he could pick out the Fine Gael candidates. When he got the ballot paper there was only one name he could identify as Fine Gael.  He was not sure of the others and so he just put No. 1 opposite the one name that he knew was associated with the Fine Gael Party.  That man wanted to &ldquo;vote the ticket&rdquo; as they say.  There was no literature available and he could vote only for one candidate of the Party he was supporting.  The inclusion of the Party on the ballot paper will help people to &ldquo;vote the ticket&rdquo; and leave them no longer dependent on literature at the entrance gate to the polling booth.  That is a tremendous improvement from the point of view of the electors.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the names of the candidates should be rotated.  The inclusion of the Party will be of tremendous assistance to voters who are not sure of Party affiliations.  We should remember, too, that some voters are self-conscious and nervous in the polling booth and they want to get through with the job with the least possible fuss.  Some may have defective eyesight. Some may come without their glasses.  What do they do? They will just try to mark the ballot paper somehow but will not admit they have come without their glasses.  Then there is the person who is semi-illiterate and who wants to pretend he can read the ballot paper intelligently.  The chances are that he will put his mark at the first name on the paper believing he has put his mark at the name of the candidate whom he had in mind.  Any steps that are taken which will make it easier for an elector to cast his vote correctly are to be welcomed. The suggestions in this Bill are an improvement in that direction. If any other improvements can be thought of in regard to the ballot paper they ought to be included in this Bill by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>The hours of voting also arise because we must consider the convenience of electors.  I have nothing to say against the hours provided in the Bill.  They offer every facility to people who wish to cast their votes on <Col N="499" /> election day.  Many of us know that women voters particularly are not keen on voting if it interferes with their domestic duties.  In other cases if a car calls to bring them to the polls they will not avail of it unless they have dressed up and titivated.  There are people then who have other excuses at a time when transport is offered to them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the distance of the polling booth from the person wishing to cast a vote.  In some cases people have very long distances to travel.  We do not have a system of compulsory voting, and, therefore, if people find that three miles is too far to a polling booth they will not travel.  In Australia and possiby some other countries it is compulsory for a qualified person to cast his vote on election day.  There is a great deal in favour of making voting compulsory because very often the very people who have not cast their votes in an election are the people who criticise the policy of a Party or Government after the election.</P>
    <P>Side by side with compulsory voting in Australia there is a provision that the State must ensure that no polling booth is more than one mile from an elector and then he is automatically fined if he does not cast his vote.  If he is voting under protest he can claim his ballot paper at the polling booth and drop it into the box unmarked. There is no compulsory voting in the British Isles and in a democracy there is an inclination on the part of people to neglect the very important duty of casting their votes.  There are many countries where the people would be glad to have the opportunity of casting their votes freely and without interference or danger to themselves and their families.  In democratic countries many people do not realise the value of their right to vote freely and without any kind of intimidation or interference. Therefore, the question of compulsory voting ought to be considered but we should ensure that every facility will be made available to people in connection with claiming their ballot papers and casting their votes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> I come now to a more contentious aspect of voting, that is, as to whether we should have Sunday voting.  There is no Sunday voting here or in Britain but there is Sunday voting in the majority of countries on the Continent of Europe.  There are many arguments in favour of it.  I mentioned the case of the lady who was not prepared to avail of the transport provided for her until she had titivated and who possibly got no opportunity during the rest of the day of casting her vote.  Most people in this country are churchgoers, whatever their religious denomination may be, so both men and women are ready and, if you like, respectably dressed to go down to the village on Sunday morning and cast their votes after the Mass or church service.  That would mean that there would probably be an 80 per cent poll before one o'clock and there would be ample transport available during the rest of the day for the small percentage who would not have cast their votes by that time.  It would be a great convenience to the electors in general.</P>
    <P>There might be strong objections from various religious denominations but all aspects of the suggestion should be considered especially the fact that such a high percentage of votes would have been cast before lunch-time on the Sunday.  Sunday is usually a day of rest away from the daily routine.  In the ordinary way an elector must take some time of the day or evening away from his work or leisure hours.  The arrangement whereby in many households some people must be at home and some away could be the same for Sunday as it is for weekdays.  That arrangement obtains in most households every Sunday.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of postal voting.  I feel that people who are genuinely away from their own polling districts ought to be facilitated in every possible way. Polling cards will be issued to such people in their own home in the normal way but it has been mentioned that commercial travellers, particularly, are away during the week and cannot be expected to be at home to cast their votes.  Surely they should be given <Col N="501" /> some opportunity to vote if a good system could be devised?</P>
    <P>They are not the only people affected.  There are bank clerks and others who are sent out to various places by their employers and the distance might be so great that they could not undertake the heavy expense of travelling back to the place where the vote is available to them.  It should be possible to decide that if a commercial traveller is going to be in Galway on polling day, although his vote is in Swords, he will be given the opportunity of casting his vote in a pre-determined polling booth in Galway instead of either leaving him without his vote or having to travel 150 miles back to cast it.  It should be possible to arrange, in this Bill, that a person who is away from his own polling district can be given the opportunity, subject to due notice, to vote at a specified place elsewhere.</P>
    <P>After every general election, we read in the newspapers of people who travelled 200 miles to vote and of the enthusiastic political Party organisers who went to considerable trouble to bring one or two people over a long distance to vote.  The suggestion I have made would cut out the fantastic inconvenience and cost involved in the transport of people over these long distances.  A person is entitled to his vote and it is up to the State to ensure that, within reason, he is given the opportunity to cast that vote on the day of a general election.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that polling cards are now to be issued to local government electors.  Any of us who have taken part in local government elections have realised the real value of these cards.  Many people feel that the vote is not available to every person over 21 years of age who is on the register.  They believe that the vote in a county council election is available only to a ratepayer or a householder.  The result is that polls in county council elections are very low although the county councils administer most of the national services. Most of these services are available to the electors through the county council which shows the real importance of county council elections <Col N="502" /> though many people do not realise this.  One of the reasons for that is the feeling in the minds of people that the vote is available only to ratepayers and householders.</P>
    <P>Some people really believe that the vote in local elections should be available only to householders and ratepayers and that people who are not regarded as responsible citizens, usually the young people who have no views one way or the other, particularly in relation to the services available, should not be allowed to participate. The position is that they are entitled to vote and they ought to be encouraged to vote.</P>
    <P>I should like to see very severe penalties imposed for personation and attempted personation.  It is a disgrace that the vote of any citizen can be stolen from him very easily on election day.  When the aggrieved person arrives at the polling booth to be told that his vote has already been used, his only consolation is that he is given a pink paper which enables him to cancel the effect of the vote stolen from him.  In every election I have contested, and I have contested quite a few now, there have been examples of personation.  In the last election, there was a ballot paper in our county with the names of the candidates belonging to a different constituency.  It was the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency and the presence of that paper in our box showed that it had been taken out of some booth in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  Obviously, there was some mix up in the Party room and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown ballot paper got in with some of the County Dublin ones that were being used or abused.  That kind of abuse should be stopped if at all possible.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, there was a constituency which had about 75 nurses on the register.  When it was checked, it was found that only about 35 of these nurses were in residence. The others had gone to various hospitals, had completed their courses and were scattered throughout the country but the votes of those other nurses were used.  They were personated. I complained about the <Col N="503" /> matter and brought it to the notice of the Attorney General, asked him to take action and he declined to do so. I hope the seriousness of personation will be realised from the Attorney General down to the lowest person on the day of an election.</P>
    <P>I believe that during the last election the voting papers of the men in the Congo went astray and that the votes cast by them were ineffective. The ballot papers never got into the count.  There must have been some great negligence there, too.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers mentioned the right of non-nationals to vote.  We should consider at what stage a non-national will be entitled to vote.  There are plenty of people here who came from other countries. Perhaps they have lived a long time here and have brought up their families here.  They are paying their rates and taxes to this country.  They are as good as, if not better than, many of our best citizens.  If the law seems to be treating those people unfairly, some arrangement should be made to give them an opportunity of participating in local elections and Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate those associated with the preparation of it.  It has brought about many improvements and brought our electoral system into line with modern trends.  I am sure that as a result of this debate the Minister may find it desirable to bring further amendments for further improvements.  In any event, the Bill, as it stands, is a very welcome step indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As was to be expected, there has not been, so far, much controversy on the matters in this Bill. Generally speaking, it has been accepted as an advance on what we have been accustomed to operate under our present laws.  I suppose this was only to be expected considering the vast amount of consideration given to it in all its aspects by the Joint Committee and, indeed, before the Committee was set up, by the officers of the Department of Local Government.  All aspects of the electoral <Col N="504" /> law were put under the microscope, so to speak, to find out where they were wanting and what sensible changes could be made.</P>
      <P>In the Department of Local Government, this review has been going on intermittently for many years.  During the year before the Committee was set up, the matter was pursued very actively.  It had reached an advanced stage at the point when it was decided by the Government that the Committee was the best way of finishing the job.  The result is the production of this Bill, which is further evidence of the agreement that has been reached by all those who have studied the matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be followed by another Bill, probably during the present year.  I would be very hopeful it will be the present year.  This other Bill will deal with petitions and disqualifications. After we have dealt with that, there will be the ultimate step of a consolidating Bill.  That will probably take a further year.  For the benefit of those who feel somewhat disappointed that we have not been able at this stage to have one Bill covering everything, I should like to say it looks as if it will be possible within the next two years to achieve that very desirable end.  We would all wish to see one measure embracing all the parts we have been dealing with and the remaining parts which will be dealt with in the other Bill.</P>
      <P>The Committee were quite well aware of the difficulty&mdash;and the delay that would have been attendant on it &mdash;of making one measure do the entire job.  It would have meant that we possibly could not have implemented the parts already on the Statute Book, nor would it have been possible to have a Bill as large as this before the House so soon.  They expressed that view at an early stage of their deliberations and foreshadowed that we would be probably forced to take their recommendations in part and deal with them not in just one consolidating measure but in a number of measures to be followed by a consolidating measure. That is the programme in front of us and which I can see coming to an end probably within the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> Deputy Jones mentioned a number of matters as not being in accord with the Committee's report.  It is true there are a number of things that do not accord.  I took it from the Deputy that not only was he somewhat disappointed but he was really surprised to find there should be any discord as far as the approach to the Committee's report is concerned.  Deputies are quite well aware from the information available from those who served on the Committee that, although a report was produced covering many items, there was not always obvious accord amongst the members themselves.  It is only to be expected then that some differences of opinion should occur in so far as the final production is concerned as compared with what was agreed to eventually by the Committee. Taking it by and large, however, the divergence from the recommendations is not of any real substance and should not become a matter of controversy here.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the oath that could be administered by the returning officer is one of the things Deputy Jones pointed out we have dropped. He wants to know why we should drop it in Section 26 and retain it in Section 27.  The Deputy is aware that in regard to personation, we have come down pretty heavily against any offender.  We have stiffened the fines and we have made prison sentences a very distinct possibility.  In fact, a substantial fine, up to £500, or six months' imprisonment, or both, may apply in the case of offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of section 27, which deals with the incapacitated voter, as compared with Section 26, which deals with personation, there are no fines or no imprisonment for a false declaration that one is incapacitated and cannot mark one's own paper. This oath can be said to be of some use in the sense that it can deter people.  It is the only deterrent.  In <Col N="506" /> Section 26, there are very severe penalties providing both for fines and imprisonment.  I know for a fact that one of the things the ordinary voter going to the polls can be afraid of and can be very upset about is if he is called upon to take an oath or affirm by a presiding officer at the instigation of some political Party agent.</P>
      <P>As I say, in cases where they had nothing to fear, where the oath was the truth, nevertheless the taking of that oath in a number of cases has had an unsettling effect on people going into the polls and has made them rather nervous and quite upset.  They were completely in the right but yet they were called upon to go through this performance to which they objected.  On the other hand, if there is a question of the oath being of value in the prevention of personation I wonder whether the person who goes out wilfully to personate will be deterred by the oath or an affirmation.  I question whether that would be a great deterrent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that is so, but if they vote in somebody else's name by falsely representing themselves and if that is known or suspected at the time it is being committed by the offender and that offender is followed by the law, then the fact that he has voted means that he has committed the offence for which he is liable to a £500 fine or six months' imprisonment, or both.  The difference, as pointed out, was that you have the fine and imprisonment, that you have these penalties in Section 26&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the question of distinction.  I made the point that we consider the retention of that very necessary and perhaps the Minister will agree to look at that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at anything.  In fact, the debate has been so short that I have not had time to consider anything but it goes without saying that anything that has been said will receive further consideration. The House will appreciate that my reactions to what has been said are spontaneous but that does not debar me from giving further consideration to what has been said.  The difference between the two sections is that one has a deterrent in law and the other has not.  The oath remains where the deterrent in law does not exist and there is no oath where the deterrent in law remains.  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the person is made to swear that he is illiterate will certainly be a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of illiteracy, there can be no judge other than the person himself as to whether or not he is illiterate to the degree that he cannot properly mark his paper.  The oath has a real meaning there.  I know it is a rather tenuous sort of argument but it is true in such cases that there can be only one judge, that is, the person himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So there is a point <Col N="508" /> there.  The question of the dates in regard to the compilation of the register has also been mentioned.  I should say that I do not agree particularly with the dates which operate at present and I have been trying to find ways and means of making such dates fit better into our pattern and thereby compile the register more fully. We can probably shorten the present procedure without changing the actual dates very much.  For instance, we could make 15th October the qualifying date rather than 15th September.  This would mean a decided advantage from the point of view of the rate collectors who in many cases are responsible for the setting up of the lists.  They are very busy during September and at that particular time, with the ending of their half year, a month later would probably be of great assistance to them to do their job more readily.</P>
      <P>That, as I say, would take that month off and we probably could reduce the overall period from then by starting with the qualifying date on 15th October and still finishing up on 15th April as the date for the emergence of the register.  My own belief is that if it can be operated, it would simplify things for all concerned if the date of the emergence of the register were arranged for 1st January and thus qualify on age grounds people who come to obtain a vote for the first time as all those born 21 years previously.  We would not then have to go around finding out whether it was on 14th, 15th or 16th September. If the register falls for 1st January, 1962, anybody born in the year 1941 will immediately qualify on age grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in itself would be quite an advance and if we can so synchronise the other operations, it would be quite a helpful start and, in addition, would be a very good way of starting the new year.  It would cut out this idea of finding out whether the date was 14th, 15th or 16th September, or the 14th or 15th of April, as the case may be.  However, that will come to be prescribed by regulations of which the House will undoubtedly hear more at various stages, and anything that can help to make these regulations do the job better than it is done now will <Col N="509" /> certainly be considered by whoever is responsible at whatever time the Department of Local Government are looking after this particular item.</P>
    <P>The question of the non-Party description of those who do not belong to Parties would seem to be received with somewhat mixed feelings.  Very often, this is rather a more useful and a better way to describe such people than to describe them as Independents. It is the better way to make clear that if you belong to a Party, you are down as a member of a Party and if you do not belong to a Party, you go down as non-Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not put Independent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be to you but I would not say so.  We will argue about that on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter we can argue on Committee Stage.  I feel that it is clear and unequivocal and without question indicates what it says and means what it says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The other does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does not in all cases, and while I am not casting any reflection on anybody, there is a certain connotation which I do not think rings clearly true in all cases.  However, we can have another discussion on that when the section comes to be debated on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that one-third of the quota is too many votes to set up as a target below which, if a person's vote falls, he loses his deposit. The first thing we have to realise is that in a general election there is no constituency that is not at least a three-seat constituency.  If we take the quota in those circumstances and take one-third of that quota, then the percentage of people in that constituency constituting one-third of the quota is a very small percentage of the total.  When you consider that £100, which has been there since 1923, having been reduced at that stage from £150, is being left as the deposit, I do not think we should have much <Col N="510" /> grouse if we say, on the one hand, that you have still got the £100 deposit but you must get one-third of the quota rather than one-fourth which has been suggested, on the other. That would make things too easy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee had all that before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but do not forget this.  I do not set myself as a paragon of all the virtues in regard to these things, but I have been thinking about this for a long time before there was a Committee.  I have gone into it and I have considered the Committee's views and I came to conclusions, too, before there was even a Committee.  I have given it the once-over since then again to see the way this worked out.  From my personal point of view, I would prefer to see the deposit raised.  If there were a question of giving away to the quarter, I would feel that in all fairness to the whole working of our elections the deposit should be raised.  If there were any question of reducing the actual limit of votes that one must get to save it, then the amount should be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recognise that under PR a contest could take place between two candidates, one of whom will have one-third of the quota and the other a vote or two less than one-third.  The latter would be eliminated and lose his £100.  The other could and in fact would be elected as a result of his elimination so that the hardship is considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is when you get down to cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If he could get one-quarter, it is unlikely that the remaining man would be elected right away. That is in itself unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the man who remains in is elected or not is of no assistance to the man who has not only got the hammer but loses his money as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make the loss of the deposit any less or any more <Col N="511" /> to the man who has lost it merely because another man remained in after him in the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not lose it if it were a quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had not a quarter, he would lose it.  However, I feel that one-third is fully justified in the PR system where we have not less than three seats in our constituencies and have one-third of the quota which is one-twelfth of the votes cast.  That is what the person now must have to save his deposit at the time of elimination and not on the first round.  He has to have before elimination, one-twelfth of the votes cast.  That is not asking too much, and as a percentage it becomes less than that as the number of seats in the constituency rises to four or five. With £100 having the little value it is alleged to have to-day, I do not think this is really unjust.  If we were to reduce the requirement from one-third to one-quarter, I would feel very strongly that we should increase the money deposit.</P>
      <P>The loss of his deposit in an election is not all he loses.  Whether it is £100 or £150 does not really matter a great deal at that stage.  If you reduce it to a quarter and leave the £100 stand and leave the other innovation where a man can nominate himself or be nominated by an agent, it is made terribly easy and could for reasons other than to get himself elected make it attractive for a person to stand or to be got to stand by somebody who would put up the £100 to block somebody else's chances. That is the real feature of this business of deposits and the number of votes you have to get without which you will lose your deposit.  Bringing it to the point where a person can nominate himself is a liberalisation which we have to temper with a certain sense of balance. To go too far in all directions would be bad.  We are going as far as we think it is good to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that has been asked is why we are changing the hours of polling from the hours recommended by the Committee who recommended that the hours should be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  We propose in the Bill that the <Col N="512" /> period should be twelve hours between the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. In other words, there is a flexibility to choose within those 14 hours a period of 12 hours.  You could theoretically start at 8.30 in the morning and finish at 8.30 p.m. or start at 10.30 a.m. and finish at 10.30 p.m., or you could have it at any points in between. Summer and winter voting can involve a very different approach, and it is for that reason that I have suggested and am putting to the House this sensible arrangement of 14 hours during which to have 12 hours' voting rather than dogmatically saying, as has been recommended by the Committee, that the period should be fixed absolutely and without any flexibility from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean not less than 12 hours, or does he leave himself open to take more than 12 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, we are able to stop two hours earlier than would be possible if the recommendation were accepted.  The Committee recommendation was to start not earlier than 10 a.m. and to finish not later than 10 p.m.  We may start at 8.30 a.m. if we feel that that suits best and stop at 8.30 p.m.  Their recommendation would compel us not to start until 10 a.m. and not to close before 10 p.m.  Under the present system, we may start at 8.30 a.m. if we feel that suits best, and stop at 8.30 p.m.  So, at least, we gain one and a half hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

I just want to point out that we are not really departing from what the Committee said but are adopting a more <Col N="513" /> flexible arrangement and making it possible for those hours or other hours to be used, as the time suits.</P>
      <P>There were arguments as to the schoolhouses being used in the rural areas where there is no lighting available. I cannot guarantee that in the middle of winter we will make it possible to have polling completed before dark but at least the arrangement is flexible and gives one and a half hours more of daylight than would have been possible under the system proposed by the Committee.  We can start half an hour earlier in the morning, when there will be light.</P>

      <P>Another matter that was raised, particularly by Dublin Deputies, was the need for national publicity in connection with the compilation and preparation of the register of electors.  There has been such national publicity.  There has been TV, radio and newspaper publicity on a national scale and there has also been, concurrently with these efforts, the stamp cancellation slogans that have been adopted over recent years which are applied to the letters issuing from post offices during certain relevant periods each year.  Certain registration officers, not only in Cork, as was mentioned earlier, have been participating in helpful publicity also. The registration officer in Dublin has been doing likewise.</P>

    <P>All of these things together, on the national scale and at local level, in the cities, particularly, of Cork and Dublin, are helping to get a more realistic register prepared but it is undoubtedly true that, no matter what publicity is given, how widespread it may be or how often it is repeated, you will not get across to the people concerned who will find themselves, <Col N="514" /> when the election comes around, off the register.  They just do not seem to be tuned into the same wavelength as those who have that slight interest in these public matters.  The only time they become interested is when they find they have not a vote and then it is, unfortunately, too late.  Not only does it happen that such people are too late on the day of an election, but you will find the very same people are probably too late at the next election. It is one of those regrettable features that publicity can improve to some extent but, I am afraid, cannot cure entirely.</P>
    <P>It is easier for those from rural constituencies to do something about this matter than it is in the cities but there is a great deal that public representatives can do and are doing to supplement all the other methods that have been adopted, whether it be through rate collectors, the local Garda, radio, TV, newspapers.  Public representatives, both local and parliamentary, do, in the rural areas, quite an amount of work each year in helping to see that their supporters and those they know to be their supporters are on the register.  From all Parties that effort comes and it certainly makes an impression.  It is not so easy and it is not so useful in the cities.  Unfortunately, it is the city registers that show the greatest weaknesses in this regard. We cannot really do in the cities as we do in the country.  It is not possible for public men to do in the cities as we do in the country.  They do not know everybody.  It is not such a personal matter as it is in the country.  In the city, you do not know your neighbours so well as you do in the country.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say, as somebody suggested here, that nothing is being done about it.  Quite a lot has been done by national as well as local publicity over recent years.  I have no doubt we are getting through to a certain number of people.  I am not living in the fool's paradise of believing that publicity, no matter how well done, will get across to all those who are not really interested now in whether they have a vote or not but who may be sufficiently interested at election time when they find they have <Col N="515" /> no vote and will cry about it, whereas, if they had a vote, in many cases they probably would not use it.  I think we will get through better in future than we have done in the past, due to all the help we get from the radio, the Press, television, and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the difficulties in Dublin.  I cannot say that I have personal experience of the difficulties he mentions in Dublin polling stations or their vicinity, on an election day, created by the ganging up of the various Party adherents, shouting home their men.  Candidly, I cannot see what good it does if everybody is shouting.  It would seem to me that it would only succeed in annoying voters.  Perhaps I do not understand the mentality of the people in Dublin.  I would imagine that the Party that would take steps to restrain people from doing that would probably gain votes.</P>

      <P>This ragging of the voter, if carried on to any great extent, should not be encouraged and if there is anything we can do, whether through individual effort or Party effort, to minimise that sort of thing in future, it would be very well for us all if it were done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne also complained about long-resident English people being given the franchise here and then suddenly in recent years being knocked off.  I do not know why they were on the register in the first instance.  So I could not comment on why they should be put off.  If they are not entitled, according to our Constitution, to be on, they have not lost something to which they are entitled but had something to which they were not entitled.  Further than that, I do not wish to comment.</P>
      <P>The question of postal votes for those of our people abroad is a very nice suggestion but I am afraid a rather difficult and impracticable one to carry out and one which I think would have been considered in its broadest context by the Committee and certainly has not been recommended by the Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible. I shall look into the matter.  It would be a pity to spoil our electoral machine merely for the sake of the few pounds necessary to make it worth the returning officer's while to do the job more efficiently or better than he has been doing it.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to postal votes for commercial travellers.  This is an old agitation.  While there would appear to be a justification for it, the fact is that it would be very difficult to provide the machinery to operate such a vote without abuse. Again, if it is given to commercial travellers, then others would want to be included in the same machine. There are many people who have to be away from home on the day appointed as polling day.  There is nothing they can do about it.  If special provisions were made for commercial travellers, all these other categories would have to be included.  The difficulties would be great.  The burden of trying to arrange it would be very heavy, if not impossible, and there would once more be the possibility of abuse.  This matter was considered by the Committee and, despite their liberal-mindedness in many other directions, no recommendation was made in this respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has his own troubles with regard to the alphabetical list. For what it is worth, I reckon the top of the list No. 1 and the bottom of the list No. 2.  If I were not at the top, I should prefer to be at the bottom rather than in the middle.  While one may not have the best of the bargain at the bottom, one certainly has second best.</P>

With regard to inmates of homes, hospitals and institutions, it does not follow that they will be registered in their constituencies. <Col N="519" /> Neither does it follow that they will be entitled to a postal vote.  They will be qualified to vote in the constituency, provided they are registered, in which the establishment in which they are resident is located.  I visualise a ballot box being made available in the establishment, with a presiding officer and all the rest of the paraphernalia.
