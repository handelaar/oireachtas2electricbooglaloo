      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Joe Higgins.  I now call on Deputy Higgins to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent and important matter of public interest, that is the ultimatum by the management of Aer Lingus to 1,550 workers at TEAM Aer Lingus to accept the privatisation of the company and settlement proposals arriving therefrom, which the workers have already rejected, or face the closure of TEAM and whether it is appropriate for a semi-State company to seek to compel a section of its workforce to negotiate under such duress.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22, Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions), Bill, 1997, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 4, Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998, Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 23, Statements on Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that the Report and Final Stages of No. 22 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes, by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, <Col N="1374" /> include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources; the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 4, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.45 p.m. today; No. 23, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of the Minister for Public Enterprise and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; the statements of the main spokespersons for the Democratic Left Party, the Green Party and of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case; Members may share time; the Minister for Public Enterprise shall be called upon not later than 2.25 p.m. to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21, the Minister for Public Enterprise shall take questions which shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 4.45 p.m.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998, was introduced last night.  It is a substantial Bill of major importance. That the Second Stage of this Bill should be guillotined at 1.45 p.m. today is extraordinary and totally unacceptable.  Will the Government give more time next week for Second Stage to allow a proper debate on what is a very important Bill for the future of the food industry, food production and food standards here?</P>

      <P>In view of the Tánaiste's statement to the House yesterday that she recognises the need for competition in the media, what legislation does she propose to introduce to ensure greater competition in the media?  Will she describe what she means by media?  Does she mean not only the written media but the broadcasting and rebroadcasting of TV signals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a firm believer in competition. Competition brings about change faster than anything else.  This Government has an unprecedented record so far, after only 11 months <Col N="1375" /> in office, of agreeing to privatise a number of State companies with a view to providing competition. We have already agreed to the disposal of Cablelink and to ending the derogation in relation to voice telephony a year in advance. That is being done to advance competition.  On media issues, I am examining whether we need legislation to prevent the cross ownership of different media interests but that is at a preliminary stage and I am not in a position to say what exactly we may be able to do in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that since coming into office the Tánaiste has been examining the newspaper industry?  Why has it taken a year for the Minister to produce proposals from that examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the matter now.  Is legislation promised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>My examination was similar to the examination carried out by my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton and I am subject to legal advice.  It was not possible, as the Deputy is aware, to advance legally in relation to many of the recommendations in that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste on the Order of Business and remind her that her presence here is of considerable relief to many nervous Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  In relation to her own Department, when will the legislation to give effect to the establishment of Enterprise Ireland be tabled in the House and when is it expected to have it enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be circulated today to Opposition spokespersons and to the spokespersons in the Seanad.  The intention is to take Second, Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad next week and to take the matter in the Dáil the following week.  I understand that has been agreed with Opposition spokespersons.  I thank Deputy Quinn for his good wishes.  I know he is anxious to get my job.  I do not intend to let him have it too quickly.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate how soon we can expect to have Government time provided for the debate on the report of the Commission on the Family, which is one of the most significant reports produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On yesterday's Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach when he expected the prevention of corruption Bill would be introduced to allow the ratification of OECD and EU conventions on combating bribery and corruption.  The Taoiseach indicated that it would be late this year, and perhaps even next year, before that Bill is brought before the House.  Is the Tánaiste satisfied that <Col N="1376" /> the Government is dealing with this issue with the urgency it requires?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the debate on the Commission on the Family, I agree with Deputy De Rossa it is a far reaching and fundamental review of issues affecting the family and society. It would be appropriate to have an early debate in the House.  With that in mind, perhaps the Whips might discuss the issue.  I understand the Taoiseach said that on a previous occasion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other matter the Deputy raised, we would like to see this legislation as quickly as possible but a large amount of legislation is currently being processed in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the British-Irish Agreement and that must take precedence.  The intention is to bring forward that legislation before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The number of applicants on Dublin Corporation's housing list has increased from 4,000 to 6,000 and there are now 400 applicants in bed and breakfast accommodation and on the homeless list.  In relation to the Urban Renewal Bill, 1998, Second Stage of which is currently being debated in the House, will the Tánaiste consider allowing Committee Stage to be taken in the House so that we can consider the question of Dublin Corporation being allowed to build housing estates for its applicants outside Dublin along the lines of the house building in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown?  This is a serious problem.  There is now a waiting list for housing which is almost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on the issue.  The Deputy must ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now a waiting list for housing which is almost as long as the waiting list for special edition Mercedes.  This is a grave problem because a two-tier society is developing where people cannot get housing.  I ask the Tánaiste to allow the Committee Stage of this Bill to be taken on the floor of the House to deal with this crisis.  The Bacon report is welcome but we need a local authority house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a statement.  Does the Tánaiste wish to reply to the question on promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The committees were established with a view to having a more effective way of dealing with Committee Stage of legislation.  If the Deputy wishes to change that it is a matter for the Whips to discuss.  As Deputy Mitchell knows, every Deputy can attend the committees and make a contribution in relation to this issue.  The <Col N="1377" /> Bill can be dealt with more speedily in a committee rather than on the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will time be made available today for a member of the Government to explain the actions of the Government in relation to the continuous finds of dangerous phosphorus bombs on east coast beaches, and the communication that has taken place between the Irish and British authorities to deal with this ongoing problem which arises from the dumping of weaponry in Beaufort Dyke?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources made a statement in relation to this issue yesterday.  I understand all the beaches between Greenore and Dún Laoghaire are being searched by the marine emergency service.  If members of the public see any unusual objects on beaches they must not go near them and should report them to the emergency services.  The Minister has also been in touch with his counterpart in the UK.  It will not be possible today to make time available for a debate on this issue and perhaps the appropriate way to proceed would be by tabling a parliamentary question for next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste discuss with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the possibility of him coming into the House to explain what is happening with regard to the Garda Síochána?  Government spokespersons are saying a deal has been offered to the gardaí.  The gardaí deny that and they have now threatened to stop work for two days by using their annual leave.  Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain whether this country will have security from the Garda Síochána or whether the Government will continue to mishandle the issue of their pay claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that the Government has done a deal with the Garda Síochána, as the Deputy suggests.  There is a forum to resolve these issues through negotiation.  We wish to see the gardaí return to that forum because nothing can be solved by the ongoing dispute.  I hope the gardaí will not take the type of action they took some weeks ago.  That is not in the public interest.  It is not good for our democracy to see gardaí marching on the Houses of Parliament. I appeal to them and to their representatives to <Col N="1378" /> get back to the negotiating table.  This matter can only be resolved through negotiation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Government is determined to hold the line in relation to public sector pay.  That is fundamental to the operation of this Government and, therefore, any resolution of a dispute in relation to public sector pay will have to be done within the parameters set down by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the recent increase in vicious attacks on the elderly throughout the country, including last night's fatal attack on an elderly man in Dublin 7, will the Tánaiste outline the Government's plans, if any, to protect the elderly and to reassure them in regard to their safety, including the provision of wardens?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the Deputy's concern about the recent spate of attacks on elderly people and others.  This is an operational matter for the Garda Síochána.  I do not think there is any necessity for new legislation.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation for a national minimum wage, will the Tánaiste state if the inter-party committee she has established is preparing the legislation or, as reported, seeking to gain the arguments of the commission?  If the committee is preparing the legislation, when will it be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee, not an inter-party committee, is examining how the Government can introduce the national minimum wage.  If the Deputy had been in the House last week when I answered parliamentary questions he would have heard me say that the <Col N="1379" /> legislation will be brought forward next year.  It will be enabling legislation but as the Deputy knows, this is a complex and difficult area.  If it were not, Democratic Left and Labour in Government would have introduced a national hourly minimum wage but they chose not to do so.  We have to move forward in a way that protects jobs and guarantees workers a decent minimum hourly rate.  We intend to do that but, as the commission said in its report, it has to be done in a way that does not affect employment or competitiveness. That is the reason the interdepartmental group was established.  I will be meeting the social partners over the next number of weeks to discuss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At 5.30 p.m. yesterday, five Government Departments had failed to respond to Deputies' parliamentary questions.  That is par for the course in recent weeks and it is a grave infringement on our rights.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to ensure that parliamentary questions are answered and the replies available to Deputies at the conclusion of Question Time.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Tánaiste about item 69 on the list of promised legislation. The Minister indicated this morning that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was working on various Bills to implement the British-Irish Agreement.  Item 69 relates to the promise to abolish ground rents, which are one of the last feudal remnants in this State's property laws.  This is the only State, apart from Britain, which still has ground rents.  Will the Tánaiste undertake to have that legislation brought forward? Deputy Woods introduced a Private Members' Bill on this matter when he was in Opposition and it would be relatively easy to bring that Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the previous Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, advised there were major constitutional legal issues involved in the full abolition of ground rents. These are currently being examined.  I cannot say when that examination will conclude but, presumably, the Bill will be brought forward if the legal issues can be resolved.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 18 to 24, and substitute the following:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to repeal in full section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, thereby removing not only <Col N="1383" /> the offence of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo;, as the Bill proposes, but also that of &ldquo;absence without leave&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to take legal advice on the consequences of repealing in full section 221.  The Attorney General's office advised that the removal of the offence of absence without leave would have to be considered in the light of relevant InterNational Labour Organisation conventions. Other relevant issues would also have to be considered, including the relationship of employer and employee in the merchant shipping sector.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that a too hasty removal or updating of the absence without leave provision might have undesirable and unforeseen consequences. I propose, therefore, to leave the matter for fuller consideration in the context of more comprehensive revision of merchant shipping legislation which I promised to have undertaken as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>This Bill, dealing as it does with matters requiring speedy attention, is not a suitable vehicle for a comprehensive revision of maritime legislation. In that context, I note that the United Kingdom's 1995 Merchant Shipping Act provides penalties for &ldquo;absence without leave&rdquo;, indicating the continuing relevance of such a provision for a maritime nation.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 2 I am carrying out a tidying up exercise removing a reference to &ldquo;desertion&rdquo;, an offence which will no longer exist following the enactment of this Bill, from that part of section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1984, which is not being repealed.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 3 tabled by Deputy Bell, I acknowledge that I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider on Report Stage the repeal of section 6 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, if I were repealing in full section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  Deputy Bell is proposing the repeal of section 6 in amendment No. 3.  Section 6 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, provides for a fine not exceeding £10 on summary conviction for the &ldquo;absence without leave&rdquo; offence, specified in section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  Until the provision in section 221 of the 1894 Act, dealing with &ldquo;absence without leave&rdquo;, is repealed or revised, I would consider any amendment of section 6 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, to be premature and to be covered by the caution expressed by the Attorney General's office.  In view of this, and while I appreciate the point of his amendments, I ask Deputy Bell to defer them for the more comprehensive Bill, in line with the advice of the Attorney General.  Amendment No. 2 in my name tidies up relevant aspects of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill.  Its key provisions as originally published centred on the overhaul and updating of elements of Irish shipping law.  These include introducing increased penalties for breaches of safety regulations, the removal of out-of-date penal sanctions for certain offences committed by merchant seafarers, the introduction of a provision to allow EU nationals and corporate bodies to register ships in Ireland and the provision of special exemptions for certain categories of small passenger vessels.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine amended the Bill at my request to provide a legal basis for borrowing by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The need for this amendment arose because the Commissioners of Irish Lights needed to secure financing facilities in connection with their purchase of an ultramodern vessel to service aids to navigation.  I thank the Deputies for their support in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have been able to accommodate some of the concerns of Deputy Bell by tabling Report Stage amendments to further amend section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and to bring all sections of the Bill into effect when it has been signed by the President. This meets the points made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I assure Deputies who expressed concerns on Committee Stage regarding passenger boat exemptions that every effort will be made by my Department to ensure that no diminution of safety will be permitted by virtue of any exemption granted by regulations made under this Bill excepting boats from licensing requirements.  Several Deputies, especially Deputy Finucane, were concerned about his matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's statement that there will be no dilution of safety standards because of the exemptions to the Bill. Will he assure the House that his marine surveyors will ensure that safety procedures are adhered to?</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister stated that exemptions would include canoes in which individuals or groups are undergoing instruction.  The area of adventure centres must be looked at because responsibility for them is very diluted. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation does not have a responsibility, nor does the Minister, even though many of them are concerned with exclusively marine related activities.  In addition, despite education centres which are controlled by the Department of Education and Science and the vigorous promotion of adventure centres, which are undergoing expansion, by Bord Fáilte, the regulatory body is the Association for Adventure Sports.  Although it does excellent work and tries to issue safety standards, etc., there is no underpinning legislation.  We will encounter difficulties if we do not introduce regulations in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his co-operation on the amendments I put down on Committee Stage.  It is refreshing when a Minister takes on board amendments put down in good faith by Opposition parties.  Given that we co-operated with passing the legislation as quickly as possible to facilitate the purchase of the new vessel, the Minister may extend an invitation to the Opposition spokespersons to the launch of the ship.</P>

It is especially important we liaise closely and ensure there are clear regulations which are implemented fully.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Marine Survey Office we will make our experts available.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy that there is a need for co-ordination.  To this end we are liaising with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate yesterday I was dealing with section 48(12) which obliges the Food Safety Authority to act where the terms of a service contract are not being met.  While it is necessary to include this provision, I seek further details on how the Authority will respond.  The section states that where the terms of a service contract are not being met the Authority may without delay make suitable alternative arrangements.  What form will these take?  If it is deemed that a certain service contractor is doing a poor job and alternative arrangements have be made, will the contract be offered to one of the other agencies listed in the Schedule or will the Authority be in a position to seek tenders and, if so, could persons currently working in the health boards, local authorities, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Agriculture and Food end up losing their jobs to persons currently working in the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the independence of the Authority, the Minister claimed the Bill will ensure greater transparency in the field of food safety.  The previous Government proposed to appoint a regulator. That would be a much better way of monitoring food safety.  Such a regulator would have no responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the various agencies but would have the power to intervene.  A thorough audit or inspection by an <Col N="1388" /> independent supervisory agency would ensure greater transparency, unlike the proposed confused arrangement between the Authority and service contractors.  The Authority will offer contracts to those service contractors best placed to meet the conditions laid down.  This is a step in the wrong direction.  This matter will have to be teased out in greater detail on Committee Stage. I am concerned about the effect it will have on staff morale.</P>
    <P>A fully independent and autonomous Authority will employ up to 2,000 staff.  Where will they be located?  Why should Government Departments and agencies be required to make premises available?  This issue will have to be thoroughly addressed at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>On the structure of the Authority, the board will consist of ten members to be appointed by the Minister.  This represents a slight increase in the number originally proposed.  I welcome the fact that the chairperson of the scientific committee will be a member of the board and that in appointing members the Minister will have regard to relevant scientific qualifications and experience.  The committee will be able to provide an early and detailed response whenever there is a food scare and other problems arise.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the establishment of the Food Safety Consultative Council, although I am not certain there is a need to appoint up to 24 members.  It will ensure all issues of concern are the subject of the broadest possible debate.</P>
    <P>We have belatedly come to accept that the interests of the consumer and the producer overlap. The producer who plays a key role in the economy which is heavily dependent on agriculture has to accept that there is a need for the highest standards.  If we have learned anything from the BSE crisis, it is that anything that is bad for the consumer will quickly have an equally negative effect on the producer.  Farming organisations now accept this argument and are to the fore in pushing for the highest standards of hygiene in food preparation.  We must protect the food supply from the farm to the fork.  All Government policies in the field of agriculture and the various grant schemes, including REPS, must be geared towards ensuring this.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the establishment of the Authority, I am gravely concerned about the way the Minister has gone about his business.  I am concerned in particular about the terms of the service contracts.  There was a more straightforward and simpler approach but the Minister has not availed of that option.</P>
    <P>The local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government are not included in the list of official agencies included in the Second Schedule.  What does this mean for those currently employed as veterinary officers in the county councils?  It was suggested last year that they should be transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Food but to the best of my knowledge no progress has been made.  I suspect <Col N="1389" /> they wish to remain as employees of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been too critical.  The Authority should be established at the earliest possible date.  I am concerned, however, about a number of issues which I hope we will be able to resolve on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority is one of the most important consumer protection bodies ever established in the State.  It has a crucial role in the protection of consumer interests and in the provision of information to enable the consumer make informed choices regarding food safety.  For the Food Safety Authority to achieve these important tasks, it is important it is placed on a statutory basis with dedicated legislation governing its establishment, composition and operation.</P>
      <P>During the recent past the Government parties made great play about adopting a new approach to the Food Safety Authority, but with the publication of this Bill we see those claims are baseless because it does not alter significantly the role of the Food Safety Authority as envisaged by the previous Government.  One wonders why there has been such a delay in drawing up this legislation. There appears to be a touch of window dressing about it.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions we were promised various legislation, but to date this is the first Bill to emerge from the Department of Health and Children since the Government took office almost a year ago.  After 12 months we are still awaiting important legislation, such as the promised Health (Amendment) Bill, which is intended to reorganise the health services and replace the Eastern Health Board, and the long awaited mental health Bill.  Yet the Minister for Health and Children seems unable to produce that legislation. One must wonder why that is the case.  Is it an indication of a lack of interest or are there problems in the Department?  Why has the Department produced only one Bill given that the Government has been in office for almost a year?</P>
      <P>This Bill is an attempt to provide a sound comprehensive legislative basis for the Food Safety Authority.  The Labour Party welcomes its publication in principle.  However, the Bill, as presented to the House, is flawed and fails to enshrine in legislation the consumer focused philosophy that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland needs to make a real difference to food safety standards here.  The Labour Party intends to table a range of amendments to strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want a Food Safety Authority that is relevant to ordinary shoppers in the high street and one in which consumers to have a real say in its <Col N="1390" /> policy and direction.  The Bill fails to achieve those important goals in key areas.  I hope the Minister will engage with Members on Committee Stage so that we can amend the legislation to give the Food Safety Authority the comprehensive legislation it deserves.</P>
    <P>Food accounts for 23 per cent of household expenditure in Ireland and is the largest item in the household budget.  Irish consumers spend £4 billion on food annually or, on average, in excess of £3,500 annually per household.  The food industry employs directly 37,000 people and more than twice that number are employed in associated enterprises that service the industry.  In addition, 150,000 farmers are engaged in food production.  Food exports are vital to our economic importance and the maintenance of thousands of jobs throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The rights of consumers and their welfare concerns must take precedence over all other aspects of the industry.  In the past, particularly since the emergence of BSE and the e-coli bacteria scare, consumer concerns centre on the safety, nutritional merit, cost and ethical concerns about the methods of food production and manufacture. It is important we should have a well resourced body dedicated to addressing these concerns and undoubtedly the Food Safety Authority will fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority has been operating on an interim basis under the Health Corporate Bodies Act, 1961.  It has been awaiting its independent statutory legislative basis for some time. However, since the merger of the Food Safety Authority and the Food Safety Advisory Board on 1 January 1998, a considerable amount of work has already been achieved.  I would like to compliment the work of the authority to date, in particular, that of its chief executive, Dr. Patrick Wall.  The authority has established a one stop shop on food safety and information.  It has also had the energy and foresight to launch a detailed and informative website that enables citizens across the country to have access to data, information and news from it.  That is important work. It makes a clear statement about the focus of the authority which is on the individual consumer. The authority requires and deserves legislation that will recognise the central role of the consumer and promote the relationship between it and the consumer, but this legislation fails to satisfactorily achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>On the work of the authority to date, I would like the Minister to clarify his intentions regarding the accessibility of information.  The one stop shop concept is critical for supplying consumers with all the relevant information they require. Quite often in this age of information overload the presentation and availability of information under one roof is the key task facing information providers.  With its Dublin office and website, the Food Safety Authority is addressing this need to some extent, but there are still major problems concerning accessibility.</P>
    <P>Use of information technology and especially <Col N="1391" /> hi-tech innovations, such as the Internet, is unbalanced in demographic terms.  There is an information gap in society and it is important for the Government to take effective action to ensure that a new social division between the information poor and the information rich does not develop.  However, the information gap is a fact of life and the Internet site alone does not provide adequate access to information on food safety to many of our population.  The authority and the Minister should take steps to address this situation and serious consideration should be given to the establishment of regional mobile information units that could travel to the major towns and villages outside the capital, inform people of the authority's work and provide them with access to information.</P>
    <P>Regarding the specific detail of the Bill, the Labour Party has serious concerns about section 14.  It deals with the establishment of the consultative council which will provide consumer interests with the most direct influence on the work and ethos of the Food Safety Authority. However, as with consultative bodies everywhere, it is important to ensure that body does not become a mere talking shop and the Bill needs to be strengthened to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (2) states &ldquo;the Council shall consist of not more than 24 members and shall be broadly based and representative&rdquo;.  That subsection is weak and lacks definition.  The consultative council should be a significant forum for consumer interests to be aired and dealt with by the authority.  Given the central role that consumers must have in the FSA, the legislation should explicitly state the role of consumers in the consultative council.  A serious oversight of the Bill is its failure to give statutory recognition to the role of the consumer in that body and that needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The consultative council will be appointed by the board in consultation with the Minister.  It is important the work of the consultative council is made accessible to the general public and the Bill should include a requirement for the council to hold a minimum of its meetings in public.  That would allow the general public, the consumers the authority is intended to protect, to have an insight into its workings.  That would also be in keeping with a policy of open Government and administration that is sadly lacking in many aspects of public life.  An amendment to the Bill requiring the consultative council to allow the public access to its deliberations, where practicable, would enhance the Bill and the public's engagement with the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of the Bill states the &ldquo;Authority may publish the opinions of the Council&rdquo;.  That subsection undermines the independence of the consultative council and could lead to tension between the consultative council and the authority which could damage the whole process.  It also reduces the amount of information available <Col N="1392" /> to the public on food safety and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>A number of options are available.  The authority should be under an obligation to publish all opinions of the council or the consultative council should be empowered to publish its own opinions as it sees fit, which would be the preferred option. That would lead to a more open consultative process and remove the potential for tension that exists as the Bill is currently formulated.</P>
    <P>Other sections require amendment to ensure the vitality of the role of the consultative council. Section 48 (8) should contain a provision that would oblige the authority to furnish copies of reports received from agencies executing service contracts to the consultative council.  Section 37 does not contain provision for the consultative council to require or request meetings with the chief executive.  The chief executive will form a pivotal role in the Food Safety authority and it is important this legislation should define a relationship between the consultative council and the chief executive.  The Bill does not provide any mechanism for this relationship to develop and this should be addressed.  In spite of the Minister's comments about the various arms of the authority interlocking, there are significant weaknesses in this area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Bill does not provide for any structures to facilitate information exchange between the consultative council and the scientific committee.  Section 34 should contain a provision that would oblige the authority to furnish copies of reports from the scientific committee to the consultative council.  The section should also provide for contact and dialogue between the chairperson of the scientific committee and the consultative council.</P>
    <P>The Bill is vague about service contracts entered into by the authority and other agencies. I concur with many of the comments made by Deputy Bradford.  I am not clear if the Minister's intention is that the authority will emerge as the main inspection body for food safety and if the current role of local authorities and health boards will diminish under the new regime instituted.  I would be obliged if the Minister will clarify his intentions at an early date.  Serious efforts must be made to deal with the many staff interests if there are to be significant changes in their terms of employment.</P>
    <P>It would also be of benefit if the Minister gave an undertaking that the necessary resources needed will be provided to ensure that health boards and local authorities can adequately carry out their inspection functions when contracted to do so by the authority.  The real weight and authority of the new food safety institution is closely related to the resources allocated to it.  This is especially true in the case of inspection procedures and the agencies with which the authority will enter into contracts.  At present the resources of health boards and local authorities are often stretched to the limit and additional resources to comply with the authorities' service contracts <Col N="1393" /> undoubtedly will be required.  There is no point putting the onus back on the existing agencies to improve standards unless the Government is prepared to provide them with the necessary resources to do so.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the shortcomings of the Bill.  These issues will be debated more extensively on Committee Stage.  The provisions for the consultative council are undoubtedly inadequate and must be strengthened to ensure public confidence and public engagement with the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specifics of the Bill I will mention the task facing the authority in the coming years.  The safety of the food we eat has become an important issue for every family in recent years.  In the wake of the recent BSE scare we saw how ordinary families adjusted their purchasing patterns and moved away from purchasing beef in significant numbers.  The recent food scare regarding a butcher's shop on the southside of Dublin also points to the seriousness of the issue.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority will have a huge task in educating consumers, retailers and producers in the proper handling and storage of food.  There is still a large degree of ignorance about the basic rules governing food hygiene and safety and the authority must institute comprehensive public education programmes to tackle this information deficit.  Some retail outlets have poor standards of food safety and do not appear to be aware of the manner in which microscopic bacteria are spread.  It is still common to encounter food retailers who do not use gloves when handling fresh produce or who do not understand the need to wash their hands or replace their protective gloves after handling money.  It is common to see butchers handling cooked or raw food and then taking money from customers.  This practice needs to be outlawed completely because it is a potential health risk.</P>
    <P>There is laxity in the handling of food in many homes and many people are unaware of the basic rules governing the storage of food.  I am sure the majority of households do not know at what temperature their fridges should be set to ensure that bacteria cannot survive on food.  Simple rules relating to the separation of certain foods, such as cooked and uncooked meats, are often ignored.</P>
    <P>These practices continue because people do not have ready access to the necessary information regarding food safety.  It is amazing that while a large number of people will radically change their purchasing and dietary habits due to concern over a disease, such as BSE which the statistical chances of catching are minute, the same people do not make small and simple changes that will protect them and their families from a range of infections and diseases that could easily occur in their homes or workplaces.</P>
    <P>An information and education campaign to tackle this ongoing problem is necessary and the performance of the Food Safety Authority will be judged on its ability to ensure that the required <Col N="1394" /> information is provided in an accessible manner. This is why it would be of great benefit to the work of the authority if mobile information units were established on a regional basis to ensure that the maximum number of consumers encounter the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>The authority will also have to ensure that an urgent analysis facility, operating seven days a week, is available to analyse samples urgently where there is a strong indication that there is a significant risk to public health.  In the case of the butcher's shop on the southside of the city which was at the centre of a scare recently, there was undoubtedly a delay in the analysis of the sample. Where a threat to public health exists delays cannot be tolerated and a system to prioritise samples and deal with them swiftly must be introduced.</P>
    <P>Consumers are also concerned about the issue of labelling.  All food labelling should contain information regarding the source of the food and the content of the product.  Added to this information, cooking and storage requirements should be clearly indicated.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would indicate the Government's plans for the authority's co-operation with its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  In the British-Irish Agreement, animal and plant health is one of the key areas with which the North-South strand of the agreement will deal.  Has the Minister had consultations with his counterpart in Northern Ireland regarding co-operation on this important issue on both sides of the Border?  How does the Minister plan to facilitate this co-operation and to enhance it during his term of office?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcomes the publication of the Bill which establishes the Food Safety Authority on a statutory basis.  We have concerns regarding the detail of the legislation and on Committee Stage we will table amendments intended to strengthen the role of the consultative council, improve co-operation between the consultative council, the board and the scientific committee and to improve the public involvement and engagement with the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>The authority has made an excellent start to its operations.  We wish it well in the coming months and years with the onerous task which it faces. It is a crucially important institution that has the capacity to significantly change attitudes and enforce regulations regarding food safety.  These two goals are extremely important for consumers and the food industry.  It is right and appropriate than an independent authority should be charged with their implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is part of a pattern associated with food scares.  This pattern involves an initial scare followed by reassuring noises and comforting statements from the pillars of conventional wisdom and safe talk.  However, this is followed by a reduction in consumption which includes a lag period while consumption <Col N="1395" /> slowly returns to normal levels.  Complacency then sets in and another scare appears in due course and the pattern is repeated.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the biggest and most elaborate response to the scares which have occurred.  The board sets out to achieve the maximum possible level of food safety through better policing standards, food science facilities, education for the public and improved attitudes on the part of producers and the agencies.  I am pleased the Minister for Health and Children introduced the Bill and that the Department of Health and Children will be the primary influence on the activities of the board.  However, one hopes the influence will be in the form of benign support rather than modulation of how the authority behaves.  The long-term success of the board will centre on two key factors &mdash; the quality and ability of those employed by it and the board's budget.</P>
      <P>A very good start has been made with the appointment of Dr. Pat Wall and other members of staff.  However, the pool of talented independent people who are experts in food science in Ireland is relatively small.  Some experts in food science have been influenced by having to defend the system in the past.  That is not confined to the world of food science; it is to be found in politics as well.  We see ex-Ministers continuing to behave as if they were still Ministers and new Ministers behaving as if they were still in Opposition.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the board is a recognition that the status quo is not good enough.  It is essential, therefore, that those committed to defending the status quo should not be allowed to exert an undue influence on the new board.  The quality of board members will be important and it is no harm to describe the kinds of people who should not be members &mdash; those who defend lobbies and those who defend the short-term interests of the agricultural industry have no place on the board. That would not be good for the board, for consumers or for farmers in the long term.</P>
      <P>The board does not need a Department representative whose job has always been to defend the Department and who will be a sort of full back for the board to stop people getting through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person's job is usually to mark people down and close them off rather than to produce an initiative.  They have no place on the board and I am sure the Minister will ensure that such people will not be members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's funding will be crucial.  The present funding is inadequate.  Food safety and quality assurance do not come cheaply and unless we are prepared to invest we will have more problems.  Quality is the only way forward for the food industry.  The culture of short cuts and soft options must be avoided and the board will have a key role in ensuring that that does not happen. If the board is to be influential it must have <Col N="1396" /> enough money to engage in serious, enduring research, and that seems unlikely.</P>
    <P>There is an appalling ignorance of the role of research and development in Ireland.  Some of the key people who call the shots regarding research do not have a clue and some of them are beyond help.  It is impossible to change their minds to the point of understanding that if one invests in research there is a kickback.  That is how progressive countries and companies progress. However, those people I am referring to are beyond understanding that simple concept. Another group of people are not totally helpless because they would benefit from a basic remedial course in this phenomenon, The course could be made up of small words, short sentences and two or three figures.  Unless the board can invest in research it will not be effective in the long term.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem regarding expectations about food safety.  A risk free diet of perfectly safe foods is not available.  Reducing the risks is the best that can be done.  The extent of exposure to the problem can be diminished but not eliminated, though some people want no risk associated with food.  There is a craving for certainty in the human condition, but it does not exist in this area.  That craving has led to snake oil salesmen in the food sector who say that one can have a perfectly safe diet and that if one uses diet a, b or c the implication is that one will live forever and be disease free.  It is important that this board confront this voodoo nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is also important to have some understanding of risk and some perspective on where serious risk exists.  In the old days we had ghosts, such as the púca.  The púca is now extinct and people do not believe in ghosts, but there is still an opportunity for people to scare others by pointing out the limitations and deficiencies of technology.  I am not saying that serious risks do not exist, but it is important to get a perspective on those risks and to manage them.  We must move forward knowing that progress cannot be achieved without exposing ourselves to some element of risk.</P>
    <P>People have stopped eating certain foods because they are afraid of getting BSE, for example, though the risk of getting BSE is very small.  Those people drive their cars every day of the week and the risk of a car accident is much higher, not to mention the risks of drinking too much alcohol.  People readily take serious risks yet stop eating certain foods because they become afraid of things happening that are very unlikely.  Important concerns have been expressed regarding the staff of the new organisation and I hope the Minister empowers the Board to deal effectively with them.</P>
    <P>What happened to the concept of &ldquo;the farm to the fork&rdquo;?  It seemed a good idea, but it does not appear to have developed in the meantime.  Will the board or any other body be able to move it forward?  It is important that consumers be able to work their way back to see where their food originates, but no significant progress seems to have been made on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> Consumer education in basic principles of food safety and hygiene is very important and has the potential for huge improvement in relation to the incidence of food poisoning.  Most food poisoning arises from the activity of fairly boring poisonous microbes.  Those could be cleaned up by basic measures in the average household, retail shop or food producing company.  Deputy Shortall referred to primitive hygiene in retail outlets. There is huge scope there for diminishing the incidence of food poisoning, yet the public remains ignorant of this.  It is a hopeless task to attract the public attention's to this in comparison with BSE.  A spongy brain is the type of thing to make people sit up compared to bacteria which cause mild digestive disorders.  It is important to deal with the basics of labelling and storing food. We must invest more in food safety.  It is essential to develop scientific methods and improve food safety standards in the industry and among members of the public.  People do not know how to store food properly in fridges and such basic errors could be corrected at a small cost.</P>
    <P>I hope the new authority will invest heavily in promoting that aspect of food safety.  It should also develop strategies to deal with recurring scares.  I have no doubt that there will be further health scares involving food and the authority must learn the most effective way to manage them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because the authority it proposes to establish is long overdue. People's attitudes towards food have changed, as evidenced by the fact that they eat a greater variety of foods and are more conscious of the health aspects of the produce they consume.  As a result they are more knowledgeable than in the past and they want to believe that what they are eating is healthy and wholesome.  If it is successful, the new authority will restore confidence in the food industry.  If consumers are confident about what they are eating, this will have beneficial effects for farmers, producers and manufacturers of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a food safety authority is long overdue because of the number of scares involving BSE, salmonella, e-coli, etc.  The risks of contracting some of these diseases are minute and many of the scares surrounding them were driven more by newspaper headlines than scientific fact.  I understand that the risk of contracting CJD is quite small and farmers have argued that beef is safer to eat than many other foods.  To a large extent that argument is correct.  The production of beef is much safer than the production of poultry, for example.  Many people began eating chicken or turkey because they believed these meats were safer than beef.  I accept that the consumption <Col N="1398" /> of white meat is more beneficial to one's diet, but beef is a more organic food than many poultry products.</P>
    <P>Problems surrounding beef production had to be tackled because a certain number of cattle were contaminated.  As Deputy Upton stated, once a scare involving a food arises it must be tested scientifically so that people can be informed whether they should eat it.  Warnings about certain foods must be based on scientific reasons rather than on newspaper headlines because many health scares have been driven by such headlines in the absence of scientific proof. Much of the food we produce is healthy and wholesome and its quality has improved dramatically.  However, the increase in food production has given rise to many problems.</P>
    <P>The main responsibility of the new authority will be to ensure the safety and quality of food and the restoration of consumer confidence.  Consumers must be in a position to ensure that they are represented within the organisation.  The new authority will be the single agency with overall responsibility for the enforcement of national and EU legislative provisions in the area of food safety and hygiene and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale.  The authority will be formally established in January 1999 and the interim body will remain in office until that time.  I welcome the fact consumers are represented on the interim body.</P>
    <P>The new authority will come under the direction of the Minister for Health and Children who will also appoint the board and the scientific committee. The authority is important in terms of consumer confidence in agricultural produce and providing assurances to foreign markets about our agricultural exports.  The responsibility of reviving confidence in our produce is particularly important in the aftermath of the BSE crisis and other health threatening diseases spread by animal infections and land pollution.  The authority will assume responsibility for the functions of existing agencies, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards in this area.  Existing agencies will act as agents of the authority in the performance of their contracts.  This means there will be a greater degree of uniformity in the inspection regime and it will ensure that public health and consumer confidence take precedence.</P>
    <P>The new authority will aim to promote a system of standards from primary production through to final sale and food inspections will be carried out under its guidance and direction.  The authority may establish food safety assurance schemes for the protection of consumer interests by itself or in conjunction with other organisations. A food safety council will be established to consult with interim groups on the promotion of standards, etc.  The Bill provides for the transfer of staff from existing agencies.  Research, advice, co-ordination of services and certification of foods are included in the functions of the authority <Col N="1399" /> which will have full powers to ensure that producers follow the highest standards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the establishment of the food safety authority, a commitment Fianna Fáil gave when in Opposition.  The legislation will go a long way to address unnecessary concerns on the part of consumers and it will deal with many of the real problems relating to food production. I hope the food industry will go from strength to strength and that consumers will regain confidence in the food they eat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate those involved in bringing forward the Bill, particularly the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  The Bill is designed to provide for a statutory body to be known as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which will have full responsibility for all safety and hygiene matters.  I am pleased that a single agency will have total and sole responsibility for the enforcement of national and EU legislative provisions in the area of food safety and hygiene and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale.  This will hopefully mean there will be a greater degree of uniformity in the inspection regime and it will ensure that public health and consumer interests will take precedence.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the environmental health officers who currently work in this area under the aegis of the various health boards.  These people work on the basis of existing legislation so there should be a degree of uniformity in terms of inspection and controls. However, greater benefit will be gained from the fact that a sole agency &mdash; the food safety authority &mdash; will retain responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>While emphasis can be put on hygiene enforcement I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the provisions of this Bill will not only contribute to public health but will also serve the economic development of the food sector.  I urge caution, especially when EU legislation is involved.  Many people find it difficult to make a living from food retailing in restaurants or cafés.  They may occupy a unit in a shopping centre and, therefore, do not have total control over the maintenance or alteration of the physical environment.  They may be faced with a requirement under EU or other law to make an alteration to the premises which it is not possible for them to carry out readily.  This can cause complications.  I hope the food authority will be able to take account of such practical issues when dealing with relevant matters.  The House will endeavour to ensure the protection of consumers' interests.  However, we must also acknowledge the practicalities involved for those selling food to the consumer.  They can face great difficulties meeting certain criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inspector may call to a premises and, under current provisions, may make a report if necessary which can affect the granting of a licence. <Col N="1400" /> The procedures allow inspectors to require certain works to be carried out.  I am aware of the case where a small café in a shopping centre was inspected and the inspector noticed a number of minor matters needing attention, including a crack in the plaster on the wall and a broken floor tile.  All the significant issues relating to food hygiene, preparation and sale were in order. However, because there was a total of seven minor items to be addressed the application for a renewal of the licence was rejected.  The proprietor had no alternative but to go through the appeals process, although the inspector had returned to the premises, reinspected the premises and was satisfied that the work had been carried out.  In the current economic climate it can be difficult to get hold of a tiler or plasterer to carry out work.</P>
    <P>The food safety consultative council should be able to make good recommendations through working with the interested parties on the promotion of standards and other important issues. Slight alterations to current procedures and standards may be required.  It would be in the best interests of all concerned if the issues could be addressed pragmatically.  When the food authority is up and running the Minister should adopt a pragmatic approach to the simple issues.  We must bear mind at all times that consumers' interests should be protected.  However, the concerns of those striving to provide industry and to satisfy demand must also be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I have tabled many parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food over a long period on the various grants and funds available from the Department.  I am surprised at the level of expenditure over many years on the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programme.  It is time we called a halt to it.  In excess of £38 million was spent on it in 1997 and similar amounts have been spent annually over many years.  I am concerned also at the grants available to farmers, many of whom receive one or more payments.  I am baffled at the setaside scheme under which farmers may receive hundreds of thousands of pounds not to use their land.</P>
    <P>Young entrepreneurs in the food sector in urban areas who strive to make a livelihood, to provide employment and to supply demand for food have no grants available to them.  There are over £962 million worth of grants available under the agriculture and food headings, yet not a penny goes to the entrepreneurs to whom I referred who set up enterprises in Dublin.  Sums totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds are paid in setaside grants, £962 million is available to farmers to claim one or more payments and almost £40 million was spent last year on the TB and brucellosis programme.  Of what benefit is it? It would stir up a hornets' nest to ask who is responsible for the spread of brucellosis and TB.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on the e-coli and salmonella scares and their effects on the food industry.  I raised previously in the House, the question of false allegations made in this <Col N="1401" /> House by Members whose families and friends benefited as a result of the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry.  There are people in this House with egg on their faces.  They made false allegations in this House which had a huge impact on the food industry and were unable to give concrete evidence to back up those allegations when the tribunal was up and running. Millions of pounds were spent investigating the beef processing industry.  It would have been much better spent on young entrepreneurs setting up in industry, providing services and so on.</P>
    <P>Because of the current economic climate there is a huge increase in disposable income and people eat out much more regularly than before. Will the Government consider expenditure in terms of providing grants in this area?  Entrepreneurs should be given assistance.  Perhaps money could be made available to enterprise boards under the heading of food.  Because of the increase in disposable income and the cultural change whereby many more people eat in restaurants, that matter should be considered favourably.</P>

      <P>While the Minister for Health and Children is in the House I wish to make a special plea on behalf of a food which is 100 per cent pure, safe, natural and free.  I refer to human milk.  I raised in the House previously my concern that the Department of Health and Children does not support the drive for increased breast-feeding among young mothers.  Will the Minister consider this aspect of food safety?  No food is safer or better than human milk, particularly for very young babies.  Yet there is an extremely low level &mdash; approximately 30 per cent &mdash; of breast-feeding in Ireland.  We are literally wasting a primary food and a primary source of nutrition and protection for very young babies.  La Leché League applied to the Department of Health and Children for funding &mdash; I raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, on a previous occasion &mdash; and if the Minister has not already dealt with this application I would ask him to ensure, in the interests of food safety and of the very young, that breast-feeding is given the support it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is an important step forward in the modernisation of our food sector in terms of its regulation and its development. Food is essential for life, although it is unequally distributed.  In parts of the world people are dying from too little food while in other parts people are dying from too much.  We are fortunate to live in a country where the vast majority of people have enough to eat, but food has become a national and, at times, a knotty issue.  Consumers <Col N="1402" /> are more discerning, informed and suspicious than ever before.</P>
    <P>A study carried out by the department of medicine in UCG of about 200 shoppers found that every one of those surveyed expressed concern to some degree about the status of the food they buy.  Those fears may not always be grounded &mdash; most of the time they are probably ungrounded &mdash; but they must be addressed.  The Food Safety Authority is an important structure to alleviate fears.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the international aspect of the authority.  Food safety has become a marketing tool, particularly in European countries.  It is used very effectively to attract consumers to products.  We pride ourselves in having a green image and we must ensure we compete effectively in marketing and in terms of the record in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures consumer trust.  Provided the authority functions as is desired, the Bill will be effective in terms of allaying fears and in terms of competitiveness.  We are talking about every stage from production at farm level to the food on our plates.  I was interested to hear the term &ldquo;from farm to fork&rdquo;, the term I always heard was &ldquo;from plough to plate&rdquo;, but it has the same meaning. There must be an assurance that at every stage the highest possible standards are guaranteed. If such standards are to be guaranteed there are serious implications in terms of resources, staffing and adequate financing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to address these vital factors is revealing and disturbing.  He must recognise that the Bill arises from a commitment by the rainbow coalition Government and the work of the Food Safety Authority.  When we came to Government the consumer affairs section in the Department of Enterprise and Employment was deplorably under-resourced and neglected. In recognition of the need for consumer protection and the facilities provided by that office, one of the major decisions taken by the last Government was to ensure the office was upgraded, resourced, relocated and adequately staffed.  It is ungracious of the Minister not to recognise the good work done by his predecessors.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Opposition, I have no difficulty in saying that the expansion and strengthening of the role of the Food Safety Authority is a welcome initiative.  Moving on from the role of regulating the regulators towards a central directional role and ultimate responsibility is a significant step forward and I am happy to support it.  I wish, however, the Minister was not so grudging in his approach or so parsimonious in his praise.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more explicit about funding.  It is very well for Fianna Fáil to claim that it set out a policy in the programme for Government and that it is taking the initiative of introducing legislation, but that is not enough. Funding is critical to the success of the authority. The Minister should have referred in detail to the issue of funding and I hope he will do so in summing <Col N="1403" /> up.  The authority will be judged on its capability to live up to its new role of direct responsibility. The requirements are considerable, but the budgetary and resource implications have not been spelled out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has been unable to wrest sufficient funding from the Minister for Finance to deal effectively with areas of responsibility within his Department.  I question his ability to secure the solid financial base that will be needed for the authority's expanded role. His track record so far has not been impressive nor has the Department of Health and Children dealt sufficiently with food safety.  There is a danger the authority will be seen as the poor relation in the Department.  The Minister set high targets, but he must assure us he can meet them. I have great confidence in Dr. Wall and the authority. It has a good reputation and has shown its commitment to engage with the public and directly in public education.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the outbreak of BSE and e-coli 0157 undermined public confidence.  Those were not the only factors involved.  Despite what Deputy Callely said, the serious irregularities exposed by the beef tribunal, the extensive court cases relating to the use by farmers of illegal growth promoters, the scientific advances of genetically modified foods and irradiation contributed to public anxiety.  While, generally speaking, our diet is balanced and healthy, the establishment by statute of an effective and well resourced authority is an important guarantee for public confidence.  Anything less than a well resourced authority would simply serve to increase fears rather than allay them.  I recognise that numerically speaking there are very few cases of BSE, but the remoteness of the likelihood does not lessen the fear or the need for vigilance.</P>
    <P>The consumer has only recently been placed at the centre of the debate on food safety.  At EU level the traditional dominance of farming interests is being replaced by a greater emphasis on the consumer.  I recall arguing with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the time of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government about having only one consumer representative on the board of Bord Bia.  I am pleased we have moved on from that narrowly based thinking in terms of food safety.  When the name of the Department of Agriculture was changed to the Department of Agriculture and Food most people, particularly consumers, believed it did not address relevant food safety issues and that producers dominated to the detriment of consumers. Most producers want best practice in production, but there cannot be grounds for complacency. There are still rogues, mavericks and those who want to take short cuts.  In the recent dispute about the dairy hygiene regulations, the Irish Veterinary Union took a position on certification that most farming organisations opposed and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry appeared to be willing to concede to <Col N="1404" /> them.  This shows that we have still some ground to make up.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the consumer must be the king or the queen &mdash; many consumers are female.  To address the issue of food safety we must ensure the absolute independence of the authority and the Bill provided for that.  It is important that vested interests cannot influence the authority, it is a question of resources and a secure budget.  An argument could be made for a system of levying because exporters will benefit from the guarantees the Food Safety Authority can provide in marketing their products abroad. There is a danger that we could end up with an export driven initiative.  We must ensure that exporters are not given a type of gold card certification for their products if a similar standard of excellence is not provided for produce for the home market.  We must be able to compete and live up to our image.  Sweden can guarantee their chickens are salmonella free and Denmark have superb arrangements in place regarding food safety.  I understand multiples are demanding very high standards and, while that is very welcome, it also places demands on producers to meet those standards.</P>
    <P>Service agreements are at the nub of the problem for the authority.  While the authority has moved from being a regulator of regulators, the work will continue to be done by agencies by way of service agreements.  I can envisage problems for the authority in regard to the effectiveness of the system.  If, for example, a local authority does not have a full-time veterinary officer &mdash; ten do not &mdash; how will it enforce consistency across the country?  If an environmental health officer does not comply with an agreement what power will the authority have to enforce the agreement?  It appears it cannot impose any sanctions in that regard.  If that is the case, it will not be effective because of the limitations at local level and human fallibility.  Will the Minister refer to that matter in his reply?</P>
    <P>Another matter that must be addressed is the question of data collection and the lack of links between laboratories.  We must ensure data is accessible.  We are all aware of the recent salmonella outbreak in a Dundrum butchers.  While the health board did a good job in tracking down the outbreak, it took a long time to do so.  We must address the question of traceability and the provision of information in a speedy manner to ensure effective controls are in place.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I want the Minister to deal specifically with budgetary and staffing requirements at central and local level.  If he fails to do that he will undermine the competence of the authority to meet a glorious opportunity to deal with food safety in a modern and effective manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus who, at very short notice, agreed to share time with me.  I, too, welcome the Bill and, wearing my farmer's cap, I believe all farmers will welcome it. <Col N="1405" /> The debate has been very balanced.  During other similar debates we were not all singing from the same hymn sheet in that primary producers were always wrong and everybody else was right.  Of course, that is not the case.  I lend my voice to the good wishes sent to Dr. Patrick Wall who will do a good job as chief executive of the Food Safety Authority.  He made a good impression when he appeared before a committee of the House a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>We want one authoritative voice in the food safety area so that people can accept and believe what is being said at a time of a crisis.  The last BSE outbreak brought horrendous problems for which we are still paying and we have not recovered as an agricultural nation.  Reports in the national media were totally wrong.  Only 70 cattle out of a total of 7 million were affected; it was a low incidence.  A few months following the outbreak one could hardly give cattle away at marts. In 1996 there were approximately 70 outbreaks of the disease and consumption fell dramatically. Strangely, in 1997 there were almost the same number of outbreaks but more meat was eaten in Ireland.  The same cattle, farmers, land and disease were involved but the perception of the disease changed.</P>
      <P>It is important there is an authoritative voice that will tell consumers the way it is.  If the situation is bad, they should be told and that is where Dr. Patrick Wall and the food safety authority come in.  It is in the interest of our 150,000 farming families that this authority is successful.  We export nine out of every ten animals and, obviously, the certification attached to the ear of every animal when they are exported is the most important aspect of our marketing.  If one looks at Bord Bia, our Embassies and our marketing structure throughout the world, that certification is required and that is why I welcome it.  There are obviously pitfalls which will have to be watched.  Recently, the Minister of State appeared before an Oireachtas Committee where he gave us a great insight to the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is obvious there will have to be greater funding because somebody must pay the piper.  As primary producers, farmers are already paying veterinary and inspection fees, etc.  . I hope that if there is an increase in fees it will be shared by everybody, including processors, distributors and consumers.  It should not be landed on primary producers.  I hope there will not be vested interests on the scientific committee because if there are, it will fail.  It is important that when it makes a recommendation, it will be seen there were no vested interests of any description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 3.5 million Irish consumers about whom we must worry most.  I hope we reach a stage that when they put food on their plates, they will know there is improved fitness to practise at farm level and greater efficiency and attention to detail at processing and distribution level and in our kitchens where food is frozen.  Dr. Wall said there is little point in blaming anybody else if one's refrigerator is set incorrectly and the <Col N="1406" /> food is not treated in one's home as it should be. This is an example of a breakdown which could result in major illness.  This is an all embracing business and I wish the authority well.  I hope funding will be made available for it, vested interests will be kept outside and throughout the world when our products are being marketed and are on display that the certification of the authority will be the best in the world.  That is when I and everybody else will be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally support the setting up of the new food safety authority on a full-time statutory basis.  However, unlike Deputy McManus, I have the utmost confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  Such an authority for food safety with a high degree of expertise and independence will be well placed to protect the reputations of farmers and other producers whenever a problem of food safety arises.  The new authority will be the agency with the overall responsibility for the enforcement of national and EU provisions in food safety and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for food controls currently rests with a wide number of Departments and agencies and hundreds of staff are involved in the delivery of food control services.  Furthermore, it is not uncommon for such staff to have other duties, in addition to food control, assigned to them.  It is not definitively possible at all times to identify food control staff individually.  As a result, the transfer of all relevant staff from existing agencies to the new food safety authority will take time, but it will greatly add to bringing all strands of food safety control under the auspices of one central agency.</P>
      <P>Following the BSE crisis, the setting up of the food safety authority is a positive and innovative step in assuring foreign markets about the safety of our produce.  However, this is only one measure which must be introduced if consumer confidence in our food products is to be improved.  Other initiatives which could be implemented to enhance and improve food products include the allocation of greater resources to Bord Bia for the implementation of marketing and promotion activities of Irish food products in Britain and throughout Europe; greater marketing of Irish beef products in Britain and in Europe through greater promotion of the national beef assurance scheme and continuation of the operational programme for the food industry post-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves in this regard. In terms of direct employment, the food industry accounts for approximately 38,500 jobs in Ireland. Over 12,000 people are employed in the slaughtering and preserving of meat, 7,200 in the manufacture of dairy products, 2,700 in the manufacture of poultry food, 5,500 in the bread and flour industry, 4,000 in the sugar production sector and over 7,300 in other related food industries.  Food <Col N="1407" /> production provides important benefits in terms of direct employment and its contribution to the agricultural and wider rural economies.  The current operational programme for the food industry 1995-99 has been allocated £641 million pounds broken up into three categories &mdash; EU assistance of £205 million, national assistance totalling £78 million and private sector assistance of £358 million. I fully appreciate the importance of the food industry from the perspective of those involved in it and that of consumers.</P>
    <P>I recognise the broader need for the marketing of Irish food products here and in Europe on the basis of their quality.  There must be a real partnership and participation by all those involved in the food industry in this process to guarantee that improvements are made in this sphere.  The setting up of the food safety authority will undoubtedly assist the food industry, but more work remains to be done if the agriculture industry is to fully recover from the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on carrying out the commitment in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium which stated a new safety authority would be created.  It is an agency with singular and overall responsibility for the enforcement of legislative provisions in the area of food safety and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale.</P>
    <P>Public health and consumer interests will be protected as a direct result of the uniformity of control to be exercised by the new authority.  The Bill also provides in section 30 for the authority's involvement, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food producers' representatives, in the establishment of schemes to protect consumer interests.  These schemes, described in section 13 as food safety assurance schemes, will cover the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation, storage and handling of food products.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill provides in detail for a policing and enforcement role for the authority, its main aim is to foster, through education and promotion, a food safety culture among providers and consumers which characterises all elements of the food chain.  The establishment of such a culture will serve the purpose of protecting our national public health in a positive sense, as opposed to relying on an enforcement regime to carry out such tasks at all times.  I am also glad that the national surveillance unit, which will have primary responsibility for food-borne diseases, will maintain a liaison with the new Food Safety Authority of Ireland in this area.</P>
    <P>After the Maastricht Treaty and the new Treaty of Amsterdam, consumer policy has become a major concern of the European Union. Numerous provisions and action plans have been adopted at a European level for the protection of consumers and their interests.  Especially after the BSE crisis, the Community has taken measures <Col N="1408" /> to ensure that the principles of good health and consumer protection are included in all European Union policies.  With the directives which provide for liability on defective products, and other measures such as general product safety, numerous measures have been put forward to improve food safety and consumer protection.  Specific provisions have been enacted for labelling requirements on the ingredients of foodstuffs and food additives.</P>
    <P>In future there will be an increasing need to improve consumer confidence and to identify the genuine priority problems for consumers to enhance their quality of life and to guarantee minimum safety standards.  EU consumer policy is well advanced and consumer protection in the field of food protection is but one example of such legislation.  In the trade area, new instruments such as the directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, the directive on consumer protection in the indication of the price of products, the directive on comparative advertising and the protection of package holiday makers are examples of the priorities of the member states and the EU in consumer policy.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill there is a strong emphasis on the openness and transparency under which the authority will operate.  The chief executive, board members, the scientific committee, the staff of the authority and any other consultants and advisers or persons engaged by the authority will have to declare any financial or other beneficial interests that might be in conflict with their role in the authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely and appropriate Bill.  The food scares of the last few years have had a disastrous effect on consumer confidence and the economy as a whole.  However, the scares we experienced in the past, such as salmonella and the danger of unpasteurised milk, pale into insignificance when we compare them to the possible link between BSE and new variant CJD. Concern in our home market is quite apparent.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for being so forceful and committed in bringing the Bill before the House.  It is in line with the commitments in our manifesto and our programme for Government and I take great pleasure in supporting it.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister mentioned other issues of concern to consumers, including new crop developments, food processing, the increasing availability of genetically modified foods, antibiotic residues in pork, and angel dust and other growth promoters.  All these scares regarding food production have caused tremendous worry for consumers, who have correctly demanded protection from the State.  This Bill conforms to those demands and the Minister has addressed those fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will reassure the consumer, make a solid contribution to public health, allay the fears <Col N="1409" /> of our export market and go a long way to develop our food industry.  By extension, it will assist economic growth and job creation.  The consumer will be reassured that the authority is independent and science-based, and that there will be full traceability of food.  That has been a buzz word for a number of years in food safety and the Bill will protect the consumer in that regard.  The Bill will also encourage, promote and foster high standards of safety and hygiene from the primary production stage to purchase by the customer. This typifies the commitment in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The authority will have as its key objective the placing of primary responsibility for food safety with producers as well as with manufacturers, distributors and retailers.  I believe it will act in the consumers' interest, which will make them king and assure them of good standards.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of misunderstanding regarding the farming community, perhaps due to the few farmers who have used illegal growth promoters.  The IFA's reaction to the Bill demonstrates beyond doubt its commitment to food safety.  The association has recorded its support for the Bill and stated that consumer confidence in all food products is vital for producers. Those of us who met IFA delegations in the last few weeks will have taken that on board.  Farmers have nothing to hide as regards food safety.  They are committed to the highest standards, as underlined by their open and early support for the Bill. I support the IFA's call that the authority must be fully independent and act in accordance with the highest safety standards at every link in the food chain.  The association said the authority should also have an obligation to assure and inform consumers about Irish food.  I support this call and the Bill provides for it.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Bill is the establishment of the scientific committee to advise on matters referred to it by the board relating to scientific or technical questions, food inspection and nutrition.  The science-based nature of the authority shows the wholesome commitment of the Government.  That authorised officers will be empowered to enter and inspect food premises, to secure these premises for later inspection and to inspect and, if necessary, remove records proves beyond doubt the good intentions of the Bill.  For the first time closure orders may be served where improvement orders have not been complied with.  This shows the Government's commitment to food safety.  Where there is an immediate threat to public health, similar orders may be served.  The new authority will be directly accountable for all food control functions.  Traceability will be the cornerstone of the Food Safety Authority.  The authority's responsibilities will include inspection of farms, places of primary production, water treatment plants etc.  That prosecutions may be taken by the authority itself or by one of the contracting agencies shows the purpose of the Bill is to protect and reassure the consumer regarding food safety.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the Bill given that it is <Col N="1410" /> in line with our commitments in the programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue as it is necessary to ensure confidence in regard to food safety.  In recent years there have been many food scares but, generally speaking, the level of control and food safety is of a high standard.  While it is necessary to establish an independent authority we should congratulate and pay tribute to those responsible for this area heretofore.  My experience is in the whole area of agriculture and food inspection.  I often considered inspectors were inspecting themselves and to an extent that is the case.  While they have done a marvellous job, difficulties have arisen from time to time in certain areas.  There was always a question about their independence in that they were supervising themselves.  It did not have face validity that beef factories and creameries were supervised by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It would have been more appropriate if they had been supervised by the Department of Health and Children.  The authority, when established, will have an independent role and will have credibility with the public.  This is important in the context of people's awareness of the need for quality food.  However, it is important that the authority be given the necessary resources and that it has the teeth to operate effectively.</P>
      <P>The Minister has clearly stated the best possible practices in supervising the whole area of food safety.  He has outlined what he considers necessary but, in the event that the resources are not provided, confidence in food safety will be undermined.  On the one hand the Minister is saying this is the proper way to proceed and on the other he is not providing the resources to ensure the implementation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the authority will be to promote, encourage, and foster high standards of food and hygiene at all stages from primary production to final sale to the customer.  Like the previous speaker I pay tribute to the farming community and the IFA for their wholehearted support of the Bill and the establishment of the authority.  We welcome that.  A key objective of the authority is to bring about acceptance that primary responsibility for food safety rests with producers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and caterers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of the producer has been examined over a number of years and there are various EU directives regarding production at farm level. Sometimes these directives are not backed up with proper assistance to ensure standards are reached.  While our standards are high in the area of food production in the farmyard, a great deal more assistance should be provided to ensure the best possible practices.  When viewing production standards in European countries I am often amazed that their standards are lower than ours. <Col N="1411" /> This is because we are mainly an exporting country and our standards are dictated by the export market and the inspections of the country to whom we are exporting.  Frequently, they set standards higher than are required in their own countries.  This is a means of protecting producers in their own country.  I do not have any problem with that except that more assistance should be provided to the primary producers, the farmers, to ensure the best possible practices.</P>
    <P>While manufacturers were well supervised by the Department of Agriculture and Food, distributors are not supervised to the same extent. The authority should examine the area of food distribution.  In recent times retailers and caterers are supervised more by local health boards.  The authority should ensure the co-ordination of all areas in the provision of food from the primary producer to the consumer.  The authority will carry out, through the contracts negotiated with the agencies, inspections, approval, licensing and registration of food premises and equipment. Where the situation warrants it, this will extend to the farm and places of primary production. Water treatment plants and other sources of material are used in food production.  It will also be responsible for the sampling and analysis of food and inspection of food labelling.</P>
    <P>While this is not the area of responsibility of the Minister I avail of the occasion to raise an issue which he may bring to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, because the whole agricultural area impacts on this.  Two issues are causing concern.  One is the movement of the primary product, cattle, due to the severe delays in the results of the 30 day premovement test.  The IFA and farmers in general are concerned about the delay in producing the blood test results to enable them to move cattle. In several cases that I am aware of, the information came too late to remove the animal.</P>
    <P>The other issue deals with the quality of the product.  It was brought to my attention recently that where an animal en route to a plant loses its identification tag, the factory will not accept the animal and return it to the farmer.  Obviously, the animal has been in an area which is not disease free.  The factory cannot have disease free status because diseased animals are taken there.  It is the job of the factory to ensure that no diseased animal gets into the food chain.  Although there is disease in the factory area including TB and brucellosis these animals are returned to the farm.  This area should be examined because of the obvious danger of transferring disease from the factory to the farm.  I understand the need for identification of all animals and that there can be a need for further herd tests, but once an animal has been inside the factory gate it should not be returned to the farm.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, the success of which will depend on the Minister having the goodwill to provide the resources to ensure all aspects of it <Col N="1412" /> are implemented.  If that is not done the Bill will have a negative effect because the consumer will hear the Government talking about best practice while not providing the finance to ensure there is best practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the long awaited Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998.  Those of us who regularly attend for the Order of Business will testify that the Bill, which deals with a serious issue, has been promised for many years.  I will set out what I believe should be a central objective of the Bill.  The question of whether the Minister can fulfil that objective perhaps will be dealt with elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Bill accepts current trends and refers to higher standards, although it does not say how those standards will be measured.  It also accepts the trend which should be reversed, namely, the intensification of food production in this country and elsewhere which has resulted in considerable problems, the more well known being BSE and CJD.</P>
      <P>Some advantages have been gained from intensification over the years in respect of short-term costs but in the long-term it has resulted in enormous costs which are difficult to quantify but which we pay nonetheless.  The Bill should take account of that and support more sustainable agricultural practices.  For instance, organic production should be favoured.</P>
      <P>The sustainability of packaging is another factor to be considered.  I realise that is not this Minister's brief but packaging, particularly plastic packaging, in relation to food production has increased in recent years.  That area should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The demands made on producers by large retail multinational companies operating here &mdash; I raised this matter on the Adjournment &mdash; have resulted in smaller and more sustainable producers going out of business.  In my own constituency of Dublin North, farmers who want to deal with Tesco are being asked to spend between £18,000 and £20,000 on the provision of a chilling room.  If they do not do that, Tesco will not do business with them.  Tesco is currently cornering the market, and issues like that must be addressed as a backdrop to the Bill.  Merely insisting on higher standards will not raise them unless the infrastructure exists to ensure sustainable and wholesome food is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are some way behind other countries in relation to CJD, for example.  A UK survey project refers to the incidence of CJD in the European Union in 1994.  A number of countries monitor CJD with the help of EU funding, but Ireland is not on that list.  France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK indicated the number of cases, definite and probable, and incidence per million per year.  In the context of the Bill before us, the Government should try to catch up with other EU countries so that we can be reassured and benefit from this monitoring which is funded <Col N="1413" /> at EU level.  It is worth following up that matter even at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a broad brief.  It covers a significant number of issues including packaging, food standards, the operation of premises dealing with food and a number of associated matters.  Difficulties can arise when a range of operations are covered in a Bill.  To that extent this Bill seems to rely on a number of the agencies currently in operation.  I hope we can ensure on Committee Stage that it will not be compromised through lack of resources or having to depend on the same people who have dealt with the area of food safety up to now, or in terms of independent experts.</P>
    <P>The board of the Food Safety Authority will continue to be chosen by the Minister.  Will he spell out more clearly the criteria that will be applied for the appointment of people to the board?  People concerned with food safety expect reassurance from us.  There is provision for the chairman of the board to be sacked but the reasons for that must be more clearly identified.</P>
    <P>In light of the debate yesterday on payments to politicians, it was interesting to read the section on gifts and that the authority could benefit from being resourced from various quarters.  There is reference to the authority not being compromised by any conditions attached to those gifts but we know from debates in this House that conditions are seldom attached to gifts.  Matters would be much simpler if that were the case.  Previous tribunals have found that giving a gift is compromising to some extent and we must be extremely careful that we do not allow the authority to be forced into accepting resources from vested interests which might compromise its independence. That is particularly relevant, given the compromising situations following our debate yesterday.</P>
    <P>My worry about the giving of gifts is related to the fact that large vested interests have a great deal to lose by incurring the displeasure of the authority.  The giant multinational retail units and companies to which I referred have enormous turnover and it would be well within their means to give resources to the food safety authority to help it do its work.  They would probably also get PR kudos for so doing.  However, I pointed out earlier the long-term effects of allowing such a system to dominate our food production.  I hope we can ensure the Bill will strengthen the independence of the authority by not allowing it to depend on gifts, as is mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I reckon the food safety authority will not see the light of day until next year, which leaves more time in which food safety must be assured.  Food is very important to our economy as well as to our individual wellbeing.  We must speed up the implementation of the Bill and the appointment of the authority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the gender balance of appointments throughout the Bill.  It is difficult to see much gender balance in marches or demonstrations by <Col N="1414" /> food producers, but perhaps this food safety authority will have a knock-on effect.</P>
    <P>Lessons should be learned from the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to fines. Some of the fines should be increased on Committee Stage.  As I mentioned, some of those who might face the wrath of the food safety authority are extremely large multinational companies with turnover comparable to the GNP of some countries. Slapping a hefty fine of £1,500 on such companies would be little more than an irritation to them.  The fines must be revised in that context.</P>
    <P>The standing committee to be set up by the Dáil should examine reports but it seems to be focused on accounts and financial dealings, which are important in themselves.  However, given public concern about food safety, it should be mandatory for these reports to be in the public domain.  The Bill states the authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; publish reports, which I hope it will.  However, as is the case in many Bills, &ldquo;may&rdquo; could read &ldquo;shall&rdquo; without threatening the foundations of the State. I hope that will be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the production, growing, storage and manufacturing sides of food safety.  It seems to omit the increasing interest in wild food. In England and Germany restrictions have had to be put on the collection of wild food because of its increasing popularity.  It opens to question the integrity of our environment when one expresses concern about the state of food collected from the wild, which is no harm.  For example, in some countries the picking of mushrooms is a family pastime, similar to choosing a Christmas tree.  We must include wild food in the remit of the food safety authority, thereby focusing attention on the healthy state of our environment generally. People should be encouraged to pick blackberries and so on unless it damages the environment. Collecting wild food is a very healthy, social and nutritional pastime.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred on Second Stage to about 50 agencies which are relevant to the Bill. There are much fewer than 50 agencies in the list at the back of the Bill.  I presume he was referring to agencies associated with, for example, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  There are agencies which would be very important to the work of the food safety authority but which are not directly connected with the agencies listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the organic food production sector and the various organisations which, largely on a voluntary basis or with meagre support from the State, operate inspections of various aspects of food production.  The organic inspectorate operates on a relative shoestring and is supported by the organic sector.  I hope the food safety authority will take a proactive stand, perhaps by lobbying the Minister for Agriculture and Food or by generally alerting the Government to the need to help the organic food sector to ensure inspections are properly resourced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Packaging and labelling are becoming far more important in marketing than ever before and the descriptions used by, for example, egg producers are pretty wild and make wonderful claims. Words such as &ldquo;natural produce&rdquo;, &ldquo;home produced&rdquo;, &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;wholesome&rdquo; are loosely and glibly thrown around, as if to suggest an organic standard is being adhered to.  A close inspection of some of those products would reveal they are very far from organically produced food.  Cowboy food producers are being allowed to exploit a price premium or market advantage for their own gain.  However, they are discrediting those who, at considerable expense in many cases, are making the extra effort to produce food in a non intensive, humane and healthy organic fashion.  The food safety authority should address that issue, which does not seem to be covered by the official agencies listed in the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>This Bill presents the Government with a final opportunity to redress the damage done to food production by the dominance in the food market of very large and successful profit oriented multinational interests.  That is the ultimate challenge we face.  The Bill should face down the challenges and take-over bids which I am sure will be made by large multinational vested interests.  It should set the standards for the control of the food industry.  I look forward to furthering that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate and for the manner in which it has been conducted.  We are all agreed that food safety is one of the most important issues at present.  As Minister of State with special responsibility in this area it is my first priority.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has already stated, the Government recognises the need for uncompromised and independently verifiable assurances on food safety to ensure consumer confidence.  While the primary purpose of the Bill is the protection of consumers, the Government also recognises that one of the best ways of promoting the food sector is to put in place a strong, independent and science based food safety authority, which will have the confidence of consumers, both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory speech, the Minister referred to such issues as BSE, the new variant CJD, salmonella, listeria and e-coli, which are matters of increasing concern for consumers, as are new crop developments and food processing. I agree the Government must listen to all and respond appropriately to their concerns.  I assure the House that the Government will not be found wanting in this regard.  The protection of public health is a matter of absolute priority and any threat to the safety of food we eat will receive an immediate, strong response.  It is vital, therefore, we put a structure in place that can adequately <Col N="1416" /> identify and assess any risk to public health in a competent, professional manner and then communicate clearly and effectively with both consumers and providers.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the interests of consumers are better served by the creation of an authority which will be directly accountable for all food control functions.  For the authority to be accountable in this way, it must also have direct responsibility for these functions.  While our original intention was to effect the immediate transfer of all relevant staff to the new authority on vesting day, this has not proven to be a practicable proposition.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government's decision not to give the authority the audit function envisaged by the previous Government was a case of change for the sake of change and an attempt to put Fianna Fáil colours on the previous Government's proposals.  Deputy Bradford claimed that we have got it wrong and that the option of an authority which was merely an audit body was the correct one.  I strongly disagree.  The previous Government's proposals were little more than a knee-jerk reaction to a growing lack of consumer confidence.  The idea of an authority which would have no direct role in its administration of food safety services and which sat pontificating at one remove would not have provided the assurance consumers demand and deserve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford described his preferred solution as &ldquo;simple and straightforward&rdquo;.  There is nothing simple or straightforward about food safety.  We are concerned with a complex, ever changing environment, where the range of skills required to manage it extends from microbiology to animal husbandry to environmental control.  It is not simple and requires a structure which brings all these diverse skills together and allows them to function in a harmonised, responsive way.  The structure proposed for the authority is not a bureaucratic nightmare, as some have claimed.  Indeed, it provides the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the best interests of the consumer are served.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the provisions in the Bill for contracts between the authority and the existing official agencies and it has been suggested that the authority could, somehow, go elsewhere for its services.  This is nonsense, which I can illustrate with an example.  The health boards employ some 200 environmental officers. These are highly skilled professionals with years of training and experience behind them and are in the front line when a food safety alert arises. Perhaps Deputy Bradford could tell the House where we can get 200 such officers if not from the health boards?  The Bill proposes that the authority will be able to publish details of the contracts and will introduce a system of monitoring to ensure that the agreements are adhered to.  If contracts are not satisfactorily fulfilled the authority will report to the Minister for Health and <Col N="1417" /> Children who will arrange for such reports to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The service contracts proposed are a practical, workable and immediate solution.  They do not purport to be anything else.  In the longer term we may well see the authority with its own full staff and the bulk of these would come from the existing agencies.  On the question of transfer of staff I again emphasise that this will only happen after discussion and agreement with the representatives of the staff concerned.  The Bill provides that any staff who may be transferred will enjoy terms and conditions no less favourable than those which they already have.  I will not be drawn on any timetable for transfers.  No decisions have been made on this.  Let us get on with the work in hand and get the authority operational without delay using the service contracts devices as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>The ultimate benchmark of quality is safety and the protection of public health.  The Bill focuses firmly on this.  In the broader context, quality is much more subjective and is influenced very much by personal taste.  It is essentially a market driven concept.  Different markets have different perceptions about quality.  To give the food safety authority responsibility for this wider area of quality would deflect it from its primary responsibility, which is to focus on the matter of food safety.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has a whole range of programmes dealing with the quality issue.  These are complemented by the schemes operated by Bord Bia, Bord Glas and the processing retailing sectors.  These schemes represent industry's response to consumer concerns and quality.  I am satisfied they should be left in this arena.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance schemes will undoubtedly benefit from underpinning the safety role of the authority.  However, I stress this is a desirable spin-off and not a requirement of the food safety system.  The Bill provides the authority's involvement, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food producers representatives in the establishment of schemes to protect consumer interests.  These schemes, to be known as food safety assurance schemes, will cover the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on a range of food safety issues.</P>
    <P>The structure of the authority has been considered carefully to ensure that it can discharge its functions in a fair and balanced way.  This can be managed by achieving a proper balance between the four structural elements &mdash; the board of the authority, its scientific committee, the chief executive and staff and a consultative council. Specifically, the Bill provides for a broadly based consultative council.  The Ministers for Health and Children, Agriculture and Food, the Marine and Natural Resources and the board of the authority will nominate the membership of the council, the broad base of which reflects the need for balanced representation.  Notwithstanding that the council will include representation from various <Col N="1418" /> interests, including producer interests, the authority will not be bound by its views in arriving at decisions.  The board of the authority will regard the best interests of the consumer as paramount. The notion that the consumer is king or queen will be reflected in the appointment of the board's membership.  Within this context we can look at the role of the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford sought clarification on the local authority veterinary service.  As he indicated, it was the intention that the service would transfer to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It may still be prudent to do this but we may need to review the position in light of the establishment of the authority.  The point was well made and I will be happy to amend the Schedule on Committee Stage to include a reference to the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus raised the issue of breast-feeding. I accept that the low level of breast-feeding is a source of concern.  The Department is pursuing the matter on a national basis and has established a national breast-feeding policy.  The Health Promotion Unit has funded the production of a video and an information pack by Professor Kelleher of UCG for professionals.  It has also produced the Breast Fed is Best Fed booklet and a poster giving clear and simple advice on the issue.  The Department has provided support for many voluntary organisations, including the La Leche League, the Irish Childbirth Trust and the Irish Association of Lactation Consultants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton welcomed the Bill and said it was balanced.  There are 150,000 farmers each of whom is behind the authority.  The Deputy highlighted the pitfalls in certification and asked who will provide the funds to solve any problems that may arise.  He is anxious to ensure the scientific committee is not interfered with by outside interests.  We can deal with these issues in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville said that, as a major food exporter, we need to have confidence in the authority which should be credible.  Its independence will guarantee this.  The Deputy availed of the opportunity to highlight a number of issues affecting farmers, including the movement of cattle in regard to the brucellosis test about which we have heard much recently.  There is need to produce blood test results faster.  Attention was drawn to the problems being experienced in Cork and Sligo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville also raised the issues of tagging and factory practices and mentioned that cattle are transferred from the factory back to the farm. This is not good practice.  We will bring this matter to the attention of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney said the Bill is timely to restore the confidence of consumers following a number of food scares.  He is happy that the authority will be independent and highlighted the scientific and traceability aspects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> Deputy Collins expressed confidence in the Minister whose ability has been questioned.  If one considers how the Department has performed over the past 11 months, one could not but have confidence in him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins reminded us of the number involved in the food sector &mdash; 38,500 at a minimum, including 12,000 in slaughtering; 7,200 in dairying; 7,000 in poultry; 5,000 in bakery; and 4,000 in sugar and ancillary services.  It is important to maintain the highest standards.  The consumer needs to be assured that everything possible is being done to ensure food safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall highlighted the need for consumer education in food hygiene and safety practices. The interim authority has established an information centre in the city centre which is complemented by an Internet website and a freefone helpline.  It also plans to provide mobile information units.</P>
    <P>On the question of cross-Border co-operation, we are considerably ahead of the United Kingdom in the development of a food safety body and structures.  We have many shared interests and intend to maintain close contact. Meetings have been held at ministerial and official level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton mentioned that BSE poses a much lower risk than traffic accidents.  That is not to say we should not be concerned about the myriad problems which can arise such as food poisoning. These can be avoided by ensuring best practice. The Deputy raised some interesting aspects to which we will return on Committee Stage.  The Deputy also highlighted the authority's role in assessing real risks and communicating effectively with consumers and producers.  That is an important aspect of its role and we will also deal with that.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate.  Yesterday the authority was described as an emperor with no clothes, but I stress it will have a full and well fitted wardrobe and will be well decked out for the job in hand.  People have asked from where the money will come.  The Government has guaranteed the authority £2.38 million this year and given a commitment to ensure it will work.  We know that will cost money, but it will be provided to ensure we will have the best possible authority.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Committee Stage debate and thank all those outside the House who assisted us in our work on the Bill and the Department officials for their help in preparing it.  I pay tribute to the fine work done on the scientific aspects of this matter by Teagasc, the farm organisations and farmers who have supported the concept of this authority.  They know their future depends on good quality and safety in food.  We export more than 80 per cent of our produce and it is important we get this right.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth occasion the House has considered this issue since we announced last month that the Government had decided to proceed with a larger and more ambitious light rail project comprising a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station, based on the CIE preferred surface alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street, and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport, using the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused railway alignments and with an underground section in the city centre.</P>
      <P>In the intervening period there has been widespread welcome for the Government's decision from many sections of the community and from members of parties in this House.  There has been particular support for the wisdom of the Government in looking to the long term while at the same time ensuring there would be the earliest possible progress on the construction of a substantial proportion of the surface system already designed by CIE.</P>
      <P>People have also welcomed the more integrated approach which the Government took by providing for links to Dublin Airport and Connolly Station.  The key message I have been getting from people, whether they agree or disagree with the Government's decision, is to get on with the job.  With that objective in mind, the Government set the CIE Light Rail Project Team the task of proceeding without delay with the construction of the Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.</P>
      <P>Last month I provided a preliminary estimate of the timescales involved in implementing the Government's objective and it is useful to recap briefly.  The objective is to begin construction work on the light rail network early in 2000.  Completion of the Tallaght to Abbey Street section and the extension to Connolly Station is envisaged by the winter of 2002.  The line from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green should be completed by the summer of 2003.  Those target dates are subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary statutory procedures and to the necessary technical evaluations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government's decision, the CIE project team took legal advice on the most appropriate way to deal with the existing formal applications <Col N="1421" /> which have been submitted for light railway orders.  The conclusion was that the speediest way forward for the project would be to withdraw the existing applications and to quickly submit fresh applications which take account of the revised situation arising from the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>I agree with that assessment and I am pleased to say the CIE board passed the formal resolution, which I mentioned during yesterday's Question Time, deciding that the current applications be withdrawn and that new applications for light railway orders be made.  I got a fax on that yesterday and a formal letter on it today. CIE formally communicated its decision to me today.  I will now advise the inspector of its decision and formally withdraw his inquiry mandate. I know I said yesterday that I do not get in contact with judges, but I have formally written to the judge today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be described as a U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a massive one.  I hope, <i>pro bono publico,</i> he will be able to agree to it.  CIE will write to all those whom it served with formal notices when the original applications were lodged.  It will also publish press notices informing the general public of the revised position. My Department will advise all those who made formal representations to me or the Department.</P>
      <P>CIE will make a new application in respect of the Tallaght to Abbey Street line during the summer and for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green section before the end of the year.  The application for the Abbey Street to Connolly Station section will be made next year in good time to enable the Tallaght to Connolly Station line to be completed as a single project.</P>
      <P>In parallel with this process, I have asked CIE to proceed quickly with design and planning work on the St. Stephen's Green to Dublin Airport route.  As some work has already been undertaken on the planning and design of a route to Ballymun, CIE expects to be in a position to commence public consultation on the BroadstoneBallymun-Dublin Airport section later this year. That consultation will invite views on the broad route options and I encourage people to participate fully in this process, as no doubt they will.</P>
      <P>CIE will also go to tender in the next few days, I understand, to recruit consultants to undertake the detailed technical evaluation of the underground section from Broadstone to St. Stephen's Green.  The physical evaluation work necessary, such as the drilling of trial boreholes, is expected to get under way early in 1999 and will take about nine months to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed results of this technical evaluation will provide the information necessary to determine the specification for the underground section.  That will help to decide the precise route of the tunnel, the required gradients and the number and location of stations.  It will also assist <Col N="1422" /> in determining a firm cost estimate for construction and, subject to the relevant statutory procedures, the likely implementation timetable for the underground section.</P>
    <P>Sufficient provision has been made in the Vote of my Department, without requiring a Supplementary Estimate in that regard, to fund the planning and design work in 1998 and my Department had already sought expenditure projections from CIE for future years.  I repeat my assurance to the House that appropriate funding arrangements will be put in place to deliver on the Government's commitment to this project.  As is the usual practice, the precise funding commitments for the project will be addressed as part of the normal budgetary process when the Government is preparing its annual public capital programme. The light rail project will also be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion funding.</P>
    <P>The possibility of private financing for infrastructural projects, including the light rail project, is being addressed by the Department of Finance. An interdepartmental group has now been set up to develop criteria for and advise the Minister for Finance on the potential contribution of public-private partnership mechanisms to meeting future infrastructural investment needs.</P>
    <P>The possibility of private financing for infrastructural projects, including the light rail project, is being addressed by the Department of Finance. An interdepartmental group has now been set up to develop criteria for and advise the Minister for Finance on the potential contribution of public-private partnership mechanisms to meeting future infrastructural investment needs.  That group is expected to make an initial report to the Minister for Finance by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework monitoring committee will take decisions on the decommital and reallocation of Structural Fund assistance for the light rail project later this month, on 25 or 26 June.  Some time ago my Department asked CIE to carry out reviews of public transport investment requirements across all the sectors. This meant that at the time of the Government decision, my Department and CIE were readily in a position to identify a range of potentially suitable public transport projects which could be contractually committed by the end of 1999 and on which work could be completed by 2001.</P>
    <P>Since the Government decision there have been regular ongoing contacts at official level between my Department, the Department of Finance and the European Commission in relation to this matter.  Senior officials of my Department have already been to Brussels to brief the Commission on the enhanced light rail project and to provide information on possible alternative public transport projects for EU assistance.  I am confident that the twin aims of ensuring that Ireland does not lose EU funding and that a reasonable proportion of the Luas aid will be reallocated to <Col N="1423" /> other public transport projects will be shortly realised.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a realistic and farsighted decision to deal with the major issues which dogged the light rail project for so long, namely those of passenger capacity and disruption during construction.  It has also set out a clear strategy for making parallel progress on the various elements of the project with a clear objective of starting construction early in 2000.</P>
    <P>There is widespread support for the plan.  It will deliver an integrated system which will finally provide a direct link between Heuston and Connolly Stations and a direct interchange between the light rail, DART and suburban rail systems at Connolly Station.  Dublin Airport and Busaras will also be directly served by the new light rail network.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, we now need to focus all our energies on delivering the light rail network to the citizens of Dublin who wish to use it. However, it is also important to acknowledge that this project on its own will not solve Dublin's transport problems.  There is also a need to progress the other major infrastructural projects.  We need to complete the quality bus corridor network as quickly as possible.  Dublin Corporation's traffic management proposals must be implemented and the DTO is putting the finishing touches to a short-term action plan which I hope will re-energise the rest of the DTI strategy in the same way as the Government decision has done for the light rail project.  I understand it will suggest measures to improve the capacity and quality of the public transport system as well as traffic, parking and demand management proposals. I hope all Members, regardless of party affiliation, can work together to make Dublin a more accessible city.</P>

How far into the future will the revised and enhanced Luas proposal be operational?  How much will it cost?  How will it fare under the competitive public capital projects programme?  How will it fare under successive Governments?  My primary criticism <Col N="1424" /> is that the Minister is unable to answer these questions.</P>
      <P>It transpires from the Minister's reply yesterday to my question about whether the design expenditure would be refunded to the Commission that the EU committed £12 million of aid for design work on the previous Luas project.  The Minister said yesterday that on this basis the EU has been asked to confirm that the expenditure continues to be eligible for assistance.  She also said a decision is expected shortly.  We do not know if a miffed Commission will want the money back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious issue for the taxpayer. The Minister said a decision is expected shortly. This means it could go either way.</P>
      <P>The most incredible aspect of the Government decision is the fact that no geological work has been carried out and we do not know if there will be a massive hole in St. Stephen's Green.  We do not know if the Luas will come up to the surface on O'Connell Street before it goes underground again and re-emerges at Broadstone.  The Minister said yesterday that CIE will shortly go to tender to recruit consultants to undertake the detailed technical evaluation of the underground section.  This study should have been done before the Government made a decision.</P>
      <P>The time to commission consultants to undertake detailed technical evaluations, which will confirm whether it will be necessary to bore into sand, silt or rock, was before a decision was made. We do not know what will be found underground. If it emerges that the tunnel will cost £500 million to construct, where lies the Government decision?  For example, if the cost is prohibitive, will it mean that all bets are off?  We will not know where we stand until the study is completed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has ducked and dived regarding the public inquiry.  She intends to write to Judge Seán O'Leary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sold the plan on the basis that the Luas would be extended to Swords, Finglas, <Col N="1425" /> Cabinteely, Clondalkin and the docklands. However, it transpires that the Government decision on 5 May includes no commitment to those spurs.  What is the position?  The key selling point of a bigger, better, brighter Luas is not part of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>Regarding the original blueprint and the £220 million that was available for the project, what will happen to the £114 million of EU funds?  The Minister mentioned other transport projects and the House has called for the reallocation of the money to quality bus corridors, mainline rail services and other projects in Dublin.  Can the Minister confirm it is a Government decision to reallocate the funds in that way?  What is the position?</P>
    <P>The real Government decision is to defer street disruption.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, the <i>Sunday Times</i> asked what communications took place after 21 May between the Atkins team and the Secretary General of the Department.  I have a copy of a fax sent by the Secretary General, Mr. John Loughrey, to Mr. Richard Cuthbert.  It states: &ldquo;Following our telephone conversation this morning, I have set out a number of comments which you might usefully take on board in finalising your draft summary.&rdquo; We do not know what doctoring of the Atkins report took place. The fax also states: &ldquo;The impact which either a surface or underground option will have in terms of disruption needs to be clearly brought out in the summary.&rdquo; I intend to return to this matter during the time available for questions later.  The £400 million plus will have been squared by the time this matter is over.</P>

However, given that many public transport issues are unresolved, the Government's handling of the Luas project has been disastrous.

      <P>Given the Government's record and the recommendations for the taxi industry, I hope the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, will allow the matter to proceed. Those who are entitled to make decisions should be allowed to do so without interference from the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It was wrong of the Minister to mislead the public with her timetable, which is unachievable, unrealistic and intended to deceive.  It was wrong to describe the new Luas plan as an integrated approach.  It has proved not to be integrated, and it has proved impossible to bring Luas to Connolly Station while serving the docklands at the same time.  It is obvious that it will take ten to 15 years if it ever gets under way, to begin construction of the tunnel or black hole referred to by my colleague.  As planning gets under way for this project, more and more problems and unresolved issues will present themselves.</P>
      <P>The Tallaght line can go ahead if the political will is there and perhaps we will see the line to the airport in the future.  However, I do not doubt that in future Deputies will debate why it was decided to bring millions of tourists to Broadstone and will wonder how those tourists might be brought to somewhere they might like to go.</P>
      <P>The hugely problematic construction of the Harcourt Street line while we still subscribe to the myth of the tunnel being built is a more immediate issue.  Only the Minister can change this myth by admitting that the tunnel is at best a long-term proposal.  If the Minister allows the current situation to persist, we will find in two or three years that it is environmentally unacceptable to dig a tunnel from Stephen's Green.  It will be pushed out to the suburbs and we will be back to the drawing board with the Harcourt Street line.  That situation can be saved by the Minister having the courage to say that we will probably never build the tunnel and that we should get on with what we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Luas project has lost £114 million, and every Deputy and councillor in Ireland has a plan for it.  However, there is no justification for spending that money on anything other than public transport in Dublin.  Even if all aspects of the DTI strategy were in place, which they clearly are not, a huge deficit in the provision of public transport has emerged.  This deficit must be addressed as possibly the single most important issue facing the economy and quality of life in Dublin, particularly in the suburbs where traffic congestion is now insupportable.  The Minister, who is responsible for transport, must make those changes.  I must also make a plea for Dublin Bus, which requires a massive investment in its fleet and a subvention to render its increased capacity viable in off-peak hours.  We need more buses and more <Col N="1427" /> routes, particularly orbital routes to account for changed travel patterns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  The provision of a high quality light rail system for Dublin is essential.  The city cannot now cope with the volume of traffic flooding into it every day.  The resulting gridlock and traffic mayhem costs the city millions of pounds every year in environmental, social and economic terms.  It cannot be allowed to continue, and the ultimate responsibility for resolving this crisis rests with the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a tragedy for Dublin that the Government is not prepared to implement the existing plans for light rail.  These plans, and a large amount of preparatory work that went into their formulation, have been cast aside by this Minister and Government.  This was done at the behest of the coalition partners and the large vested commercial interests in the city.  The light rail plan scrapped by the Minister would have provided Dublin with an efficient light rail system, and every expert who has examined the project has said it was the best option.  It would have reduced the gridlock that currently strangles the city and would have reduced the chronic pollution that is mostly caused by exhaust fumes which is a serious cause for concern and a threat to public health. The Minister decided to jettison these concrete proposals and replace them with mere aspiration &mdash; a wish list cobbled together in four days in opposition to the views of every expert who examined the issue.  She has even ignored the advice of the consultants she charged with compiling an independent report, and has failed to honour numerous commitments to honour that report.</P>
      <P>On 12 November 1997, the Minister said in the Dáil:</P>
      <P>Regardless of the outcome of the consultancy study, we will engage in the project recommended by it.</P>
      <P>On 16 December 1997, she said:</P>
      <P>I have made it as plain as I can.  If the study concludes in favour of the overground option, tight as the timetable may be the money earmarked for Luas will go to Luas.</P>
      <P>During an adjournment debate on the matter on 30 September 1997, she said:</P>
      <P>Whatever is the result of the independent consultants' report, I will go at it hell for leather and it will be implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister has attempted to sell the people of Dublin a non-existent plan to replace the concrete proposals by the previous Government and which the CIE's light rail project team proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claims that her light rail plans are a victory for imagination and vision.  I am impressed that she keeps a straight face when <Col N="1428" /> making these outrageous claims, as nothing could be further from the truth.  Her plans are a victory for those who are opposed to public transport and for those who feel the historic fabric of Dublin should be sacrificed to accommodate car owners at every turn.  This is a disgraceful way to appease a small number of vested interests which the Government and this Minister will not discommode.</P>
    <P>The loss to Dublin and taxpayers arising from the Minister's decision is enormous.  She spent £200,000 of taxpayers' money engaging consultants and effectively binned their report when it did not produce the result she wanted.  However, this is only the start of her cavalier attitude to taxpayers' money.  She has also put at risk the £12 million in EU aid already invested in the planning and design of the original Luas proposal.  The Minister stated yesterday that the EU Commission will soon come to a decision on the validity of this funding.  I am not a gambling man, but I bet the Commission will say that money cannot be spent on a project that will not be completed. The taxpayer will have to stump up to pay for the disastrous decision made on this issue. There is also £114 million in EU funding lost to Luas to be considered.  Despite pressing the Minister on this issue in recent weeks, we still do not know if this funding can be salvaged.  Even if it can be salvaged at this late date, we do not know if the Minister intends investing the money in measures specifically designed to relieve Dublin's chronic traffic and public transport problems.  In common with her attitude to this whole affair, she is short on details and answers.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government and this Minister do not know what they are doing with regard to the light rail question. Their grand plan is no more than a fig leaf to cover their inaction.  The Government has no intention of completing that grand plan and it will continue to procrastinate and delay until the public becomes convinced that the light rail proposal will never be implemented and the entire concept can be quietly dropped.</P>
    <P>The Government does not really intend to construct a light rail system.  That has been confirmed by the decision of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to promote the construction of quality bus corridors along the proposed light rail route.  Surely there is no need to provide bus corridors on these routes if a light rail is to be put in place.  However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has indicated his intention to construct such corridors.</P>
    <P>Dublin cannot afford a dereliction of duty of this magnitude.  Every family in this city will be affected by the Minister's decision.  Gridlock will continue to paralyse the city, air quality will continue to decline and respiratory and other health problems will become more serious.  In addition, Dublin will continue to be a glorified car park and the interests of the city's inhabitants will continue to play second fiddle to the requirements of <Col N="1429" /> private motor cars.  Plans to enhance Dublin as a living city and an urban space designed and developed for its citizens will come to naught.</P>
    <P>If we are to proceed, there must be action on constructing a light rail system while studies are carried out into the proposed underground section of the Minister's route.  To salvage some credibility the Government must proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght-Connolly, Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green and, when the relevant procedures are complete, the Ballymun-Broadstone lines.  The geological and engineering studies required for the proposed underground section should proceed while this work is being done.  We cannot allow the entire light rail project to be deferred so that the Tánaiste's pet project can be endlessly investigated.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who recently wrote letters to a number of newspapers on this matter &mdash; she could have spoken in the House just as easily &mdash; take note that I am in favour of the parts of the light rail system which have not been jettisoned proceeding as soon as possible?  I am at one with my colleague Ms Eithne Fitzgerald in that.</P>
    <P>The engineering difficulties in constructing the short tunnel proposed by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, are immense.  Her plan involves tunnelling from the relative height of Harcourt Street to a depth of 100 metres under the city until the line re-emerges at Broadstone. Therefore, people exiting the line at O'Connell Street would be obliged to climb 100 metres to the surface.  I have received professional advice that such a tunnel will have a rollercoaster effect on any train using the system and will pose serious implications for people's comfort and safety.  It should also be noted that the Atkins' report specifically outlined that the underground option would not serve the needs of people with disabilities.  The Minister's proposal must include measures that seek to rectify this serious problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the underground option proposed by the Minister will not be taken up.  I am further convinced that the Government has decided to scuttle the light rail project and <Col N="1430" /> replace it with a wish list of pious aspirations that it has no intention of putting into practice.  A plan, timescale or costing has not been provided and the Minister has no money because she has already given away the little she had in her possession. The Department of Finance must have been delighted with the Minister's nonsensical wish list which is merely designed to assuage the Tánaiste's wish to see the construction of a tunnel in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Given that we have been discussing a light rail system for Dublin for more than ten years and that a metre of rail has yet to be laid or a single tram acquired, it is not surprising that scepticism among the people of Dublin city and county has increased with increasing numbers doubting that the project will ever proceed. The bungling, delays, rejection of consultants' reports and U-turns that have been a feature of the Government's handling of the issue have increased public scepticism against the background of a traffic problem of such magnitude that it is no exaggeration to state that Dublin city and county are grinding to a halt.</P>
      <P>A month on from Government's decision to reject the consultants' report favouring the overground option, the Minister in reply to a question yesterday was unable to provide any further information on the cost of the Government's proposals other than that it will be £400 million plus. Whether that plus will be £10 million, £40 million or £400 million, the Minister is unable or unwilling to say.  Her reply also contained a series of target dates for commencing and completing a number of phases of the plan, which, based on previous experience and the fact that we are virtually starting from scratch, seem wildly optimistic. It is interesting that no dates were given for commencement or completion of the northside elements of the plan.  The completion date for the Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green line, which is largely on-street and for which land is already available, is set at summer 2003, while the Tallaght-Abbey Street phase, which faces major onroad construction problems, is due to be finished six months earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if these wildly optimistic targets are met, it will still be the best part of five years before an operational light rail system is put in place in the <Col N="1431" /> city.  What is clear is that we cannot allow the traffic problem to continue to deteriorate until light rail becomes available.  Urgent remedial action is required.  While the Minister has been dithering week by week, the situation has been growing worse.  Traffic conditions which were once the norm for one hour at peak times in the morning and evening are now experienced throughout the day.  Even relatively short journeys at peak time are taking on epic proportions.</P>
    <P>The key to dealing with traffic problems in Dublin in the short term rests with the proper use of the £114 million of EU funding allocated to the Luas project which has now been lost to that project.  As the Minister stated, a decision on the reallocation of that money will be made later in the month.  There are many public transport projects in Dublin on which £114 million could usefully be spent.  There is a need to upgrade the Dublin-Maynooth rail line to service the growing population in that area and there is scope for improvement in DART services.  The building of quality bus corridors must be accelerated.  A provision of £10 million would pay for ten new routes.  Bus services will remain the only public transport option for the vast majority of Dublin people in the foreseeable future.  However, contrary to public perception, the level of subvention for Dublin Bus at approximately 3.8p per passenger journey remains one of the lowest for any city of similar size in Europe.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of the vehicles in the Dublin Bus fleet are clapped out, mechanically unreliable and unpleasant to travel in.  Just £30 million, less than the cost of constructing an underground station, would allow Dublin Bus to acquire approximately 175 new buses which would make a major difference to the quality of public transport in the city and county.  The combination of poor service, relatively high fares and chronic traffic problems is forcing increasing numbers of people to abandon public transport in favour of their cars.  This in turn worsens traffic problems, slows down bus services and inconveniences people with no alternative to public transport.</P>
    <P>The vicious circle must be broken.  The key to doing so rests with the £114 million originally allocated to Luas.  At Question Time, I intend to ask the Minister for the list of projects she indicated were identified by her Department and CIE as being suitable to receive funding from that £114 million and which she stated could be contractually committed by the end of 1999.  The £114 million must be spent on public transport in Dublin.  There is no point in spending it somewhere else because the traffic crisis exists in Dublin, which lost the £114 million because of the decision taken on Luas.  The £114 million should be spent in Dublin.  Any failure to do so will mean the Minister and the Government are turning their backs on the traffic chaos in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party is of the view that the on street option for Luas is preferable to the Minister's proposal in that it would secure EU funds and force radical change in city transport. It would have been a catalyst, even during the construction period, through park and ride facilities to address the traffic problems.  Such a catalyst is needed because people are not easily tempted from their cars.  We must face up to the necessary changes.</P>
      <P>It is sad that the plan before us, although high on aspiration, is low on cost and timeframe information. The tunnelling will be a bottomless pit from a financial perspective.  Three underground stations are planned and there is a question about where on St. Stephen's Green excavations will be carried out to build a station.  People need information on such matters if they are to accept the project.</P>
      <P>The cost issues are unresolved.  There are questions about security at underground stations to which people are entitled to answers.  We have had a discussion in the House previously on the geology issues and whether the underground option is feasible.  Nobody knows the answer and the issue condemns the project to continuing uncertainty.  There are also questions about the Finglas to Dublin Airport route.  Will it go through a cemetery?</P>
      <P>The £114 million of EU funds is a considerable sum and it should not be lost to Dublin.  I am concerned that the Minister has not given guarantees on spending the funds on transport in Dublin and I urge her to do so.  The operational programme for transport is road dominated with £1.655 billion to be spent on roads, £275 million on mainline rail and £356 million on other public transport projects.  In that context, £114 million is a large sum.  I urge the Minister to guarantee that it will be spent in Dublin because of the current congestion there.</P>
      <P>Many schools face great problems with school transport and the safety of routes to schools. Many children no longer make their way to school independently, thus forcing their parents to drive them to school.  It is an indication of the unsustainability and the lack of forethought of the Government's public transport policy.  Car dependence is bad economics.  The Minister should bear this in mind in the context of Government policy.  If we import cars and depend on them we lose money in the long-term and benefit foreign as opposed to domestic interests.</P>
      <P>With promises that have been made house prices will increase because people will expect the Luas to be built near them.  However, there will be no change.  It will exacerbate current problems.</P>

      <P>I am grateful.  The biggest gap in transport policy is that there is not a Minister with sole responsibility for transport matters.  It is a major problem that roads and related matters are not the responsibility of the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for other aspects of transport.  We are unique in the EU in this respect.  It should not be a surprise that there have been difficulties of co-ordination with transport. Responsibility for roads and related matters, including taxis and motor testing, which rests with the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be transferred to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>This is a crucial point in the context of the implementation of the Government's decision on Luas.  If one Minister does not have overall responsibility for these matters there will be continuing difficulty.  When I was Minister with responsibility for transport I made this proposal. However, the then Minister for the Environment resisted the proposals and was supported by the Minister for the Public Service.  It is a structural problem in Government which has added greatly to transport problems.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed tunnel from Harcourt Street to Broadstone, consideration should be given to including an underground road privately funded by way of tolls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; IMES &mdash; of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service.  At present search and rescue coverage on the east coast is provided by the Air Corps from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, using an Alouette III helicopter and crew of three, for daylight search and rescue operations.  The response time is 15 minutes from receipt of call.  Since 22 December 1996, a Dauphin helicopter and crew of four based at Baldonnel has been committed to night search and rescue operations to cover the east coast.  The response time from receipt of call is 45 minutes by night.  There is, of course, also an Air Corps operated search and rescue service located at Finner Camp, County Donegal, on 24 hour call.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing programme of development of search and rescue services, a civilian operated medium-load carrying search and rescue helicopter will be provided on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998.  It had been intended that the service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved.  This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers has meant that the Air Corps is currently not in a position to provide pilots for the new east coast service.  Provision is, however, being made in the contract for the provision of the civilian operated service for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date.  It has been <Col N="1435" /> decided that the service will operate initially from Dublin airport with the option of relocating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the commencement of the new service on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998, the search and rescue service currently provided by the Air Corps at Baldonnel will be relocated to the south-east coast.  This service, which will initially be restricted to daylight hours, utilising an Alouette helicopter, will be based in Waterford.  It is intended to upgrade this service to a 24 hour one, using a Dauphin helicopter, at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the search and rescue service currently provided from Baldonnel, there has been no curtailment of service in recent times due to a lack of flying officers.  However, due to unforeseen shortages of winch crew, caused by departures to civilian employment, illness and leave the east coast service was curtailed on eight occasions between 13 April and 24 April 1998. IMES was kept informed of the position at all times in order that cover might be provided from other sources such as the Shannon-based marine emergency helicopter service.</P>
    <P>Because of the current upturn in the civil aviation industry and resulting attractive financial packages available, the number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire has risen considerably in recent times and this impacted on the ability of the Air Corps to provide pilots for the new east coast service.  As a result of prevailing market forces, I introduced last year a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots.  This scheme, with the ongoing training of pilots and winch crews as well as the annual recruitment of Air Corps cadets is intended to ensure a continuing supply of well trained air crew for the Air Corps search and rescue service.</P>
    <P>A review of the Air Corps was recently carried out by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. Their report is at present being considered by the Efficiency Audit Group and it is expected that proposals will be brought to Government in the near future.  It is not possible to say at this stage what impact the review will have on the staffing and funding of the Air Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he outline what he envisages for the Air Corps in terms of providing an east coast search and rescue service?  Has the Air Corps a role in that regard, particularly given that the tender has gone to a private company which will be located in Dublin airport?  Will the Air Corps be in a position to take over this task in three years' time?  I raise this matter because I am concerned about a number of developments which highlight the difficult position of the Air Corps.  Why is the service, which operated for 30 years from Baldonnel, being transferred to Dublin airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a shortage of personnel, the service was curtailed on eight occasions and there are difficulties with security duty allowances paid to <Col N="1436" /> staff.  In addition, the Government jet must use Dublin airport as opposed to Baldonnel because there are no crash rescue service personnel available there, particularly outside working hours, thus increasing the cost of that service &mdash; I understand it will cost about £2,000 extra every time the plane takes off and lands.  In the context of those points, does the Minister see a future for the Air Corps or is he presiding over its decline?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not presiding over the decline of the Air Corps although, as the Deputy rightly points out, I face a number of difficulties. In the course of the three year period concluding in 1998, 30 of our best and most experienced pilots will have retired.  Last year we found it necessary to introduce a service commitment scheme to see to what extent we could retain senior experienced people in the Air Corps to enable us to carry out all our functions and meet our obligations.  Of the 26 people to whom this scheme was offered, 12 have remained in the service, some for a three year period and others for a five year period.  That has helped greatly to consolidate our position.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when the emergency service will be manned from Baldonnel by Air Corps crew.  The service is being temporarily transferred to Dublin airport.  There are about 84 pilots in the Air Corps at present and there are seven cadets who will qualify in June of this year. Ongoing recruitment will continue.  If the picture were to remain as it is, with the civil aviation industry growing at a great rate and attractive packages for pilots, even with constant recruitment, there could be as many people leaving the service as coming in to be trained.  There are difficulties which must be overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces which was submitted to the Efficiency Audit Group in 1993.  Arising from this report, the Efficiency Audit Group made certain recommendations to the Government which were accepted in July 1995.  Following this, an implementation group was set up to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for the first three year phase of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  In February 1996 the Government accepted the Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98.  This plan, rather than the Price Waterhouse report, is setting the agenda for the ongoing Defence Forces reorganisation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation plan provides for a study of military accommodation to be undertaken <Col N="1437" /> towards the end of phase one.  This is a very sensitive issue and one which will need careful study from a number of perspectives.  In particular, full account will have to be taken of the economic and social issues involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage is the review?  Has the Department decided the areas that will come under the criteria for barracks closures?  I spoke to numerous Army personnel and representative bodies who are concerned that reorganisation of the Defence Forces depends on finances that accrue from barracks closures.  They believe that for political reasons barracks will not be closed and, therefore, reorganisation of the Defence Forces will be neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this matter.  We are trying to ensure the review of the total accommodation portfolio is completed quickly.  A significant percentage of personnel is engaged in administration while there is not a sufficient number in other posts.  The Price Waterhouse study concluded that there are too many barracks, many unsuitably located for military needs and many in very poor condition with unacceptably high upkeep costs.  It also concluded that barracks management and administration takes up an unduly large element of military manpower who should be on operational duties.</P>
      <P>This is a sensitive and difficult matter.  As the numbers have reduced, the pressures on existing numbers have become more intense and we must consider a sensible course of action.  As soon as the review is completed I will return to the Dáil with proposals on the matter.  As I stated publicly last week in my tour of northern counties, we cannot maintain everything we have forever.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree the figures show that the strength <Col N="1438" /> of the last two battalions dropped by approximately ten in each case on the previous two battalions and that this indicates we cannot fulfil our current commitment to overseas duties?  In reply to a matter raised by Deputy Wall on the Adjournment on 26 May the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children stated, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, that there is no official position on the possibility of FCA personnel serving overseas.  However, an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that the chief of staff said he would prefer to use FCA personnel rather than contract civilian personnel. Is this a scare tactic or are there proposals to use FCA personnel overseas?  Is recruitment of civilian personnel in the paramedics area being considered? What are the Minister's views on this? Recruitment and allowances are the main difficulties with personnel serving overseas.  The concept of getting a replacement force for current personnel is not acceptable.  It would be akin to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recruiting a reserve Garda force in the current circumstances rather than addressing the problem in the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 98 of the 82nd Infantry Battalion applied to return and it was agreed that 58 of them should return on the present contingent.  That is an indication of the numbers that are anxious to continue serving overseas.  We have been serving in south Lebanon for more than 20 years and some personnel have returned on several occasions.  Repatriation frequently takes place for urgent domestic reasons and we must provide counselling services and so on.  We are running close to the wire and that is why we are examining what needs to be done to ensure we have the necessary specialist services to fulfil our obligations to the UN in south Lebanon at a time when there are neither sufficient volunteers nor personnel in the Permanent Defence Force.  Discussions are taking place, but I have not received any proposals regarding FCA personnel serving overseas.  When I do, I will give them due consideration.  We are at the preliminary stages of planning for developments we envisage might take place in the next few years. We do not perceive a problem in fulfilling our mandate in the next few years, but if we are to remain in south Lebanon for a prolonged period, we must ensure the necessary personnel are available and provide the necessary training and support services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The report which I have received from the military authorities concerning this matter indicates the following sequence of events.  On 26 May 1998, 11 De Facto Force personnel on foot and three in a jeep came to AT-TIRI crossroads from AT-TIRI and Haddathah compounds.  Shortly afterwards two mortar rounds were fired from an unknown location to a position 100 metres south west of an IRISHBATT position.  During the day armed elements fired a total of 61 x mortar rounds, 60 x anti-aircraft rounds, 1 x missile and 350 rounds of heavy machine gun-light machine gun fire towards De Facto Force compounds as well as towards a helicopter in the vicinity of Haddathah compound.  As a result of this fire the Israeli Defence Force-Israeli Air Force as well as De Facto Forces retaliated with a heavy bombardment using mortar, tank rounds, heli rockets and an aerial bomb resulting in 12 firings close to IRISHBATT positions.</P>
      <P>Apart from certain personnel who were required to undertake necessary observing and monitoring duties, all personnel were in secure bunkers during the firing.  There were no injuries to IRISHBATT personnel or damage to locations or equipment.  During the shelling IRISHBATT evacuated children from Tibnin school by armoured personnel carrier to the IRISHBATT area.  IRISHBATT post 6-44 at AT-TIRI confirmed that one De Facto Force casualty was removed by ambulance from AT-TIRI village and IRISHBATT post 6-40c at AL YATUN reported that one armed element body was removed from a house in the vicinity of the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the following morning armed elements <Col N="1440" /> fired 13 mortar rounds towards Haddathah.  During this firing one mortar round from the general area of Haddathah school impacted within five to ten metres of the transport billet at IRISHBATT position 6-38 at Haddathah.  The round impacted on an earth mound which absorbed the impact. There were no injuries to IRISHBATT personnel who were in secure bunkers during the firing.  The circumstances of these firings were reported by IRISHBATT to UNIFIL headquarters which in turn has initiated protests to the Israeli and Lebanese authorities through the usual UNIFIL liaison channels.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the safety of Irish troops in their execution of the UNIFIL mandate, it is obviously not possible to give absolute guarantees as to their safety.  I can, however, give an assurance that none of the troops is exposed to any unnecessary risks and all possible precautions are taken to ensure their safety.  The Irish Battalion has specially designed secure bunkers in each of its positions and personnel move to these bunkers in the event of impending attacks.  Some personnel remain in secure observation posts during these attacks to ensure the necessary observation and monitoring of activities in their area continues.  Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved.</P>
    <P>Our troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for them consistent with the carrying out of their mission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a detailed reply, particularly in regard to the action that took place on the day in question.  I am more concerned about the facilities available to our Defence Forces in the Lebanon.  Is he confident they meet the necessary criteria to deal with such attacks and the shells that do not explode at the time?  According to media reports our troops came under exceptionally heavy fire on the date in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may not be true to say they came under very heavy fire, they were certainly close to a great deal of action.  We objected in the strongest possible terms to the Lebanese and Israeli authorities about this.  The accommodation and bunkers in the Lebanon are secure. The safety of Irish troops is of paramount importance to me, the Government and all other Members.  Like the previous Administration, we are continuing to upgrade equipment to provide the best possible safeguard in all circumstances. However, it is not possible to guarantee in every situation and it must be kept under review in the context of our obligations to the UN in a case by case examination of where we go.  Everything possible will be done to make sure resources are <Col N="1441" /> available for the highest level of protection for our troops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to media reports that the Norwegian Army is considering withdrawal of its troops from the Lebanon.  Given that they have worked with Irish troops for the past 20 years, what effect will that have on our policy in the area?  Is there a connection between both armies in the Lebanon and what effect will it have on our troops?</P>

      <P>We gave a commitment which has been given over the years to continue serving the UN mandate in south Lebanon until the security situation, international peace and the withdrawal of Israeli forces is resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.  There is no question of any interference with that mandate, notwithstanding what other countries might decide.  We are very proud of our 20 years' service and there have been many positive developments in the provision of new infrastructure and the return of life to normal in general.  Incidents, however serious, have reduced over recent years and we want to see that continuing.  However, we will welcome the day when we can leave south Lebanon and the people of that country have a peaceful solution to their problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 16, 30, 39, 46, 68, 72, 77, 89 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in Ireland.  Search and rescue coverage on the east coast is provided by the Air Corps from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, using an Alouette III helicopter and crew of three, for daylight search and rescue operations.  The response time is 15 minutes from receipt of call.  Since 22 December 1996, a Dauphin helicopter and crew of four based at Baldonnel has been committed to night search and rescue operations to cover the east coast.  The response time from receipt of call is 45 minutes by night.  There is also an Air Corps operated search and rescue service located at Finner Camp, County Donegal on 24 hour call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of an ongoing programme of development of search and rescue services in this country, a civilian operated medium load carrying search and rescue helicopter will be provided on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998.  It had been intended that the service would be crewed by Air <Col N="1443" /> Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military air base had been resolved.  This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority.  The recent high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers has, however, meant that the Air Corps is currently not in a position to provide pilots for the new east coast service.  Provision is, however, being made in the contract for the provision of the civilian operated service for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date.  It has been decided that the service will operate initially from Dublin Airport with the option of relocating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the commencement of the new service on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998, the search and rescue service currently provided by the Air Corps at Baldonnel will be relocated to the south east coast.  This service, which will initially be restricted to daylight hours, utilising an Alouette helicopter, will be based in Waterford.  It is intended to upgrade this service to a 24 hour one using a Dauphin helicopter at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the search and rescue service currently provided from Baldonnel, there has been no curtailment of service in recent times due to a lack of flying officers.  However, due to unforeseen shortages of winch crew, caused by departures to civilian employment, illness and leave, the east coast service was curtailed on eight occasions between April 13 and April 24, 1998. The IMES was kept informed of the position at all times in order that cover might be provided from other sources such as the Shannon based marine emergency helicopter service.</P>
    <P>Because of the current upturn in the civil aviation industry and resulting attractive financial packages available, the number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire has risen considerably in recent times and, as I mentioned earlier, this impacted on the ability of the Air Corps to provide pilots for the new east coast service.  As a result of prevailing market forces, I introduced a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots last year.  This scheme, with the ongoing training of pilots and winch crews as well as the annual recruitment of Air Corps cadets, is intended to ensure a continuing supply of well trained air crew for the Air Corps search and rescue service.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the review of the Air Corps which was recently carried out by Price Waterhouse management consultants.  Their report is being considered by the efficiency audit group and it is expected that proposals will be brought to Government in the near future.  It is not possible to say at this stage what impact the review will have on the staffing and funding of the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the protection of our fisheries, I presume that the reference is to <Col N="1444" /> the recent allegations of harassment of Irish fishing vessels off the south west coast.  In this regard my colleague the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and I recently discussed putting in place new arrangements to ensure a swift response to such incidents.  I will also be dealing with this matter in my reply to Question No. 75 tabled by Deputy McGrath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the move from Baldonnel to Dublin airport to provide this service. What are the reasons for that?  It is a bad precedent to move the service from Baldonnel where the Air Corps is based and which has given 30 years' service to search and rescue.  Why did it have to move to Dublin Airport?  Does the Minister accept there has been a failure to invest in equipment and personnel?  Will he consider investing in aircraft for the Air Corps so that it can take back this work from the private company contracted to do it over the next three years?  It is a catch 22 because pilots are leaving while, on the other hand, there has been no investment in personnel and equipment to encourage pilots to stay and believe in the future of the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>That is the challenge faced by the Minister and in that context could legislation have been introduced, for example, to ensure civilian aircraft could use Baldonnel?  Why were the aeroplanes not registered as military aircraft?  Would that have been another way out of this problem?  Did the Minister make efforts to ensure the service remained in Baldonnel with the Air Corps providing it as opposed to the move to a private company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of constraints. I am not the only Minister responsible for matters pertaining to Baldonnel and aircraft activity.  Obviously, the Minister for Public Enterprise is also involved.  Discussions are taking place between the two Departments on how soon the service could be facilitated at Baldonnel Aerodrome and I will welcome that development the day it is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that the problem is caused by the purchase of additional aircraft.  We had problems in having sufficient numbers of qualified and senior pilots to fly the aircraft we have.  The east coast service is provided by the Air Corps. Because we are also obliged to provide an all year round day and night emergency service throughout the coastline the move to Waterford has required the numbers we have to transfer there and we are trying to provide accommodation for them at that facility.  It was a reluctant decision to divide in a circumstance where we were not able to fulfil all our commitments from our own resources in the Air Corps and a civilian requirement developed.  I will work in conjunction with my colleague to get around the problems that surround the question of moving civilian aircraft in a military zone.  As soon as this can be resolved, <Col N="1445" /> the question of relocating back to Baldonnel will be considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a deeper question in regard to the purchase of aircraft.  Significant recommendations will emerge in the review of the Air Corps about the provision of funds for upgrading aircraft and the purchase of new aircraft which must be considered in the context of the resources available over the longer term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My worry is that by the time the Price Waterhouse report is published on the future of the Air Corps, it will have suffered such terminal problems the Minister will not be in a position to implement its recommendations. When will he publish the report?  The Air Corps is under pressure in all its services.  It is struggling to meet its commitment on fishery protection and service to Government.  The service has been suspended on eight occasions in recent weeks.  It is a crisis for the Air Corps.  What action is the Minister taking or is he presiding over the decline and death of the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 990 personnel are employed in Baldonnel.  It is a significant industry, with highly trained, qualified people dedicated to staying on and working with us into the future.  There are a number of training schemes in place.  We need to increase the number of winch crews and examination of how that will be achieved is under way.  The review is with the efficiency audit group and will be published later this month.  I am anxious to see it published and discussed.  There is no need for people to be downhearted as everything possible is being done.  We have a service commitment scheme to retain pilots and almost 1,000 are working actively on different operations.  There are 84 pilots with seven new cadets joining this month.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's inference with regard to the Navy, she will be aware that in 1996 there were 20 new recruits with 80 in 1997 and at least 50 this year.  At the same time people are leaving because many attractive opportunities are being taken up.  It is a sign of the times that people have options that they never had before to take up different occupations.  We should not deny that these have created pressures for us but we are working as hard as we can to overcome the difficulties and maintain the emergency services to the extent we can.  Where we are not able to do so we are calling on civilian operations and if we are ultimately able to man them we hope to take control of them in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that he is restating his commitment to put the Air Corps's house in order?  Some privately owned executive aircraft use Baldonnel on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, upon the payment of a fee and the production of the necessary insurance indemnity. The Minister's immediate predecessor, Deputy Andrews, stated last October that some small <Col N="1446" /> businesses in the area had expressed an interest in using the airport and he did not see any bar to this, providing certain agreements could be put in place.  Does the Minister agree with this policy? The former Minister also gave a commitment, in reply to a question from Deputy Deasy, to look at the viability of putting commercial traffic through Baldonnel and to report back to the Deputy. Deputy Andrews may have forgotten about this in his new Department but could the current Minister give a similar commitment?  Civilian and military airports operate successfully side by side in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a preliminary opportunity to digest components of that review.  I will have the full picture shortly and the review will go to Government and will be published.  To my knowledge the review does not touch on the civilianisation of the airport or alternative uses. However, I believe there are opportunities which should at least be examined and considered, in the context of the total resource and having regard to transport and other facilities in that area, including City West and other developments. These are matters which do not lie entirely within the remit of the Minister for Defence &mdash; there are questions concerning the overall management of aircraft and civil aviation which must also be decided.  I will listen to the views of others and examine proposals to see whether they meet certain criteria and how far they could be progressed.  As I said, I can go no further than that but I do not intend to put it completely out of the picture.  If we can provide other services, if we can be involved in economic activity and if Air Corps personnel can do a mixture of different activities, we should look at our total resources to see how we can manage them for the benefit of the community.  There could be exciting prospects for everyone concerned in the development of proposals of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the lack of training for Air Corps personnel, I have asked the Minister on previous occasions whether his Department has sought to train new recruits overseas to supplement training at home.  Has progress been made in that regard or can the Minister inform the House whether he intends in the short term to put in place such a plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, some training exercises are already carried out in France and other parts of Europe.  The position is so serious, in terms of the number of pilots leaving, that we must consider not only the options outlined by Deputy Wall but also every possible way to retain the people we have and to encourage others to assist us in manning the operations we must conduct.  I am open to any suggestions which can help us get over this difficulty, which has existed for a few years and is being aggravated by the availability of alternative, attractive packages in the civil aviation <Col N="1447" /> industry, of a type we had not experienced.  I could not ask the taxpayer to continue funding the preparation and training of highly skilled people who will immediately be attracted from the job we want them to do, so we must consider how to approach this problem with a longer-term perspective.  We provide many important services and cannot afford the luxury of an expensive training process, skills development, and aircraft training facilities if one third of our pilots either retire or leave for alternative employment within three years, which are the circumstances I have inherited.  It is not easy but we must look at every option and I am open to any suggestions made in this House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister withdrawn the proposal to change the terms of reference for cadets?  The Department acted without consultation &mdash; the booklet stated the terms of reference for Air Corps cadets were being changed and they would have to stay for a longer period. What is the status of that proposal?  I understand the Minister was taking advice from the Attorney General about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still awaiting that advice. This matter was considered in the context of new cadets going forward for training this year and in future years.  It has no impact on the existing pilots and people in the Air Corps and is one way of addressing the serious problem we face in terms of the numbers leaving.  There will be plenty of opportunity for discussion and consultation as to how this will pan out, we are not setting anything in stone at this stage.  In the context of these proposals and what I have said to the House, we are highlighting our difficulty in keeping people in the Air Corps for a reasonable period, consistent with the costs associated with the training, to enable us to carry out the functions we are asked to perform on behalf of the Government for emergency services, etc.</P>
      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We have to address the problem in a sensible, open-minded way, listening to the views of the various associations involved and reaching an agreement which will ultimately enable us to do the job we must do.  If we refuse to come forward with new initiatives to help us in this regard, we would not be providing a good service to the people.  We recognise the problems which have arisen in the past and have tried to cope with them through service commitments and other means but that does not seem to be enough, so we must further examine how to achieve our end result.  Everyone who has an interest in the Air Corps will know we could not continue to lose people in those numbers.  We could not run the services which the Deputy wants to return to Baldonnel because we did not have sufficient pilots or winch crews to meet our commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is striking that there have been two examples in today's questions of a lack of consultation with the people most involved. The Minister stressed the importance of consultation but two key decisions in recent times were made without any consultation.  The Air Corps feels it is not being consulted enough about the future of the service and perhaps further consultation would ensure that the solutions needed could be better achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My diary shows that I consult and meet people all the time but it is not possible in all circumstances to hold discussions about everything one does.  There is plenty of time and there will be ample opportunity for teasing out these proposals.  My experience in other ministries is that when hard decisions have to be taken people are not as amenable to negotiation as on some of the easier issues.  Sometimes the difficult decisions to move forward have to be taken in a lonely place.  I would welcome people who would come in and consult but I am prepared to take the hard decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins is a relatively new Member but there is a great deal of parliamentary experience in the Timmins household. He has touched on something which many of us have questioned, not only in the context of cadetship, but in a whole variety of ways.  We have a stranglehold on the use of language which is uninviting to many people whereas a simpler approach would suffice.  I will see to what extent we can become more modern at the end of this millennium in a way which takes account of the matters raised by the Deputy.  I will return to him with a more definite answer later.  The present application form stands for this year.  The interview process is already under way.  I will seek to make changes for the next tranche.  I want to make the application form more readable so that the Deputy can enjoy reading it and advise his constituents appropriately.</P>

      <P>The Milan missile was last fired in the Glen of Imaal ranges on 23 May 1995 when two rounds were fired.  In the period 1988 to 1998, 21 Milan missile rounds were fired in the Glen of Imaal ranges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I am not too experienced in firing these missiles I will rely on the note supplied to me.  The Milan is an infantry semi-automatic wire-guided anti-tank missile. The Milan system comes in two parts: the firing post and the ammunition tube.  The missile is fired from a firing post which contains the tracking and guidance system.  The missile, once launched, is then semi-automatically slaved on the target and corrective commands are automatically fed to the missile to keep it on its correct flight to the target.  The site has a simple pattern to indicate whether the target is within its range and the maximum range of the Milan missile is 2,000 metres.  In simple language, if it moves a little off course, there is an automatic adjustment to put it back on track.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9 December 1997 at Kilworth Firing Range, an accident occurred during firing practices with a 60mm light mortar.  During the exercise, which was being conducted by Defence Forces personnel <Col N="1450" /> of the Southern Command, an explosion occurred in the vicinity of the gun.  Five personnel were injured in this accident which resulted in their hospitalisation.  Private Laura Guerin suffered serious injury which resulted in the loss of her left hand.  Corporals McGrath and Dolan and Private O' Hare suffered abrasions and were discharged from hospital on 10 December having been detained overnight.  Private Dinan had no physical injury but was also detained overnight in hospital for observation.  Private Guerin has shown remarkable spirit and is back on duty.</P>
    <P>A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident and its deliberations are on-going.  The court of inquiry will encompass the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing but live firing for training purposes has ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations.</P>
    <P>Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during this exercise.  These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills.</P>
    <P>Should the findings of the court of inquiry indicate that any changes are called for in the interests of safety, these will be implemented.</P>

      <P>The military police investigation is completed but the technical board of inquiry has not yet completed its investigation.  Before the court of inquiry can complete its work it needs the two reports: one is available, the other is pending.  All the weapons used were tested within the previous month and found to be satisfactory. Obviously it will have to go deeper into the technical aspects to see what could possibly have gone wrong given that weapons were tested so close to the accident.  We want to know exactly what happened and we must ensure procedures are put in place to ensure a similar accident does not occur.  The report has taken longer than expected but, since we have not conducted that type of exercise since, we need to know the reason it happened and how we can ensure it does not happen again.  If it takes a little longer to get it right, for whatever technical reason, I am prepared to wait.</P>

Over the years we have had very few serious accidents but one is one too many.  We want to ensure they are totally eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 27 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At any one time there would generally be three or four vessels on patrol.  At present six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The question of manning levels for the Naval Service to enable it to fulfil its role is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  Some 80 recruits were enlisted in the Service in 1997 and 20 were enlisted on 5 May this year.  An additional 30 recruits will be enlisted shortly.  A competition to recruit ten watchkeeping officers to the executive branch of the Naval Service was advertised in March 1998 in the national press and in a number of relevant publications in Britain.  Interviews were held recently and it is proposed that a panel will be formed from which vacancies will be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past four years the Naval Service has been invited to participate in an annual exercise conducted by the United States Navy in the Baltic Sea.  We sent an observer in 1994, 1995 and 1997.  The Minister gave a commitment in a written reply on the occasion of the last Question Time, to send an observer in 1998.  I understand there was also a request for a vessel in 1997 and 1998 which we did not get.  Has there been a request for a vessel in 1999?  Operational commitments permitting, will he look at the request in a favourable light?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Deputy's supplementary does not deal specifically with this question, my recollection is that that request was made and, for operational reasons, we have been unable to comply with it.  Such requests are often made, not only in the context the Deputy mentioned but in other circumstances also.  There are heavy demands on the Naval Service with great commitment from the people concerned.  The duties which have been added to the existing fishery surveillance in the context of drug interdiction, etc.  means that we are stretched to the limit. We have a slight reduction in overall numbers notwithstanding the recruits that have been added to the service in the past number of years. It is an ongoing effort to ensure we can man all our vessels.  We would have great difficulty in manning all of them at sea at the same time, as the Deputy knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug abuse continues to be a major problem in Dublin, and I am sure that is the case throughout the country.  Preventing the importation of drugs by sea is a challenge for our Naval Service which was involved in five operations in l996 with the assistance of the Garda and the customs authorities; the Minister was unable to give me the numbers for l997 and l998. Does the Navy have the resources to tackle drug smuggling effectively given the enormous potential around our coastline for such episodes to occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt there is an international dimension to the way drugs are transported.  The view taken some years ago that Ireland was vulnerable in that regard has added to the overall awareness in a number of authorities of what we have to do.  We are not directly responsible in this area.  We operate in close concert with the Garda and other authorities and members have been lauded for some of the actions they have taken to support the general security services in drug interdiction.  I am always concerned to ensure that whatever support we give in this area is worthwhile.  It adds to the general tasks we have to perform but we have been successful in preventing drugs getting into the hands of people in our country.  Every effort must be made to ensure we do everything possible in that regard and in the past few years we have been extremely successful in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken any steps to devolve the administration back to the Naval Service and away from a more centralised administration? I know this is one of the key demands of the Naval Service.  Does the Minister envisage taking steps to ensure there is more local administration for the Naval Service of the tasks under its control and essentially of their own jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a systematic devolution of authority in a variety of areas throughout the Defence Forces as a whole, the <Col N="1453" /> Air Corps, the Navy and the Permanent Defence Force.  That is a welcome development.  A number of these devolved powers are currently being monitored and further areas are being examined in respect of decisions being taken without constant reference to the central control.  I would also look to the Price Waterhouse review and our determination of where we go in future, that as much autonomy as possible is released, but granting additional local autonomy carries with it the obligation to take some of the more difficult decisions at local level and I would be anxious to ensure that continues.  A remarkable transfer has taken place, without much ado, and people have responded positively at all levels.  I have had an opportunity to personally view these activities in accounting and other areas.  It is also necessary to release staff at central level to allow them to be involved in policy making and other major decisions that have to be taken.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is putting the question in the double negative.  Having regard to operational commitments and current numbers we would find it extremely difficult to accede to such a request but if it can be done, we will do it. We are in the business of presenting ourselves to the world as a committed, able force.  I am in favour of availing of opportunities to show off our wares in public to the international community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 23, 41, 55, 61, 65, 88 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The average number of claims received per week since the beginning of 1998 is 79.  The total number of claims now outstanding is 11,112.</P>
      <P>I was heartened by yesterday's judgment by Mr. Justice Lavan in the High Court.  For some time the courts have been handicapped in the absence of an agreed basis for assessing hearing loss.  The court's acceptance, therefore, of the Green Book as a fair and reasonable system of measurement of hearing disability represents a very important landmark.</P>
      <P>While I accept this case is only one of many listed for hearing before the courts, a basis for removing Army hearing loss cases from the courts system now appears to be emerging.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make any further comment other than to say that my overriding consideration is the establishment of a compensation mechanism which is both fair to the taxpayer and to the individual claimant and in which transaction and legal costs are kept to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome the fact that the Green Book has been accepted by the courts.  Obviously we must wait and see whether this will be replicated in other court decisions or appealed to the Supreme Court.  The key issue now is to move ahead and, in fairness to taxpayers and individual claimants who have a right to justice, we must set up a variety of systems.  What is the Minister's timetable for setting up a compensation tribunal, an Army pensions board and a State claims agency?  These are three important elements in tackling what has been acknowledged by everybody here to be a difficult problem going back 30 or 40 years and which has the potential to make enormous claims on the Exchequer, while at the same time finding a solution that is fair to individuals who have suffered during their time in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Mr. Justice Lavan's judgment will form the basis for future judgments because grave consideration was given to all the matters in an exercise which went on in the High Court for over four days and on which a reserved judgment was given ten days later.  If that is now to be the norm, and the expectation is that claims <Col N="1455" /> are beginning to dry up somewhat, we are facing a bill for millions, and not billions, of pounds which is an enormous relief to all of us.  I said at the outset that I would be happy to establish an alternative mechanism when the quantum was reduced to realistic and affordable levels.  Should this test case become the norm, I will proceed immediately to ensure that an alternative mechanism is available.  I hope discussions can take place on the cases due to go before the courts next week with a view to settlement, thereby avoiding significant future legal costs associated with these claims.  I would not like to put a timescale on that because a number of issues need to be clarified and proper consideration given to them, but the alternative mechanisms will be in place for the autumn sessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if we have pulled back slightly from the doomsday scenario which we faced.  However, this will still cost money.  It may be unfair to ask the Minister to give an estimate at this stage, but could he give a rough estimate of the level of compensation?  Various figures have been trotted out over the past six months. These claims will have to be paid.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Wall, the Minister alluded to the real estate of the Department of Defence. Defence personnel numbers have been scaled down and will not require as much space as heretofore. Certain comments were attributed to the Minister on his tour of the Border counties <i>vis-a &mdash; vis</i> the cutback in equipment.  Which avenue would the Minister go down if he were faced with a choice of cutting back on the purchase of equipment or selling off some real estate?  For example, there are approximately 50 acres in Cathal Brugha barracks in the Rathmines area.  Would the Minister consider selling it?  It might realise £50 million on the market.  Could he use that money to pay the claims?  That is not as drastic a measure as it may sound because it might be better for everyone concerned, given cross city traffic, if certain barracks were located on the perimeter, for example in Gormanston or Baldonnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows where my answer would lie if I were given a choice in the current climate between the sale to advantage of saleable property and equipping the Defence Forces &mdash; I would immediately opt to sell surplus land at top prices.  The fact that Deputy Timmins has no bother in embarrassing Deputy Fitzgerald in terms of the constituency he chose for the first sale is of no real import here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question that that would be my answer.  It is difficult to put a figure on it.  Deputy Mitchell talked at one stage about £5.5 billion, which was always wrong and absurd. Realistically, however, one was talking about a <Col N="1456" /> doomsday scenario of certainly over £1 billion. We are now talking about substantially reduced figures, probably in the region of £150 million. Claims are still coming in.  A significant sum, however, must still be raised and it would be great if we could raise any part of it by disposing of some of the properties which Deputy Timmins mentioned.  However, I think the Deputy would have some difficulty in getting unanimous agreement in the Fine Gael Party to his recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not rise to the bait on this occasion.  The point has been well made that selling real estate should be considered at some point to raise money, which most reasonable people would accept.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the level to which the claims per week have reduced?  Did he give a figure for that in his initial reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which reached a peak of 135 in January.  The number of claims per week has almost halved since January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the evidence is that there has been a striking reduction from 135 earlier in the year to 79 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now much lower than 79 and is somewhere in the sixties.  The average up to now has been 79 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I always felt the numbers were being exaggerated and that it was quite unlikely all the people who had served in the Defence Forces would put in claims.  I am very pleased the numbers have come down.  The whole issue seems to be moving into a much more manageable scenario. Setting up the compensation board, a reformed Army pensions board and a State claims agency will form an important part of tackling the problem and making it more manageable and satisfactory for everyone concerned.</P>

I am beginning to prepare the ground for negotiations which would involve settling cases in which there is agreement.  That is the way to go <Col N="1457" /> forward, on the basis of the kind of quantum which emerged in this test case.  I want to indicate publicly and forcefully in the House that I see no reason to continue to be involved in the high legal costs associated with pursuing cases to court when we reach an acceptable quantum.</P>

      <P>A total of 20 personnel were repatriated from the 82nd Infantry Battalion UNIFIL &mdash; 12 on medical grounds, seven on compassionate grounds and one for domestic reasons.

      <P>It is my firm belief, as I have said on many occasions, that recruitment to the Defence Forces should be on a continuous basis rather than the stop-go approach of previous years.  Some 800 new recruits were enlisted in the Defence Forces in 1997.  In addition, a further 500 recruits will be enlisted in 1998.  A total of 300 new recruits were taken on in April and May, and there will be continuous intake to fill the allocation of 500 recruits.</P>
      <P>The overall numbers of personnel serving in the Defence Forces will be assessed in summer 1998.  If that assessment indicates further recruitment is required to ensure an overall strength of 11,500 at the end of 1998, that additional recruitment will take place immediately.  The upper age for recruitment has been reduced from 27 years to 21 years.  This measure, with the voluntary early retirement scheme, VER, will help to address the high age profile within the Defence Forces and, in turn, will have a positive impact on the levels of personnel volunteering for overseas service.</P>

      <P>I have had numerous representations in regard to the 5' 4" height requirement for women applicants to the Defence Forces, which is having a detrimental effect on the number of applicants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of consideration was given to my decision to reduce the height requirement.  We had an argument in the House a few months ago about whether the change was necessary because people felt there should be no real distinction.  My view was that there should be a distinction and that we should discriminate in favour of female recruits in terms of the height requirement.  However, I must have regard to certain considerations, although I know there is a disputed view about this.  I have seen the training exercises in the Glen of Imaal, in which the apparel which must be carried is of a substantial weight.  There is a medical view that there is the danger of injury in carrying such heavy material. It is something I will keep under constant review. I would not like to think that young girls anxious to join the Defence Forces who feel they have the physical capacity to withstand whatever pressures they encounter will have a difficulty because of this.</P>
      <P>I made this decision for this year and there will be no change.  I will consult more widely with the appropriate authorities to see to what extent a further change could be made if that is deemed necessary.  I am aware there is no such limit in other jurisdictions, but we must operate on the basis of what we consider to be the best way to proceed.  I will open the door to reconsidering the matter for the 1999 recruitment period.  If the Deputy is able to keep the applicants under age until then we can proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are old fashioned and outdated in our approach to this.  I encourage the Minister to look at this again and to perhaps take a guide from the British Army in the way it deals with this issue, where these requirements have been done away with.  It is now looking at overall levels of physical fitness and ability to do the job, whether male or female, rather than having any specific requirements for either sex.  That is probably the way to proceed.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any representations that have come directly from women's groups.  I took this initiative out of love for women generally.  Comparisons with other jurisdictions are difficult because there are many functions in other Defence Forces which women are <Col N="1459" /> not permitted to perform because of rules and regulations.  By contrast, in this country everybody is free to take up whatever position is available. There are no restrictions.  That may embody some curtailment with regard to the way we must approach matters as against other places.  I will look at the matter again.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, RACO and PDFORA operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme. It is accepted that such systems have traditionally been adversarial in nature and did not lend themselves easily to the management of change.  The Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness advocates building more open, co-operative processes on existing arrangements. Although the associations have not yet signed the Partnership 2000 agreement, I have asked the Secretary General of the Department to develop proposals on providing a forum in which, in the context of both the process of reorganisation of the Defence Forces and Partnership 2000, joint ownership of change can be achieved.  Such structures will complement the existing conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of engaging outside specialist assistance in this area is being considered in conjunction with the representative associations. Consideration is also being given to the partnership structures for RACO and PDFORA and I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of this process. In general I believe employment relationships can be very much improved by the acceptance by both sides that substantial support of each other is necessary to make progress.  Both sides must also accept that each has a legitimate role and interest in the organisation.  Such steps <Col N="1460" /> should lead to a higher level of mutual respect for and trust in each others positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a thorough meeting with RACO last week, during which a number of issues on the agenda were discussed, including the White Paper on Defence.  I indicated to RACO that I would invite submissions from the representative associations very soon.  A meeting has been arranged with PDFORA for next week to continue that process.  There will be other items on the agenda.  The invitation to these associations to submit their respective views on the White Paper and the future of the Defence Forces is imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that.  If there is to be effective change in the Defence Forces it is very important that the legislative structure is in place.  The changes in legislation necessary to drive the implementation plan have not yet been made.  When does the Minister expect this legislation to be in place so that the changes can proceed in a formal way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My application to the High Court for an adjournment resulted in the granting of a three week span during which, with the agreement of the Government and the unanimous support of the House, we were able to introduce legislation which underpinned the Green Book.  To some extent it cut across the other work, however, necessary.  The draft of the Defence Reorganisation Bill came to my office yesterday.  I will do everything I can to have it before the Government in its completed form very soon.  I know time is running out in terms of this Dáil session.  If the Bill is approved by the Government I may seek the co-operation of the Opposition to facilitate the passage of the legislation, if possible on a quick time scale, before the summer recess.  I will revert to the Opposition Front Bench spokespersons in due course.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister rigid in his approach to only dealing with RACO and PDFORA?  I have received a number of representations from groups such as wives with husbands serving overseas who made representations but were told that PDFORA or RACO were the only organisations who could meet or make representations to him. They felt let down because while they look after the home they are unable to have their voices represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have paid tribute on previous occasions to the wives, partners, husbands and families of serving members overseas.  Without their commitment it would not be possible to fulfil our mandate with the UN in such a successful manner.  The Government and the public appreciate that commitment, including the fact that on <Col N="1461" /> many occasions family members are away from important family or other events.  It would not be possible under this kind of scheme, dealing with Partnership 2000 and the wider and broader questions that must be addressed in the conciliation and arbitration and other partnership arrangements, to embody a variety of representative groups.  However, at the request of the Deputy, I would be happy to hold a meeting with a representative group outside of this partnership arrangement if that is deemed necessary.</P>

      <P>The number of personnel enlisted into the FCA from 1 January 1989 to mid-April 1998 is 596.  The number who failed the medical examination on hearing grounds is 118.  It is possible that a number of applicants who failed the hearing test may have failed because their hearing temporarily did not meet the required standard, for example, because of a heavy cold, and may pass the test on further testing.</P>

      <P>I have had preliminary discussions with a number of my colleagues because of my worry about this matter.  It appears we are experiencing rather high failure rates in terms of medical examination and hearing tests across the board for the Defence Forces and for those applying to join the FCA.  It gives cause for concern. If noise induced hearing loss can be attributed to a new kind of lifestyle to which I do not want to refer openly, the matter warrants further examination.</P>

      <P>I do not have precise figures but in terms of recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force over the past 12 months the position in the Western Command was much better than in the Eastern Command where the problems were significantly worse than in most other commands.  The matter warrants further investigation to determine the factors giving rise to noise induced hearing loss among young people leading to the failure to pass a medical test for a position such as this.</P>

      <P>The Secretary General of the Department referred to interference with Mr. Atkins when he was compiling and presenting his report.  A Secretary General can only act with the authority of a Minister and has no independent authority otherwise.  In spite of such interference and given that the Atkins report, which cost £200,000, gave a clear unequivocal recommendation for the onstreet option, will the Minister explain why when she gave an absolute commitment to the House on 12 November 1997 and 16 December 1997 that she would implement its recommendations, she failed to honour it?</P>

      <P>What about the next decision that has to be made, on the fate of the £114 million which was lost in EU funding as a result of the decision on Luas?  The Minister stated that the Department and CIE were in a position to identify a range of potentially suitable public transport projects which could be contractually committed by the end of 1999 and on which work could be completed by 2001.  Will the Minister list those projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will gladly do so.  I will answer the Deputy's question directly, but it will take some time.  The EU aid amount of £114 million is the net aid figure.  The gross project cost involved is £175 million.  Projects totalling £175 million will have to be identified to draw down all of the EU aid.  We have submitted projects totalling £230 million and they are separated into four categories.  They include light rail planning and design, £34 million; Dublin suburban rail, £88 million; Dublin Bus, £8.5 million; and mainline rail, £100 million.  Those capable of completion before the end of the year 2000 have the best chance of support.  The document lists the submissions. Other projects, such as the Dublin Bus corridors, come under the Department of the Environment and Local Government in applications for EU aid.  This Department and others will also make submissions.  The document states that Government approval for a package will be sought by 16 June and this will be submitted to the Community Support Framework monitoring committee for its 25 June meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total for planning and design of the Dublin light rail system to the end of 1999 is £29.5 million with a sum of £4.5 million to the end of 2000. Regarding Dublin suburban rail, the submission includes £5 million for suburban platform lengthening, £3 million for the Dublin to Mullingar line, <Col N="1470" /> £24 million for 16 DART units, £20 million for 20 suburban rail cars, £11 million for the Maynooth line, £2.5 million for DART signalling, £2.5 million for phase two of Barrow Street station and £20 million for track and signalling at Heuston Station.  The total for Dublin suburban rail is £88 million.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8.5 million has been submitted for Dublin Bus.  Submissions have also been made for mainline rail services, including the Mallow to Killarney, Cherryville and Kilkenny lines.  The submission includes track renewal on the Mullingar to Carrick-on-Shannon line.  The total in this area is £14 million while a sum of £24 million has been submitted for 18 inner city carriages.  Other work, such as upgrading level crossings, on the Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo, Killarney, Tralee, Kilkenny, Waterford, Athlone, Westport and Ballina lines is included in the total for mainline rail services of £100 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that Mullingar and Athlone feature more prominently in the list than Dublin where the traffic problem exists.  From a total of £230 million, why has only £8.5 million been submitted for Dublin Bus?  This is the mode of public transport which the vast majority of people in Dublin city and county and surrounding areas will have to rely on now that the Luas project is not going ahead.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Dublin Bus fleet and the service provided by the company is dilapidated, inadequate and unattractive to passengers? It will require much more than the £8.5 million the Minister mentioned to address the traffic problems in Dublin city.</P>

      <P>The Chair and the Minister took exception to the use of the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; earlier. However, on the evening of Tuesday, 12 May at a press conference she stood in front of a big map of Dublin and outlined the main selling point that the Government's decision on the new proposed Luas plan included Broadstone, Ballymun and Dublin Airport.  There was also a reference to Swords, the docklands, Cabinteely and Clondalkin.</P>

However, she was gazumped by her own consultants, despite the interference of the Secretary General of her Department at her request.  Does she accept that she then had to replace the original Luas plan &mdash; which she supported in Government &mdash; with a wish list of pious aspirations without a plan, timetable or costing and without a penny of the £114 million that had been originally earmarked for Luas, which is now gone?

I was delighted to get a job which I hoped to have for the next four years.  I did not seek to gazump anybody.  The manifesto for Government we put before the people included a proposed study of Luas.  The Atkins report came out and I gave copies of it to the Cabinet, which spent portions of two sessions discussing it.  The result I revealed publicly, and this is my fourth occasion discussing it.</P>

Deputy Ryan asked a further valid question about Dublin Airport, namely, that with the number of passengers using the airport is there not a need to link it with the Dublin-Belfast rail line?  It seems there would be a need for such a link, apart from the link we propose to put in place to Dublin Airport &mdash; which was not included in a previous Government decision. From studies carried out, I understand that a link from the Dublin-Belfast line or the Dublin-Maynooth line would cost in the region of £140 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan also inquired about buses and rail carriages.  In the section of our proposal to the commission dealing with Dublin suburban rail, we have included 20 suburban rail cars at a cost of £20 million.  It remains to be seen whether that proposal is accepted.  I do not know where CIE plans to put these carriages.  Heretofore, the EU did not co-fund buses because it regards them as mobile assets.  However, it appears to have relented somewhat in this regard.</P>

      <P>For the next three hours, commuters travelling home from work will be stuck in traffic.  What is the Minister's message to those people?  From the replies she gave earlier, is she informing them she is not clear about when Luas will be built, that she does not know how much it will cost, that less that 4 per cent of the claim she made in respect of the £114 million of EU funding lost to the project relates to buses and that the £114 million is up for grabs for every second division project in every Department which failed to attract funding on previous occasions?

Will the Minister elaborate on the nature of these boreholes because I have been informed that they may have to be dug to a depth of 100 metres?  Has she given consideration to the points made by Dr. Adrian Phillips and others about the rollercoaster effect, the geology and the fact that this project may degenerate into the type of controversy which surrounded Wood Quay, which involved the construction of a building on the surface?

Our project has been the subject of a formal Government decision, particularly the enhanced lines northwards from Heuston to Connolly and outwards to Sandyford as laid down.  This will be achieved.  A formal, written decision on funding was put in place by the Government, unlike other projects where formal financial allocations were not made. I look forward to the implementation of the plan.</P>

      <P>It seems that the Taoiseach, a Deputy for a Dublin constituency, decided to fundamentally change the Luas project.  Why was £200,000 spent on a consultant's report?  Why was a decision not made beforehand?  The Minister is noted for her decisiveness and she made a decision on 12 May.  Proposals were made by Japanese financial institutions with regard to the funding for the project.  It is said they have experience in financing and building of such projects. The Minister mentioned the public and private funding issue.  Is it the likely outcome that a private foreign concern may build this network over a number of years and operate it?  Is that a desirable outcome?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that the Luas line to Tallaght will be of a heavier gauge and may follow a different route to that outlined in May? The argument is based on an alternative route through more heavily populated areas of south city.  Will the Sandyford to the airport line be of a heavier gauge?  Has any thought been given to this matter?  The previous Government decided to extend the DART from Donaghmede to Malahide. It was also decided before a notable by-election to extend it to Greystones.  Will the DART extensions take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that a number of phosphorous canisters have been washed up on east coast beaches.  They pose a danger to people who use the beaches.  It appears from media reports that these canisters were among munitions dumped by the UK Government in the Irish Sea after the Second World War.  I recall that similar canisters were washed up a couple of years ago, particularly on the County Antrim and Scottish coasts.  They emerged when the gas interconnector was being laid just north of Beaufort Dyke.  At that time the UK authorities indicated that dumping had taken place in the Irish Sea in areas outside of Beaufort Dyke and could have taken place as far south as the Isle of Man.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House where exactly the material washed up has come from?  What has disturbed it?  Scientific opinion is that dumped munitions remain on the sea bed unless they are disturbed.  The munitions from Beaufort Dyke were disturbed during the laying of the gas pipeline. There must have been some engineering or geological activity in the Irish Sea which has disturbed the canisters and caused them to come ashore.  Will the Minister tell us what has disturbed them?  Can he assure us the activity will be discontinued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of matters which impact on the Irish Sea &mdash; the dumped munitions, the frequency with which they come ashore and the problem of radioactive waste &mdash; which originate from the UK.  Will steps be taken in the light of the east-west arrangements under the British-Irish Agreement to form an intergovernmental <Col N="1482" /> body with responsibility for the management of the Irish Sea and the protection of its environment? We must avoid continuing problems of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  Citizens who wish to enjoy our beaches should not have to run the risk of encountering these phosphorous canisters and their attendant dangers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Sea is getting a reputation as the most explosive and the most radioactive in the region.  The latest incident bears this out.  Ten phosphorus bombs were washed up along the east coast and that raises serious concerns regarding safety as we face the summer season. It is fortunate that as yet no children came in contact with these devices as the consequences would be serious.  The phosphorus bombs are believed to have come from the Beaufort Dyke where millions of tonnes of munitions were dumped following World War II.  There is concern that the recent laying of a pipeline and a telephone cable line may have disturbed the seabed in the Beaufort Dyke area and caused a dislodgement.  The type of munitions and the quantities involved must be established.  Does the UK Ministry of Defence have archival records indicating the quantities dumped after World War II?  It is essential that we know the quantity of phosphorus bombs involved because they have appeared on our coastline for many years.</P>
      <P>The task force on dumping radioactive material is due to report soon.  While I appreciate the task force focused mainly on solid packaged radioactive waste dumped by the UK authorities in Beaufort Dyke in the north Irish Sea during the 1950s, dumping also took place at many other locations.  Can the task force report be broadened to include all lethal materials?  If public confidence is to be restored in our marine environment, the Minister should find out what arms were dumped.</P>

Since the points have been adequately made by my colleagues, I wish to ask the Minister some important questions. What is the origin of these bombs?  Are the British responsible for them &mdash; I assume they are &mdash; and, if so, will they fund the cost incurred in surveillance along the east coast?  Is the Minister prepared to secure information from the British authorities on where bombs were dumped, what quantities were dumped, when they were dumped and what else can we expect to be washed up on beaches in Bettystown, Laytown and Dundalk? Most importantly, has the Minister received a report from the Army disposal unit on whether <Col N="1483" /> these devices are still live?  Are they likely to explode if, for example, children pick them up or interfere with them?</P>
      <P>As we approach the tourist season, a prime time for coastal resorts from Dublin to the Border, what message will the Minister give to the public?  Will he ask the British authorities whether they are responsible for dumping these devices, together with other matters, in the Irish Sea and whether they are prepared to pay the cost of surveillance and clearing of these devices?</P>

      <P>As a Deputy for the coastal constituency of Dublin North, I am deeply concerned about the implications of this find along the east coast, particularly in Loughshinny in my constituency. In the past I asked Ministers to contact the United Kingdom health and safety Minister to identify the location of dumping of ammunition, but I still await that report.  The residents of Loughshinny had to put up with much disturbance in terms of smells which emanated during construction of the gas line from Loughshinny to Scotland.</P>
      <P>As we approach the summer season there are major concerns about this matter.  The Minister should reassure the people who live in the coastal villages and towns involved of the action he is taking to ensure there is no effect on tourism or on the lives and safety of residents living along the coastline.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House for the absence of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, who had a prior engagement of an important nature involving negotiations on fisheries matters.  He is very sorry he cannot be here to reply to this important matter. I thank the Deputies for raising it and providing the opportunity to reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and I were greatly concerned to learn yesterday that a number of phosphorus devices had come ashore in the Greenore and Loughshinny areas.  As soon as the Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; IMES &mdash; of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources was made aware of the incident, the relevant IMES coastal units were called out and immediately started carrying out extensive searches between Dún Laoghaire and Carlingford Lough.  Garda stations, harbour authorities, lifeboat stations and local authorities were also alerted, a radio warning was broadcast to shipping and this broadcast is continuing on an ongoing basis.  A warning was issued to the public yesterday on national radio, TV and press.  In addition to the above action, initial response was made by the Garda and Army bomb disposal unit who cordoned off the areas mentioned above and dealt with the devices on site.  This operation was assisted by Civil Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inquiry was made through UK Coastguard as to the origin of these devices and to ascertain <Col N="1484" /> whether there was recent activity which could have caused disturbance of the seabed, particularly in the Beaufort Dyke area.  Belfast Coastguard commenced searches of the north Carlingford Lough coastline and advised that one such device had come ashore in Belfast Lough.  My colleague followed this up earlier today by contacting Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP, the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to express his serious concern at the discovery of these devices on Ireland's east coast and has instructed senior officials of his Department to liaise closely with their UK counterparts on the issues arising.</P>
    <P>A total of 12 phosphorus devices were found yesterday on the Irish east coast, nine in Greenore, one at Loughshinny and two in the area around Clogherhead.  The IMES coastal unit at Greenore today found a further device at Ballagan Point south of Greenore and the IMES coastal unit at Clogherhead discovered another device one mile north of Clogherhead today. Extensive coastal searches are continuing involving IMES coastal units, Garda and Civil Defence. The devices in question are yellow in colour, rough in texture, four inches in diameter and between eight inches and 12 inches long.  They ignite when exposed to the air and give off noxious gasses.  These devices are considered highly dangerous and should not be approached by members of the public.  Their location should be noted and the Garda or the Irish Marine Emergency Service notified using the 999/112 system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has asked me to assure the House that he will maintain contact with the UK authorities and with the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office in the matter of investigating the cause of this incident and identifying remedies to prevent further incidents.  Efforts will continue ashore to ensure any further items that are beached are dealt with appropriately.  There are no markings on the devices that have been located so far to indicate their origin and it is complete surmise at this stage to suggest that they have come from any particular location.</P>
    <P>I recognise that a high level of co-operation has been established on political, official and scientific fronts on Irish Sea environmental matters.  A detailed survey of the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite was carried out last year jointly by UK and Irish scientists.  In the light of that survey it was agreed that both administrations would stay closely in touch in relation to the management of the dumpsite and, in particular, to ensure that activities in the area of the dumpsite would be restricted. It is a matter of concern that these devices came ashore in the numbers reported and at such distances from the actual dumpsite.  The Deputies also raised a number of other matters.  I will report directly to my colleague so that more detailed information can be conveyed to the Deputies concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming to reply.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable increase in the incidence of hepatitis A, particularly among school children.  In 1996-97 reported cases increased by 400 per cent compared to the previous two years and in the past 12 months schools in Wicklow, Carlow, Kerry and Laois have reported outbreaks of the virus.  Hepatitis A is a highly infectious viral disease which generally causes jaundice and, as its severity increases with age, when adults are exposed to it, more serious illness can result.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the lack of a co-ordinated Government policy or health board approach to this matter.  The role of health boards should be co-ordinated to provide positive information directed at parents, teachers and others concerned. I understand efforts to stem an outbreak of hepatitis A in certain parts of the country were hampered because of fears among the general public of contracting a blood disease.  People have been reluctant to take the human immunoglobulin because of the hepatitis C controversy.</P>
      <P>Evidence has shown that in recent times the virus is most commonly associated with schools and centres of child care activity.  We need to protect those most at risk, namely, teachers and child care professionals because of the link between the severity of the symptoms and age.  Adequate control measures, with particular reference to the use of immunoglobulin as opposed to the hepatitis A vaccine, are not in place.  In other countries administration of immunoglobulin is standard, but I do not believe that is the case here.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position in that regard?</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that hepatitis A is relatively common.  Consequently, it is important that all health boards adopt the same plan of action to address the problem.  At a minimum, we should issue leaflets to parents and those who live in towns surrounding affected schools, there should be proper consultation by way of meetings with parents and their representatives, public health and health board officials should visit schools and a programme promoting proper hygiene in schools should be devised.</P>
      <P>How many teachers have been infected because of the increased incidence in recent years?  What actions were taken when the virus reference laboratory reported the significant increase in hepatitis A?

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to set out the position on this matter. Hepatitis A is a notifiable disease under the <Col N="1486" /> Infectious Diseases Regulations and 365 cases were notified by health boards to my Department for the period from 1 May 1997 to 31 April 1998. Under the regulations general practitioners are required to notify their local director of community care or medical officer of health of all cases of hepatitis A.</P>
      <P>Those officers in turn notify the Department on a weekly basis of the number of cases occurring in their areas.  It is not possible to indicate the number of cases linked to schools as the information is not collected in that format.  However, I am aware there has been an increase in the number of cases reported by the Eastern and Midland Health Boards since January 1998 and I am advised by the boards that the majority of cases occurred in children of school-going age. Control of infectious diseases is the statutory responsibility of the relevant health board and the boards advise that the full range of appropriate measures were employed in each case.  In particular, advice on personal hygiene was provided and, where necessary, immunisation and immunoglobulin were provided.</P>
      <P>Immunoglobulin may be offered to those who have had household family contact or to classroom contacts if there is evidence that transmission was through a school.  The hepatitis A vaccine is available and may be used in the case of ongoing outbreaks and to immunise those who may be at particular risk of contracting the virus. My Department's policy on this issue is guided by the advice of the Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert group established by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines provide information on the use of hepatitis A vaccine and other preventative agents in outbreaks, including those linked to schools to prevent the transmission of the hepatitis A virus.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department also produces a guide entitled &ldquo;Infection in School &mdash; A Manual for School Personnel&rdquo; which was circulated to schools.  The manual provides information on all infectious diseases, including hepatitis A, and on the course of action to be taken if pupils contract infectious diseases.  Copies are available to schools through the health promotion unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise the potential closure of Goresbridge school.  The school was formed in 1858 and until 1979 the Bridigine nuns provided the educational needs of the area.  In 1979 it became a voluntary secondary school and since then has served the needs of the community in east Kilkenny and west Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school has been ahead of its time in many respects.  It has provided classes in computers, home economics and science for many years.  In May 1998 the board of management decided to phase out its operations over two years.  This decision was based on low enrolment numbers, <Col N="1487" /> for the first time ever, for September 1998 and the declining numbers in the two main feeder primary schools, Goresbridge and Gowran.  The difficult financial circumstances and the problems it would experience covering a full curriculum were also considered.  The board of management felt that if one of the ten teachers was withdrawn, the school could not provide the range of subjects to which second level pupils are entitled.  They felt the school would not be viable.  The Brigidine Convent is more than a school in the Goresbridge area.  It is inextricably linked with the community as it provides facilities, such as the community hall and other recreational facilities.  The loss of the school is one element of the closure but there is also the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of facilities which one would expect to have in any community the size of Goresbridge. People play bingo or hold meetings and the community hall is part and parcel of St. Brigid's secondary school.</P>
    <P>The parents have already contributed a substantial amount of their own resources, £27,500, in recent years to ensure their school met the highest possible standards.  A number of schools in the area, such as Borris comprehensive school and Graiguenamanagh vocational school, are 100 per cent funded by the State.  That has put pressure on the enrolment of pupils in a school where parents must dig deep into their pockets from time to time to ensure it continues to operate.</P>
    <P>St. Brigid's is one of the smallest voluntary secondary schools in Ireland but the local people feel it is worth saving.  A total of 127 pupils attend there currently with ten teachers.  A small school requires a minimum staffing level to provide an adequate curriculum, but the school occupies an important position in the social, educational and recreational life of the community.  An action group was formed which will meet the Minister for Education and Science next week to see what can be done to retain this valuable local asset.</P>
    <P>In the context of rural development this is a symptom of the declining population in many rural areas.  The provision of schools in terms of population trends is the first indicator.  Whereas in the 1970s and 1980s there was a population boom in the primary sector, the difficulties have now come through second level into third level. Fianna Fáil's rural development policy published in May 1997 recognised this when it stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to maintaining, where possible, the existing number of teachers in rural schools.</P>
    <P>This is a litmus test of that policy.  All of us share the belief that where the democratic dividend can be brought to bear on retaining small schools, that policy should be implemented.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply on this urgent and important issue for many parents and pupils affected by this decision in Goresbridge, County Kilkenny, if it goes ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to clarify the position regarding the school in question.  St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, is a coeducational school with an enrolment of 127 pupils in the current school year.  The possible closure of this school came to the notice of the Department recently when the school management sought a meeting to discuss its future.  This meeting was held on 19 May.  Two local meetings were subsequently held on 21 and 26 May and the Department was informed on 27 May that a firm decision had been taken to close the school. It was indicated that this closure would be phased over two years and there would be no intake in September 1998.</P>
      <P>The reason given for the closure is that the board of management considered the future viability of the school would become increasingly untenable due to declining enrolments.  The intake of first year pupils for September 1997 was 26 pupils.  The expectation for September 1998 is 17 and it appeared that only 10 pupils might be enrolled for September 1999.  This could result in an overall enrolment of only 99 pupils for the 1999-2000 school year.  A consequence of the declining enrolment is that the number of teachers in the school is also reducing and the school is not in a position to continue to provide a full range of subject options.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a secondary school is a privately owned and managed institution and a decision to close such a school is a matter for the school authorities.  In the circumstances, it is not open to the Minister to intervene to prevent a closure.  The responsibility of the Minister in a school closure is to ensure the best interests of the pupils are looked after.  A closure must take place on a phased basis so that existing pupils are adequately catered for in the period leading up to closure.  Allied to this there would need to be sufficient pupil places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science will continue to liaise with the school authorities to ensure as little disruption as possible is caused to all concerned by the closure.  It is very much in the best interest of the pupils that they would have an opportunity to study a wide range of subjects in a bigger school. While I accept the Deputy's point that the closure of a school in a rural area is regrettable, the fact that in two years time, possible enrolment will be fewer than 100 pupils demonstrates that the logical thing to do is what the board of management decided.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday 9 June 1998.</P>

      <P>Peltor passive ear muffs from a centralised pool held by the unit are issued to all FCA personnel carrying out range practices.  When exchanging ear muffs members of the FCA are recommended to use peltor clean paper pads.  These are thin paper pads which are adhesively attached to the surface of the ear muff in contact with the ear.  Their purpose is for hygiene only and does not affect the attenuation of noise or protection which the ear muff gives.  Some 1,000 pads were issued to the Southern Command in 1997, of which 390 were issued to FCA units.</P>

      <P>The report which I have received from the military authorities concerning this matter indicates the following sequence of events.  On 26 May 1998 11 De Facto Forces personnel on foot and three in a jeep came to AT-TIRI crossroads from AT-TIRI and Haddathah Compounds.  Shortly afterwards two mortar rounds were fired from an unknown location to a position 100m SW of an IRISHBATT position.  During the day Armed Elements fired a total of 61 x Mortar rounds, 60 x Anti-Aircraft rounds, 1 x Missile and 350 rounds of heavy machine gun-light machine gun fire towards De Facto Force Compounds as well as towards a helicopter in the vicinity of Haddathah Compound.  As a result of this fire the Israeli Defence Force-Israeli Air Force as well as De Facto Forces retaliated with a heavy bombardment using mortar, tank rounds, heli rockets and an aerial bomb resulting in twelve firings close to IRISHBATT positions.</P>
      <P>Apart from certain personnel who were required to undertake necessary observing and monitoring duties, all personnel were in secure bunkers during the firing.  There were no injuries to IRISHBATT personnel or damage to locations or equipment.  During the shelling IRISHBATT evacuated children from Tibnin school by armoured personnel carrier to the IRISHBATT area.  IRISHBATT post 6-44 at AT-TIRI confirmed that one De Facto Force casualty was removed by ambulance from AT-TIRI village and IRISHBATT post 6-40c at AL YATUN reported that one Armed Element body was removed from a house in the vicinity of the post.</P>
      <P>On the following morning armed elements fired 13 mortar rounds towards Haddathah.  During this firing one mortar round from the general area of Haddathah school impacted within five to ten metres of the Transport Billet at IRISHBATT position 6-38 at Haddathah.  The round impacted on an earth mound which absorbed the impact.  There were no injuries to IRISHBATT personnel who were in secure bunkers during the firing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances of these firings were reported by IRISHBATT to Unifil Headquarters <Col N="1493" /> which in turn has initiated protests to the Israeli and Lebanese authorities through the usual UNIFIL liaison channels.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the safety of Irish troops in their execution of the UNIFIL mandate, it is obviously not possible to give absolute guarantees as to their safety.  I can, however, give an assurance to the House that none of the troops is exposed to any unnecessary risks and all possible precautions are taken to ensure their safety.  The Irish Battalion has specially designed secure bunkers in each of its positions and personnel move to these bunkers in the event of impending attacks.  Some personnel remain in secure observation posts during these attacks to ensure that the necessary observing and monitoring of activities in their area continues. Physical security in the form of equipment and engineering works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved.</P>
    <P>Our troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for them consistent with the carrying out of their mission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98 provided for special studies to be carried out of the Air Corps and the Naval Service. In July 1996, the efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse Management Consultants to conduct a review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a preliminary draft report to the efficiency audit group.  This draft report highlighted issues which required to be studied in <Col N="1494" /> greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, rather than publishing a report that merely identified problems, it was decided that the consultants should examine these problems further in order to produce a report that was as comprehensive as possible and which could serve as the blueprint for the development of these important services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The consultants completed their review earlier this year and they submitted their final report to the efficiency audit group in February 1998.  The report has been considered by the steering group overseeing the review and it will be submitted to Government in about two weeks.</P>
    <P>I am committed to publishing this report immediately after it has been submitted to Government for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98 was adopted by Government in February 1996.  The reorganisation process is ongoing and the first phase of the implementation plan should be completed by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the plan requires some amendment to the Defence Act, 1954, and the Government recently approved the heads of a Bill in this regard.  The legislation to give effect to these amendments will be brought before this House later this year.</P>

      <P>Preliminary planning work on the White Paper on Defence is continuing.  This work is directed at identifying all of the issues to be comprehended by the White Paper and developing approaches for dealing with these.  The White Paper will set out the medium-term policy framework and approaches for the direction and management of defence.  It will be based on the work of my own Department, civil and military, as well as appropriate inputs from other Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Consultation will be comprehensive and will make provision for the input of all of those who wish to do so.  In particular, consultation will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations and special arrangements are being made in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also said that as this is the first White Paper of its kind I wish to ensure that all of the issues raised are reflected upon adequately.  The timetable for work is provisional but I would see the consultative process being undertaken over the coming months with the intention of being in a position to put a draft for consideration to the Government by early next year.</P>

      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Some of the more important developments in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are: a new fishery patrol vessel due for delivery in 1999; the supply of new turrets and fire directing systems for fitting, during 1998 and 1999, to existing armoured cars; the purchase of twelve refurbished 105mm.  light artillery guns to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete. &mdash; six guns were delivered in April and the final delivery is expected at the end of this month; delivery of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of nearly £10 million and expenditure of approximately £3 million on new troop carrying vehicles.</P>
      <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under consideration in my Department at present.  A project team was established in 1997 comprising civilian and military personnel and was tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  The procurement process will be undertaken in two stages by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.  In stage one a general request for proposals, RFP, issued to interested companies on 24 April 1998, based on a broad parameter specification, with the aim of establishing product availability in the marketplace as well as an indication of the costs involved.  Proposals were received on 27 May 1998 and are being evaluated at present.  In the second stage a request for tenders, RFT, based on a more precisely defined specification, will issue to a restricted list of companies &mdash; those deemed successful in the first stage.  The project team, already in place, will manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Requests for participation by the Defence Forces in international peacekeeping missions are considered on their merits by the Government on a case by case basis.  Where a decision is taken to respond to any such request the military unit concerned will be provided with the equipment necessary for the carrying out of its mission.  The Defence Forces are currently participating in a number of overseas missions involving a total of <Col N="1497" /> 750 personnel and troops serving on such missions are provided with adequate resources to carry out their tasks.</P>

    <P>There are no proposals to change the job description for new cadets joining the Defence Forces in 1998.  The conditions of service of cadets enlisted this year are however under <Col N="1498" /> review.  The conditions that have been changed are the height requirement for females down to 5' 4" from 5' 5" and some minor amendments to the educational qualifications.  The conditions still under review are those relating to the pension entitlements of officers and the service commitment of Air Corps pilot officers.  It is proposed that cadets recruited this year will qualify for payment of an immediate pension after 20 years service as opposed to the present 12 years.  It is also proposed that cadets recruited this year for the Air Corps should sign a 15 year undertaking instead of a 12 year undertaking.</P>

Since the granting of an adjournment of these cases on 6 February 1998 which was extended on 21 April 1998 for a further three weeks, the importance of the concerns of the Law Society has, to some extent, been overtaken by more recent developments, including the publication of the Green Book report on the assessment of hearing disability and the running of a test case in the High Court in which this report has been considered.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, recently <Col N="1499" /> announced his intention to develop and identify the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, as a national coastguard service and that he intends to bring forward specific proposals in this regard later in the year.  The proposed new coastguard service will give greater public recognition to all personnel involved in marine emergency response.</P>
      <P>As regards liaison with the Naval Service, that service currently responds to calls for assistance from IMES in marine emergency situations.  The Naval Service is also represented on the Marine Emergency Advisory Group which comprises senior officers of the maritime and land based emergency services and also on the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee.  The latter is a standing consultative committee representing the providers and users of the search and rescue services. I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will give full consideration to any request received for Naval Service assistance in connection with the operation of the proposed new service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 59 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the <Col N="1501" /> Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners, while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to tasks involving the prevention of illegal drug importation.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the joint task force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the Naval Service carried out five major drugs operations and these were co-ordinated with the joint task force, involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service. My Department does not have information in relation to the numbers that resulted in court appearances as the prosecution of personnel involved in such activities is a matter for the Garda.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  Eighty recruits were enlisted in the service in 1997 and 20 were enlisted on 5 May this year.  An additional 30 recruits will be enlisted very shortly.  A competition to recruit ten watchkeeping officers to the executive branch of the Naval Service was advertised in March of this year in the national press and in a number of relevant publications in Britain.  Interviews were held recently and it is proposed that a panel will be formed from which vacancies will be filled.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels, comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At present, six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel, FPPV, which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
    <P>As part of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998, a special study of the Naval Service was undertaken by consultants engaged by the efficiency audit group, EAG.  The consultants completed their review earlier this year and recently submitted their final report to the EAG.  The report is currently being considered by the steering group overseeing the review and it will be submitted to Government in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of in-patients treated in St. Bricin's Military Hospital from 1993 to 1997, inclusive, was 5,800.  A total of 105,000 out-patient services were provided during the same period &mdash; these included primary care, as well as medical, surgical, ENT, ophthalmologic, psychiatric and dental clinics.  Over the five year period, the daily bed occupancy in St. Bricin's Hospital has ranged between 20 and 40 patients.</P>
      <P>At present, 64 bed spaces are available in St. Bricin's Hospital.  When ongoing refurbishment work to No. 1 ward is completed an additional 20 beds will be available.  Ward No. 5, which has the potential to provide an additional 30 bed spaces, is currently unoccupied due to the fact that it requires considerable refurbishment, including roof repair.</P>
      <P>As I advised the House recently, discussions are currently taking place with a major Dublin hospital with a view to setting up a pilot in-patient scheme which could be of benefit to both hospitals.</P>
      <P>Separate budgetary details in respect of the three military hospitals are not normally quantified as the hospitals are operated as part of the services provided by the Army Medical Corps. However, the total overall cost of operating the Army Medical Corps is approximately £13 million per year.  Currently, the hospital has a staff of 80 military personnel, 17 nurses and 24 civilian employees.  A number of civilian medical consultants are also employed on a part-time basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to include military service allowance for pension purposes for personnel who retired prior to 1 August 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of military service allowance, MSA, in the calculation of superannuation benefits for military personnel arose from a recommendation made by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission.  The agreed arrangements provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following <Col N="1503" /> publication of the commission's report.  MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified retired persons.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the commission's recommendation was the subject of detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA.  In that context, the various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 were fully considered.  However, having regard to the practice followed in other areas of the public service and the considerable cost involved both to my Department and to other areas of the public service, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to personnel who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
      <P>When I met some months ago with representatives of the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers, ARCO, I listened carefully and sympathetically to their views on this issue and I undertook to have the matter re-examined.  In that context, the Deputy may be aware that a commission on public service pensions was established by Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The commission has very broad terms of reference to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits.  In that regard, I understand that ARCO and the Irish UN Veterans Association were among various groups which made submissions to the commission.</P>
      <P>The commission is an independent body and is scheduled to make its final report to Government in 1998.  In its interim report, published in November 1997, the commission lists the pensionability of overtime and allowances as one of the main issues raised by parties who made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Army Medical Corps operates nine audiometric testing booths, located as follows: St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin 2; Military Hospital, Cork 1; Military Hospital, Curragh 1; Finner Camp, Donegal 1; Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick 1; Baldonnel, County Dublin 1; Custume Barracks, Athlone 1 and Dun Uí Mhaoiliosa, Galway 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of time spent in a booth by a person <Col N="1504" /> being tested varies depending upon the complexity of the test, e.g. whether it is screening or diagnostic, whether bone conduction studies or masking of the ear not under test are required, and the level of comprehension the subject has of the test method, e.g. a person who has never previously undergone a test may need time to become familiar with the method of testing and response.  Most testing is screening, and usually takes from eight to 15 minutes for a person who has not been previously tested and five to ten minutes for a person who has had previous tests.</P>
    <P>All diagnostic testing carried out by the Medical Corps is carried out in St. Bricin's Hospital, and the time spent in the booth lasts from 25 to 40 minutes per person tested, depending on the factors above and also on the level of compliance of the person being tested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel receive the most up to date training possible.  As part of ongoing training programmes selected personnel from time to time undergo training courses and courses of instruction in a number of European countries.  In the context of peacekeeping, Defence Forces personnel have attended schools in Austria, Finland, Sweden, <Col N="1505" /> Italy, Norway, Hungary and Russia both as students and instructors.  Peacekeeping training syllabi are constantly reviewed and updated.  I might mention that military officers of many European countries have down the years attended peacekeeping training courses in Ireland.  In relation to current overseas missions, e.g. UNIFIL, personnel selected for these missions are initially trained at unit level, then at command level before personnel are concentrated as an overseas unit for some months before departure.</P>

      <P>Arising from recent allegations of harassment of Irish fishing vessels off the south-west coast, I had a meeting on 8 April 1998 with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. At that meeting measures were agreed which are aimed at ensuring an effective and rapid response to any incidents involving harassment or endangerment of fishing vessels.  To this end, it was decided that the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, will be the first point of contact for fishermen when an incident occurs.  IMES will immediately contact the Naval Service and Air Corps and the appropriate resources will then be deployed to effect a response so that a deterrent presence is on the scene as quickly as possible.  I understand that a marine notice on these arrangements is being prepared.</P>
      <P>It was agreed also that officials will review, as a matter of urgency, with the Office of the Attorney General, the adequacy of the existing powers of the State under fisheries, maritime safety and international legal codes in respect of incidents of this nature, which usually occur outside Irish territorial waters.  I understand that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is also seeking the active co-operation of other member states in ensuring the highest standards of behaviour on fishing grounds and in promoting the avoidance of conflict between fishermen operating on the same fishing grounds with different types of gear.  The aim will be the putting in place of codes of practice between the fishermen of the member states concerned.</P>

      <P>The Council of Defence is provided for under section 11 of the Defence Act, 1954.  The purpose of the council is to aid and counsel the Minister for Defence.  The council is chaired by the Minister for Defence and the members of the council are the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, the Secretary General of the Department, the Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General.</P>
      <P>It has not been necessary to formally convene the council since 1987.  Members of the council meet very regularly, individually and jointly.

      <P>The first phase of the implementation plan for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces provides for a total strength of 11,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel by 31 December 1998. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 March 1998, the latest date for which figures have been compiled, was 11,434.  Recruitment to the Defence Forces is taking place.  Since the beginning of May approximately 265 recruits have been enlisted.  A further 235 will be enlisted over the coming months so as to ensure the strength figure of 11,500 is maintained.</P>
      <P>The age profile of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force is being compiled and I will forward this information to the Deputies as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>The number of female personnel in the Defence Forces on 31 March 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, is shown in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Irish military personnel, in common with all other citizens, have rights arising from our written Constitution.  This constitutional jurisprudence has been applied increasingly in the military legal sphere in recent years.  Also, the Courts Martial Appeal Court, which is a civil court, has full appellate jurisdiction over the finding and sentence of any court martial. <Col N="1510" /> It is considered that our court martial system conforms with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court martial system as operated currently.</P>

      <P>The current number of members in Civil Defence is approximately 10,000.</P>
      <P>The activities undertaken by Civil Defence are based on the objectives set out in the Towards 2000 programme which is focused on community help and support.  In this regard, Civil Defence has evolved over the years into a skilled community support organisation which provides essential assistance to a wide range of primary emergency services, which include the Garda Síochána, Fire, Ambulance and Search and Rescue Services as well as the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Essential activities undertaken by Civil Defence include: response to natural and environmental emergencies such as flooding and blizzards; search and rescue; river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; forest fire fighting; responding to radiological emergencies; stewarding at local and national events; responding in the event of requests for overseas assistance.</P>
      <P>The Towards 2000 programme contains provisions for the involvement of the organisation in major emergencies and a considerable part of training is geared towards this role.</P>
      <P>The major emergency plan is the combined co-ordinated plans of the local authority, health board and Garda in the area where the emergency occurs.  There is provision in the major emergency plan for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces both at local and national level.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to place on record my personal appreciation and respect, and that of the Government, for the level of commitment and expertise which the members of Civil Defence, who act in a voluntary capacity, provide to the community in times of essential need.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 stipulates that payment must be made to suppliers for the supply of goods or services on or before the date on which payment is due under the terms of a written contract.  Where there is no written contract, or the written contract does not specify a payment date, payment must be made within 45 days of receipt of the invoice or delivery of the goods or services, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>The bodies operating under the aegis of my Department have informed me that they have implemented the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 since its commencement, that they have appropriate systems in place to ensure compliance with the terms of the legislation and that interest is paid in any cases where payment is late under the terms of the Act.  My Department has also fully implemented the Act and has a system in place which ensures that late payment is an infrequent occurrence and that interest is paid on late payments.  No complaints have been received by me regarding late payments relating either to my Department or to any bodies which operate under its aegis.</P>
      <P>Since the Act only came into effect on 2 January 1998 I have not sought a report on its operation to date.  However, I would draw the Deputy's attention to sections 12 and 13 of the Act. Section 12 requires public bodies to include details of their payment practices in their annual reports.  In so far as those public bodies which do not publish annual reports are concerned, that section provides for the preparation of an annual review of payment practices, a copy of which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 13 provides that an auditor auditing the affairs of a public body shall report on whether, in all material respects, the purchaser has complied with the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Registry of Friendly Societies that the registration of the society in question was cancelled on 16 December 1993 for failure to submit annual returns.</P>
      <P>In October 1997 the society's auditors inquired as to how its registration could be restored.  The auditors subsequently submitted the outstanding annual returns, which were the subject of correspondence with the registry up to 11 February 1998.  The data contained in the returns give rise to matters which require the registrar's consideration. I understand that to date he has not yet finalised his deliberations on these issues.</P>
      <P>It would not normally be acceptable practice that my Department or any of its offices should take several months to reply to correspondence. However, I am aware that the registrar has been considerably occupied recently, most notably with matters connected with the implementation of the Credit Union Act, 1997.  I am asking the registrar to arrange that a reply issue to the society shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have initiated inquiries with all the industrial development agencies which are under the aegis of my Department in order to establish the details of any applications for grant aid made by the company referred to by the Deputy and to identify any political representations made in relation to such applications.  The inquiries undertaken have identified applications for grant aid made by Rennicks Group Ltd.  and other related companies.  As of now it has not been possible to identify any company operating under the name of Rennicks Engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I can confirm that neither my own Departments records nor the historical files of the agencies which have reported to me so far reveal any evidence of any meeting which might have taken place, between the directors of Rennicks Group Ltd.  and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Ray Burke, who was in office in the period from November 1988 to July <Col N="1513" /> 1989.  There is, moreover, no evidence of any political interference in the normal conduct of the grant application process revealed in these papers. In addition, inquiries and searches made in my Department have failed to reveal the existence of any ministerial diaries relating to Mr. Burke's period in office.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this reply I propose to outline the contacts revealed by inquiries to date which my Department, its Ministers and officials and the former IDA had with Rennicks Group Ltd.  particularly in the period prior to the 1989 general election.  I am also circulating with my reply a copy of the interim report provided to me last Friday at my request by Mr. Dan Flinter, Chief Executive of Forbairt.  This report details grant aid provided to the company by the former IDA up to the end of 1993 and by Forbairt since that time.</P>
    <P>As regards the information requested from the other industrial development agencies concerning their involvement with Rennicks Group Ltd.  or related companies I propose to publish a separate report on such contacts in the coming days.  I will also be happy to provide copies of any relevant files, from my Department to the Flood Tribunal.</P>
    <P>In late l987 Rennicks Group Ltd.  submitted an application to the former IDA seeking financial assistance towards the expansion of its business. The IDA and Rennicks Group Ltd.  subsequently agreed that, prior to a decision being made in relation to its application, a company development programme would be of benefit in helping the company to develop and manage its growth strategy.  The company development programme started in March 1988 and continued over a number of months.</P>
    <P>Neither my Departments records nor the historical files of Forbairt reveal any evidence of any meeting which might have taken place in relation to this application between representatives of Rennicks Group Ltd.  and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The approval in October 1988 of grant assistance by the former IDA in relation to this application actually predated the appointment as Minister for Industry and Commerce of Mr. Ray Burke in November 1988.</P>
    <P>That approval was for grant assistance of £240,000, being 20 per cent of the total investment of £1.2 million by Rennicks Group Ltd.  was in respect of the business plan which emerged from the company development programme referred to above.  Only £180,000 in capital grants was subsequently paid.</P>
    <P>The inquiries undertaken by Forbairt have confirmed that these grants were approved in accordance with normal grant aid policy and that normal grant conditions applied.  In the context of that grant application, the former IDA Authority had also been informed of a change in the ownership structure of Rennicks Group Ltd.  involving the acquisition by Fitzwilton plc of 51 per cent of the shareholding from Robin and Maureen Rennicks.</P>
    <P>Discussions were also taking place in the <Col N="1514" /> course of 1989 between Rennicks Group Ltd.  and the IDA regarding a joint venture in which Rennicks-Fitzwilton were the minority partner with Seibulite (Mfg.) Ltd., a Japanese company &mdash; engaged in the manufacture of reflective plastic sheeting.  These discussions culminated in October l989 with the IDA approving total assistance of £4.2 million in respect of the joint venture for a project to locate in Kilcoole, County Wicklow. Because of difficulties relating to planning objections, however, the Kilcoole project did not proceed and no grants were paid.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I should also like to add that, in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I subsequently met with the IDA and officials from the Departments of the Environment and of Industry and Commerce on 21 January 1991, following upon representations made to my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, by the Fitzwilton Group in order to discuss the problems relating to the planning process which had apparently contributed to the loss of the Seibulite joint venture project.  I am circulating copies of correspondence in relation to this matter and a report on the meeting referred to with my reply.</P>
    <P>Throughout the period 1987-89 officials of my Department had been involved in a series of discussions with Rennicks Group Ltd.  about the continued suspension of the tariff duty applicable to reflective plastic sheeting &mdash; the raw material manufactured by the Seibu Polymer Chemical Corporation of Japan, for which Rennicks Group Ltd.  acted as Irish distributor.  In this regard, a meeting took place on 14 April 1989 which was attended by representatives of Rennicks Group Ltd.  and by the then Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Dr. Sean McCarthy, who was accompanied by officials of the then Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I have tried to respond to the Deputy's question in as comprehensive a manner as possible. However if there is any aspect in respect of which the Deputy would like clarification, I would be happy to seek to do so.</P>

    <P>1.  <i>Background</i></P>
    <P>Rennicks Group Ltd.  was established in 1976 and during the period 1976 to 1985 was approved a total of £370k and received payments in the same period of £310k.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 five key projects were approved which were for further expansion of the company's existing business and projects to add on new products.  A total of £2.5m in grants and preference shares was approved for Rennicks during this period of which total payments of £1.9m have been made.</P>
    <P>The company created 200 new jobs since 1985.  A comparison of all moneys paid including capital grants, preference shares and R&amp;D Grants indicate that 66% of the projected jobs target had been achieved while 70% of the moneys had been disbursed.</P>

    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>It was a pleasure to meet you at lunch today in Milltown but I did not find an appropriate time to raise an issue which may be of some embarrassment to you.  This letter is by way of information only and I do not think there is anything you can do at this stage to change the course of events because of our complex planning procedures.</P>
    <P>Fitzwilton Plc have 51% of a company called Rennicks Manufacturing who make reflective number plates and road signs.  Rennicks have been supplied by a Japanese company over a long number of years.  Because of European tariffs and increased costs in Japan, the Japanese company wish to relocate in Europe.  Because of its close connection with Rennicks they were persuaded to locate in Ireland.  A joint venture agreement was signed whereby the total manufacturing plant would be closed in Japan and transferred to Ireland and 200 immediate jobs would be created.</P>
    <P>Negotiations took place with <i>the IDA</i> and a grant aid package was agreed.  <i>They persuaded us</i> to locate the factory in Kilcoole, Co Wicklow.  This industry is a chemical industry but meets the highest US and European pollution control standards. However residents in Kilcoole objected.  A judicial review is under way and An Bord Pleanála is considering an objection.  This process can take some considerable time and the Japanese became impatient.</P>
    <P>Some two months ago we commenced negotiations with the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland and I met the Minister for Industry, Richard Needham, there two weeks ago.  <i>We have agreed in principle to locate the plant now in Northern lreland.</i></P>
    <P>We know we can commence operations next September because of different planning laws.  For the Japanese, who are trying to close down a plant and build up a stock for the market during the closedown, they required definite time tables which we cannot give them in the Republic.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the point that it was not our intention to locate outside the Republic of Ireland or was it our intention to play the IDB off against the IDA.  Peculiarities of the planning laws in this country have forced the industry North and the IDA seem unable to come up with an alternative proposal.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention to make any big deal out of the situation, however our decision to locate in the North could cause you some embarrassment and therefore I felt you should be fully informed.  The formalities are unlikely to be complete before early January.</P>
    <P>Kind regards</P>

      <P>The adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel reflected the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against United Nations and associated personnel.  Attacks against or other mistreatment of personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations are unjustifiable and unacceptable.</P>

    <P>The current international position is that the convention is not yet in force and will not enter into force until 30 days after the deposit with the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession of 22 countries.  As of 3 June 1998, 43 states had signed the convention and 18 states were parties to it.  Given that the convention remained open for signature until <Col N="1521" /> 31 December 1995, Ireland is not now in a position to sign the convention.  In order to become party to the convention, Ireland will have to proceed by way of accession.</P>
    <P>It is clear from an examination of the terms of the convention that domestic legislative measures will have to be enacted in order to give effect to the provisions of the convention in Irish law.

      <P>Procedures to ensure compliance with the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act were formally introduced in the Department in January 1998. Within the terms of the Act one minor payment of interest has been made by the Department to date and one is outstanding, details available on request.  Each of the agencies under the aegis of the Department, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, Refugee Agency, National Committee for Development Education and Irish Aid Advisory Committee, has put its own procedures in place to facilitate prompt payments.  The operation of the various procedures is being monitored with a view to any necessary improvements. In the case of the Department it is intended to enhance prompt payment procedures in the context of an upgrade of the electronically based financial management system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>Road haulage activities in the member states of the European Union are regulated in accordance with EU directives.  Under Irish law, made pursuant to those directives, all applicants for a road freight carriers licence must comply with the following criteria while their licence remains in force.</P>
      <P>They must be of good repute; be of appropriate financial standing: a licence holder must hold a current tax clearance certificate and show that it holds at least 3,000 ecu in capital and reserves per vehicle to be operated by the business; and satisfy the condition of professional competence: a licence holder must hold a certificate of professional competence qualification to manage the business.</P>
      <P>An amending directive, currently being considered by the institutions of the European Union and likely to come into effect in late 1999, will see a significant raising of the criteria for road haulage licensing.  In particular, the level of capital and reserves required to be held by a licensee will be increased.</P>
      <P>A major consultancy review of the road haulage sector in Ireland is currently under way and is likely to be concluded towards the end of this year.  The terms of reference for the review include consideration of the adequacy of the current national and EU legislative and regulatory environment.  I will give careful consideration to any recommendations concerning the regulation of the sector which impact on my Department's responsibilities.</P>
      <P>My Department has 31 staff engaged in the regulation of the road haulage industry, of which an inspectorate of nine transport officers and four support staff is engaged full time in the detection and prosecution of breaches of the tachograph regulations and offences under the Road Transport Acts.  The recent campaign launched against illegal road haulage activities was successfully undertaken with the existing complement of staff. The Garda Síochána also enforce regulatory requirements relating to the haulage sector.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to review the agreement made by her Department in regard to the rebate of rent payable on the Ryanair head office at Dublin Airport, particularly in view of the very substantial profits the company has been making for many years; when it is expected that the full annual rent will become payable; the reason the full rebate was given to a company (details supplied) which was controlled by persons (details supplied) if, as has been suggested, the rent rebate was intended to assist a struggling airline; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this company continued to charge Ryanair rent of £200,000 in each year from 1992 to 1996 resulting in these persons being the principal beneficiaries of the arrangement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I set out the full position concerning the rental agreement in relation to the Ryanair head office at Dublin Airport in my comprehensive statement to the House on 26 February 1998. I should point out that this agreement, which was vetted by Aer Rianta's legal and financial advisers, represents a commercially sound arrangement from the point of view of the State.</P>
      <P>The position is that full annual rent will apply from 2010 for the duration of the lease.  The agreement is a commercial one and is not unique. On expiry of the lease, Ryanair will surrender full and vacant possession of the site and building in good and substantial repair to the State.  Finally, the business arrangements between the two companies referred to by the Deputy are a matter for those two companies.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table and includes airlines which operated new scheduled services or which achieved growth traffic on existing routes.</P>
      <P>These discount schemes have contributed positively to the growth of traffic at the State airports from 9.3 million in 1994 to 13.4 million in 1997, an increase of 43 per cent.  Over this period, air travellers and all the commercial companies in the Irish aviation sector have benefited considerably from these growth conditions.  The schemes have helped airlines to keep fares low.  Improved financial performances by the airports and the airlines have been the result.  These aviation conditions have in turn been a major driver of the performance of our tourism sector over this period.</P>
      <P>This unprecedented growth in air traffic has resulted in a need to accelerate the capital development programme at all three airports.</P>

      <P>It would be inappropriate to speculate on the impact of the sale of TEAM on the group balance sheet as no such proposal has been finalised.  TEAM's accumulated losses have been recognised in the Aer Lingus group accounts on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The £175 million in Government equity supported the Cahill plan and was necessary to ensure the survival of the group.  It is my overriding concern to ensure that all actions proposed secure the maximum level of employment in both the airline and TEAM into the future.</P>

      <P>My Department has put in place the necessary systems to ensure that all of the conditions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, which came into force on 2 January 1998, are complied with.  To date only a small number of interest penalty payments have been necessary. No formal complaints have been received by my Department in relation to delay in payments.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the year, all State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department were reminded of the conditions and their responsibilities in relation to the Act.  However, the implementation of these conditions is an operational matter for the State bodies concerned and I have no statutory function.</P>
      <P>In conformity with the Act, my Department will lodge with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment a review of its payment practice which subsequently will be available in the Oireachtas Library.  Each State-sponsored body will include details of its payment practice in its annual report.</P>

      <P>Peltor passive ear muffs from a centralised pool held by the unit are issued to all FCA personnel carrying out range practices.  When exchanging ear muffs members of the FCA are recommended to use peltor clean paper pads.  These are thin paper pads which are adhesively attached to the surface of the ear muff in contact with the ear.  Their purpose is for hygiene only and does not affect the attenuation of noise or protection which the ear muff gives.</P>
      <P>One thousand pads were issued to the Southern Command in 1997, of which 390 were issued to FCA units.  It is my intention to provide FCA personnel with individual sets of ear muffs as soon as practicable.</P>

    <P>In January 1998, ten communications information <Col N="1527" /> services technician apprentices commenced training in the Army Apprentice School, Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare.

At present my Department has no proposals for the expansion of the role of the Army Apprentice School.</P>

Keenness of hearing is subdivided into seven grades.  Only if an individual's hearing is diagnosed to be within the seventh category, grade X, that is, severely impaired hearing where an improvement is not expected, will he or she be considered below Defence Forces hearing standards.</P>

      <P>The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, came into operation on 2 January 1998.  The Act requires Government Departments, semi-State bodies, etc.  to make payment to suppliers of goods and services:</P>
      <P>&mdash;on or before the date on which payment is due under the terms of a written contract, or</P>
      <P>&mdash;where there is no written contract, or if the written contract does not specify a payment date, within 45 days of receipt of the invoice or delivery of the goods or services, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>If payment is not made by the due date, penalty interest must be paid on the outstanding amount in respect of the period beginning on the date after the due date of payment and ending on the actual payment date.  The interest rate is 0.0322 per cent per day or 11.75 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>Appropriate modifications were introduced to departmental and military financial and accounting systems and payment procedures to take account of the requirements imposed by the Act and to minimise the amount of penalty interest payable.  To date, interest payments totalling £766 have been made.  No complaints have been received in regard to late payments.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Act is monitored by the Department on an ongoing basis.</P>

This year it is proposed to enlist 500 general service recruits.  To date, 300 applicants have been offered positions as general service recruits.  The deployment of military personnel, including recruits on completion of their recruit training, is a matter for the military authorities having regard to the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>At present three military hospitals are being operated by the Army Medical Corps.  They are St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, the Curragh Military Hospital and a hospital at Collins Barracks, Cork.  The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-98 states that a military hospital providing general medical, surgical, some specialist services and medical supplies will be located at St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that medical support in the Curragh Camp will be provided by a military medical facility which will continue all current out-patient medical and occupational services, including dental and pharmacy services.  The facility will also have an infirmary which will replace the existing hospital.  Cork military hospital will also become a military medical facility which will continue to provide the present out-patient services and will have a small infirmary.</P>
      <P>Separate budgetary details in respect of the three military hospitals are not normally quantified as the hospitals are operated as part of the services provided by the Army Medical Corps. However, there are no plans to reduce the amount of funding provided in the Estimates in respect of medical services for the Defence Forces. The total overall cost of operating the Army Medical Corps is approximately £13 million per year.</P>
      <P>The Curragh Military Hospital provides an out-patient clinic and medication without charge to the dependants of enlisted personnel who reside in the Curragh Camp and its environs.  The report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, observed that this facility is inequitable to those soldiers whose dependants are not located at the Curragh Camp and its environs.  The commission recommended that the special arrangements for soldiers' dependants at the Curragh Hospital be phased out.</P>
      <P>Other than the medical facility at the Curragh, there is no access to military hospitals for the families and immediate dependants of either serving or retired members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Following the opening of Phase 1 of the Collins Barracks Museum facility, it was considered essential by the caretaker board of the National Museum of Ireland that an exhibition strategy for the complete <Col N="1535" /> site be formulated to address the specific needs and plans of the museum in the future.  To this end a firm of international consultants was engaged by the then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and I understand the firm has now submitted an exhibit strategy to that Department where it is under consideration.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place between the military authorities, officials of the National Museum of Ireland and the consultants and I am advised that agreement in principle has been reached regarding the establishment of a military museum section in the National Museum complex at Collins Barracks.  In this regard much further discussion will be necessary in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable arrangement and my Department is pursuing the matter with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

Following my acceptance of the recommendations of the quota review group which gave priority for the allocation of quota from this reserve to eligible applicants with low livestock units, all available quota has now been utilised by eligible applicants with less than 5.8 livestock units.  As the person named already has 7.8 livestock units &mdash; suckler cow quota of six premium centers and special beef premium livestock units of 1.8 &mdash; he is not eligible to receive an allocation of quota from the 1998 national reserve.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has calculated the level of lost revenue to the Exchequer resulting from the increasing level of illegal road haulage activity which does not comply with the rules governing income tax, PRSI, insurance and the payment of fuel duties.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13281/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, given the difficulty of determining the extent of illegal activity, it is not feasible to calculate the Exchequer loss in income tax, PRSI, insurance and rebated fuel duties as a result of black economy activity in the road haulage industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been further advised by the Revenue Commissioners, however, that they have adopted <Col N="1539" /> a multi-faceted approach, in co-operation with other Government Departments and State agencies, to combating black economy activity, including black economy activity in the road haulage industry.  Following are some of the most prominent strategies being pursued in this area: programmes by special inquiry branch and local inquiry units &mdash; in tax districts nationwide &mdash; to identify non-registered taxable persons; programmes to identify non-compliance with the VAT Acts; cross-Revenue programmes involving both inspectors of taxes and customs and excise officers for specific projects; ongoing co-operation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs through joint investigation units to identify PAYE/PRSI abuses; liaison with the Garda on projects targeting specific trading sectors; and continued membership of the black economy monitoring group to identify and respond to black economy activity in the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In addition to these general measures, the Revenue Commissioners have also targeted black economy activity specifically in the road haulage industry as follows: S.I. No. 67/1995 provides that applicants for road haulage licences must produce a current tax clearance certificate from the collector general before the licence can be granted.  The tax clearance certificate will not be granted to licence applicants where Revenue records indicate that the applicant has not submitted returns of income by the due dates and-or has arrears of tax and, in that instance, the applicant is required to bring his tax affairs up-to-date before a certificate is granted.  A special multi-agency operation involving Revenue, the Garda, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment and Local Government was conducted some time ago in order to check compliance levels in the industry. The operation involved the stopping of trucks. The operations uncovered a number of irregularities which are being followed up by the appropriate agency.</P>
    <P>It is Revenue policy to prosecute even for first offences where road hauliers and other commercial operators are detected using rebated fuel illegally.  In November 1997, a memorandum of understanding, MOU, was drawn up between Revenue and the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, in order to strengthen co-operation between the parties in the gathering of information and the investigation of offences in relation to the smuggling of drugs and excise products.  Under the MOU, guidelines are being formulated aimed at assisting IRHA member companies in detecting and preventing the carriage of illicit goods in or on their vehicles.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that section 90 of the 1998 Finance Act contained a provision to combat a new source of duty evasions whereby <Col N="1540" /> rebated diesel carried in trailer tanks for purposes such as refrigeration is diverted to power the cab unit.</P>

      <P>In October, 1997, my colleague Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs gave details, on behalf of the Government, regarding additional funding of £5.875 million, from savings in the 1997 Social Welfare Vote, made available in grants to voluntary organisations to assist people with disabilities, older people and other disadvantaged groups.  Of this money, £4.325 million was made available for voluntary organisations working with people with physical and sensory disabilities to cover a range of aids, appliances and other equipment to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say what decision Government might make in relation to such savings, if any, at the end of this year.  However, a total of £8.4 million additional funding has been provided this year for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, £2.4 million to eliminate underfunding of existing services, £3 million for the development of existing services and £3 million for capital expenditure.  Substantial funding for aids and appliances will be provided from these funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The inspector of Mental Hospitals has a statutory obligation to inspect each psychiatric hospital and unit in the country at least once a year and to submit a report to the Minister in this respect.  In his report for 1996, the inspector highlights and is complimentary of further improvements which have taken place in the mental health services.  The inspector notes that the continued development in 1996 of a comprehensive and integrated community-based mental health service was characterised by the ongoing reduction in the number of patients resident in psychiatric hospitals through rehabilitation of long-stay patients, the transfer of acute psychiatric hospital care to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals and the further extension of community-based services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommended planning norms for the development of community facilities are set out in the policy document for the development of mental health services Planning for the Future published in 1984 and are also included in appendix 2 of the 1996 inspector's report.  These planning norms are continuously reviewed by the inspector.  The norms outlined in the 1996 report <Col N="1542" /> are higher than those recommended in Planning for the Future and are intended to reflect the need to increase places in community facilities with the continuing transfer of in-patient services to more appropriate facilities in the community. Health boards are continuing to develop community facilities in line with the higher planning norms.  In his report, the inspector also makes recommendations for the improvement of services in each catchment area.  These are reviewed and implemented by the health boards on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium in relation to people with disabilities is to ensure the needs of these people, their families and carers are comprehensively addressed through a wide range of measures in the health, social, leisure and sporting areas.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium is the implementation of the Report on the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which deals with the broader areas of social and economic integration of people with disabilities.  My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is due to send the report of the interdepartmental committee on the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the report of the Review <Col N="1543" /> Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an lndependent Future, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of services for such people including day care, respite care, residential care, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and home support services including personal assistance.  The process of implementing the review group's report is under way and the health boards have put in place co-ordinating committees which will examine and make recommendations on the future development of services at local level.  In 1998 £8.4 million is being provided for the maintenance and development of the services needs identified in Towards an Independent Future.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for persons with a mental handicap, the Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which was published by my Department last year and is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, sets out the level of unmet need and the changing pattern of need over the next few years.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential/ respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question, at a revenue cost of £63.5 million. There are also associated capital costs.  As outlined in An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
    <P>Sixteen million pounds additional revenue and capital funding was made available in 1998.  Last December, I announced the formation of a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services which will run over four years in tandem with the Assessment of Need.  This programme is essential to ensure that the necessary physical infrastructure is in place to enable the new residential, respite and day services to be provided. The regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee structure will continue to work at local level to co-ordinate service developments and identify priority needs for the future.  Having regard to the number of pressing needs for funding in the health services, I am satisfied that the level of funding I have outlined is an indication of the commitment of this Government to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 and amending legislation a member of an Garda Síochána may remove to a Garda station a person believed to be of unsound mind who should for public safety or the safety of the person himself or herself, be placed under care and control. Once removed to the Garda station, the member of the Garda Síochána shall apply to a registered medical practitioner for a recommendation for the detention of the person as a person of unsound mind in a district mental hospital.  The Act also provides for members of an Garda Síochána to assist in conveying to hospital a patient the subject of an application for detention of a person of unsound mind.  However, the Garda are not empowered to assist with the conveyance of persons who are the subject of applications for temporary detention orders.</P>
      <P>New mental health legislation, currently being prepared, will set out clearly the precise role of an Garda Síochána in assisting, where necessary, health professionals in ensuring that persons who need to be detained are conveyed to hospital with the minimum delay.  The publication of the Green Paper on Mental Health in 1992 identified issues to be addressed in new mental health legislation, including procedures relating to involuntary admission to psychiatric in-patient facilities.  A lengthy consultative process followed which led to the publication of the White Paper &mdash; A New Mental Health Act in 1995.  The White Paper outlined, in general terms, the content of new mental health legislation following the consideration of views of interested parties.  In the circumstances a further review of procedures as requested by the Deputy would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>Children's hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area have traditionally provided emergency beds for children taken into care by the board for whom more appropriate accommodation cannot be provided immediately.</P>
      <P>I met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board recently together with other senior board officials and one of the issues discussed was the question of admissions to hospitals in these circumstances.  The chief executive officer assured me that the board is developing services which will minimise the need to admit children to hospitals for social reasons.</P>
      <P>In regard to the development of an out of hours service by health boards, this is primarily an operational issue.  In any event, the requirements for such a service will vary from board to board.  The Health Service Employers Agency has recently set up a working group to discuss this issue and my Department is represented on this group.</P>
      <P>The responsibilities of the Garda Síochána under the Child Care Act, 1991, are set out in the Act as follows: section 12 &mdash; power of Garda Síochána to take a child to safety &mdash; section 13 &mdash; power of Garda Síochána to enter premises on foot of a warrant &mdash; section 35 &mdash; power of Garda Síochána to search for and deliver up a child on foot of a warrant &mdash; section 46 &mdash; authority to take all reasonable steps to return a child to care in response to a request from a health board, power to enter premises on foot of a warrant search for a child and, if found, to return the child to the custody of the board &mdash; section 74 &mdash; power to seize and destroy solvents.</P>

      <P>The policy document Planning for the Future published in 1984 has been accepted by successive Governments as the blueprint for the development of mental health services.  A key recommendation of that document is that a community-based mental health service be developed to replace the traditional model of care which relied predominantly on in-patient treatment in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> Substantial progress has been and continues to be made in implementing this policy and in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting.  Health boards have developed and are continuing to develop a modern, comprehensive community-based mental health service.  This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services.  I am satisfied that health boards continue to give priority to the development of community facilities for the mentally ill and I am confident that further improvements will be achieved in the coming years.</P>

      <P>There is no drug by the name of Ventison available in this country.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the drug called Fentazin.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria for the inclusion of products under the general medical services &mdash; GMS &mdash; scheme is that the price of any medicine to be included under this scheme must comply with the current pricing agreement in place with the industry. The price of drugs and medicines &mdash; ex-manufacturer &mdash; in Ireland has been controlled through the mechanism of a succession of agreements between the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company originally responsible for the supply of Fentazin in Ireland transferred the responsibility for the supply of this product to another company.  This company stated that it was unable to supply Fentazin to the Irish market under the terms and conditions of the pricing <Col N="1547" /> agreement in place with the industry and therefore the product was considered inappropriate for reimbursement under any of the community drug schemes.</P>
    <P>Health boards may provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines which are not covered by the GMS scheme.  Assistance of this kind is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide and I have forwarded details regarding this case to the Western Health Board for consideration.  I have requested that the board reply directly to the Deputy on the matter.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme provides, among other services, prescribed drugs and medicines free of charge to persons who would be unable to provide these items for themselves without suffering undue hardship.  It is not currently considered that nicotine patches come within the criteria of products which are required to fulfil this role.  Therefore, it is not intended to make these patches available on the GMS scheme.</P>

    <P>However, I should add that each year the health promotion unit of my Department conducts a national multi-media anti-smoking campaign to encourage smokers to give up and nonsmokers to refrain from taking up the habit.  Evaluation of the last such initiative indicated that future campaigns need to &ldquo;emphasise the positive&rdquo; and offer smoking cessation interventions in addition to advising the target audience of the dangers of smoking.  Details of a new campaign are, at present, being finalised by a team involving a partnership between my Department, the <Col N="1548" /> Irish Cancer Society and the eight regional health boards.  It is envisaged that this campaign will incorporate support for those trying to quit through the availability of a &ldquo;national quitline&rdquo; assisted by a range of on-the-ground interventions at local level.</P>

      <P>Prior to this legislation coming into place, my Department circulated all the relevant details to the agencies under my aegis and requested them to make all necessary arrangements to fully implement this legislation.  In addition, when advising agencies of the funding allocations for 1998, my Department again advised agencies of their obligations in regard to prompt payments. In the context of agreeing with agencies their cash drawdown profiles for 1998, specific provision was made to increase cash drawdowns in January of 1998 to allow for the additional cash flows necessary due to agencies moving from a 45 day average to a 45 day limit.  The arrangements put in place fully supported health agencies in meeting their obligations under the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the matters of non-compliance, payment of interest and receipt of complaints regarding non-payment on time, I am not aware of any major difficulty in the health sector regarding the operation of the legislation.  In the matter of complaints, my Department has received just three, none of which related to non-payment within the 45 day limit, all of which are in the process of being dealt with.</P>
      <P>In relation to interest payments, if any, incurred by agencies, the legislation provides for the issue of guidelines by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on disclosure by relevant agencies of their payment practices in their annual accounts/reports.  There are no arrangements for the provision of interim reports. The day-to-day operational compliance is a matter for individual agencies.  However, my Department has assisted, and will continue to assist, health agencies in meeting their obligations so if problems emerge they will be kept to a minimum.</P>

      <P>The approved bed complement in the Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospitals totals 534.  The bed designations have not yet been finalised for the new hospital.  However, when the new hospital opens in Tallaght later this month, 462 beds will be available.  In addition to this, 56 psychiatric beds will come on stream later.  There is also the potential for utilising 16 accident and emergency observation beds.  When the bed designations are finalised by the hospital management, there may be a slight reduction, nine beds, to allow for private/semi-private designations in both in-patient and day-care facilities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the hospital will in addition to the above have exclusive access to an inner city 35 bed Eastern Health Board facility which will cater for patients who otherwise would inappropriately occupy acute beds in the hospital.  This brings the total beds available on opening to 504 compared to the 534 beds available in the base hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the hospital management is currently finalising its arrangements to proceed with construction of a private wing which when completed will ensure that overall there will be no decrease in beds available to the hospital.  In the interim, the hospital, in association with the Department and the Eastern Health Board where appropriate, will be examining ways of enhancing its patient management systems under the following headings: pre-admission systems &mdash; admission avoidance; accident and emergency system improvement; admission process flow; and more efficient discharge planning.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board facility referred to above is an example of the kind of measure which can ease pressure on acute hospital beds.  In addition, increased use of day care and the enhanced Out Patient facilities in the hospital, which will be available in October 1998, will have a direct effect on the productivity of the hospital.</P>

      <P>The number of beds in publicly funded acute hospitals for the years 1977, 1982 and 1987 were 14,965, 15,106 and 13,131 respectively.  These figures refer to the total bed complement at 31 December and a breakdown into public and private beds is not available.

      <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on bed numbers as a measure of hospital resources.  In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in acute hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care and a marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.</P>

In line with these commitments, an interdepartmental working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, has been set up to review the carer's allowance.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It is also examining the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.</P>
      <P>As part of the review process, a series of very useful meetings have been held with a wide number of interest groups and other interested parties. The review is expected to be completed in the middle of this year and it will be published.</P>

      <P>The group has met on two occasions to date. As I also indicated in my reply to the previous question, my intention was that the White Paper be published before the end of the year. However, at their most recent meeting on 28 May 1998, members of the group expressed concern that this might be too tight a timeframe to allow for adequate consultation with the voluntary and community sector and asked that this timeframe be extended for some three months or so to ensure that time is available for the widest range of voluntary and community groups to be involved in discussions and debate about the forthcoming White Paper.  As my primary concern in the preparation of the White Paper is to ensure that it reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard, I have agreed to this request.</P>

      <P>Informal contacts have been continuing between my Department and the Garda Representative Association since the association's Annual Delegate Conference last month.  The purpose of those contacts is to try to agree a formula which would enable the association to call off its protest action and return to the pay discussions.</P>
      <P>The official side made an offer of 5.5 per cent pay increase to the Garda Representative Association. On the recommendation of Mr. Declan Brennan, the independent chairman of the pay discussions, an increase of a further 1.5 per cent was offered based on anticipated productivity and savings.  These are the only offers official or unofficial which were made to the association.</P>

    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that there are official marked patrol cars allocated to both Garda stations which are utilised in patrolling the sub-districts.  I understand that policing of the Rathdrum and Roundwood areas is augmented as required by personnel from adjoining Garda stations.  In addition, the divisional <Col N="1560" /> traffic corps and district detective unit patrol the area on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities report that they are satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in the Rathdrum and Roundwood sub-districts with the current deployment of resources.  However, they have assured me that the situation will be kept under review and that when additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of these sub-districts will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of other districts throughout the country.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, his Department is taking to eliminate the discrimination between rural and city schools in relation to the teacher to pupil ratio as a result of the breaking the cycle scheme introduced by his Department in 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 which was introduced as part of the special support package for certain schools included in the urban dimension of the breaking the cycle pilot project.</P>
      <P>I should first point out that this special ratio is strictly confined to the junior classes of the schools in question and does not have wider application within those schools.</P>
      <P>The decision to include the reduced pupil teacher ratio as part of the support package for urban schools represents a distinct response to the assessed needs of those schools as identified in a detailed study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>In the case of both the urban and rural dimensions of the pilot project a specific package of support measures was devised to address the particular problems of educational disadvantage as manifested in urban and rural settings.</P>
      <P>Many of the features of the supports provided are common to both urban and rural areas.  For example, in both cases the selected schools are in receipt of special additional funding for the purchase of materials/equipment and to support out of school initiatives.  Teachers in all the selected schools are being supported by special targeted in-career development.  The schools selected to participate in the rural dimension of the scheme are grouped into 25 local clusters each of which is served by a special locally based co-ordinator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular approaches adopted in respect of urban and rural schools under the pilot phase of the programme represent a testing of models <Col N="1565" /> of response which seek to address the specific difficulties presented in urban and rural areas.  The operation of the breaking the cycle pilot project is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate and is also being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  One of the key issues to be covered in the review will be the question of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the two distinct approaches, both urban and rural, which are being tested under the pilot project.</P>

      <P>I am currently reviewing the range of support services provided by my Department to combat educational disadvantage, including supports provided through the home/school/community liaison scheme.

      <P>Following on the evaluation of primary and second level accommodation requirements of the Naas area carried out by the planning section of my Department, a number of strategies were devised to cater for short and long-term needs in the area.</P>
      <P>At primary level, temporary accommodation is being provided as a matter of urgency to cater for immediate needs.  In the long-term, it has been decided that an additional primary school will be required.  A suitable location for a new school has been identified and this is being pursued locally with the owners and the local authority.</P>
      <P>At second level, building projects have been approved for all three postprimary schools in the centre.  Two of these projects will provide additional permanent accommodation at Meánscoil Iognáid Rís and St. Mary's College.  The third is a refurbishment of St. Patrick's vocational school which currently has around 120 vacant pupil places.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a design team for the Meánscoil Iognáid Rís project is currently in progress. Proposals from the school in this regard are expected shortly.  The school has also requested that the Department approve a further 100 pupil places in the extension.  This matter will be processed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The project at St. Mary's College has reached stage 4 of my Department's design team procedures, the detailed design stage.  The submission of this stage is awaited from the school and, again, is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>The indications are that there will be sufficient second level pupil places between the three schools to meet the immediate demand in the centre.  It is anticipated that the building projects in hand will further ease any pressure for places. Developments in the centre will continue to be closely monitored by my Department to ensure that any additional emerging requirements are addressed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The importance of the role of parents as the first teachers of their children was one of the key issues to emerge at the recent national forum on early childhood education.  In its discussion on this issue, the forum also highlighted the variety of State agencies involved in the provision of early education services and stressed the need to co-ordinate and streamline service delivery in this area.</P>
      <P>A report on the proceedings and conclusions of the forum is currently being prepared by the independent secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of this report, it is my intention to publish a White Paper on early childhood education.  The White Paper will address in a comprehensive manner the variety of educational issues raised in the forum, including those involved in the Government's commitment to the parents as first teachers programme.</P>

      <P>Customer service is receiving attention in all areas of my Department in particular in relation to the improvement of information for its customers.  Earlier this year it published a statement on customer service which outlined its approach to this important issue.  As part of the initiative on customer service, specific focus groups have been set up in the planning and building unit and in the higher education grants section, where the focus is on external customers, and in personnel section, where the focus is on internal customers.  It is intended to establish further groups later this year in other areas of the Department yet to be finalised.  Participants in these groups, who may either be nominated or volunteer to be involved, are representative of both management and line staff.  No formal reports are produced by these groups.  Instead they focus on preparing action plans which are constantly evolving as the needs of customers change and/or are clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, for the first time the Government has provided extra substantial dedicated finance, for the funding of research and development, through the Department of Education and Science.  The new allocation of £5 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science, for recurrent funding of research and development projects.  This funding is to be made available for research and development in the humanities, the social sciences and science and technology.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday 26 May, I announced arrangements for the programme of scientific and technological research in third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme, to be administered through the Higher Education Authority, is as follows: £3.5 million will be set aside for science <Col N="1575" /> and technology proposals, which demonstrate a link with the strategic development of the institution, from which they come.  This is the core of the programme and will involve putting in place, a system of competitive bidding, between third level institutions, for submitted research programmes, based on, and consistent with, the stated research policies and strategies of the individual institutions.  There will be a £0.5 million allocation for studentships in science and technology.  This will involve direct support for doctoral and post-doctoral students, administered through the same competitive bidding process.  A sum of £0.5 million will enable the Higher Education Authority to fund projects approved by the national research support fund board during 1998.  The remaining £0.5 million is to be set aside for proposals relating to the humanities and social sciences.  The details of these proposals are being finalised at present and will be announced soon.</P>
    <P>This funding is absolutely supplementary to the existing sources of funding for research and development, including the various teaching and research budgets, of the higher education institutions, including various schemes, administered by or on behalf of the office of science and technology at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the funding position for the national research support fund board, which is attached to my responsibilities in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the position is that the allocation to this board has increased from £7.5 million to £8.8 million over the period 1996 to 1998, which represents an increase of 17 per cent.  Out of this amount, an allocation of around £2 million <i>per annum</i>, has been allocated for basic research, over the same period.  A detailed breakdown of the actual allocations is set out in the attached table.</P>
    <P>My own appointment in the two Departments, ensures that there is effective co-ordination of Science and Technology issues and there is also ongoing contact at official level.  In addition the interdepartmental committee on science, technology and innovation, chaired by me, provides an effective mechanism for consideration of science and technology priorities between the Government Departments involved in funding science and technology.  A permanent independent advisory body, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, has been set up and this has proved to be a very valuable source of advice, on a range of issues.  In addition, Forfás has played a major role in the provision of policy advice and co-ordination, as well as promoting science and technology, for economic and social development.  These co-ordination mechanisms <Col N="1576" /> are designed to ensure that we continue to strengthen our research base, both to promote the development of indigenous industry and to help increase the level of research and development activity in foreign owned firms located in Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review his decision not to increase the resources allocated to the youth service in 1998 in view of the commitments made by the voluntary youth sector to Partnership 2000 and the vital role it can play socially if it is adequately supported.</Quest>

      <P>The overall level of resources made available for the provision of youth work services in 1998 is £13,567,000 representing an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision for 1997.  Unfortunately, due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible to provide for increases in the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives. However, I am aware that additional costs are likely to be incurred by voluntary youth organisations in meeting their commitments under Partnership 2000.  In the circumstances, additional funding is being sought for youth service provision in 1998 with a view to providing assistance towards meeting the costs involved.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to include students at Portobello College, Dublin, in the free fees and the local authority grants schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 37,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1996/97, at a cost to the Exchequer of some £77 million in 1997.  Any extension of the initiative would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints. In this regard, I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, l995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> My priority is to increase the number of places available in publicly funded colleges.  This priority was delivered on this year and will be again in the next academic year.</P>
    <P>I also draw the Deputy's attention to the legal proceedings which have been instituted in the case of Patrick Jordan, Junior, Patrick Jordan Senior and Raymond Kearns &mdash; v &mdash; the Minister for Education, Ireland and the Attorney General regarding the non-inclusion of Portobello College within the free fees initiative.  As the matter will be before the courts, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of including private colleges within the scope of the higher education grants scheme.  I would point out that the scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to l992.  An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The annual higher education grants scheme which I approve sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme.  The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions.  However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
    <P>I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants including the eligibility rules and the administration of the scheme.  In this regard, the scope of these schemes is being considered as part of an ongoing review of the existing arrangements.  This review will be completed in advance of the l998 student support schemes.  Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to grants can only be considered in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify for the Deputy that I have not proposed the establishment of a new central agency to pay grants to third level students.  I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants and in this context, I am considering the administrative arrangements for the scheme.  The report of the advisory committee on third level student support, which was published in February 1995, found the administrative arrangements to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  The advisory committee recommended that the processing of grant applications and payments be transferred to a central applications office.</P>
      <P>I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes including the case for and against transferring this activity to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>I have received the preliminary report of this working group and I am currently engaged in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, regarding a more detailed review.  This review would involve the participation of interested parties.  I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.  At this stage, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the more detailed review.</P>
