      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8b, motion re Membership of Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business; No. 8c, motion, re Ministerial Rota for Parliamentary Questions; No. 22, Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 3, Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 8b and 8c shall be decided without debate; (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 22 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and (3) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until Tuesday, 21 April 1998.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8b and 8c agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22 agreed?  Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the adjournment of the Dáil agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Government to continue its efforts to reach an agreement in the talks despite what may have proven to be a very short-term hiatus last night.  In this context, will the Government provide time today for statements on security arising from the truly terrifying discovery of a bomb in a car which was about to go across the Irish Sea?  While I compliment the Garda Síochána and all involved on their vigilance, Members want to know that measures are being taken to ensure that the Governments co-operated to stop these evil people who put so many lives at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While my party and I wish the Government every success in the negotiations which clearly reached a difficult period last night, <Col N="866" /> will the Tánaiste confirm now or later today if provision will be made for an early recall of the Dáil before 21 April if there are developments which require a discussion in the House?  While the parties on this side of the House want to be supportive and helpful to the Government in the task it is undertaking at present, they are also obliged to take account of developments and to participate in deliberations before they are finalised.  What provision has the Government made for briefing party leaders and, more importantly, enabling the House to participate in this historic process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Garda on discovering this bomb which could have caused untold death and destruction wherever its final destination may have been.  Will the Government agree to a debate in the House on the negotiations during the week it resumes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed party leaders to make brief statements and do not intend to allow a general discussion to develop on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputies Bruton, Quinn and De Rossa on the interception by the Garda Síochána of the bomb last evening.  This bomb could have had catastrophic effects on human life, property and the process which is under way.  This is the sixth occasion since 8 January that the Garda have intercepted weapons of death and destruction and I pay tribute to them for this.  They have the continued support of every right minded person and, clearly, of the parties in this House.  I am not certain it would be helpful to have statements today but perhaps the Whips can discuss after the Order of Business the possibility of taking private notice questions.</P>
      <P>On the political process, the Taoiseach had a very good meeting with the British Prime Minister last night &mdash; I spoke to the Taoiseach this morning &mdash; but clearly major differences still exist between the two sides.  We are prepared to make major changes both in terms of our Constitution and the Anglo-Irish Agreement if others have the capacity to make the kind of changes required, particularly in relation to North-South institutions. We clearly want institutions which are meaningful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke to party leaders earlier this week about developments and he will do so again when there are further developments.  I assure Deputy Quinn that the Dáil will be recalled if this is felt necessary or desirable.  We want to move forward on an agreed basis in relation to Northern Ireland.  There has been cross-party agreement on Northern Ireland in the House for some time and the Government very <Col N="867" /> much appreciates this continuing support.  As soon as there are developments the Taoiseach will talk to Deputies Bruton, De Rossa and Quinn and either Deputy Gormley or Deputy Sargent.  There are only a few days remaining and if goodwill and generosity is shown on all sides we have the capacity to reach an historic settlement. That is what the vast majority of people want us to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has indicated a way of dealing with this matter today.  I do not think we should proceed with it any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is acceptable.  I want to ask a question on a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked specifically when it is proposed to hold the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not reached agreement, as Deputy Gormley knows, but obviously legislation to facilitate holding a referendum would have to go through the Oireachtas.  There has to be a gap of 30 days so it may not be possible to have that legislation passed with a view to holding a referendum on 22 May, but all options are still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the evidence of transboundary crime in the attempted exportation of a bomb from this jurisdiction to another, will the Government revise its legislative programme <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Extradition Bill, given that the Taoiseach indicated earlier this month that we will not see the legislation to harmonise our extradition laws across the European Union until next year? Perhaps this matter could be brought forward now in light of the need to underpin any settlement with effective security arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law on extradition is satisfactory and working well.  If there were deficiencies in the current law the Government would respond speedily to correct them.  The question raised by Deputy Bruton relates to the harmonisation of extradition laws and I understand it will take until the end of next year before we will be in a position to bring forward that legislation.  If it were possible to do so more quickly that would be desirable and we will explore that aspect with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In March of last year the previous Government published the Road Transport Bill which gives effect to modernising the licensing arrangements for the haulage industry.  This Bill has not been put back on the Order Paper and the haulage industry is concerned that it has been either shelved or long fingered.  As there is no delay with the parliamentary draftsman, will the Tánaiste give a commitment that the Bill will be restored to the Order Paper immediately?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Tánaiste confirm if the Government has decided definitively that the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will be held on 22 May irrespective of any timetable in regard to the Northern Ireland talks? Has the Government given further consideration to the point made here some time ago that it would be desirable to hold both referenda on the <Col N="869" /> same day?  Bearing in mind that the Tánaiste is proposing the adjournment of the Dáil until 21 April, will she agree it is impossible now to do justice to a debate on the Northern issues before 22 May?  Will the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty go ahead on that day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not made a decision on the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is most likely that it will be held on 22 May.  In relation to a referendum on any possible outcome to the Northern Ireland negotiations, we will have to wait and see if we can reach agreement in the first instance.  The Government is anxious to move forward in that regard with the support of other parties in the House.  That will be one of the matters the Taoiseach will discuss with other party leaders.  There are mixed views about whether it would be desirable to deal with the two separate issues on the one day.  We would want to hear the views and reach agreement with other parties on that matter.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Deputy Ellis, we had a very good meeting yesterday with the Deputy, Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Smith regarding the loss of jobs in Ballinamore as a result of the proposed closure of the textile factory.  The deputation made a strong case for the establishment of a task force and I propose to respond positively to its request in a few days.  There are unique circumstances in County Leitrim.  It suffers from enormous economic deprivation and clearly bringing together the various State agencies with local interests can have a positive effect. Deputy Ellis can be assured I will respond positively to the request within a matter of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the date for the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty should be cleared up because we have been told 22 May was a definitive date.  In relation to legislation, given that we have the largest serving UN battalion in UNIFIL and other Irish officers serving abroad, will the Tánaiste indicate when it is intended to introduce legislation to give effect to the convention for the safety of UN troops and associated personnel?  I have been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it requires legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that legislation is at an early stage of preparation.  It is most likely the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will be held on 22 May, but the Government has not made a formal decision on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Some time ago Deputy Rabbitte stated in this House that the time at which &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; was broadcast was so unsociable and unfriendly in terms of the viewer that it was designed only for drunks and insomniacs. RTE broadcast yesterday's proceedings at 3.05 a.m. today.  Even the drunks and insomniacs would be asleep by that time.  In view of the fact that the proceedings of this House have to play second fiddle to &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nothing Sacred&rdquo;, &ldquo;Undercover&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rock Heroes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Holding the Baby&rdquo;, I ask you, in your capacity as Chairman of this House, to consider cancelling access of RTE to the proceedings of this House until such time as it decides to broadcast the proceedings at a more suitable hour.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Amsterdam referendum and information given to the House yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that there will be two questions in relation to the agreement which it is hoped we will arrive at in the current negotiations, what is the Tánaiste's view with regard to whether these three very complex issues should be given to the people to be decided on the one day?  What is the latest date on which the Amsterdam referendum could be held, given that the legislation has already been passed and there is a limit of 90 days within which it has to be held?</P>

      <P>It is almost certain the referendum will be held on 22 May.  We just have not made a formal decision in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have strong personal views as to when we <Col N="871" /> should hold the Northern Ireland referendum, assuming that we reach agreement but I prefer to reserve those views because clearly the Government will make a collective decision on that matter. Ministers have different views, but we would like to take on board the views of the Opposition parties because we want to have the maximum possible consensus in relation to how we move forward if there is a Northern Ireland settlement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 17 to 20, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 17, down to and including &rdquo;satisfied&rdquo; in line 20, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) (i) the tribunal has requested the amendment, or</P>
      <P>(ii) the Government with the consent of the tribunal has requested the amendment, or</P>
      <P>(iii) the Houses of the Oireachtas with the consent of the tribunal have requested the amendment,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b) the tribunal is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The thrust of amendment No. 1 is to broaden the capacity to have the terms of reference of tribunals amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally we believe this Bill is unnecessary, superfluous and restrictive.  The Government could have acceded to the request of Mr. Justice Flood to extend the terms of reference of his tribunal <Col N="873" /> in relation to planning matters by a simple resolution of this House.  We have no problem with extending the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal to include the time prior to 20 June 1985.  It is imperative that the body that established the tribunal, the Dáil under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, should have the absolute right to establish whether the terms of reference of a tribunal should be extended or amended.</P>
    <P>We totally reject what has been said in this House time and time again by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Finance, and outside the House by the Minister for the Environment, that it was not legally possible to extend the terms of reference of this tribunal, or any tribunal, without having recourse to legislation.  Our legal advice is that it could be done by a simple resolution of this House.  We believe it is legally possible to do so and that this is how it should be done.</P>
    <P>We also believe the reason the Government brought forward this legislation was its realisation that its legal advice was wrong, that it was not sustainable.  Therefore, to provide a fig leaf for itself and to protect its Attorney General it decided to bring in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The second reason was to ensure that the Ansbacher accounts cannot be investigated.  Yesterday it was alleged that the Ansbacher accounts had been overly debated.  They have been debated at length inside and outside this House, but they have not been investigated.  A key question is why there should be a reluctance on the part of the Government to investigate those accounts.  The day before yesterday the Minister made a high profile announcement to the effect that he was determined to introduce all the necessary legislative measures to stamp out fraud.  The report of the Dunnes payments tribunal sets out in clear detail gross anomalies in relation to the handling of £38 million of money for individual anonymous depositors which was shifted and shunted within and outside the jurisdiction by Guinness Mahon and by its subsidiary company in the Cayman Islands, but for some reason the Government has decided that it does not want to have these accounts investigated.  All one has to do is look at the comments of Mr. Justice McCracken where he talks about the ingenious system where Cayman Islands and Guinness Mahon deposits were in sterling, although some deposits were in other currencies, where the arrangement was that Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited paid to Irish clients interest calculated at 0.8 per cent per annum less than the interest which it received from Guinness Mahon, thus generating a small profit for Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. The currency in which the money was deposited is not known.  One need only look at the 1987 audit report of Ansbacher Cayman Limited, which states:</P>
    <P>These clients have a number of key characteristics.  They are generally undisclosed except to the senior manager of the company. The principals will not sign any documentation. <Col N="874" /> The principals do not receive any statements of account on a regular basis.  The principals only occasionally visit the company to review their affairs.  Instructions are usually received by telex from solicitors or other trustees or by telephone from the principal.  There is never any direct written instruction from the principal.</P>
    <P>If one reads the 1989 audit report of Guinness Mahon Ireland Limited, it states:</P>
    <P>A matter of particular concern to us relates to the management of the Ansbacher Cayman deposits amounting to nearly £38 million and constituting almost 35 per cent of the bank's liabilities.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken rightly called this an ingenious system whereby the money of Irish depositors was kept offshore, no record was kept of deposits in Ireland and yet an interest rate was on offer that was one eighth of 1 per cent less than if the money was deposited in Ireland.  We can talk about stamping out fraud and new restrictive measures, but the taxpayer wants to know who these people are.  Why did they resort to this so-called ingenious system?  What right have they to remain anonymous?  Will they ever be named?  Why should they be accorded such special treatment, which is effectively an amnesty?</P>
    <P>If this House decides it is appropriate to change the terms of reference of a tribunal, it should have the right to do so.  However, I emphasise that my amendment holds that this should not be foisted on a tribunal or its chairman.  There is no question of imposing additional responsibilities or broadening the terms of reference without the assent of and consultation with the chairman of the tribunal.  If evidence comes to light to sustain the argument that the terms of reference should be extended subsequent to the tribunal's establishment, then there must be consultation with the head of the tribunal following a resolution of the House.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister made a meal of saying this was technically impossible, asking what apparatus would be put in place.  In relation to the Buchanan investigation, the persons who conveyed the wishes of the House to the chairman of that investigation were the then Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.  They also received the Buchanan report.  As elected representatives we must retain the right, by resolution of the House, to change the terms of reference of a tribunal if, having consulted the tribunal chairman, it is the will of the House to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise out of the fundamental belief that this Bill is unnecessary.  It is a pity the Minister will not accept them.  The proposal that the Oireachtas be empowered to change the terms of reference of a tribunal with that tribunal's assent seems entirely reasonable. It would make the process much more efficient than would be the case if this Bill passes.  What is <Col N="875" /> happening is undesirable, it is something of an infringement on the democratic process which restricts the Oireachtas' power.</P>
      <P>The Minister obtained two pieces of advice prior to introducing this Bill.  One advocated a position in accord with my and Deputy Higgins's views, and the other gave rise to his introduction of this Bill.  What was the sequence of events? Why did he look for a second opinion and what inspired the choice of his anonymous adviser? These are important questions, and the Minister should tell us why he sought a second opinion. Which advice came first?  Was the first advice in accord with these amendments?  Who gave the second advice and what inspired the choice of that person?</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the person who gave the second advice did not act with integrity, but there are those with contrary views.  It is possible to obtain certain advice by going to somebody who is known to have those views.  It casts no aspersions on the person's integrity, but if one wants to hear a certain opinion, it is possible to find someone who holds that opinion.  Why did the Minister stop at the second opinion?  Why did he not seek further opinions when the first two he received were contradictory?  Is this normal practice?  Does the Minister usually seek a second opinion?</P>
      <P>We have debated the Ansbacher matter over and over.  Will those people be named?  That is my final question.  Will we hear the full story if they have broken the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that an instrument establishing a tribunal and which applies the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to the tribunal should be amended pursuant to a resolution of the Oireachtas where the tribunal has requested it and is satisfied that such amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>On Second and Committee Stages, I indicated that the policy of the Bill was to ensure that any amendment of the instrument establishing a tribunal of inquiry and incorporating its terms of reference should guard against the possibility of a successful challenge to a tribunal.  I have heard nothing to change my opinion that the Bill's approach is the safest one and that the conditions in section 1(a), and (b) of the Bill would achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first safeguard, that the tribunal must have requested the amendment, ensures that when a tribunal seeks information, considers whether such information is within its remit and starts to take evidence, it can proceed in the knowledge that a change in terms of reference will be rare and only on its own initiative.  This approach is supported by the terms of reference of the McCracken tribunal, as set out in the instrument <Col N="876" /> signed by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, on 7 February 1997 which comprehends an extension in the terms of reference of that tribunal following a recommendation by the tribunal.  When it is contemplated by a tribunal that a change be made to its terms of reference, the Bill's second safeguard is that the tribunal must be satisfied that that would not prejudice the legal rights of anyone who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its original terms of reference.</P>
    <P>These safeguards take account of the undeniable fact that the tribunal is best placed, given the facts before it, to determine the precise nature of any amendment.  This is the more certain way to proceed if we are to guard against challenges to tribunals.  To do otherwise would be completely irresponsible.</P>
    <P>It is important to again outline to the House the comments of the 1966 Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry on the terms of reference of tribunals.  It stated:</P>
    <P>In view of the inquisitorial nature of the proceedings of the Tribunal, the terms of reference require careful consideration and should be drawn as precisely as possible .</P>
    <P>The Act lays down, rightly in our view, that what is to be inquired into shall be a &lsquo;definite matter&rsquo;.  The reference should confine the inquiry to the investigation of the definite matter which is causing a crisis of public confidence. On the other hand it is essential that Tribunals should not be fettered by terms of reference which are too narrowly drawn.</P>
    <P>The commission was of the view that well defined terms of reference were essential to the effective operation of the tribunal.  Nowhere in its report did it contemplate any amendment to the terms of reference of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on Government and the Legislature to ensure that proper terms of reference are drawn up when a tribunal is being established. Following the interim report of the Flood Tribunal, the Government accepts that there may be circumstances where a tribunal, with the evidence before it, will wish to seek a change in its terms of reference.  In those circumstances, the tribunal is uniquely placed to make such a request.  However, it is reasonable to assume that such requests from tribunals will be rare.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2, tabled by Deputy Upton, would allow amendment of a tribunal's terms of reference even if the tribunal had not requested the amendment or consented to it.  The tribunal would then be charged with establishing whether the proposed amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who co-operated with or provided information to it.  The task of establishing whether the proposed amendment would prejudice the rights of any person could be sizeable, involving the tribunal in a review of the evidence before it.  If the tribunal were to report that the proposed amendment would prejudice the rights of individuals, it is not beyond the bounds <Col N="877" /> of possibility that the process of consultation with the tribunal, and possible redrafts of amendments of terms of reference by the Oireachtas, would begin again.  It is not clear what procedure the Oireachtas would follow when consulting the tribunal. The amendment is silent on that issue. Therefore, with all due respect, the Labour Party amendment is extraordinary.  If it were passed by the House it would turn the entire process on its head.</P>
    <P>These comments apply by and large to paragraphs <i>(a)</i>(i) and (iii) of amendment No. 1 tabled by Deputy Higgins, although it at least acknowledges that the consent of the tribunal would be a necessary prerequisite to amend its terms of reference. Nonetheless, amendment No. 2 leaves open the possibility of toing and froing between the Government or the Oireachtas and a tribunal on proposed changes in its terms of reference that might lead nowhere and could create tension between the Government or the Oireachtas and the tribunal at a crucial time when it had already commenced its work.  It is conceivable that the Government would have to redraft changes in the terms of reference following the necessary consultations with a tribunal.</P>
    <P>On each occasion, the tribunal would be in a position to veto the proposals for amendment.  In cases where the Oireachtas initiated the change in terms of reference, the same problem would arise.  It is not clear what procedure the Oireachtas would be expected to follow when consulting the tribunal.  Amendment No. 1 is silent on this issue.  It is also silent as to who would make the instrument which would amend the instrument establishing the tribunal because it proposes to delete the words &ldquo;by a Minister of the Government&rdquo; from the new section 1(a) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments are ill-conceived, ill-judged and must be rejected.  The Bill as it stands comprehends the current request from the Flood Tribunal, but also takes into account any future requests of a similar nature.  It sets out the strict conditions which must be satisfied prior to the initiation of the process under which the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal can be amended. The Bill achieves a proper framework on which the law in relation to sitting tribunals can operate without prejudice to parties before them.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition again adverted to whether legislation is required.  I have resolutely defended the Government's position by stating categorically that it is my view and that of the Government that legislation is required.  When they were last in Government &mdash; which, unfortunately, is not long ago &mdash; Members of the Opposition were advised that primary legislation was necessary by way of amendment of section 1 of the 1921 Act to expressly provide for amendment of an instrument incorporating terms of reference in appointing a tribunal to which the 1921 Act is applied.  However, they would now like to deny this.  It is clear from the provisions of the order that Government made on 7 February 1997 setting <Col N="878" /> up the Dunnes payments tribunal that I am correct.  They envisaged the possible necessity for a further resolution of the Dáil and Seanad in the event of any matters arising before that tribunal and specific provision was made in the original order providing for this amendment.  Thus, the order allowed the Dáil and Seanad to make a further resolution that would automatically apply to the original tribunal.  The provision was inserted by the Government of which Deputy Bruton, the current leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Quinn, the current leader of the Labour Party, were members, as well as many other armchair critics on the Opposition benches, because there was doubt as to the power to amend the order establishing the tribunal once it had been made.</P>
    <P>The positive assertions, now that these parties are in Opposition, that there is no doubt in this regard is, to say the very least, strange given the clear evidence that they had a doubt when in Government.  They were clearly given the same advice as this Government has been given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton questioned the advice received from an eminent senior counsel.  It is not unusual for the Attorney General of the day to seek outside advice.  In this instance, the advice was sought for analysis.  I regret the insinuation Deputy Upton appears to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

There would be little point retaining a senior counsel in a matter such as this if one were to tell him the advice he should give.  No self-respecting senior counsel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that we have returned again to the Ansbacher accounts issue because I have explained the position many times.  I gave a full and comprehensive response to this matter on Second and Committee Stages, yet precisely the same assertions are being made this morning as were made during those debates.  I have stated many times that the Ansbacher accounts are subject to intensive scrutiny.  They are being scrutinised by the Revenue Commissioners and by the authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Companies Act, 1990.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners stated that the proceedings of the tribunal were monitored closely <Col N="879" /> by the Revenue Commissioners and that appropriate actions will be taken.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, also indicated that any additional powers which might be required by the Revenue Commissioners can be provided for in legislation.  In addition, the Moriarty Tribunal has a brief to examine certain aspects of the Ansbacher accounts and I explained that brief in detail in my Second Stage reply.</P>
    <P>I greatly resent any suggestion by the Opposition that this Government is trying to shield or hide people who hold accounts in Ansbacher. When the legislation is passed, it will be open to Mr. Justice Moriarty to seek an amendment of his terms of reference if he considers such a course to be appropriate.  He is the only person in a position to determine on the basis of the evidence before him whether such changes are warranted. It is not a case of &ldquo;Don't ring us; we'll call you&rdquo;. Mr. Justice Moriarty, if he wants to approach the Government with a view to amending the terms of reference, is perfectly entitled to do so, but he has not done so.  If the Government, or anyone acting on its behalf, were to meet him and question him on this matter, there would be a hue and cry in the House and the Government would be accused of interfering with the independence of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We must be fair on this matter, and to be so, we should accept that the Government is doing what it can and that there is no question of anyone being shielded.  I have explained the position <i>ad nauseam</i> and yet people refuse to acknowledge the reality.  It is extraordinary that, despite the fact that I have explained the position several times, Deputies Jim Higgins and Upton still have precisely the same long playing record.  At this stage, I have both their speeches off by heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>I am sure they may also have my side of the story off by heart.  However, it is clear they have decided not to believe it and have buried their heads in the sand.  There can only be one reason for that: they are trying to present an untrue position to the public and to create a smokescreen.  They are trying to suggest that the Government wants to hide the identity of the Ansbacher account holders.  That is not true and I resent that accusation.  I have explained the position in great detail.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: &mdash;&mdash;for information in this regard.  The Minister knows well that, irrespective of promises given as regards investigation of these accounts, assurances given by the Minister for Finance relating to required additional <Col N="880" /> powers and efforts to gloss over the reality by saying the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners is closely monitoring what is happening, the 1993 Finance Act makes clear that the Revenue Commissioners cannot investigate such deposits until the names of the depositors are supplied.  By refusing to pursue the names of the holders of the Ansbacher accounts, the Government is frustrating the Revenue Commissioners.  By not revealing the names, it means the Revenue Commissioners cannot pursue these account holders for income tax owed to the State.  Prosecutions will not follow, names will not be published and income tax and revenue rightly owing to the State will not be sought or paid.  The Minister knows the Revenue Commissioners cannot carry out a general trawl unless specific names are supplied. He has already been asked whether the names of the Ansbacher depositors will be revealed.  If so, what mechanism will be used?  When can we expect the names to be revealed?  Will the people who deposited £38 million be allowed to retain their cloak of anonymity?  We are not trying to create tension between the Oireachtas and the tribunal.  The provision of consent is clearly built into my amendment.  The terms of reference of a tribunal can be changed:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) (i) the tribunal has requested the amendment, or</P>
      <P>(ii) the Government with the consent of the tribunal has requested the amendment, or</P>
      <P>(iii) the Oireachtas with the consent of the tribunal has requested the amendment,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b) the tribunal is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is no question of imposing additional obligations or terms of reference on a tribunal. Where there is a will, there is a way, and for some reason there is no will on the part of the Government to pursue the identities of the Ansbacher depositors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Minister's reply concerning my amendment, I draw to his attention that it clearly states the tribunal must be satisfied with what is proposed by the Oireachtas.  I do not accept his criticisms on that point.  We have reached a full stop as far as this Bill and the Ansbacher deposits are concerned.  The matter will continue, but we are in danger of being bored out of our minds by prolonging the argument.  At this stage, the Minister's replies and our contributions are such that we are going around in circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the integrity of the person who gave advice to the Minister.  What was the sequence of obtaining that advice?  Which came first?  Why was a second opinion sought?  Why did the Minister stop after receiving two opinions?  Is there <Col N="881" /> any background opinion relating to the views held by this person on the matter at issue?</P>
    <P>There are experts in other areas who legitimately and with the highest regard to integrity hold conflicting views.  If one wants a different point of view to suit one's agenda, one can seek an appropriate expert.  No one does that better than various commercial interests.  For example, the cigarette companies did it for years.  A small number of experts held views which were favourable to the companies' position and they sought their views when the vast bulk of opinion was to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister indicated the sequence of events and what triggered the decision to ask for the second opinion.  Is this usual and does it normally stop at two opinions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained how the Ansbacher accounts are being investigated and the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners, the tribunal and the inspector.  The issue of tax evasion is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the account holders.  If additional powers are required, they will be provided.  This has been stated <i>ad nauseam.</i>  If Mr. Justice Moriarty wants to change the terms of reference of his tribunal, he can ask the Government to do so. Mr. Justice Flood decided he wanted to amend his terms of reference and asked the Government to do so.  It then came forward with legislation. The bona fides of the Government cannot be doubted.  That is the position but some choose not to accept it for reasons best known to themselves.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Upton, I understand the senior counsel's opinion was sought in or around 5 March.  On the evening of Monday, 9 March, the Attorney General's Office advised the Department in writing that the Attorney General was of the view that primary legislation was necessary to amend section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to expressly provide for amendment of terms of reference of an instrument appointing a tribunal and applying the Act to the tribunal and that this view had been confirmed by independent senior counsel.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the Attorney General's advice, the memorandum was submitted to Government seeking approval to proceed with the legislation which is before the House.  The following new paragraph was then inserted in the memorandum for Government meeting of 10 March:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by some commentators that tribunals are not established as such by the Act of 1921, rather that they are established by resolution of both Houses and that the Act of 1921 regarding evidence etc. is merely applied to such tribunals.  The Attorney General, however, is of the view that primary legislation is necessary to amend section 1 of the Act of 1921 to expressly provide for amendment of terms of reference of the Minister who is appointing the tribunal and applying the Act to the tribunal.  This view is supported by independent <Col N="882" /> senior counsel.  It is in the light of these advices that the Minister seeks approval to proceed with the legislation.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 10 March 1998 the Government approved the text of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1998.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; One of the most important functions that we have as legislators is to ensure that our legislation offers children the type of protection to which they are entitled and which will provide them with the opportunity to enjoy a carefree and happy childhood.

    <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997, is the latest legislation that offers protection against sexual abuse.  There is no need for me to recite a list of such legislation; suffice to say that even in the recent past we have passed the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995, which arose from a Private Member's Bill which I introduced in the previous Dáil; the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, which I also published by way of a Private Member's Bill; and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, with its important &ldquo;stalking&rdquo; provision.  In addition, the Children Bill, 1996, will update the law on <Col N="883" /> the protection of children from abuse, including sexual abuse, in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the pipeline are two important documents which I hope to publish shortly: the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences and the interim report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet.  The discussion paper will deal with many issues relevant to child sexual abuse, including the age of consent to sexual relations and other matters raised in the Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse, issues surrounding the establishment of a sex offenders or paedophile register, and child prostitution.  The working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet will report on the very difficult issue of what we can do at a national level to deal with objectionable material such as child pornography being transmitted to this country from all parts of the globe by means of that most personal and modern means of communication, the Internet.</P>
    <P>How international agencies co-operate and share their expertise in trying to understand the problem of child sexual abuse and the role child pornography plays in that abuse was brought home to me recently when I had the privilege of opening the first Conference on Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe &mdash; or COPINE Conference &mdash; in Dublin Castle.  This is a project funded under the EU STOP programme; it is a partnership between the child studies unit in the Department of Applied Psychology at Cork University, the paedophile unit of the London Metropolitan Police, An Garda Síochána and the Association for European Law Enforcement Co-operation in Brussels.  The conference addressed many issues of importance, including paedophile activity on the Internet, something that can only be realistically combated through international co-operation.  While such international co-operation is critical in tackling the problems of child sexual abuse, we must not lose sight of the need for our own national response.</P>
    <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997, is an important and integral part of the ongoing programme of legislation aimed at providing comprehensive protection against sexual abuse or exploitation.  There are many forms that sexual exploitation of children can take, ranging from direct physical sexual assaults to the depiction of children in pornographic materials.  The making of child pornography constitutes child sexual abuse and often it can involve the most horrendous violation and abuse of children.  With increasing globalisation and greater movement between countries, new forms of child sexual exploitation have begun to emerge.  To deal with the continuing and changing nature of the problem, imaginative and novel responses by law enforcement agencies and legislators are required.</P>
    <P>This Bill also represents a response to the awful events surrounding the Belgian paedophile ring <Col N="884" /> which was uncovered in 1996.  The tragic fate of the young Belgian children who fell victim to that paedophile ring galvanised the EU into immediate and effective action.  It was during our presidency of the EU, when those events came to light, that a joint action on trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children was negotiated. This Bill will give effect to the provisions of that joint action so far as it applies to children.</P>
    <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill offers protection to children against exploitation and abuse primarily in three ways.  It protects against trafficking in children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation.  It protects children against being used and abused in the making of child pornography.  By criminalising possession of child pornography, it protects children from being abused by persons whose fantasies have been fuelled by watching child pornography.  The first and second of these protections are obvious, the third not so obvious.  However, with the proper treatment and therapy paedophiles may be persuaded to stay away from what to them is temptation. One such form of temptation is child pornography.</P>
    <P>Possessing and looking at child pornography by paedophiles poses a real risk of harm to children by re-enforcing cognitive distortions and fuelling fantasies.  Child pornography can also be used in &ldquo;grooming&rdquo; or conditioning possible child victims into believing that what they are watching constitutes normal behaviour.  There can be no comparison in this context between the possession of child pornography and the possession of other forms of pornography for personal use.  This is why it is necessary to specifically outlaw child pornography in all its manifestations.  The making of and the use made by paedophiles of child pornography is frightening.  Most of us will never see it unless we come upon it accidentally because it tends to circulate among paedophile rings and not otherwise.</P>
    <P>There may still be some people who think of paedophiles as pathetic old men, as much to be pitied as feared.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Paedophiles may appear to be ordinary people who live apparently ordinary lives.  They can be highly manipulative and seductive, often charming themselves into people's confidences so that they can insinuate themselves into a position where they have unsupervised access to children. They are capable of taking the long view, even spending years to get themselves into a position of trust with the parents of their targeted victim. They will similarly use the devious side of their character to obtain positions of trust, power and responsibility directly over children.  Not all persons who possess child pornography are necessarily paedophiles.  However, all paedophiles will probably possess child pornography; it could almost be described as a necessary accessory to their activities.  It is this connection between paedophilia and child pornography which this Bill targets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> I would now like to give a brief explanation of the more important provisions in the Bill.  Section 2 contains a definition that is central to the success of the Bill, the definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;. Defining the expression &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; is something of a departure from what might be considered the traditional way to legislate in matters such as this, to leave it to the court to interpret what is meant by &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; or &ldquo;indecent&rdquo;. It is important in a Bill of such crucial importance to give the prosecuting authorities and the courts a clear indication of what exactly we as legislators mean by the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;. It does not matter how the child pornography is represented or how it is made &mdash; it is caught by the definition.  For example, section 2(2) puts it beyond doubt that any figure resembling a person that has been generated or modified by computer graphics is comprehended by the definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; if it conveys the impression that the figure is that of a child.  This means that any person who would try to circumvent the legislation by means of computer technology would not succeed.  This is an illustration of how legislation must be in a position to deal with the clever misuse of developing technology to frustrate the law.  There are two exceptions in the definition: first, it will not apply to any film in respect of which a certificate under the Censorship of Film Acts is in force and, second, it will not apply to any video work in respect of which a supply certificate under the Video Recording Acts is in force.  In other words, if the censor has passed a film or video for release, the provisions of this legislation will not apply.  These are common sense exclusions which will mean that the present criteria in respect of obscene or indecent material in films or videos passed by the censors will not be affected by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The other important definition in section 2 is that of a &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  There are several different ages for which one could make a case.  I have decided that the most logical and appropriate age is 17 years, that is, the age of consent to a sexual relationship in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the first of four sections in which new offences are created.  Section 3 makes it an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation.  It will also be an offence to provide accommodation for such a child while in the State.  This section gives effect to one of the most important aspects of the EU Joint Action on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation of Children.  The seriousness with which this offence is regarded is reflected in the penalty, which can be imprisonment for up to life on conviction on indictment.  The ingredient in this offence which makes it so serious is that it deals with children who have been taken from their family, community and, indeed, their own country and trafficked across international borders to another country, possibly on the other side of the <Col N="886" /> world, for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  We are giving a clear message in this provision to any would-be traffickers in children that they would use this country for their despicable trade at their peril.  We will not allow children to be brought in or out of this country for the purpose of sexual exploitation and we will not allow this country to be used as a transit point for such children.  What makes this provision so necessary and urgent is that, as we have seen in the recent past, although thankfully not in this country, such trafficking does occur.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo;, which is used in section 3, is comprehensively defined.  It includes more than trafficking in a child for the purpose of using that child to produce child pornography. It incorporates trafficking the child for the purpose of inducing or coercing him or her into prostitution or participating in other sexual activities.</P>
    <P>The other offence created in section 3 reinforces a provision in section 17 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. Section 17 deals with the abduction of children by persons other than their parents and has a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of seven years imprisonment.  The extra ingredient in this provision is that the taking or detaining of the child is for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation and, because of that extra ingredient, we are providing a higher penalty on conviction than for the offence in the 1997 Act, up to ten years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes it an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child to allow that child to be used for the production of child pornography.  It parallels a provision in the Children Bill, 1996, under which it will be an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child to cause or encourage the commission of unlawful sexual intercourse or buggery with that child or to cause or encourage the seduction or prostitution of, or the commission of a sexual assault upon, the child.  Section 4 and the provision in the Children Bill, 1996, are aimed at persons such as parents or guardians who, for whatever reason, but usually monetary gain, allow their children to be so sexually exploited.  Is there a worse breach of trust than parents allowing their child to be sexually exploited by others?</P>
    <P>Section 5 is aimed at persons who would profit from child pornography although it also catches persons who are involved in the child pornography business for other reasons, as the profit motive may not always be a significant factor in the dissemination of child pornography.  Under this section it will be an offence to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show any child pornography.  While elements of it are required by the EU Joint Action, it is a comprehensive provision which attempts to deal with any person who is knowingly involved in any way in the child pornography trade.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is necessary <Col N="887" /> because it is possible for child pornography to be distributed or imported without the knowledge of the distributor or importer.  This arises in particular in the case of those involved in providing Internet services who would not be in a position to police everything that is available on the Internet. This issue will be dealt with in the report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet to which I referred.  The prosecution in any case will, therefore, have to satisfy the court that the defendant knowingly distributed or imported, etc. child pornography.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will make it an offence to knowingly possess child pornography.  This provision is also required by the EU Joint Action and, from some of the comments I made earlier about the potentially horrific effects of child pornography, there is little more I need to say to explain or justify it. The offence of possession will not apply in two circumstances: first, where it is in the possession of a person who is exercising his or her functions under the Censorship Acts or the Video Recording Acts and, second, where possession is for the purpose of the prevention, investigation or prosecution of offences under the Bill.  The term &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; can be interpreted widely and will allow persons who are, for example, preparing an exposé of child pornography or organising workshops or seminars on the effects of child pornography to go about their business without fear of prosecution.  The offence of possession will apply, however, where, for example, a person downloads child pornography from the Internet.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the maximum penalty on conviction for trafficking in children will be life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty on being convicted for possession of child pornography will be five years on indictment.  The other offences all carry a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.  These are without doubt severe penalties but they are necessary if we are to offer our children the protection they deserve.  There can be relatively minor manifestations of some of these offences and the fact that provision is made for a summary charge in some cases reflects that.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions are relatively straightforward and routine and at this stage I will make a brief comment on one or two of them. Section 10 will amend the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, by allowing evidence to be taken from children by television link in cases involving child trafficking and child pornography.  It does this by adding the offences created in sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Bill to the other offences in the 1992 Act for which children can give evidence by television link.  Section 11 amends the Bail Act, 1997, by adding the offences under two of the sections of this Bill to the list of offences in the Schedule to the 1997 Act for which a court may refuse bail to a person on the ground that such a refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The offences being added to that Schedule are those for which I consider there would be a likelihood <Col N="888" /> of the person committing a further offence while on bail.</P>
    <P>This is a critically important Bill.  Some years ago the necessity for such a Bill might not have been as clear as it is today.  Everybody will agree, however, in light of what we now know and the advances of modern technology, that this legislation has become essential.  I hope it gets a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas and can become law without delay.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will strengthen the legislative measures which aim to protect children from sexual exploitation by targeting two manifestations of such exploitation, child trafficking and child pornography.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, places general obligations on states to take action at national and international level to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse.  This obligation is not confined to child nationals of a particular state.  Article 34 of the convention refers to the protection of children from all forms of sexual abuse and requires states to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity and the exploited use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights stressed the need for states to address the problem of exploitation and abuse of children and to provide effective measures against harmful child labour, the sale of children, child prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse.  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Working Group on Temporary Forms of Slavery have adopted a programme of prevention on the sale of children and child prostitution which calls on sending and receiving countries to adopt measures to prevent child sex tourism.</P>
      <P>It is difficult, in the absence of clear evidence, to arrive at a conclusion on the extent to which Irish people take part in sex tourism or the extent to which it is organised here.  Nevertheless, however much we might not want to believe it, there is no reason to suppose Ireland is immune. We have a responsibility to do whatever we can to stop it.  It is right that our laws should contain a deterrent against such behaviour.  The international community also has a role to play in eliminating sex tourism and child pornography.  The problem has been recognised internationally.</P>
      <P>I welcome the work being done by the ECPA, End Child Prostitution in Asia, which has offices in many countries and works closely with organisations such as UNICEF and INTERPOL as well as tourism agencies.  It has been lobbying the Governments of the major sending countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 deals with child trafficking for sexual exploitation which shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine of up to £10,000 or a term <Col N="889" /> of imprisonment of up to ten years or both.  The section may, however, be too restrictive.  In 1997 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealt with 125 cases of child abduction, an increase of 11 on the previous year but, significantly, down on the 1995 figure.  A total of 69 cases involved the abduction of children into the State and 56 out of the State.  In most cases the children were abducted by a spouse or partner. The figure also includes incidents in which the location of those abducted is not known.  This area should be more closely examined.  I am not suggesting that such abductions should attract the same sanctions included in section 4 of the Bill, but the Bill is restrictive in not dealing with the movement of children in contexts other than sexual exploitation such as, for example, labour exploitation.</P>
    <P>A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 23 January 1998, outlined evidence that Irish paedophiles use the Internet for the exchange of child pornography.  Research commissioned for the report and carried out by the child studies unit of University College, Cork sampled activity on the Internet chat network.  In one test at 9.20 a.m. researchers found 31 channels with titles available on child sex, with 281 participants.  The report stated that more than 40 sites containing child pornography are available on the worldwide web with at least one Irish website having links to paedophile sites.  An independent Internet monitoring centre, along the lines of the offices of the censor, is recommended.  Its function would include scanning Internet material, reporting and discussing abuses with the Garda and raising public awareness of undesirable activity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the study reviewed Internet newsgroup activity at 6 o'clock on a particular day.  It found 465 files in three newsgroups which appeared to contain child pornography. According to the report in excess of ten newsgroups explicitly provide a form of child sexual exploitation.  Most of the commercial pornography comes from Japan and, to a lesser extent, Russia.  More than 40 Japanese sites seek payment for access to child pornography.  On paying users get password access to the pictures.  The report concludes that there is occasional Irish participation in Internet reply channels and occasional newsgroup postings from Irish addresses.  This includes e.mail and Internet relayed chat which are also used to exchange information on pornographic material.  One mailing list is described as a forum for people to discuss &ldquo;their feelings towards girls, i.e. girls under the age of 14&rdquo;.  According to the report there appears to be Irish involvement in this list.</P>
    <P>The report recognises the moral, ethical and technological difficulties associated with proposals to regulate a development which cherishes freedom of speech above quality of content. However, the report says that Internet service providers should be licensed and that such providers should agree not to include certain <Col N="890" /> material, provide optional access to certain sites with appropriate filtering, inform all subscribers about potentially harmful material and co-operate with monitoring and hotline agencies.  The group also recommends the preparation of information leaflets for parents and teachers and the training for gardaí, customs officers, teachers and care workers.  It states that &ldquo;whilst it is likely the extent of the problem within the State is limited in nature, it is equally likely that individuals participating in child pornography exchanges are as yet undetected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Child pornography is a problem at a variety of levels, but in some respects is also the paedophile's Achilles heel because the possession of material means that police can identify people who have an interest in the area.  This is very important, especially in the context of recent photography, as it may have evidential value and contain information about location, offenders and exploited children.  It is unique in that it is a picture of the scene of a crime.</P>
    <P>Child pornography is unusual in that possession of the offensive material is also evidence of an offence taking place.  Therefore it is important that it be seen and not destroyed until it has been properly examined for evidential qualities. Another important issue concerns finding out where pornographic material, found in the possession of somebody, originates.  This will lead police to the network of distribution and contact groups.  A database with such information would be an important investigative tool in dealing with the problem.  Seized material should not be destroyed without first being examined and carefully analysed.</P>
    <P>Most pornographic material currently in circulation is between 20 and 40 years old.  One of the qualities of child pornography is that the child in the picture does not age and that is why it is of value to those interested in it.  Pictures being distributed can date back 40 years or more.  I understand there are tens of thousands of pictures on the Internet at present, the bulk of them being 20, 30 or 40 years old.  On examining these pictures one detects that the furnishings are different and somewhat dated as much of the material comes from the 1960s, particularly from Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries where, for a period, censorship was withdrawn and there was freedom of publication.  An enormous number of magazines, videos and photographs was compiled at that time.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between the old and new material.  The value of the old material lies in its possession.  Possession tells us something about the individual.  There is no point in pursuing the children involved because if they survived they would be 50 years old.  It is important to seriously examine the newer material as it identifies the children involved. This concerns child protection as well as detecting and punishing criminal activity.  It is worth targeting police resources at examining new material, although this tends to be between four <Col N="891" /> and nine years old.  It often takes that length of time for material to come into circulation as most of it is made by and for individuals or small groups of people who are in contact with each other.  Much of the material is copied and some of the copies can be of very poor quality having gone through so many hands.  Police must be able to co-ordinate the collection of copies as the copy seized, which may be of poor quality, may be comparable to other copies seized elsewhere. This would signify and identify links between people involved in the area.  European co-ordination is very important in this respect.</P>
    <P>The market in child pornographic material is not serviced and updated as are other markets, such as those for film and video.  Even though the market is underground it would appear that the material is leaking through from private sources rather than being overtly manufactured.  The material is either privately owned or, in some cases, commercially manufactured.  Manufacturers are mainly based in Japan.  Currently on the Internet there is a vast amount of Japanese material, most of which is not illegal in Japan.  At best the laws are confused and any area of illegality is immaterial as there is no enforcement. Much of the material originating in Japan is quite modern.</P>
    <P>The interchange of child pornography is a complex and highly organised criminal conspiracy which is not driven by money.  It is unique in the respect that even though money changes hands it is primarily driven by sexual interest in children. I wish to make a distinction between child pornography and child erotica.  Child pornography is covered by this legislation and relates to sexual pictures involving children engaged in sexual activity.  There is an immense array of material which, while not in itself obscene, can be obscene in a particular context.  Two years ago in the UK, a person was deported after being discovered on a beach taking photographs of children.  The man had a camera which enabled him to take photographs at right angles to the direction in which the camera was pointing.  Perverts also take sexual pleasure in photographing children in playgrounds coming down slides and exposing the lower half of their bodies.  The difficulty here is that these photographs are sexual in the context of the individual but are not, in themselves, sexual. They are rendered inappropriate because of the context and mindset of the person taking them.  It is of course impossible for the State to legislate for this but it is important we know of its existence.  Such photographs are available on the Internet, many having been taken by a Japanese person with sophisticated camera equipment with telephoto lenses.  Most of the pictures taken are of children in playgrounds.</P>
    <P>In this context, an attack is being made on children's innocence.  There is no victim because the child is simply not aware of the activity.  A child is sexualised by the person lurking in the background taking photos of him or her.  While this is <Col N="892" /> uncontrollable, we must be aware that such activity is carried on and that the results are available in child pornographic circles and on the Internet.  The sexualisation of children in such a context is very difficult to deal with by law.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, a book was published in Dublin by a famous photographer who took photographs of children.  The photographs, in themselves, were quite innocent and the children were portrayed very beautifully and innocently.  The photographs were published to portray the beautiful innocence of the children.  I understand these books were widely collected by paedophiles who created a corruption of the children's innocence by seeing them in a sexualised context.</P>
    <P>Certain material is sought by paedophiles for their sexual gratification.  The evidence is that most people who extensively collect these kind of photos, which are not, in themselves, obscene, are paedophiles.  The portrayal of child pornography material has a very corrosive quality in that it sexualises child innocence.  I pay tribute to the excellent work done by the Coping Project in UCC. Its investigations found no real evidence of Irish involvement in using the Internet for passing on information in regard to photographs or sex tourism. There is evidence of some small involvement in this area in that an Irish address occasionally turns up.  However, there is no evidence of any systematic involvement by Irish people in exchanging information or child pornography on the Internet.  We must, however, be extremely vigilant.</P>
    <P>Child pornography cannot be tolerated in any society.  The law must ensure that distributors, retailers and others who allow pornography to become available are severely dealt with under the law.  It is difficult to comprehend the effect of child sex abuse on its victims.  Child pornography ranges from photographs of naked and semi-naked children to the depiction of various acts of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Children of all ages are photographed.  Child pornography cannot be produced without sexual abuse being visited on a child.  This must be at the core of our abhorrence of such pornographic material.  While recent legislation has helped to clamp down on the production of material and magazines throughout Europe, the collectors of such material have become new producers in the child porn industry.  Individual paedophiles record their abuse of children through photographs and videos which are subsequently sold to, or exchanged with, other abusers.</P>
    <P>The result of legislation in many parts of Europe has created a situation where paedophiles deal directly with each other.  A paedophile involved with a particular child realises his victim will grow older and that there will be periods when he will not have a victim to molest.  Paedophiles, therefore, have a compelling need to record the physical act of molestation.  They will use various recording mechanisms to do this such as diaries, computers, photographs, films or video tapes.  Photographs and descriptions of child sex <Col N="893" /> abuse are frequently traded by paedophiles on the Internet.  The existence of these pornographic images is essentially disturbing and traumatic for the exploited child who lives for many years with the knowledge that a record of his or her humiliation is available and probably in circulation.</P>
    <P>The characteristics of people who abuse children vary according to their relationship to the child.  Abusers who are strangers to the children involved are generally loners and single men who have no history of marital relationships.  They attack children in a violent way in one-off situations. Having sexually assaulted one child, they move on to other victims.  They accumulate a vast number of victims and it has been known for some to claim as many as 200 to 300 victims.</P>
    <P>Another type of abuser is the parent or blood relative.  Such offenders do not have many victims and are not usually violent.  They persuade the child to accept the sexual abuse over a long period of time.  They convince the child that the abuse is an education or a game and persuade him or her that the abuse will not be harmful.  In most situations, this type of abuser lives with the child.</P>
    <P>Between the above two extremes lies the abuser who is known to the child but does not live with him or her.  Such abusers can have a number of victims at any one time or sequentially. All sex offenders tend to have very low self esteem, a low sense of self worth and very little understanding of their victims' position.  They do not understand how the victim feels and often feel they are not doing the victim any harm.  In many situations, they can blame the child for the abuse, alleging that he or she is being too friendly or dependent.  They do not accept any blame for the abuse and if they do, they usually point to an external source as a cause for their actions, using drunkenness and so on as an excuse.  Such offenders are usually socially isolated.</P>
    <P>The main difference between physical abuse and sexual abuse is that the latter can never be accidental.  Sexual abuse is planned and, if it occurs in the victim's home, it is planned over a long period of time whereas physical abuse can occur on the spur of the moment.  Physical abuse is often accompanied by deep regret when a person did not intend to lose his or her temper or harm the child.  Child sex abuse is quite different. Most victims of sex abuse suffer from long traumatic stress disorders and an entire range of mental health problems often occur in such children. They often inflict self injury or self mutilation directly or through eating disorders and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Once children have become victims of abuse, they tend to suffer further abuse in later life.  Children who are abused in a family are often vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles when they reach school age or adolescence.  That is due to low self-esteem and low self-confidence.  The paedophile identifies and targets those children by offering them some form of comfort or attention. Then they sexually manipulate and coerce the <Col N="894" /> child into degrading and inhuman sexual acts. Studies in the UK show that children who have been abused and emotionally neglected in a family are more vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles when they reach school age or adolescence. Paedophiles specifically target and exploit such children and go on to sexually manipulate and coerce the child into unwanted sexual activity.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on what is sometimes referred to as kiddie porn, or a less explicit version of child pornography than that stated in the Bill, which is subtly presented in advertising promotional material.  As a society we must attempt to draw a line, however difficult that may be, between acceptable portrayal of children in advertising and the unacceptable presentation of them by sexual innuendo.  While most advertisers are careful to portray children as children, some have stepped over the line.</P>
    <P>Society cannot claim to abhor the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and women in pornography and yet allow their portrayal as sexual objects in the popular press and in advertising. The sight of young children selling jeans in a seductive manner pleases paedophiles who are attracted to it.  It glamorises children as sexual objects by presenting them in inappropriate sexual contexts.  Children should be protected, loved and nurtured and not used and abused.  They should be treated as children.  Consumers when faced with this type of unacceptable advertising should bring it to the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority, refuse to buy products which use children in that way and tell manufacturers why they are not purchasing their products. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the publication of this timely and comprehensive legislative reform.  The issues of child pornography and trafficking in children for the purposes of sexual exploitation addressed in the Bill are two of the most obscene acts imaginable.</P>
      <P>Over the recent past the frightening level of abuse and exploitation inflicted on children in society has been laid bare.  For too many years we sought to ignore this issue and to pretend it did not happen.  That attitude effectively facilitated the brutal acts perpetrated by child abusers.  Paedophilia and child abuse thrives in an atmosphere of ignorance and denial.  The revelations of recent years exposed the dangers of that attitude which ignored the plight of children and offered support to criminals who perpetrated these acts.  As a society we now have to fashion legislation and administrative systems that seek to protect, support and listen to children.  The protection and welfare of all this nation's children is now a political priority and must remain so into the future. This Bill is part of the process to ensure our children are protected and abusers punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The instance of child prostitution and child trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation was the focus of the world congress on the sexual <Col N="895" /> exploitation of children held in Stockholm in 1996.  This Bill is a development from that conference at which UNICEF produced shocking figures related to child exploitation.  Those figures showed that over one million children are entering the prostitution trade each year.  In 1992, figures showed that 92 per cent of all prostitutes in Nicaragua were children.  Those figures indicate the degree of orchestration involved in forcing children into prostitution.  The horrific details of cases across Europe, including Ireland and Belgium, point out the necessity of not only strong national law to prevent this abuse but also the need for maximum international co-operation.</P>
    <P>The legislation addresses the first of those two points and I would be obliged if the Minister, when replying to this debate, would outline the Government's proposals to ensure the EU and the UN take effective action to pool information and resources to combat the international trafficking in children.  Child prostitution and pornography is a vice that trades across international borders.  While it is right and necessary that each individual jurisdiction should place on its Statute Book strict legislation prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children, it is also essential there should be maximum co-operation between law enforcement agencies to track down and bring to justice the evil people who profit from this trade.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific provisions of the Bill, the Labour Party will seek to table amendments on Committee Stage.  Section 3 regarding child trafficking is comprehensive in dealing with all aspects of this nefarious trade.  From court reports and research material available we know that child trafficking operations involve complex networks of people engaged in the abduction, detention and trafficking of children.  It is important this section provides for long custodial terms for persons convicted of involvement in any of these aspects of child trafficking.  However, I would like the Minister to explain why there is a difference in sentencing policy contained in section 3.  It is bizarre that the trafficking of children through the State, for the purpose of their sexual exploitation, is quite properly punishable by up to life imprisonment, while the kidnapping of a child within this State for the same purpose carries only a maximum sentence of ten years.  Surely both offences should carry the same maximum sentence and I hope the Minister will address this point when he responds to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides legislative sanction against persons involved in child pornography. The definition of child pornography is vital in legislation such as this and the Bill attempts to address all forms of child pornography through whichever medium they are broadcast or supplied. It also includes in its definition of pornography visual representations of a person depicted as being a child, which is an important inclusion in our definition of child pornography.</P>
    <P>However, I will seek to remove the sentencing <Col N="896" /> proposals contained in section 4, 5 and 6, and, in particular, the proposals related to maximum fines that can be imposed on an individual convicted of offences related to child pornography. There should not be limits in the legislation on the size of fines a court can impose on convicted persons.  There is no need to specify in advance a limit on the size of a fine.  I assume the production and distribution of child pornography is a lucrative trade and vast amounts of money can be made from this pernicious business.  I see no valid reason for putting an arbitrary upper limit on the amount of money that can be retrieved from persons convicted of these practices and I hope the Minister will review his approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill also seeks to address the issue of child pornography on the Internet, which is a welcome move.  I am aware the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in discussions with Internet service providers in drafting this Bill and the provisions relating to computer generated images, in particular, are especially welcome. Regulation or control of information on the Internet is an extremely complex area.  Much of the initial work in this area has been carried out in the United States where the first amendment to its Constitution guaranteeing free speech has complicated the process.  I welcome the consultative approach adopted by the Department towards the preparation of this Bill.  While the term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; does actually appear in the Bill, I am hopeful progress can be made to restrict the availability of child pornography on the Internet. I understand the Department working group on illegal and harmful uses of the Internet is due to produce an interim report soon and I hope that group will recommend practical proposals which can be implemented by the service providers and Internet users to prevent the transmission of child pornography or communication between paedophile groups on the Internet.  While I accept the difficulties involved in trying to do that, the contributions of the Minister and Deputy Neville sounded a note of encouragement in regard to what is possible in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify one aspect of the Bill which has been brought to my attention. Why is the term &ldquo;unlawful sexual activity with children&rdquo; used in section 2(c)?  It has been suggested that the term &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; is unnecessary. Can the Minister explain why it is included?</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and I believe it will be strengthened on Committee Stage.  However, it is only part of a process to protect and enhance the lives of children.  The recent appearance by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, before the UN committee on the rights of the child and the subsequent report of that committee point to our failings in providing adequate resources for children. The report made a number of points which the Government must address.  While the committee welcomed the publication of this Bill, there are other areas where our system of child care were found seriously wanting.  They include the lack of co-ordination between agencies whose <Col N="897" /> task is to protect children, the lack of an ombudsman for children's rights and concern for children who are expelled from schools for disruptive behaviour.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has been to the fore in raising the latter with the Minister for Education and Science.  He has proposed the establishment of special regional education units which would specifically deal with children who have been expelled from school for disruptive behaviour and work intensively with them to adequately prepare them for a return to the education system.  Child centred proposals such as these are required for the delivery of services to children.  We have a long way to go to ensure that this happens in a co-ordinated and focused manner.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this Bill. It will send a strong signal that the State will not allow itself to be used as a trafficking point for prostitution or pornography.  It will also send a signal to people involved in the sexual exploitation of children that their heinous crimes will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>On the fragmented and increasingly individualistic nature of Irish society, that fragmentation, which is endemic, has greatly facilitated the activities of paedophiles.  Our new society has much to recommend it but in the older society in which I was reared there was a powerful social sanction against paedophiles.  It was not overt but it existed.  I remember being left in no doubt that one would be well advised to avoid contact with a certain type of person.</P>
    <P>There was usually an older person in the community who was sharp and vigorous in ensuring a child did not go next or near such people.  Only as one grew older and began to understand the import of such directions did one realise that these elders were trying to protect young children and ensure they did not become victims of paedophiles. That type of social sanction does not exist in our new society.  In many ways the social sanctions which existed years ago had many deleterious effects but the one to which I have referred was useful and helped to curb the awfulness of some of these people.</P>
    <P>However, the evidence that is available now indicates clearly that a disturbing amount of child sexual abuse took place, although the social sanction element succeeded in curbing it to an extent. That social sanction no longer exists which is why this Bill is particularly welcome.  It will go a good distance towards compensating for the lack of awareness on the part of most of the public of the awfulness of these activities and the extent to which they happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  There is reluctance to deal with legislation that will require tackling modern technology.  The subject of this Bill is one such area and white collar fraud is another.  Legislators in general have been reluctant <Col N="898" /> to tackle these problems but the Minister is willing to do so.</P>
      <P>I disagree with some of the points made by Deputy Neville and Deputy Upton.  It is true that when we were young we were aware of what were called &ldquo;funny&rdquo; people in society and we were warned away from them.  They were obvious people.  Unfortunately, however, as we have learned from the drastic cases which have come before the courts in recent years and for which people have been jailed, the most dangerous people were usually those who appeared to live ordinary lives.  They were manipulative and seductive, charming and, in many cases, held positions of power.  They used their trusted positions to pursue these activities.</P>
      <P>As we have seen from the two most recent cases, such people were willing to wait and work for years to get themselves into positions where they could abuse children.  I take the opposite view to Deputy Upton.  Children had no problem with the obvious suspects but they did have a problem with discreet paedophiles.  That has been evident from the cases that have come before the courts in the past five years.  I agree with the Minister that these people were manipulative and willing to work for a long period in order to reach positions of trust.  They secured the trust of parents while they abused children.  Some of the cases date from 25 years ago.  The difficulty has always been that we did not recognise where the problem would occur.  We tended to take people at face value and we now know, unfortunately, that society is sicker than we thought.</P>
      <P>I also disagree with Deputy Neville's suggestion that the Minister include the abduction of children for purposes other than sexual exploitation. The Bill seeks to tackle a specific difficulty and the inclusion of a new task would complicate its remit.  There is a need for further legislation to deal with the issue raised by the Deputy but the Bill before the House should not be complicated by its inclusion.  I hope the Minister will agree with my point of view.</P>
      <P>One of the most important functions of legislators is to ensure that children are offered the type of protection to which they are entitled and to give them the opportunity to enjoy a carefree and happy childhood.  Unfortunately, that has not been done.  Many people tended to be of the opinion that child pornography was mainly a matter of dirty pictures.  However, according to Detective Chief Inspector James Reynolds of Scotland Yard's paedophile unit, child pornography is the visual depiction of sexual assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the Internet poses particular problems in coping with child pornography. The international nature of the Internet and its anonymity demands that we seek innovative means of preventing the widespread distribution of obscene material.  The ten year sentence on indictment for the production and distribution of such material and the five year sentence for possession will be a significant deterrent and will send a clear message to those involved in such <Col N="899" /> activities.  The message has not been clear previously. In fact, many people have virtually sought sympathy for some perpetrators by using the &ldquo;God help them&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>Being from Cork, I am extremely interested in the work being carried out in this area by University College, Cork.  I was particularly concerned by the comments of Dr. Max Taylor of UCC who said that the Internet is the major focal point for the distribution of child pornography and information about paedophile behaviour.  The Government should implement in full the recommendations of the report of the child studies unit at UCC, which worked on the report in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and other agencies under the STOP programme.  The report called for a proper licensing system for Internet service providers, a monitoring centre and a public hotline to assist in tracing illegal material.  The monitoring centre could work in the same way as the censor and could play a role in heightening public awareness of undesirable activity.</P>
    <P>That suggestion leads to the argument of what constitutes pornography.  Obviously there is a dictionary definition, but many people differ on its interpretation.  A recent Irish film that earned international acclaim but which I have not viewed had scenes which, I am told, would be considered at least blasphemous by the majority of the Catholic population and for many people would come within the definition of pornography.  The Minister has done a very good job in dealing with this aspect of a much wider and complicated issue.  He is to be congratulated on bringing forward the legislation.  Under the legislation a child is defined as a person under 17 years.  I appreciate that is the age set down in other sexual offences legislation but, given that in the past complications have arisen from different definitions of a child, I would ask the Minister if it is in line with other legislation.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have backed away from tackling outstanding issues because of the difficulties involved.  I refer to white collar fraud and so on.  In the early 1990s the Law Reform Commission recommended that changes should be made in that area, but to my knowledge nothing was done by the previous Government in that regard.  I am glad the Minister is tackling that aspect under the fraud offences Bill.  We should not be afraid to draw up much needed legislation because of difficulties with changing technology. People, whether draftspeople or Ministers, seem to back away from that, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is to be congratulated on taking on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have criticised in the past the delays between recognising the need for legislation and its implementation. That gap is far too great.  Rapid changes in society have left legislation way behind.  For example, the term &ldquo;paedophile&rdquo; meant nothing to the average citizen ten years ago.  We are slow to respond to needs at times and the House should consider these matters.  The <Col N="900" /> setting up of committees has speeded the passage of legislation once it comes to the House, but there is a bottleneck in the drafting of Bills.  I am delighted with the Minister's enthusiasm in dealing with issues that were previously avoided.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be considered in the context of a number of measures to improve child welfare.  In the last Dáil Deputy O'Donoghue introduced the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Bill, 1995, which was passed.  This Government accepted legislation put forward by Deputy Shatter on the reporting of child abuse.  Taken together, those measures will be of assistance, but much more needs to be done.  I disagree with Deputy Neville in that this is specific legislation dealing with a complicated issue.  People have referred to the abuse of children.  There should be a register of paedophiles and abusers of children to reassure and assist parents and local communities.  When that is introduced, together with the other measures such as the provision of up to three months leave for parents to care for their children, it will represent a major upgrading of all aspects of children's welfare.</P>
    <P>There is international pressure in this area, such as Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which will force us to do certain things, but as a State we should ensure children are not abused.  They should be able to enjoy their lives and feel free to participate in all walks of life without the fear of abuse.  We should be capable of legislating speedily and specifically when the need arises.  This is one of the most serious issues we will deal with in terms of the welfare of children.  The consequences of not dealing with it are drastic.  Reports of abuse constitute only a small percentage of the abuse that is taking place &mdash; I am talking here in an Irish context.  We must send a clear message from this House that abuse of young people will not be tolerated by the State.  The punishment must fit the crime.  The Minister has struck the right note in this regard, particularly in section 3 which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Child trafficking for the purpose of sexual abuse has been ignored over the years.  It has been referred to in the context of pseudoreligious groups which have taken families under their wing.  This has been a difficult matter to deal with because very often parents are involved.  It is a matter of which we must be aware and with which we must deal.  I am glad all people, including parents, who permit abuse of children are covered in the legislation.  No specific case of child trafficking has been dealt with because much of it has been conducted under a different guise.  This is a matter on which we must educate ourselves.  There have been rumours of cases and very often the reaction is that there is a personal gripe against a certain group and that people are concerned about the religious education of their children.  We now find, however, that there is real substance to many of those complaints.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter and ensure such activities are covered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> This Bill will be widely discussed during its passage.  I welcome the Minister's proposals. While this is not a very large Bill, it is a technical measure which is a start in facing up to difficulties in terms of modern technology.  The Internet has been referred to, and it can be of great benefit to students, industry and others, but it can also have a very harmful influence on people.  I commend the Minister on the steps he is taking in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Fine Gael welcomes this Bill which deals with the very serious matter of child pornography.  The regulation of pornography generally can be a very controversial issue as it often involves a conflict between the right of citizens to read or view the material of their choice and the right of others, particularly women and children, to be protected from exploitation and from being depicted in a degrading and humiliating manner.  Here, however, we are dealing only with child pornography.  Therefore, the type of conflict to which I referred does not really come into play.</P>
      <P>The essential characteristic of child pornography is that its very production will almost invariably have involved the commission of an offence and often a number of serious offences. In this country, no person under the age of 15 years can consent to sexual intercourse.  Homosexual acts are illegal if either party is under the age of 16 years or is mentally impaired.  Most other countries have similar laws, although the age limits vary.  Be that as it may, it means that any pornographic film which portrays a person under the age of 15 years engaged in a sexual act would automatically be the product of crime if made in Ireland or in any one of several other countries.</P>
      <P>Another valid reason to outlaw the production and distribution of child pornography is that there is strong evidence to suggest that the use of this pornography may be a causal factor in the commission of crimes against children.  There is some disagreement among experts on this issue but we cannot afford to take any chances in this area.  Doubtless the motivation for sexually abusing children may derive from deep rooted psychological factors but the use of pornography may well be the immediate factor which motivates those already disposed towards abusing children to go out and commit specific acts of abuse.  This is another good reason to outlaw it.</P>
      <P>Another reason is that paedophiles sometimes use child pornography and other forms of pornography as a means to persuade and induce children and adolescents to engage in sexual acts with them.  All the evidence, therefore, points to the need for strict controls on child pornography and, indeed, for sustained efforts at both domestic and international level to eliminate it.  It is probably too optimistic to expect it to be eliminated in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever arguments can be made from the so-called civil libertarian standpoint on the freedom <Col N="902" /> to use adult pornography, there is absolutely no valid argument to be made on child pornography, which is often the product of crime and there is a strong likelihood that it leads to further crime. The catastrophic consequences of that crime for its victims is to be seen on a daily basis in our courts.</P>
    <P>It is clear this Bill is intended as a comprehensive effort to criminalise the production, distribution and possession of child pornography as well as trafficking in children for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Two crucially important aspects of the Bill are the definitions given to child pornography and sexual exploitation.  The definition of this term is contained in section 1 where it appears to be confined to audio and visual representation, which includes books, periodicals and other documents.  I assume the primary definition of child pornography, with its reference to computer graphics and so forth, includes material published on the Internet.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the problem of people using the Internet to exchange information on targeting children for sexual exploitation purposes.  If, for example, a website was established simply showing photographs, not necessarily obscene photographs, of children with an indication of where they could be found and indicating they were available for sexual purposes, would this practice, although intended to facilitate child abuse and as harmful as pornography in its own way, if not more so, be captured under the present definition of child exploitation?</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to two further aspects of the definition of child pornography.  As the Bill now reads, a visual representation is confined to depictions of children engaged in explicit sexual activity and to intimate depictions of children for a sexual purpose.  If, for example, a video or photograph depicted a child watching adults engaged in sexual activity, would that come within the present definition?  I do not believe it would, because the present definition is confined to representations of children engaged in or depicted as being engaged in sexual activity.  In the types of situations I mentioned, the children in question are not really engaged in such an activity, but are more bystanders.  However, we know from accounts of child abuse committed here and elsewhere that children have been used by adults for the purposes of sexual gratification in this way.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will table an amendment to extend the present definition to include representations of children against whom sexual acts are being directed or whose presence at a scene involving sexual activity by others is depicted as providing sexual gratification for those others.  The type of activity in question would not necessarily involve advocating, encouraging or counselling unlawful sexual activity for children.  Furthermore, the type of behaviour I described of children witnessing adult sexual acts is unfortunately not always unlawful in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> It is not clear, as the Bill is drafted, if child pornography includes printed narratives, such as novels without illustrations.  The reason for the ambiguity is that on the one hand visual representation is defined as including documents such as books, periodicals and pamphlets but on the other hand, the primary definition states that it must be a visual representation which shows a child engaged in explicit sexual activity and so on. If it is meant to include printed narratives, surely one would expect to find a word formulation along the lines that a visual representation is one which describes or shows a person?  As it is now written, it conveys the impression through the exclusive use of the word &ldquo;shows&rdquo; that there must be some graphic or photographic element involved.  If it is not intended to include solely printed pornography, this is surely a serious gap in the Bill.  Pornography in literary form, if one may call it that, has long been in existence and continues to thrive even in this technological age.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Bill is in some way or other intended to cover printed pornography, then I would like to draw attention to another problem which relates to the conception of a visual representation in the Bill.  It will be noted that this has two aspects depicting a child engaged in sexual activity and intimate photographs of children for a sexual purpose.  There is an important difference in the way these two aspects are defined.  In the second, the intimate depiction of the child must be the dominant characteristic of the representation. This will operate to keep medical text books and such things from being treated as pornographic.  There is no such requirement of dominant purposes in relation to a visual representation depicting or purporting to depict a child engaged in explicit sexual acts bearing in mind that a visual representation can be a book, a magazine, a film or a video among other things. If there was a serious documentary on child abuse which depicted such an act or if a serious work of literature described such an act, is it, therefore, right that such an act should be treated as child pornography, although its dominant purpose is not even remotely pornographic?</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that a later provision makes it a serious offence to possess a piece of child pornography as defined here.  As I read the definitional elements of child pornography, there is a possibility that many people might unwittingly commit the possession offence by having a book or video in their house perhaps for a long time without realising it contravenes the terms of this legislation simply because the dominant purpose of the book or video in question could not be remotely described as pornographic &mdash; I am talking about medical matter and so on. It is a technical point, but it is one at which we should look.</P>
    <P>I realise some will argue that artistic merit should not be a deciding factor.  A serious work of literature might be used for pornographic purposes by some and not by others.  What matters <Col N="904" /> at the end of the day is the protection of children. However, there is a need for balance in view of the many competing issues of stake.  This is a matter which I am sure we will debate carefully on Committee Stage.  Would it be better to have a dominant purpose requirement for all types of visual representation?  Would there be more merit in a provision to the effect that to constitute child pornography, a visual representation is not treated as such unless it is gratuitously included in a work which is otherwise of literary, artistic or of scientific merit?  The regulation of any form of speech, including pornography, is a difficult and delicate issue and I hope we will give it serious attention as the Bill moves through Committee and Final Stages in the House.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the need to outlaw the systematic exchange of information intended to facilitate child sexual exploitation.  It is doubtful if the section, as drafted, would cover this practice.  Yet what we know about paedophile rings suggests that their operation relies heavily on this kind of information exchange.  Although the information which is traded may not always be pornographic in that it may not include the kind of depiction covered by the Bill, it can have an impact which is just as detrimental as pornography.</P>
    <P>On the definition of sexual exploitation in section 3, it is appropriate to draw attention to gaps in the criminal law relating to sexual offences against children.  There is a serious lack of legislation to outlaw indecency with children. There is no general offence of child sexual abuse in our law, although the Law Reform Commission recommended the introduction of such an offence as far back as 1989.  Most forms of abuse will come within the definition of the standard offences, such as rape, sexual assault, incest, prostitution or gross indecency between males, but there is a need for a general offence to cover behaviour such as allowing children to witness sexual acts.  The absence of such an offence weakens the law now being introduced in relation to sexual exploitation which is heavily dependent on current sexual offences against children.  I hope the Minister gives this matter urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 4 which makes it an offence for a person having custody, charge or care of a child to allow the child to be used for the production of child pornography.  I ask the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage whether it would be wise to extend this definition to include a person in a position of influence over a child.  What I have in mind is the possibility that a person, such as a sports coach or voluntary worker with a youth group, might misuse his position to facilitate the exploitation of children for pornographic purposes by allowing photographs to be taken of them.  Such a person might not necessarily be deemed to have custody, charge or care of the child at the particular time, yet he can have considerable influence over the children with whom <Col N="905" /> he works whether in a paid or voluntary capacity. There could be no principled objection to broadening the provision to state that any person who facilitates or allows a child to be used for pornographic purposes shall be guilty of an offence.  No one has a right to do this.  The penalties could be increased in the case of a parent, guardian or carer.</P>
    <P>One of the most far reaching provisions is contained in section 6 which makes it a serious criminal offence to possess child pornography.  In a liberal democracy such as ours we are usually reluctant to legislate for what people may read or view in the privacy of their homes.  The general principle in the words of John Stuart Mill is that behaviour should not be criminalised unless it causes harm to others.  This is a fundamental norm most of us would wish to see honoured. Section 6, as drafted, constitutes an exception to that norm.  However, I am prepared to tolerate it because of the seriousness of the issue involved. Child pornography results from harm to others, namely the children involved in its production. There is strong evidence to suggest that it leads to further harm when it falls into the hands of the wrong people.  In view of the important constitutional principle at stake, I ask the Minister to consider it with the Attorney General.  Does he believe this section would survive a constitutional challenge in the event of a person being prosecuted for the possession of, say, a video which might involve an element of child pornography but which in the eyes of some people may, unfortunately, have some documentary or artistic merit?</P>
    <P>There are two perfectly reasonable exceptions mentioned in section 6, one of which will protect those who might happen to find themselves in possession of pornography in the exercise of official censorship functions and the other which will protect those engaged in crime prevention, investigation and prosecution.  I draw the Minister's attention to a third possibility, namely, the possession of such material for bona fide research purposes.  A great deal of the leading scientific research carried out by psychologists, criminologists and scholars in the field of women's studies has involved the examination of various kinds of pornography for specific investigation purposes. This is clearly important work and it should not be prohibited through a legislative oversight. Close attention would have to be paid to the wording of any such provision to ensure it does not provide a loophole.  However, I am confident that such a form of wording can be found.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise with the Minister a matter which is relevant to the topic being debated.  It is said that some imprisoned sex offenders exchange copies of each other's statements as a form of pornography.  If this is true, then it makes a complete nonsense of any efforts, such as they are, to reduce the risk of these people reoffending when they are released.  This is probably not the appropriate debate in which to deal with the exchange of statements which involve a complex point of <Col N="906" /> criminal procedure and possibly a point of constitutional law, but there is a problem and the Minister should examine it urgently.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an indictment of our society that we need a Bill to deal with child pornography. This terrible trade has existed for thousands of years and it is only now that we are really tackling it.  I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the Bill which will help address and, I hope, eliminate child trafficking and pornography.</P>
      <P>The Bill probably had its genesis in the Bill dealing with child sexual abuse in the Philippines introduced by Deputy Eoin Ryan.  At that time Irish priests in the Philippines highlighted nationally and internationally the huge problems of child sex rings and the fact that people travel to the Philippines to engage in this evil practice. We have heard reports of families who are forced for economic reasons to sell their children to this trade.  I am sure these families do not realise the purposes for which their children are used.  It is cruel that such an economic necessity exists in this day and age.  It forces us to consider the extent of our international aid programme, particularly for families who are forced to sell their children for economic reasons.</P>
      <P>Under section 3(1) it will be an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate child trafficking. I hope this section will reduce the level of child trafficking.  We are all aware of the terrible Dutroux case in Belgium where children were imprisoned and killed.  Section 3(2) will make it an offence to detain or restrict the liberty of a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  A person found guilty of such an offence will be liable on conviction to up to ten years imprisonment. When one considers the Dutroux case one wonders whether ten years is a reasonable period of incarceration for a person who has ruined the life of a child.</P>
      <P>It is horrifying to read the explanatory memorandum and the definitions in the Bill.  It is repellent that we have to bring in laws to prevent people from showing children engaging in explicit sexual activity, the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction for a sexual purpose of the genital or anal regions of children.  Most of us in this House are parents and even the thought that any child, like our own children, could be subjected to such grossly indecent acts is totally abhorrent.  The Bill also specifically includes the definition of pictures or audio material of those events or anything which encourages or advocates unlawful sexual activity with children.</P>

    <P>The question of the Internet was raised by a number of speakers.  I agree that all the Internet service providers should come together to form a grouping.  They should make available a freefone number to allow any responsible user of the ISP services throughout Ireland, whether it be Ireland On-Line, Indigo, Internet Ireland or the Higher Education Authority net, who comes across anything associated with child pornography to telephone <Col N="907" /> the number so that access to the site would be immediately denied by all the Internet service providers.  That would not be difficult to do.</P>
    <P>Internationally the main search engine is Alta Vista which is used by many of the other search engines.  Alta Vista is a company which I understand is owned by Digital DEC.  International pressure should be put on Alta Vista to ensure any sites which include child pornographic material are eliminated from the search engine.</P>
    <P>Some months ago it came to my attention that there was a child sex site on IOL.  Without hesitation, IOL immediately removed that site from its service and was anxious to ensure that people who found unsuitable items on the service would inform the company so that they could be deleted immediately.  That was a first class response from IOL.</P>
    <P>I agree there should be a register of paedophiles in Ireland.  No quarter should be shown to people who ruin the lives of children.  We have to listen more to our own and other children, take seriously what they tell us and ensure their complaints are fully investigated.</P>
    <P>It can be difficult for children in schools who make an accusation against a teacher.  The complaint has to be investigated and the teacher's reputation is at stake but we must ensure that if a child makes an accusation against a teacher it is treated in a sensitive manner and that the case is examined in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the time has arrived where children are denied cuddles.  In the past many Members of the House, during meetings in their constituencies or otherwise, would give a child a cuddle and ask them how they were.  Circumstances would arise where that would have been appropriate, and it is very unfortunate that children are denied those cuddles except by their parents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to artistic merit and child pornography but I hope this jurisdiction will not allow a liberal thinking population, in Europe or elsewhere, to prevent us from ensuring that child trafficking and pornography are eliminated not only in Ireland but internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill dealing with an increasing problem in our society which involves a corrupt, million dollar business with an international dimension.  The Bill is an indication that in one sense we have come full circle.  In the United States, the makers of the film &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo; cannot find a distributor.  We are discovering that the liberal agenda has not been so liberating.  In some instances, it has curtailed development, enslaved human beings and deprived children of childhood innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the absence of child pornography, children are being corrupted every day.  One simply has to look at MTV to see that sexual images are broadcast early in the evening.  These programmes are not catering for adults because these fairly explicit sexual images are broadcast at six o'clock in the evening.  Even children who are <Col N="908" /> interested in the Spice Girls &mdash; some as young as four years of age &mdash; watch these programmes. That must be questioned because children are being sexualised prematurely.  They have the minds of children but they are being subjected, at every instance, to sexual imagery.  The Australian &ldquo;soaps&rdquo; which are broadcast every day depict children who, under the definition of this Act are those under 17 years of age, engaging in sexual relationships.  Is this good for society?  I do not agree with Margaret Thatcher's dictum that there is no such thing as society, only individuals.  We have to think about the good of society and, as we enter the new millennium, we are beginning to rethink the idea behind the liberal agenda.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with the Bill in that it deals primarily with visual images, not the written word, and that raises the question of magazines for children.  <i>More</i> magazine is aimed at children under the age of 17 yet it deals with fairly explicit subjects.  Do we intend to deal with that problem at some future stage?  I hope we will because one simply has to listen to the conversations of ten year olds to hear how apparently sophisticated they are.  They are only children but they are talking about sex, fancying people, etc.  That is something about which we should be concerned because if we are sexualising our children at such an early age, the consequences will be that we will have more unwanted pregnancies, etc.  That is something we ought to be worried about.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines what is meant by child pornography. In section 5 the important word is &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.  The freephone system is a good one, and it would be wrong if Indigo or Ireland on Line were held accountable because they provide a service on that basis.  We have had much comment about the Internet, some of it good and some of it plain ignorant, and I say that with respect.  The Internet is wonderful, it contains mountains of knowledge for people who want to access it but it is also difficult to control.  We need to be careful, but Internet service providers should not become the fall guys.  If police units were properly trained in information technology, the freephone system would make it possible to trace people and crack paedophile rings.  We can track down some of the most sophisticated hackers who bounce material around the world.  It should be possible to trace paedophiles also.  Recently we saw how the famous Gary Glitter was tracked down through his use of computers.</P>
    <P>We need to crack down heavily on paedophile rings, and it is important that we are seen to do so.  I agree with Deputy Ardagh that terms of imprisonment are far too short.  We need to have a harsher regime for people who are ruining children's lives.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people accept that pornography is probably the dirtiest and seediest form of abuse.  It largely affects women and children. Many studies over the years have shown the link between pornography and violence because pornography <Col N="909" /> dehumanises people and shows them as depersonalised sexual beings, not as human beings, multifaceted people with rights.  Pornography is used by men to show dominance and power.  It has been shown over the years that it has led to women feeling very vulnerable and unsafe.  If that is the way adult women feel, how do young children feel who have been the victims of such sordid abuse?</P>
      <P>What is frightening about pornography is that it is a multimillion dollar industry.  It has been proven to be at least as big as the video and music industries combined throughout the world.  It is not just something we in Ireland have come across recently.  In Europe and North America it has been found that up to 60 per cent of men are regular users of pornography.  It is frightening to think of the large numbers of children who are caught up in the sex industry.  For years we have blinded ourselves into believing that this is something that happens in America, Thailand or the Far East.  Unfortunately, with the horror of what happened in Belgium in recent years we have found that it happens all too close to home.</P>
      <P>The exploitation of children in pornography is closely linked to child sex abuse.  It has been found that each reinforces the other.  Women and children are depersonalised by it.  They are turned into consumer objects.  They are objects for the benefit of profit for a multimillion dollar industry.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has recognised the difficulties and the extent of the problem in a report entitled &ldquo;Sexual Exploitation: Pornography, Prostitution and Trafficking in Children and Young Adults&rdquo;.  The report observes that abuse and exploitation is often associated with early sex abuse within the family or outside it and is underestimated by criminal, justice, welfare and educational organisations.  It is not something that falls within the remit of any one Department or Minister.  It needs to be addressed by all Ministers working together transnationally across borders.</P>
      <P>All the records show that children's involvement in sexual exploitation exacerbates their shame, humiliation and powerlessness.  Particularly for children, the knowledge that there is a visual record of their abuse will be with them for the rest of their lives, irrespective of how young they were when abused.  That visual record is pornography, it is impossibly painful for children and something with which they can never cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because it is such an international problem and transcends boundaries, this Bill is particularly welcome.  Though not mentioning the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; it covers the Internet, because the Internet transcends technological borders.  We need to control what we do in our own countries, but it is very difficult to control what happens in third countries because they themselves have little legislative control.  The working party being set up on the illegal and harmful content of the Internet has led, for example, to the STOP programme, but the Commission has said that it is the responsibility of each member state to ensure the application of existing laws.  In that context I <Col N="910" /> welcome this legislation, because we need to strengthen our own laws.  We can only enforce whatever laws we introduce ourselves.  Again, we need a co-ordinated approach.  Outside Europe, the G7 plus Russia have a working group on child trafficking and pornography and the abuse of the Internet.</P>
    <P>For the first time in this Bill there is a definition of pornography and of the child.  I particularly welcome the continued use of the definition of a child as being up to and including 17 years of age because young adults, which they are at the age of 17, feel independent and would never classify themselves as children.  They feel they have a certain knowledge and sense of responsibility, and it is only years later that they realise that at 17 one is still a child.  It is very important to hold on to that age definition.</P>
    <P>The definition of the types of pornography and its types of presentation is particularly welcome. The Irish approach is probably better than the UK Protection of Children Act, 1978, because this refers only to photographs and pseudo photographs. It is better than the American Federal Child Pornography Statute which refers to visual depiction but goes on to define what is meant by visual depiction.  The list of sexual acts it gives is itself tantamount to pornography.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister on drafting this Bill and the definitions in it.</P>
    <P>I welcome all aspects of the Bill which deals with the production, distribution, printing, publication, import, export, selling or facilitating of such activities or facilitating advertising.  That also covers the Internet.  Equally welcome is the fact that possession is also listed.  What is difficult is its policing.  The power of the Garda Síochána to have a warrant to enter, search and seize, and that the courts can forfeit and destroy, is a strong one, but enforcement will always be difficult, and it is something we should keep a close eye on.</P>
    <P>There have been some successes in other countries, particularly in relation to the Internet in England, for example, in the case of R. <i>v</i> Fellowes, the supplier using a university computer to distribute pornography and in which there was a successful prosecution.  The extent of the problem in that case was that the data in question contained 11,650 pictures which were being distributed, 1,875 of which were of minors.</P>
    <P>The police were fortunate to have discovered this situation.  In other cases this happens by chance, as occurred when Gary Glitter had his personal computer repaired.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that he has been charged with 50 different prosecutable offences.  Policing this is very difficult because one is dealing with people who are in positions of power, strength and influence over innocent children. <Col N="911" /> This morning I brought in a group of sixth class children from Booterstown national school. I spoke to them about the importance of our work and attempted to explain that we were debating a child pornography measure.  One asked innocently if children could not be used in advertising any more.  She was thinking of the Liga advertisements and had no concept of what I was talking about.  This brought home to me the extent of the problem.  We are dealing with children who are so innocent that they have no idea of the level of abuse that can take place.  Child pornography is a very frightening development in our society, a society which has failed in many ways.</P>
      <P>Child trafficking is almost impossible to comprehend. One thinks of milk cartons in America which carry photographs of missing children. Those children's parents must wonder if their children are kidnapped, dead or sold off for sordid activity.  I welcome the Bill because it means that we are doing our part to protect the most innocent members of our society.  However, enforcement of the Bill must be given full power.</P>

      <P>Not a day seems to go by without reports of child sexual abuse on the radio or television. Many of the crimes against children are carried out by trusted relations or friends of these children's families.  This Bill will go a long way toward strengthening the legislation against child sexual abuse such as the Children Bill, 1996, which updated the law on abuse.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call last Saturday from a young woman in Cork on whose case I am working.  Her circumstances are horrific.  Her child, who is a year and a half old, is allegedly being molested by his father.  It makes me sick to think about it, but listening to that lady tell me the gory details of the abuse focused my mind on what can happen to young children.  This case is even more frightening because the Garda cannot prosecute the case successfully because of the age of the child.  I was close to tears when speaking to this woman.  What manner of person carries out such acts?  What drives them to lust after and abuse children of both sexes?  I wish there was a cure for this illness, which robs young children of their innocence.</P>
      <P>I have yet to see any pornographic images of children on the Internet, but I believe quite a number exist.  Those communicating with each other about this see nothing wrong with what they are doing.  They see it as the exchange of information and see nothing wrong with trading pornographic photographs and messages.  I welcome the Bill's provisions regarding pornography as well as child trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hardly a day goes by without one hearing of child pornography rings, the paedophiles who run them and the sexual abuse that results from them. <i>The Examiner</i> devoted a page last Monday to sexual abuse court cases, though not all of them related to children.  It is frightening to have <Col N="912" /> people from all parts of society organised into rings devoted to gratification from photographing and abusing young children.</P>
    <P>A register of known paedophiles is very important.  We need to know the names of those who have been convicted and sentenced for these offences and where they go when their terms of imprisonment end.  I am informed by doctors that approximately 90 per cent of paedophiles are repeat offenders.  It is vital to have a register of paedophiles to know if they are in contact with children.  Because of the nature of their illness, many paedophiles find a way to become involved with children, and the Minister should look into establishing a register.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, as all Members will.  I hope it passes and is enacted speedily to bring us into line with other States which have passed similar laws.  I have not had time to study all contributions to this debate, but I am sharing my time with Deputy Roche, who is very eloquent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague.  At least he did not say I had more experience in this area than he has.  I compliment the Minister, because this is a very timely Bill.  This subject is becoming very topical.  There is an attempt, particularly in the art world, to desensitise people to the revulsion they naturally feel towards the concept of child pornography.  For example, I listened to an extraordinary erudite defence of the remaking of the film &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo; where a 12 year old, with a body double, is being cast in a pornographic role.  It is intriguing that the writer of the original novel, Nabokov, cautioned against using young people in this way.</P>
      <P>This debate, and the debate about that film, raises the question of pornography, child pornography, the abuse of children and, as the Minister said, the theft of childhood.  It is important that we address this issue.  The Bill is timely because it represents a joint European response to the horrors of the Belgian child abuse ring that were unveiled to an incredulous world last year. This is a truly frightening issue.  Any civilised adult human being must be appalled at the concept of children being abused in this manner.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the Internet, an extraordinary and remarkable tool in the worldwide explosion of information technology. However, the speed with which it has been abused is regrettable.  Users of the net will know that one can innocently be sidelined into websites which peddle pornography.  For example, some of the cartoon sites are innocuous and enjoyed by adults and young people.  However, if one clicks on a button to get a further example relating to a cartoon, one could be transferred to a site which contains very explicit pornography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation must be introduced on a pan national basis.  There would be no point in us introducing regulations to control the Internet because most of the material that causes offence comes down the line from the United States or elsewhere.  We are dealing with a complex use of <Col N="913" /> technology.  While there are huge benefits to be gained from its extraordinary volume of material, it is also abused by the purveyors of pornography, the abusers of children and those who destroy youth.</P>
    <P>The legislation illustrates the Minister's consciousness of the need to keep abreast of technology, although I acknowledge that work was done prior to the change of Government.  The horrific events of the Belgian paedophile became public knowledge during the course of our Presidency of the EU and operated as a catalyst in this regard.  The abuse of the net also became evident through a case that was mentioned earlier.  I will not mention the person's name because there has not been a finding against him.  The abuse became evident when his computer coughed up some of its nasty contents when it was returned for maintenance.</P>
    <P>While the legislation is worthwhile, it is difficult to envisage how the Internet can be policed without a huge amount of technological development. There are thousands of hits available under each site and these are displayed at the bottom of each page.  However, that is not to say we should not try to police it and the Bill is a first step in that direction.  It recognises the net as a channel through which pornography can be purveyed and contains a number of other worthwhile aspects.  I am pleased to note that it provides for the criminalisation of the provision of accommodation for children being moved from one State to another and that there will be much clearer provisions relating to the movement of children across borders. The Minister was correct not to try to identify or codify what is meant by obscene or indecent behaviour.  He prudently left that decision to the courts.  They will have to refer to the specific context within which an image or piece of material is regarded as prurient or art.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of international pornography I find appalling.  I have not seen the film &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo; and even if it were available here, I would not wish to see it.  There is something extraordinarily distasteful about creative people using a 12 year old to create an atmosphere in which child pornography and paedophile actions against a child are glorified as if they were a form of art.  Most people, particularly parents, find that difficult to accept.  The makers of the film have made the excuse that they are using a body double for the child, but that is avoiding the main point of criticism.  There is something offensive about anything that glorifies or commercialises the abuse of children, seeks to portray as normal an abuse of a child or, as in the case of the film, portrays a child as the cause of the offence.  It is sad that people with undoubted talent and artistic abilities engage in this type of film making.</P>
    <P>This has given rise to a debate about where responsibility for pornography should rest.  Anyone who tolerates the abuse of a child in any image is tolerant of pornography.  This type of abuse does not happen merely in films.  The issue of child models has been discussed recently.  I <Col N="914" /> would regard myself as being very liberal, but I find it appalling that major fashion houses use children by dressing them to look like adults.  A particular look which also constitutes an abuse of children has recently come under much criticism in the international fashion industry.  It is difficult to know where the borderline lies between abuse and art, particularly as some people regard it as liberal to suggest there should be no thresholds beyond which we should not go.  The Minister was prudent to leave it up to the courts to decide what is decent in the circumstances before it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome small addition to the armoury because it recognises this is an international problem which must be addressed on a pan-national basis.  One of the criticisms of the Amsterdam Treaty was that it would create something approaching a police state.  I refute that.  One of the most welcome aspects of that Treaty is that it will create mechanisms to address matters such as the movement of children across borders and actions which facilitate the type of pornography with which this Bill is concerned. The Bill also defines a child as someone under 17. That is a logical decision.  Although young people develop more rapidly today than they did ten or 20 years ago, they can still be trapped and abused and the consent they are capable of giving is determined by circumstances.  The cut off age of 17 is welcome.  I welcome the Bill as an additional measure to protect children and I cannot see why anyone would oppose it.</P>
    <P>One small issue is policing, particularly of pornography on the Internet.  The creation of strictures which would make the Internet and all its benefits inaccessible is undesirable, but at the same time, consideration must be given to it.  It strikes me that there ought to be an international conference on it and it is to be hoped we can be to the fore in promoting that.  There is a good deal of technologically advanced thinking in this country so we have a part to play.  Policing the Internet will be a mammoth task because of the extraordinary amount of information on it.  I do not know how that will be achieved technologically. While welcoming the Bill, it should be pointed out that there are still lacunae, including the policing of the Internet, for example, which need to be addressed, and this can only be done by international action.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister because this Bill is one of a series of actions he has taken not only since coming into office but prior to that.  They show he is deeply concerned about this issue. With the good work put in by his predecessors, he is putting in place mechanisms of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Its quality and tone indicated the seriousness with which we all treat the disturbing subject of child pornography.  It is not enough for us to express our contempt for persons who sexually exploit children; we must <Col N="915" /> also act.  This Bill is evidence of the Government's determination to ensure legislation will be put in place to deal with any manifestation of the evils of child pornography and the trafficking of children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this legislation would not have been clear to many people some years ago. That is because there was less awareness of the existence and effects of child pornography and the level of abuse of children involved in its production. Every form of technology in the communications area, from the telephone to videos, can be abused.  New forms of communication, such as the Internet to which many Deputies referred, have their disadvantages as well as their benefits.  These can give rise to new patterns of abuse and exploitation.  Accordingly, legislation must be kept under continuous review and, from time to time, new legislation may be required to deal with any emerging forms of abuse and exploitation.</P>
      <P>However, it is wrong to depend on legislation alone as offering a sufficiently high level of protection to children from being abused in the making of or as a result of child pornography or other forms of exploitation.  The legislation will only succeed if it is accompanied by an increased awareness of the problems associated with child pornography and more education, greater co-operation between agencies and new approaches to investigation and problem solving.</P>
      <P>As has been correctly pointed out by several Deputies, the Internet poses certain problems and challenges, not just in the area of child pornography. Two major issues which can only be dealt with on an international scale are liability for illegal material on the Internet and jurisdictional matters.  I do not wish to say too much about the Internet at this stage in advance of the report of the working group.  However, with the increasing popularity and accessibility of the Internet, parents must be aware of its potentially negative aspects.  Various tools are being developed to help parents monitor children's activities on the Internet, such as equipment which will block parts of it or will limit searches on it.  Parents should try to keep up to date with modern technology in this area and make use of it if they are to match with practical, preventative measures their concern about what their children are accessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville thought the child abduction provision of the legislation was too restrictive. This provision must be read in conjunction with the child abduction provision in the Non-Fatal Offences Against The Person Act, 1997, which includes abduction by parents.  In a Bill dealing with child trafficking and abduction, it would not be possible to deal with abduction for other specific reasons, such as child labour.  However, that is a matter which could be examined by the appropriate Department to see if the law needs to be tightened up.  Although the Deputy's point <Col N="916" /> is well made, it is inappropriate to deal with it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Upton referred to the need to regulate the Internet, something I have already mentioned.  This will be dealt with in the report of the working group on the Internet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville correctly mentioned that many pornographic pictures are 30 and 40 years old.  It illustrates the extent to which paedophiles will go to hold on to their pornography.  They hate to part with it and collect it like others would stamps or football cards.  As Deputy Neville correctly pointed out, the material they collect has in its making already resulted in children being abused. It may well be used to fuel the fantasies of paedophiles so that other children in future may be abused as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville also referred to pictures of children which, while not pornographic, are sexual to the paedophile.  This is true and, as the Deputy said, it cannot be criminalised.  The problem is in the mind of the paedophile who regards the pictures or photographs as being sexual even though the children may be fully clothed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville also mentioned the different types of child sexual abuse.  He points out that where incest is involved, the offending may stop when the offender is removed from the house.  However, fixated abusers who abuse strangers or children to whom they are not related can abuse many children.  It is important that children are not afraid to tell someone about the abuse.  Deputy Neville also referred to the sexualisation of children in advertisements.  It is important that parents, sometimes naively, do not sexualise their children, by dressing them as young adults or otherwise making them look like adults.  Advertisers have a duty as to how they depict children in advertisements.  Nobody can absolve themselves of responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton asked why the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; is included in paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;.  It is used where the advocation or encouragement of sexual activity with children is outlawed.  If the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; was not included, it would be an offence to make a video that advocated that married children should not have a sexual relationship.  By children I mean &ldquo;children&rdquo; within the meaning of the definition in the legislation.  Since the Deputy has brought the matter to my attention I will examine whether there is a need for it.  He referred to the penalties for trafficking and abduction of children. Trafficking refers to trafficking across international borders.  However, I will look again at the whole question of the penalty for abduction, about which he was not pleased, and we shall discuss the matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; and asked whether it includes the exchange of information.  The intention is that that aspect is covered but I will certainly discuss it with the draftsman to see whether an amendment is required.  He asked also if films <Col N="917" /> depicting children watching adults in sexual activity would be covered by the definition.  That is a good point and may not be covered in the definitions but I undertake to look at it before Committee Stage.  Other aspects of the legislation mentioned by Deputy Higgins will be examined and if action is required to deal with any omissions we will attempt to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins was concerned that some medical books and so on might be caught up in the definition.  He referred specifically to research material.  In this context I draw his attention to the words &ldquo;for a sexual purpose&rdquo; which are included in the definition.  I do not agree that the material he mentions for research would be excluded.  The point raised by Deputy Higgins regarding the definition of &ldquo;indecency&rdquo; and the lack of a general definition of sexual abuse is dealt with in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Higgins in regard to section 4 may not be valid.  A definition of the terms &ldquo;custody charge&rdquo; and &ldquo;care&rdquo; in the Children's Act is wide-ranging.  I may consider extending it in this Bill having examined the position further.  Deputy Higgins considered that a defence based on bona fide research should be included in section 6.  I have raised that matter with the draftsman and it will arise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy said how ordinary some paedophiles may appear.  This is true.  In my speech I attempted to explain how devious, manipulative and downright dangerous these people can be. He referred also to the age of a child as defined in the Bill.  The definition is in line with that in other legislation dealing with sexual offences.  I considered that to be the best age that could be specified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the Stockholm World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in August 1996. Deputies will be interested to learn the Council of Europe is organising a follow up European regional conference in Strasbourg on 28 and 29 April.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be represented by officials at this conference which should be a learning experience.  Deputy Dennehy referred to the need for a paedophile register.  The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to introduce such a register.  I am determined that that commitment is honoured.  The issues arising from the establishment of the register will be addressed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ardagh and Gormley also referred to the Internet and made some interesting and valid comments, many of which will be dealt with in the forthcoming report of the working group on the Internet.  Deputies Gormley and O'Flynn referred to the paedophile rings and how difficult it is to break into them.  However, good police <Col N="918" /> work, vigilance and some good luck can ensure their break up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin said that up to 60 per cent of men look at pornography.  I am in no position to dispute that figure but the proportion of child pornography would be low compared with the broad sweep of pornography which is available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn argued also for a paedophile register.  There will be a sexual offenders or a paedophile register, the details of which are discussed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  Deputy O'Flynn's figure of 90 per cent recidivism among paedophiles is quite often put forward.  However, the figure may not be that high.  This does not mean we should drop our guard or not be ever vigilant on this matter.  Even one paedophile can accumulate hundreds of victims before being apprehended, charged and convicted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to pornography being transmitted on innocent sounding websites. Unfortunately, he is correct and this illustrates the difficulty of dealing with this problem on the Internet.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable importance that we have had a wide-ranging and informed debate.  It is of critical importance that this matter is considered maturely.  We began well on Second Stage and I look forward to Committee Stage when the detail can be further teased out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the reports referred to by the Deputy and the issues raised are under consideration in my Department.  Last week I met the board of Telecom Éireann to hear its response to the issues raised concerning pricing and investment in broadband services.  The board accepts the need for further price reductions to improve the competitiveness of the sector and assured me it will be bringing forward substantial reductions later this year.</P>
      <P>The principal means by which prices of telecommunications services will be brought into line with best international practice is through the implementation of effective competition in the telecommunications sector.  Competition is being implemented through a clear regulatory framework, including a clearly defined role for the Director of Telecommunications Regulations, to ensure market compliance.  Next week the Government will consider the future development of Cablelink as a platform for developing a state-of-the-art multimedia platform.</P>
      <P>With regard to liberalisation of the sector on 1 January 2000, the agreement with the European Commission was entered into by the previous Government in November 1996.  This timetable formed part of the strategic alliance deal with KPN-Telia which has been supported by the Union Coalition.  The timetable was designed to afford Telecom Éireann time to achieve the necessary structural adjustments so that it can compete effectively in an open regime.  The recent agreement with the Union Coalition on an employee share ownership scheme in Telecom Éireann was a key milestone in this regard as it prepares the way for the transformation of the company to proceed.</P>
      <P>On the question of investment in the sector, my Department is considering, in the context of planning for the use of Structural Funds after 1999, whether funds should be dedicated to the development of broadband infrastructure to promote the availability of advanced services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware that a call for proposals will be issued shortly for the purposes of the award of ten mecu under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme and £2 million under the INTERREG programme for broadband infrastructure as additional funds to support the development of the information society.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the board of Telecom Éireann informed me last week that it approached the IDA and Forfás with a view to establishing a small group to identify the precise needs of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the matters on the Minister's desk the issue of telecommunications costs, including leased line charges, and Internet <Col N="920" /> charges is the most critical in terms of the development of the economy.  While Telecom Éireann's prices have gone down by 17 per cent in recent years, is the Minister aware that reports show that, in terms of competitiveness, we are eighteenth out of 24 on the table; that leased line charges are 80 per cent higher here than in the United Kingdom, and that trunk call charges are four times higher here than in Sweden?  In these circumstances will the Minister agree &mdash; I was a member of the Government which sought the derogation &mdash; that there is a case for introducing liberalisation of voice telephony services earlier than 1 January 2000 given the pace of change among our competitors who are reducing prices faster?  Is the Minister prepared to contemplate this or &mdash; I understand the point she made about KPN-Telia &mdash; is it a shut case?  To introduce competition, say, on 1 January 1999 a decision would have to be made rapidly in terms of the licensing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this issue.  The issue of telecommunications costs is of vital importance to us.  As the Deputy is aware, and as indicated by Forfás and in earlier reports, there are three main centres, the Asian, United States and European centres.  If we avail of every opportunity, we have the capacity to move forward.  We have the people with the brains and we have the necessary structures.  It is a question of approaching it in a much more dynamic way.</P>
      <P>That is the message I tried to impart at the meeting with the board of Telecom Éireann last Thursday.  It shares my concern at the reports.  I made the point that it should not be so defensive in its response.  As the Deputy said, the cost of calls has come down by 17 per cent.  Despite this, they are still too costly.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have informed me that this point is made consistently in IDA reports, including those on industries which decided not to locate here. The cost of telephone calls, Internet charges and the lack of investment in broadband infrastructure are consistently highlighted.  They are interlinked. I informed the board about the ESOP which was concluded the previous night.  It is aware of the need to tackle the issue in a much more dynamic way and that competition is looming quickly.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a derogation was sought in 1993 and finally granted in the latter half of 1996 in respect of voice telephony services. It covers the period to the year 2000.  We had sought a derogation to 2003.  This formed part of the commercial contract and strategic alliance deal entered into by KPN-Telia with Telecom Éireann.  It was envisaged at the time that there would be a sale of a 14.9 per cent stake to the workers.  This did not come off but I am glad it has now been concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's sense of urgency on the need to introduce competition earlier than the proposed date but I am conscious that commercial <Col N="921" /> and political agreements have been entered into by the strategic partner, the company and the Union Coalition.  I hope the sale of Cablelink, which the Deputy supports, will proceed.  Having reached agreement with the employees, the board will now work to make the company more competitive. To put to one side a commercial contract would be the incorrect path on which to travel.  I am not prepared to put to one side the contract with the workers which I concluded last week concerning employee share ownership.  I told Telecom Éireann clearly and openly that its telephone and Internet charges are too costly while its Internet services are too inaccessible.  I have also raised the lack of infrastructure in broadband.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 of the legislation establishing the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulations relates to price capping for a five year period which is the Minister's responsibility.  Does the Minister agree with a proposal put forward by IBEC that this responsibility should be transferred to the regulator whose brief is to promote competition?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to broadband capability. It is estimated that the investment by Esat and Telecom is £500 million short of that which is required.  Has the Government any proposals to invest Structural Funds, arising from the midterm review or in any other manner, to ensure the full roll out of broadband capability is put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forfás report nailed down the figure of £500 million.  There is no dispute about this figure or about what is needed.  We gained from a disbursement of money from the EU last year to carry out this useful pilot project. We are preparing proposals for post 1999 for investment in broadband.  I hope the sale of Cablelink will enable Telecom Éireann make proper and comprehensive investment in that area.  I expect Telecom will pursue this route.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in pointing out that the price capping arrangement rests with the Minister for five years from the date of the legislation, namely, mid-1996.  I have said enough to Telecom Éireann and will say more as necessary.  In many ways Telecom Éireann is a fine company which, together with its employees, has given and continues to give great service to the State.  It unveiled a very ambitious corporate plan last autumn. That plan includes foreign investment. However, it should concentrate on Ireland for the present until the infrastructure and so on is brought to a proper standard.  Telecom's board is entitled to produce a corporate governance plan. It has done so and the plan contains some ambitious ideas about linking up with and investing in other countries.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if the policy for the introduction of competition in the electricity generation industry will no longer be fulfilled by means of open competition that would include the ESB but rather by a selection process for new generators that would exclude the ESB; her views on whether this would lead to ESB generation plants closing down and to large scale redundancies among its workforce; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8498/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be based on a misapprehension.  In the first instance there is no proposal to move to a selection process for new generators under the new industry structure.  The Deputy is aware of much of what I am going to say through his work in the Department.  The choice under the relevant EU directive is between a tendering system for new capacity, in which case authorisation must also be granted if sought, or a simple authorisation system.  There is no proposal to exclude ESB under either system of regulation.</P>
      <P>The capital investment involved in any new generation capacity which ESB might wish to build will continue, as at present, to be subject to shareholder approval.</P>
      <P>There are no valid grounds for believing that the advent of competition as required by the EU directive would lead to large-scale redundancy among the ESB's workforce as a result of ESB generation plants closing down.  There are a number of reasons for this view: there is strong growth in demand leading to a need for more rather than less capacity &mdash; last year the ESB had more new connections than ever before; the small degree of initial market opening will limit the extent of potential new entrants; the finite capacity in the gas interconnector will act as a limit on the building of new electricity generation for some years and I have every confidence in the ability of the ESB and its workforce to react positively to competition.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the directive came into force in February 1997 and that it will be implemented by February 2000.  It requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish market be opened to competition, increasing to 32 per cent by 2003.  Customers using more than 100 gigawatt hours per year will automatically be eligible to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market.  The franchise market will continue to be supplied exclusively by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued a consultation document last May which led to the receipt of over 50 submissions from people in the industry and others, most of which were critical in nature. None of the submissions were supportive of the document.  The officials studied the submissions and last January a forum was held where our stall was again laid out.  The papers delivered at the forum were very helpful, as were the subsequent submissions.  During the forum we indicated our view that the holding of open tendering competitions for future large-scale electricity generation might not be the best way forward.  It was clear <Col N="923" /> that a centrally planned tendering system was no longer feasible under the directive as it has emerged.  There are various reasons for this.</P>
    <P>The authorisation procedure is consistent with the approach being taken by many EU states in implementing the EU directive, including the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. I met all the unions yesterday.  We had a very good meeting and went through all the related matters.</P>
    <P>The ESB has a proud and honourable history but has had a monopoly since 1927.  There is no doubt that open competition, even in a limited sense from 2000, will be difficult for management, employees and those in the political system.  The best chance the ESB has is if the challenges and how to cope with them are approached collectively. A certain amount of this is taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>At the forum referred to by the Minister, her officials laid out the Department's stall and came down in favour of authorisation procedures for finding new capacity rather than tendering.  We all understand what is meant by tendering, i.e., the process whereby somebody advertises, tenders are received and a procedure to find the best tender is embarked upon. However, will the Minister explain an authorisation system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A company may wish to build, for example, a new generating station.  We discussed this matter with the employees yesterday. Generating stations are very expensive items, the smallest costing £100 million.  Nobody will invest £100 million unless they are sure the market will sustain the investment and that it is a viable proposition. An inhibiting factor is the gas interconnector which can only sustain one more station.</P>
      <P>That is another question that will have to be addressed in some other fashion.  That is what authorisation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm I am correct in assuming that suitable companies, such as Scottish Power and Marathon Oil, would be licensed under certain criteria for generating electricity? Marathon recently outlined plans at that conference for the building of a 2,000 megawatt power station.  If it was to proceed with its proposal to build such a station, which would provide for approximately half our required capacity, what would happen in regard to the ESB's generating plants, particularly the turf burning plants that produce the most expensive electricity? Would they be redundant if it were to produce electricity from a new modern plant at a cheaper price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Marathon expressed an interest in it, but I do not know who else did. When people are at a forum they feel bullish and want to make their views known.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, the CCR is the <Col N="924" /> arrangement entered into by the Government and the company and its workers.  Under, I believe, Article 24 of the transitional arrangement we signalled to Europe there are arrangements in place here and undertakings entered into &mdash; there is no mention of CCR because they are of a general nature &mdash; but that we may have reservations about the shape of the directive in terms of that article.  We were required to do that by February this year and we did it within the appropriate time.  A further stage of that transitional arrangement will be in place by mid-summer or early autumn next year and under that article we will be able to elaborate on where we perceive the arrangements entered into could be wrongly influenced by the liberalisation programme. By that stage matters will be further advanced.  I hope the necessary legislation will be before or have passed through the House and we will be able to clearly state our position.  I told the unions yesterday, and I will repeat what I said to them tomorrow in Killarney, we will ensure the stations will not be redundant before the end of their economic lifetime, the term used in the arrangements with the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's good intentions in ensuring there will not be redundant capacity, particularly in the most vulnerable sector of the generating capacity, will she agree the system of authorisation will take from her the authority to decide that issue?  If Scottish Power was to build a 300 megawatt power station and provide electricity in the system at a cheaper price, having been licensed or authorised as a suitable company to do so, under the market regulations and the directive the power procurer would be required to take that electricity in the interests of cheaper prices from the consumer.  If that may occur, how can the Minister guarantee to the unions or the House that she can protect the ESB's existing capacity?  I am well aware of the fears of the ESB, previous Governments and this Government in seeking to protect that existing capacity for the duration of its economic lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about this to the IVO last night.  This issue is highly complex in any market that opens up, as the electricity market will open up.  No doubt thriving predatory companies &mdash; although that may be too strong a term &mdash; will properly seek to get much more than their toe into the market.  There are a number of points.  I am committed to the spirit and thrust of the CCR and I have said that here before and to the unions.  The unions accept the CCR was finally framed before the directive was published in its present form but we are expected to work within it.  Under the transitional arrangement we flagged our concern about the final shape of the directive because of the arrangements we have entered into, but the follow-up to that transitional arrangement, which will be in place by September 1999, will enable us to shape much more clearly <Col N="925" /> our commitments to protect the economic lifespan of our stations and outline our concerns about the new influx into the market.</P>
      <P>There will be two Bills before us next year, one giving PLC status to the ESB and a much larger one, with approximately 100 heads, dealing with the opening up of the industry to liberalisation. However, this is a matter the House should closely monitor.  The heads the Bill will be published in three weeks' time for consultation purposes, but they will not be the ones that will be confirmed by Cabinet.  There will be some input into that and once that is completed we could have another debate on the electricity system.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Aer Lingus management has finalised an offer, subject to the approval of the board of the Aer Lingus group and of the shareholder, in respect of the overall financial compensation which would be made available to the staff of TEAM Aer Lingus in the event of the sale of TEAM to FLS.</P>
      <P>Individual letters have been sent to each employee in TEAM, indicating the amount of financial compensation in his or her case.  I understand that at the end of a period of two weeks from 31 March 1998, a form will be issued to each staff member to allow their acceptance or otherwise to be indicated.  These forms are to be returned to the process facilitator, Mr. Gerard Durcan, at the Law Library by close of business on 21 April 1998.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the due diligence process between Aer Lingus management and the management of FLS is proceeding and is expected to take some weeks to be concluded.  I expect that the board of Aer Lingus will consider the overall position towards the end of this month and will make a recommendation to me.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly said that the proposed sale of TEAM to FLS will not proceed without the concurrence of the TEAM workforce.  I will examine carefully any proposal which I receive from the board of Aer Lingus and then make my recommendation to the Government.</P>

About 90 per cent of TEAM's work comes from abroad and, as FLS is a foreign company, they fear that the work would not come here but to the company's base abroad.</P>

Will it require a majority of just the TEAM workers or of the TEAM and Aer Lingus workers?  What will be the electoral procedure?  There are 1,100 workers. Will the result require 51 per cent of their votes or will their votes be subdivided?</P>
      <P>When this matter was last raised, I asked if it would be possible for FLS to put forward a business development plan to the unions so assurances could be given about pay, conditions and job security for each division.  Has any progress been made on that?  I understand a cumulative offer of £54 million has been put to the workers. Does that exceed the FLS offer and, if so, how will it be financed?  Will Aer Lingus contribute money, in addition to the FLS moneys, to make up the settlement to each employee?</P>

      <P>The electorate will be the workers of TEAM.  The Deputy asked what percentage of the vote would be required.  The concurrence of the workers means the concurrence of a substantial number.  The letters of offer were sent to the employees two days ago so I do not know what the response will be.  However, it will not be a collective arrangement where 51 per cent of the vote wins against 49 per cent.  Each worker has a contract of employment so it is up to each worker to decide how he will proceed with the process.  A substantial majority would be required.  Obviously it will not be unanimous but we must cross that bridge when we come to it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if FLS would bring a development plan for each section of the business to TEAM Aer Lingus and outline how it would move the plan forward with guarantees of employment and so forth.  The chairman visited me about one month ago and I informed him that I sought a plan such as the one envisaged by the Deputy.  The chairman said he would come back to me about it.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say when and by whom the decision was taken to contemplate the end of the 51 per cent Government shareholding? The decision has not yet been implemented but it is accepted in principle.  I am anxious to pursue the alternative proposals as I do not have the same faith as others in this buy out.  Is the Minister aware of the fear of a situation similar to what happened at Seagate since 90 per cent of its business is foreign business?  Is she familiar with the proposal for a three way arrangement which proposes to include an original equipment manufacturer &mdash; an OEM &mdash; in the two way shareholding that currently exists?  Is the Minister aware Aer Lingus has said that unless 100 per cent of the company is involved there will not be a deal? Given that the Aer Lingus expanded fleet will cost £65.5 million and that that revenue should be kept as locally as possible, with a three-way arrangement, does the Minister agree there is a considerable question over the wisdom of the buy-out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The only idea conveyed to me relates to the purchase by FLS.  Deputy Stagg suggested employee purchase of the company <i>vis-à-vis</i> FLS purchase.  That proposal has not been put to me although I have read about it in the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> I have no knowledge of a three-way option as referred to by Deputy Sargent.  On who put forward this idea, the chairman of Aer Lingus asked to meet me in autumn of last year.  He said consideration would be given to the sale of TEAM and it was thought there were several potential buyers.  Some who were interested in the beginning backed out.</P>
    <P>I agreed on several matters, but a conclusion was not reached.  It has been reported that it is up to the board to make a deal if it has the concurrence of the workers, but I have come to no conclusion on the matter.  Last autumn the chairman hoped to move forward in seeking a buyer for TEAM.  It is now April and no conclusion has been reached.  The workers have been written to and they have a fortnight from the day before yesterday to reply to Gerard Durkan in the Law Library.  We will then see where to go from there. I wish to be clear on what I consider is a very important matter.  A deal has not been done and no arrangement was made.  There will not be a decision until I am aware of what the board thinks.  I will put my interpretation on that and it will then go to Government.  Nobody from the employees or any other grouping has signalled to me their intentions to purchase and I would be glad to hear them.</P>

      <P>Are we putting the cart before the horse?  I would have expected that the Minister, as the member of Government responsible for this matter, would first issue a statement of policy on what she wants to achieve with the aircraft maintenance business, which she currently owns, and her criteria in selecting a partner and that an audit of the suitability of FLS would be carried out.  Is it unfair to expect the workers to make a decision by 21 April when they do not know the Minister's mind?  They only have the view of Aer Lingus management on the suitability of FLS.  The shareholder has not expressed a view or carried out an audit of FLS.  I take the Minister's point she has come to no conclusion on the matter, but surely her conclusion and her policy thrust is crucial to the decision of workers rather than the Minister waiting for the workers' decision before coming to a conclusion.  Even in the UK under the Tory Government before any privatisation was undertaken a White Paper was published on the policy implications and directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>TEAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aer Lingus.  It is not a separate semi-State company.  The Deputy referred to a policy paper on aircraft maintenance and an audit of FLS suitability.  My Department prepared a very good document on FLS operations, from its beginning in the last century up to now.  I have studied that and note that profits for last year were £17.5 million, which it forecast the previous year.  A professional account was undertaken and I am satisfied with what that account of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The Deputy referred to Tory Government privatisation, but I would prefer not to go into that matter because they made a mess of their approach to utilities.  On whether the workers should know my mind, this is very much overlaid by the way the TEAM issue proceeded from 1990.  In 1991 each worker received a letter stating that he had a contract of employment for as long as he wanted.  Each person was named in the letter and the letters were personally addressed. That is a completely different matter from any other arrangement into which one might enter.  It was in that context that the negotiations took place and letters were issued since last November. I received nothing in writing from Aer Lingus.  I have monthly meetings with the chairman. Because the workers received a personal letter about a contract of employment I must consult each worker now.</P>

      <P>This Government is implementing a dynamic and progressive alternative energy policy, as evidenced by the four major initiatives pursued to date in this area.  There are two competitions currently under way in relation to the development of alternative energy sources. The AER III competition conducted by an independent agency, ETSU, aims to secure an additional 100 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from renewable energy sources, wind, hydro, waste, biomass and wave.  The closing date for receipt of commercial bids for the competition was 13 February 1998.  I expect to be in a position to announce the results before Easter.</P>
      <P>The AER IV competition, which I launched on 22 September 1997, aims to secure an additional 25 megawatts of newly installed electricity generating capacity from high efficiency combined heat and power systems.  Furthermore, it will seek to secure up to ten megawatts of electricity generating capacity from existing similar systems.  The AER IV competition closed for technical bids on Friday, 23 January 1998.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the guaranteed electricity market access for Irish renewable energy projects successful in securing THERMIE grants has been continued for the 1998 round.  It has also been broadened to include combined heat and power projects.  For successful biomass projects, a special enhanced tariff structure has been negotiated.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 1998, makes provision for tax reliefs for investment in renewable energy projects using windpower, hydropower, biomass and solar technologies.  This pilot tax relief initiative is further evidence of the strong commitment of Government to promote alternative energy projects.</P>

We will vigorously follow up and pursue all measures to promote renewables and will interact with our colleagues in the North on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring to comply with all aspects of the EU position and are in the throes of preparing a Green Paper which will be published before the end of the year &mdash; I hope it will be published during energy awareness week in September.

Will the Minister confirm that the pilot wave energy project under the third round of AER will proceed and that this country's competitive advantage will be fought for and maintained?  As an island nation, our potential for wave energy is unsurpassed.  Will the third round of the alternative energy requirement be oversubscribed and will the energy requirement be extended beyond the 100 megawatt limit?  Will he take account of the interest, which <Col N="934" /> may mean he will surpass his wildest dreams in the area of renewable energy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that we are determined to drive this policy.  We are aware of our God given advantages as an island nation.  I agree with the Deputy's comments on wave energy, which is a pet project of mine, and we will progress this vigorously.  Perhaps the Deputy could help with the difficulties we face at planning level, which are extraordinary.  Although we are endeavouring to drive this policy, there seems to be an aversion at planning level to proceeding with wind energy projects in particular, which will be the main source of these renewables.  The difficulty is paradoxical in that decent environmentally conscious people are objecting to these project as they do not see the environmental advantages.</P>
      <P>If we do not properly educate these people we will not get very far with this policy.  I have asked for consideration to be given to a PR drive to promote the idea and correct the misconceptions, particularly as regards noise pollution which is almost zero.  Deputy Stagg will confirm this as, like me, he has visited wind farms.  I would welcome assistance from Deputies in dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>The biomass programme includes urban waste. Is there anything in the upcoming competitions which will allow the waste generated in Dublin and other cities to be converted to energy, thereby drastically reducing the problem in regard to landfill sites?  The Minister has a proposal along these lines in the pipeline.  Is there anything in the programme which will allow for the massive amounts of chicken waste, particularly in Border regions, to be converted to energy?</P>

      <P>On the latter question, this is an agricultural rather than an energy problem.  It remains to be seen whether the two can be inter-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the waste to energy question, the European Commission has finalised its examination of the socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the waste to energy project.  The Commission cannot agree to European Regional Development Fund support for the project as the predictable revenue <Col N="935" /> stream and the high degree of certainty about the capital cost of the project would effectively render the European Regional Development Fund grant deadweight money and construction of the station at this juncture would be at variance with the indicative time horizon for the thermal conversion of waste outlined in the draft waste management strategy for the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme Monitoring Committee considered the matter at its meeting on 30 March.  It was the committee's view, subject to a reserved judgment by the Department of Finance and the European Commission, that the 9.3 million ecu earmarked as aid for the project should be retained within the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme and, if agreed by the CSF monitoring committee, in principle the aid should be allocated between the rural networks and broadband technology measures of the operational programme.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given due consideration to the so-called waste to energy option?

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself as to the level of investment by Telecom Éireann into the communications network; the discussions, if any, she has had on this matter with the board of Telecom Éireann; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I met the board of Telecom Éireann last week to hear its views on recent reports which had expressed concern at the level of investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure.  The board informed me that the company's plans for the next five years involve a significant level of investment in the core telecommunications network as well as in broadband infrastructure.  Telecom Éireann plans a capital investment of £350 million for the financial year l998-99.</P>
      <P>As far as the Border regions are concerned, the INTERREG programme agreed by the European Commission in February 1995 aims to assist internal border areas of the European Union in overcoming the special development problems arising from their relative isolation within national economics and within the Union as a whole.</P>
      <P>In January 1996, approval was granted to Telecom Éireann for EU assistance for a number of telecommunications projects under the INTERREG programme.  These projects involve investments totalling £11.6 million in fibre optic cabling and the upgrading of exchanges to advanced ISDN technologies in the Border counties of Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.  A total of £5.8 million of this investment is being provided by the EU.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of £4.4 million has been spent under the INTERREG programme and in this year it is planned to spend a further £5 million on the further roll-out of fibre optic cabling and the upgrade of additional exchanges in the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the programme, comprising £2.2 million in expenditure, will take place in 1999.  Apart from this EU-funded investment, Telecom Éireann will spend, as part of its ongoing capital investment programme, an <Col N="937" /> additional £2.6 million on the development of telecommunications infrastructure in the Border regions in 1997-98 and 1998-99.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Telecom Éireann is no longer the only provider of telecommunications infrastructure in this country. Since the liberalisation of infrastructure on 1 July 1997 there are other operators in the market who are also investing in the country's communications network.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her detailed reply.  Will she agree that in view of the most recent NESC report of December 1997 on population distribution and economic development, which clearly demonstrates that some Border counties, particularly County Cavan, have not benefited to any substantial degree from recent economic progress, it is essential to put in place the most up to date telecommunications network to ensure we have a chance of obtaining some welcome inward investment?  I am sure the Minister will agree that the Border counties need particular economic development.  Will she insist that her own Department and the appropriate State agencies adopt such a policy and implement investment decisions accordingly to ensure we have an infrastructure that will help to attract much needed new jobs and maintain existing employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in a broad sense with the Deputy.  The report to which he referred highlighted the position in County Cavan.  As I stated in the reply, a great deal of INTERREG funding has been allocated to the areas but the Deputy is correct in what he said.  Deputy Yates raised the question earlier of the need for much more investment in the whole telecommunications infrastructure.  There is concern about this because one company, if not two, was quoted as saying that one of the reasons it did not come to Ireland was the lack of sophistication in our telecommunications sector.  There is a need for investment in infrastructure and the lowering of charges.  I share the Deputy's wish that there should be an influx of investment in County Cavan and I hope the INTERREG programmes will help in that regard.  We are preparing our programme for the tranche of funds for 1999 onwards and I will seek to ensure that the Border counties are adequately catered for in the proposals we will put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first opportunity we have had in the House to discuss the issue of Telecom Éireann since the recent agreement, I congratulate the Minister on achieving a result in getting an ESOP partner and the agreement of all parties concerned to a Telecom flotation.  I join her in recommending that to the members of the unions who will vote on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into that matter in detail because it was dealt with effectively in an earlier question, but in regard to the intended sale of <Col N="938" /> Cablelink, is it the Minister's intention that that money will be invested in the areas of Telecom discussed earlier or will the Government take the money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be proposing that Telecom retain the rewards of the sale.  As the three reports to which we have referred emphasised the need for investment in areas of Telecom, I would hope the company would go forward along those lines.  My proposal to Government will embrace the proposal that Telecom retain the finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this question. Will the Minister tell the House if there are any proposals to treat the island of Ireland as a single communications zone and thus reduce the need for multi-numbered telephone numbers when ringing Northern Ireland?  This is of particular relevance to many people living in the Border region who have to make an international call to talk to someone who may live down the road.  That seems ridiculous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when the level of investment by Telecom over recent years is analysed, countries like Austria and Switzerland invest three times <i>per capita</i> what Ireland invests?  Telecom invests only 20 per cent of its revenues whereas the EU average is 30 per cent. Will Telecom meet its commitment that all mainline telephone users will be linked to a digital exchange in 1999?  The company set this objective some time ago but it will require substantial investment.  Will that be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom did set that objective. I am aware of the disparity in the percentage investment figures.  I was very open and straight-forward with the people I met in Telecom last week on the basis of the three reports the Deputy cited on an earlier question.  There does not seem to be a sufficiently strong impetus in the board to push forward in this regard.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for his kind remarks about the ESOP arrangement.  The board of Telecom may not fully go along with my wishes but when the votes are cast and the matter is fully concluded, and following the sale of Cablelink, I hope that arrangement will give the company freedom to examine the issues which require their attention and which we have discussed this afternoon. There is a realisation on the part of the board that all the reports contain similar recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At 6.30 a.m. members of the Garda Síochána stopped a car driven by one man which was in a queue of cars waiting to board the car ferry at Dún Laoghaire.  On searching the car the gardaí discovered a quantity of what they believed to be home-made explosives.  This was confirmed by Army explosives experts who made the device safe.  A second car was also searched. Five people, three men and two women, are currently in Garda custody arising from this incident.</P>
      <P>In so far as there are implications for security arising from this morning's events, I acknowledge the efforts of the security forces in countering these terrorist activities and pay tribute in particular to the Garda Síochána on the success of this most recent operation at Dún Laoghaire which resulted in the recovery of a significant quantity of home-made explosives.  These important interventions and recent finds at Howth, Dundalk, Redhills and Hackballscross have, without doubt, prevented serious loss of life and damage to property.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to provide all the resources necessary to support the Garda Síochána against those who assist, prepare and carry out these attacks.  The Government will also continue to ensure that Anglo-Irish and wider international security co-operation is maintained and, where possible, enhanced in the interests of all communities threatened by terrorist activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that, at this early stage in the investigation, I have not received other than preliminary reports from the Garda Commissioner, and any assessment of this morning's events must, of necessity, await completion of the Garda investigation and subsequent evaluation. I do not intend to comment on any speculative <Col N="941" /> suggestions which might be made.  I do not, however, consider that it would be unsafe for me to speculate that those concerned either had the intention of doing damage to the current efforts to resolve the Northern conflict or, at the very least, that they were reckless as to whether their outrageous attempt, if it had been successful, might have had that result.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree with me that those concerned should be given the clear message that progress towards the resolution of the Northern conflict through the democratic process will not be halted by terrorism.  I am sure Deputies would also agree that, given the very advanced stage of the current discussions, it would be extremely unwise for anybody in this House to speculate further at this time.</P>
    <P>In preparing my reply to these questions, I have consulted with the Garda Commissioner and he has advised me that &ldquo;investigations are ongoing and further comments concerning this morning's events would be imprudent.&rdquo; I hope that Deputies will respect that position in putting supplementary questions to me.

Would the Minister agree that this morning's attempt to transport a bomb in a less than safe condition on one of our ferries introduces a completely new set of risks for people on this island and for people travelling between this island and the neighbouring island?  Has he considered what additional security measures may be necessary to ensure that nobody manages to put a bomb on a plane or bring a bomb on board a ship travelling to or from this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are security implications in relation to the incidents in question, <Col N="942" /> not least that security measures must continue to be taken throughout the island to counter the threat of the use of paramilitary violence.  It is clear that the potential destruction, had these explosives not been discovered, highlights once again the horror of violence pursued for political ends and the need for the Government and other parties to work earnestly and urgently to achieve a lasting political solution.</P>
      <P>It shows the need for the Government and other parties to work earnestly and urgently to achieve a lasting political solution. Garda vigilance thwarted this threat in the same way that other recent threats were foiled.  The discovery of the device is a testament to Garda vigilance.  In relation to additional measures that might be taken, security measures at ferry ports are reviewed periodically by local divisional officers in conjunction with the security branch at Garda headquarters to ensure their effectiveness.  I assure Deputies that measures required are implemented on review.</P>

      <P>We are all familiar with the security measures at airports and the degree of scrutiny given to baggage for airplanes.  Is the Minister satisfied that the same degree of scrutiny applies at ferry ports or are additional security measures necessary to ensure a bomb is not brought on to a ship?  The ship in question this morning would have had busloads of children on it.  The ease with which one could drive a bomb on board a ferry seems considerably greater than one's chances of getting a bomb on to a plane. Will the Minister address the need for additional security measures for ferry transport?  The danger averted this morning has highlighted this matter.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe this car was brought across the Border?  If so, is there a need to enhance Border security?  Are there any issues with regard to Garda overtime which might disrupt Garda vigilance during this crucial period of the peace process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that as we draw <Col N="945" /> closer to the decision day for the Luas EU funding, there is understandable public disquiet, particularly in the areas which hoped to be served by Luas, with regard to the future of the project. This disquiet has been fuelled by conflicting media reports on the outcome of the consultants' study.  I do not know where these reports are coming from, the spin they are seeking to put on the story or whose agenda they are pursuing, but it is time for the Minster to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>In her media response to my remarks last Monday she stated the consultants' report had not yet been written and that she had no idea what it would say.  While I accept the consultants' report may not yet be written, I do not accept they have not reached a conclusion.  I find it difficult to believe the Minister is not privy to the conclusions they have reached.  If I were Minister, and on two consecutive Sundays two different newspapers gave details of the outcome of a report I commissioned &mdash; on which at least £100 million of EU funding depended and for which the deadline was only weeks away &mdash; I would have lifted the telephone and demanded a briefing from the consultants.  The public finds it difficult to believe the Minister has not inquired as to the veracity of the reports.  If she has received the report it is time to share the information with Dubliners.</P>
    <P>I realise I am rapidly becoming an irritant to the Minister and a bore on the topic of public transport for Dublin.  I also believe she is genuinely bewildered at the strength of public feeling on the issue of Dublin traffic congestion, but if she lived and worked here she would have some appreciation of the frustration and pessimism of most Dubliners.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the only person who can solve the problem by investing in public transport.  Her dismissive attitude towards those who raise concerns about the problem has only deepened public despair and undermined public confidence in the ability of the political system to grasp the nettle on this issue.  The Minister gives the impression that there is no urgency in dealing with the Dublin traffic problem.  She appears to have adopted an indifferent attitude towards it.</P>
    <P>There is virtual unanimity that the solution is to invest in public transport.  The public finds it difficult to understand why the Minister does not accept this.  Every time the matter is raised in the House she recites the plan of the Dublin Transportation Office which has constantly admitted that its plan is too little and too late.  Even if Luas started to run today, it would be too late to solve the transport problems in Dublin due to the growth in employment and so on.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to answer a number of questions.  Is the original project, as designed, being recommended by the consultants and can we proceed with it immediately?  If not, and either a full or partial underground system is being recommended, has the Minister or her Department made interim plans to allow the two lines run as far as the city while the underground <Col N="946" /> system is being designed?  If she does not have any such plans, how does she propose to utilise the Luas money?  Can we have a guarantee the money earmarked for Luas will be spent on public transport in Dublin and that priority will be given to the areas which would have been served by the Luas project?  These are legitimate questions which all Dubliners are asking.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me an opportunity to clarify the position on Luas.  There has been a great deal of media speculation about the consultants' recommendations. It is interesting that at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning another Deputy Mitchell &mdash; a Dublin Deputy from her party &mdash; spoke strongly in favour of not putting Luas on the street.  Therefore, there is not unanimity on this matter.</P>
      <P>We engaged consultants and the terms of reference were placed in the Library.  I stated on numerous occasions that the consultants will report by the end of April.  I categorically state, as I did in a low key manner on Monday morning, that I have not received a draft, interim or final report and I have not spoken to the consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what happens.  One engages consultants and waits for them to furnish their report.  That is the way business is done. Why should I ring them constantly?  I gave them a timeframe and they have informed my Department they will adhere to it.  My Department has not received a report and I made that clear on the radio last Monday.  I have no arrangement to meet Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.  That was never on the cards.  I gave a comment to a reporter for a Sunday paper in which I clearly stated the agenda as laid down would be adhered to when we receive the report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell might like to believe she poses as an irritant, but I do not regard her as one.  She is a fine Deputy.  I do not regard any Deputy as an irritant.  Neither do I regard her as a bore.  As a full time public representative, I have lived and worked in Dublin five days a week since 1981.  I gave up my teaching job when I became a Senator and, whether in Opposition or in Government, I come to Dublin on a Monday morning and go home on a Friday night.  For the past 17 years I have lived in various apartments and flats around Dublin.  I also went to school for six years and to university for four years in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I will not be labelled as someone from the backwoods who does not know what is going on, because I do.  I live in Dublin from Monday to Friday, which is unfortunately far more time than I spend in my nice home town of Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will receive the consultants' report at the end of the month and this was the delivery deadline agreed between myself, the Department and W.S. Atkins.  I asked the Department to check if they <Col N="947" /> would meet their deadline and it appears they will.  They had to review all the proposals.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly made it clear that the Government is committed to the construction of a light rail system for Dublin.  However, the Government also believes that it could not take a decision to proceed with a project of such importance as the light rail system in the absence of a fully independent analysis of concerns expressed by a range of commentators.  I cannot understand how Ministers of various political parties did not allow for an objective analysis and study to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I agreed last October with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies how the matter will be addressed. However, I have not yet received the consultants' report.  Media reports on their recommendations are nothing more than speculation.  When I receive it, I will study it, bring it to Cabinet, make it public and then decisions will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: The phenomenon whereby 20 to 50 per cent of new housing units coming on to the market are being purchased not by people wishing to live in them but by people planning to rent them at exorbitant rents has been recently highlighted.  A variant of that speculation in the housing market is that speculators have been turning their attention to local authority estates.  Typical of how this works is that so-called investors, usually from leafy suburbs, purchase houses for sale in local authority areas.  They then rent them at exorbitant rents to people who cannot afford to buy their own homes and who are sometimes also on the local authority housing waiting list.</P>
      <P>More often than not, the exorbitant rents charged by those from outside who have purchased these homes are being heavily subsidised in the case of Dublin by the Eastern Health Board.  This amounts to insidious speculation in the housing market.  The result is to push the price of homes in these estates way beyond the reach of young adult members of families happily settled in these estates who wish to purchase homes and live beside their parents or siblings. These young adults find themselves priced out of contention and out of any hope of purchasing a home in their local community or at all.</P>
      <P>It adds insult to injury that taxpayers' money is funding this aspect of speculation.  I understand that last year the health boards paid a massive £80 million in rent subsidies.  Rented homes are obviously needed by those who have been left in the lurch by successive Governments who have not given local authorities the funds to build enough local authority housing.  The fact that these taxpayer subsidies in such huge amounts go to swell the profits of the property speculators, the bankers and the building societies is nothing short of a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Sheepmoor, a small local authority housing <Col N="948" /> estate in Mulhuddart, I know of three houses on the one road which have been bought in the past few years by one family from a leafy and salubrious suburb.  These houses are rented and, to my knowledge, the Eastern Health Board is subsidising the rent.</P>
    <P>Speculators who purchase homes for investment in local authority areas and who live outside those areas, generally in comfortable circumstances, are parasites.  They benefit from misery and, in turn, cause more misery by pushing the possibility of a home and a shelter beyond the reach of those who desperately need it.  Successive Governments have allowed this situation to persist and have allowed speculators to run riot. First, the failure to have an emergency programme of house building in response to the suffering on the housing list is creating a situation where rents are going through the roof.  Second, the <i>carte blanche</i> given to landowners and speculators to charge any price for building on land rezoned for housing is an outrage.  Third, the total refusal and failure of successive Governments to halt the obscene profiteering in the new housing market is allowing this kind of speculation to thrive.</P>
    <P>I demand, as a representative of working class people, some of whom are unemployed, others who are PAYE workers, that the Government take action to halt the speculation and profiteering, that this most human need for shelter and for a reasonably comfortable home is taken in hand and that the speculation and abuse is rooted out so that all people can afford to live in the comfort they deserve.  That is hardly too much to ask.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter on the Adjournment. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is unaware of evidence of a specific problem relating to purchase of houses in local authority estates by investors. If a tenant purchaser of a local authority house wishes to sell their house within a period of 20 years from the date of purchase or before they have acquired full ownership, they must get the consent of the local authority.  An authority may refuse to give its consent to the resale of a dwelling if the intended purchaser is not a person in need of housing or the intended sale would leave the seller, or any person residing with the seller, without adequate housing.  This effectively precludes the sale of houses by tenant purchasers to investors.  However, subsequent resales by owneroccupiers who buy houses from tenant purchasers cannot be restricted in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SWA rent supplementation scheme is governed by the social welfare Acts and is administered <Col N="949" /> by the regional health boards, subject to overall direction, regulation and funding of the scheme by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Concern has been expressed in relation to escalating costs of rent supplementation in recent years.  For example, it has been suggested that needs currently being catered for under the SWA scheme could be met by expansion of the local authority housing programme. This argument does not stand up to scrutiny.  The provision of additional local authority housing is unlikely to provide a cost effective, economic or appropriate means of addressing the predominantly short-term housing needs currently catered for by the SWA rent supplementation system.  An estimate of £96 million is being allocated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1998 to provide supplement rents.  Even if all this amount was switched into building local authority housing it would provide in the order of 1,200-1,400 additional dwellings nationally, less if account is taken of the concentration of demand in the Dublin area.  This would make negligible impact on meeting the needs of the 35,000 or so households who depend on rent supplementation from the health boards.  It must also be recognised that SWA rent supplementation is a lower cost option than local authority housing for meeting the housing needs of single people, who account for the majority of rent supplement recipients.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises in connection with the SWA rent supplementation scheme is the question of standards of accommodation.  A condition of entitlement to rent supplements is that the health board is satisfied that the residence is suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  The question of registration of these dwellings and enforcement of standards by local authorities also arises.  The Minister is concerned at the low level of registrations nationally and local authorities have been requested to actively enforce the registration regulations to ensure compliance with the statutory requirements.  The range of enforcement measures available would include: regular advertising of the registration requirements, carrying out inspections or other investigative procedures to identify unregistered houses, issuing individual reminders to landlords, issuing notices to landlords specifying a registration deadline and initiating prosecutions against known non-compliant landlords.</P>
    <P>Increased co-ordination between housing authorities and the health boards is desirable in relation to SWA supplementation and the Minister would regard this as an important feature which could help with the type of issue raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987 Paul O'Donoghue was one of a group of young children receiving physiotherapy and occupational therapy at Cork spastic clinic.  In November 1987 he was diagnosed as suffering <Col N="950" /> from severe mental handicap.  He was offered a conductive education service for two hours per week instead of the pre-school facilities provided for children who, though physically handicapped, are not mentally disabled.  From that time his mother felt Paul was discriminated against in terms of various educational facilities. This led to the judgment which is the subject of this debate.  The Constitution states in Article 42.4 that the State shall provide for free primary education.  Following on this, in his High Court judgment in the Paul O'Donoghue case in 1993 Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon stated:</P>
      <P>It appears to me that it gives rise to a constitutional obligation on the part of the State to provide for free primary education for this group of children in as full and as positive a manner as it has done for all other children in the community.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the phrase &ldquo;this group of children&rdquo; refers to children with disabilities similar to those of Paul O'Donghue.  Mr. Justice O Hanlon further stated:</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that it is not sufficient for the respondents [the State] to grant as a matter of grace and concession educational benefits which the applicant [Paul O'Donoghue] is entitled to claim as of right.  The demands of justice must first of all be satisfied. That which is already due in justice is not to be offered as a gift of charity.</P>
      <P>I am informed that when in Opposition as spokesperson on education, the Minister, Deputy Martin, criticised his predecessor for creating a two-tier system of education by spending £42 million on free third-level education for the capable while at the same time pleading scarce resources when faced with spending a few million pounds in educating the less capable.</P>
      <P>On 26 March I tabled a question to the Minister for Education and Science seeking the proposals, if any, he has to discharge in full the State's obligation arising from the O'Donoghue-High Court judgment.  The final paragraph of the Minister's reply reads:</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the necessary educational provision is being made available to the child in question and is available to other children with similar disabilities.</P>
      <P>However &mdash; and this is where clarity is required &mdash; my information is that only 462 of the approximate 3,000 severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children are in school.  I am informed the number does not include other disabled children, especially autistic children, not in school.  This discrepancy is disturbing.  The reaction of senior members of the association for the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped to this parliamentary question ranges from disbelief to outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when in Opposition, milked this issue, in what appears to be the most opportunist <Col N="951" /> and reckless way.  The baton has long since passed to the Minister, the buck stops with him.  Is he guilty of cynical hypocrisy or will he deliver in full on the position he assumed in his previous incarnation?  Is the Minister categorically stating the necessary educational provision is being provided for all children with severe or profound mental handicap.  I eagerly await the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter.  Apart from obligations relating to costs, which have been discharged, the judge made an order declaring that:</P>
      <P>. the Respondents, in failing to provide for free primary education for the Applicant and in discriminating against him as compared with other children, have deprived him of constitutional rights arising under Article 42 of the Constitution, with particular reference to Article 42.3.2º and Article 42.4 thereof .</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy the necessary educational provision is being made available to Paul O'Donoghue and to other children with similar disabilities.  At the time of the High Court judgment in 1993, there were 19 special classes for children with a severe or profound mental handicap catering for up to 216 children.  Since the judgment, my Department has established more than 60 additional special classes to cater for the special educational needs of up to 486 children with a severe or profound mental handicap. The Department of Education and Science is happy to respond to any request from a board of management to establish further such classes where needed.</P>
      <P>At the time of the judgment, the pupil-teacher ratio for these classes was generally 12:1.  Since the judgment, the Department has reduced the pupil-teacher ratio from 12:1 to a current pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  This pupil-teacher ratio is now at the level recommended in the report of the special education review committee.  The Department gives priority to these special classes in the allocation, when available, of child care assistant posts.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has substantially increased the level of funding for these special classes.  At the time of the judgment, my Department paid an annual grant of £92.70 to the school board of management for each child in a special class catering for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.  The current grant for each child in £426 per year.  This represents an increase of almost 460 per cent in five years.</P>
      <P>The Department has sanctioned special incareer training courses for teachers of these special classes to ensure that they can provide an appropriate education for the pupils in their classes.  Each pupil has an individual education programme drawn up to meet their specific needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with a severe or profound mental <Col N="952" /> handicap have such special needs that considerable co-operation is needed between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to ensure that pupils in these special classes have access to a range of educational and paramedical services such as speech therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  An interdepartmental committee has been established comprising officials from both Departments which can, as part of its remit, review the current services being made available to these special classes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the State has discharged its obligations on foot of the judgment in question and that children with a severe or profound mental handicap have access to an appropriate education.</P>

      <P>This is an issue in which you, Acting Chairman, may have an interest given the boundary changes announced last week.  St. Michael's CBS, Inchicore, is my former school.  I am ashamed to say that it is the only school in the Dublin Central constituency which still has outside toilets.  It is a matter of shame that any school should still use outside toilets at the end of the millennium.  I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the House that funds are being provided immediately to ensure that a modern inside toilet block will be built and in use by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>We have talked recently about millennium projects and rightly so.  One such project should be the provision of basic facilities in homes and schools as we enter the next century.  There are 1,400 houses which still have outside toilets. There are also schools with outside toilets and this is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>This school is in the middle of Inchicore where I was born and reared.  Inchicore is an old area with great traditions.  However, to use the French phrase, Inchicore is a <i>quartier en crise</i>&mdash; it is in crisis.  Major steps have been taken to improve it. The closing of St. Michael's estate is imminent.  I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will accept my proposal for the designation of the village for urban renewal status when he comes to make those decisions in August.  I also hope the recent protocol from the Minister for Health and Children will reduce the number of drug addicts receiving methadone at the local chemist shop which is the capital of methadone dispensing in this country.  Other things should happen such as the provision of indoor toilets at this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an historic school.  It is on a site provided at the request of W.T. Cosgrave.  The land was owned by his distinguished father-in-law, the late Alderman &ldquo;The Bird&rdquo; Flanagan.  W.T. Cosgrave is buried in Goldenbridge cemetery next door to the school.  What is now the school gymnasium is where the defeated men of 1916 were held overnight pending their dispatch to Kilmaiham <Col N="953" /> and other jails.  People such as Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera, Arthur Griffith, W.T. Cosgrave and many more were held in the gymnasium. It has a long tradition but it is shocking that the school still has outside toilets 40 years after I left.  I hope the Minister will bring this scandal to an immediate end.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's current position regarding an application from St. Michael's Christian Brothers national school, Inchicore, Dublin 8, for grant assistance to relocate the outside toilets within the existing classroom blocks.  I am aware that the school is staffed by a principal, two assistant teachers, two remedial teachers, one concessionary remedial teacher and a shared home school liaison teacher. The school had an enrolment of 96 pupils on 30 September 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school is housed in three separate buildings on the same campus.  The existing toilet block for the entire school is housed in a standalone building on the campus.  In 1997, the school manager applied to my Department for grant assistance <Col N="954" /> towards the cost of relocating the toilets within the existing classroom blocks.  The school's preferred option is to link the two existing classroom blocks and provide a main entrance to the school from this building.  A new toilet area would then be developed in this area to serve the entire school.</P>
    <P>This proposal was costed by my Department's professional advisers and was found to be prohibitive from a cost viewpoint.  The current position is that my Department's architectural service is examining the case with a view to developing the most appropriate and cost effective solution.</P>
    <P>As soon as this examination is complete a report on the various options will be furnished to my Department's building unit for consideration. I expect that this report will be finalised in the near future.  As soon as this report is received the school manager will be advised of the outcome without delay.  I thank the Deputy again for the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in this case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 April 1998. <Col N="955" /></P>

      <P>The form and content of such licences is prescribed in the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989. Regulation 13(2) of those regulations prescribes that the licensor may revoke or suspend a licence where the number of premises served by a licensee is less than the minimum number prescribed in the licence.  It is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to ensure compliance with this requirement.</P>

      <P>CIE completed a technical and policy review of suburban rail investment requirements for the greater Dublin area last year.  The company subsequently engaged independent consultants to carry out an economic and financial evaluation of the proposed investment programme contained in the review document and their interim report has recently been received.  The consultants' final report is expected to be received within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>From work done to date it is clear that there are three principal components to the upgrading of the Dublin-Maynooth rail service.  The first and most important is an upgrading of signalling in the city centre area to facilitate increased levels of service.  This is a prerequisite for the other investment.  The other elements are an upgrading of trackwork, including the doubling of the line from Clonsilla to Maynooth, and the provision of additional rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary discussions have already taken place with the European Commission and more substantive discussions will be undertaken following <Col N="956" /> receipt and consideration of the consultants' final report.</P>

      <P>Magnox power stations are the oldest of the commercial nuclear installations in the UK &mdash; some such as those at Sellafield were built as far back as 1956.  The Sellafield reactors have exceeded their design life by 20 years.</P>
      <P>I have raised our concerns about Magnox reactors in the course of a meeting with the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, and in December last I received the UK Government's response from Mr. John Battle, MP, Minister of State who has responsibility for nuclear safety policy.  Mr. Battle contended that Magnox reactors could continue to operate safely because of their low power density and operating conditions.  He affirmed that the UK regulator would not allow these stations to operate if he was not satisfied with these general design features.</P>
      <P>Since the receipt of the Minister's comments there have been discussions between the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the UK regulator about the UK regulator's thinking and approach.  These contacts will continue but I have recently written to the Minister Mr. Battle seeking once again the early closure and decommissioning of Magnox reactors.</P>

      <P>My Department is, at present, examining the report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director presented me with a copy of the report during a recent courtesy call to my office. The report examines the issue of the future delivery <Col N="957" /> of television services in Ireland generally.  The report, therefore, is primarily about the introduction of digital services and only deals with deflector systems in this context.  It will provide input into the director's decision-making on the question of licensing deflector systems.</P>
    <P>In this regard, and as the Deputy is well aware, the legal power to issue licences to operators of television re-broadcasting systems, including deflectors, was transferred to the director with effect from 30 June 1997.  In the event that the director determines that new licences should be issued, it will be necessary for her to make regulations prescribing the form and content of such licences in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Such regulations will then be subject to my consent.</P>
    <P>I will be in a position to give consideration to the policy implications involved only if and when specific proposals are received from the director in the matter.  I also plan to have discussions with the director in due course in relation to her views both on the licensing of deflector services and on the introduction of digital television services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 44 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad once again to update the House on my recent contributions to the mounting campaign to arrest the demise of duty free.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that I succeeded in having duty free sales placed on the agenda of the Transport Council of 17 March last.  At this meeting, I presented to the Council a statement in the matter, expressed my concern on the socio-economic impact of the proposed ending of duty free sales and called for an EU wide study to be carried out by the Commission into the effects on employment, access transport costs, etc. of the proposed abolition.</P>
      <P>In advance of this Council meeting and in order to gain maximum effect, I wrote to my fellow Transport Ministers in the European Union.  I also met directly with the French, German and British Ministers and held phone conversations with several others.  As a result of these contacts and, in particular, arising from visits to my counterparts in the UK, Germany and France, I secured in advance indications of support from key players in the Council.</P>
      <P>As the House is doubtless aware Ireland received a strong level of support around the Council table.  Eight countries, namely, UK, Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, supported my initiative.  Five countries did not speak and Netherlands and Denmark stated that it was a matter for ECOFIN.</P>
      <P>In its conclusions on the proceedings of the Council, the Presidency noted the strong support by a majority of delegations for my proposal to have the Commission carry out an impact study. The Presidency summed up by saying that he would bring this support to the attention of the President of ECOFIN.  Indeed, this outcome has been noted in the minutes of the Transport Council.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 31 March my colleague, the Minister for Finance, published the study his Department had commissioned on the impact on Ireland of the abolition of duty free sales.  Minister McCreevy has stated that he will use the results of the study to press the case for retaining duty free and tax free sales in ECOFIN, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers.  The House is well aware that reversal of the present decision requires a proposal from the Commission and unanimous agreement of the ECOFIN Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister Deputy McCreevy has pointed out, we need to be supported by other member states to make progress in ECOFIN and with this <Col N="959" /> in mind the Government will continue to do all it can to keep this issue on the political agenda. However, it is not possible at present to give a definitive response as to whether or not our campaign for the deferral of the duty-free decision will be successful.</P>
    <P>I remain optimistic, nevertheless, that if pressure can be brought to bear on the European Commission, especially by the larger member states, such as Germany and France, to conduct an EU-wide study, the results will speak for themselves and the Commission will be persuaded to make a proposal.  I believe the clearly expressed wish of the recent Transport Council will prove fruitful and should help to increase the pressure on the Commission considerably.</P>

      <P>It has been clear since 1993 that an investment programme of some £800 million would be needed in the railway network over a 30 year period.  By 1999, some £275 million of this programme will have been completed.  However, further investment will be needed in all the main elements of the rail system &mdash; track renewal, signalling and rolling stock.</P>
      <P>CIE was asked to prepare investment plans for the mainline rail network in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period. CIE has recently submitted a discussion paper to my Department on mainline rail investment needs.  However the paper identifies a need for further evaluation work, particularly an economic and financial appraisal of the proposed investment. CIE is in the process of appointing an independent consultant to complete this work.</P>

      <P>The CCR is designed to prepare ESB for a future based on competition.  It is critical for the competitiveness and future success of the company that the savings agreed in the CCR are delivered in full.  I can inform the Deputy that implementation of the CCR is proceeding very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The agreement provided for a reduction in staff numbers of 2,000 and £58 million in net annual cost savings.  Around 1,400 staff have already left the ESB under the voluntary severance scheme and the remaining exits will take place in 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>Other agreed savings including those on materials and those arising from changes in work practices are also on target.</P>
    <P>As a result the full target net savings of £58 million per annum by the year 2000 will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The spirit of partnership underlying the CCR and the new culture which implementation is creating at every level in ESB will ensure a continuing emphasis on cost efficiency in the years ahead.  This will help ESB and its workforce to meet the challenges and opportunities provided by competition on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>The CCR demonstrates the ability of ESB to develop and carry out a major process of change and I have every confidence, as a result of this unique exercise in partnership, that ESB will remain a major player in the electricity sector in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>There has been no further meeting of the ministerial committee since its first meeting on 5 February.  However, that first meeting facilitated a wide ranging discussion on nuclear safety and radiological protection issues which will form part of my Department's and the RPII's work programme.  Work is continuing on relevant matters which will be considered by the committee from time to time. My Department is completing its work on the review of the National Emergency Plan and making preparations for the transposition of a major new EU basic safety standards directive to protect the public and workers from the effects of ionising radiation in respect of medical, research and industrial applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another significant aspect of the committee's work is the Government's campaign against Sellafield.  Among the issues of relevance are the County Louth residents' court case about which I have replied separately today and bilateral contacts which I, my Department and the RPII are engaged in with the UK about safety matters at Sellafield and the UK nuclear industry generally. Recently my Department have made submissions to the UK authorities in relation to public consultations on modified discharge authorisations at Sellafield and the proposed MOX Plant at Sellafield. <Col N="961" /> In addition, I have recently written to the relevant UK Minister about the storage of high level waste at Sellafield and safety of magnox reactors.</P>
    <P>I envisage a further meeting of the committee shortly to update Ministers on progress made since the last meeting and to focus attention on areas where other Departments have an input.  I emphasise that the main programme of action would come within my Department's and the RPII's responsibility.  However, it is important to consult my ministerial colleagues in relevant areas so that there is an integrated approach to policies spanning a number of Departments.  I would highlight the efforts to be made under the OSPAR Convention to halt technetium discharges into the Irish Sea and contacts with other Departments on the basic safety standards directive as examples of where this contribution is vital.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has now finalised its examination of the socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the waste to energy project.  The Commission cannot agree to European Regional Development Fund support for this project because in its view the predictable revenue stream and the high degree of certainty about the capital cost of the project would effectively render the European Regional Development Fund grant deadweight money; and the construction of the station at this juncture would be at variance with the indicative time horizon for thermal conversion of waste outlined in the draft waste management strategy for the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme Monitoring Committee considered the matter at its meeting of 30 March 1998.  It was the committee's view, subject to a reserved judgment by the Department of Finance and the European Commission, that the 9.3MECU aid earmarked for the project be retained within the economic infrastructure operational programme and, if agreed by the CSF monitoring committee, that in principle the aid be allocated between the rural networks and broadband technology measures of the operational programme.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the restructuring proposals for the superannuation schemes which apply to CIE salaried staff. These include the merging of the existing pension <Col N="963" /> schemes and funds together with benefit improvements in so far as the new fund permits.</P>
      <P>Amending schemes were drafted to give effect to the necessary restructuring of the salaried staff superannuation schemes.  However, during the course of the examination of the draft amending schemes by the Attorney General's office, legal technicalities were identified which necessitated considerable detailed attention.</P>
      <P>This process was almost complete when further legal complications arose.  These issues are currently being addressed by my Department and CIE as a matter of urgency.  I am not, therefore, in a position to approve the scheme until these legal issues have been resolved.  However I can confirm that, irrespective of the length of time it takes to complete the arrangements for approval, the agreed terms of the new scheme include a provision for an effective date of 1 January 1994.</P>

      <P>I have not seen any evidence that the ownership structure of the State airports acts in a way which inhibits the operation of those airports or limits access to air services.  Increased numbers of flights and of destinations served have recently been announced for Cork and Shannon airports, the two airports to which the hotels federation president has referred.  In addition, all three State owned airports experienced record passenger numbers in 1997 and further increased growth is expected in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I announced last week that agreement had been reached with the union coalition in Telecom Éireann on an employee share ownership scheme.  The agreement follows from the commitments entered into last summer by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides that employees will pay £190 million for 9.9 per cent of the company with an additional 5 per cent acquired in return for company transformation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main terms of the deal are as follows: the employees are to receive a shareholding of 14.9 per cent in the company which will be transferred to an employee trust as follows: a total of 9.9 per cent of the State's shares in the company will be <Col N="965" /> transferred to an employee trust from the outset, on payment to the Exchequer of the agreed price; an additional 5 per cent will be transferred to the employees on a phased basis as plans for the transformation are achieved and verified, the objective of these plans is to transform Telecom Éireann into a world class telecommunications business through cost reduction, more flexible working arrangements and improved delivery of service to customers; and an initial public offering, IPO, for the sale to the public market of a further tranche of the State's shares in the company is to take place in 1999, and details are to be decided by the Government at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The price of the 9.9 per cent will be £190 million payable to the Exchequer by an employee share ownership trust.  The trust will source its funds as follows: First, the company has agreed to make a contribution to the employee trust of £100 million which the company is satisfied represents fair value for revised work arrangements and pension arrangements.  As part of its contribution to the deal, the employees will now introduce new agreed working arrangements and pay 5.3 per cent of salary as an employee contribution to the pension fund.  At present, the company makes the full contribution.  A total of £60 million will be raised by the trust by way of commercial loan.  The trust will make a final payment of £30 million on a basis which will be without recourse to the company or the State and will take place one year after the 1999 IPO date.  If the market value of the company is less than £2 billion at the time of the IPO but more than £1.6 billion, the final payment will be reduced on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis. No final payment will arise if the market value is £1.6 billion or less.  Final payment will be secured against an appropriate percentage of the shares held in the trust.  The trust will receive dividends and voting rights on 9.9 per cent from the outset and on the 5 per cent as ownership is transferred.</P>
    <P>The next step is to transform last week's deal into a formal legal agreement between my Department, the Strategic Partners KPN/Telia, the company and the union coalition representing the employees.</P>
    <P>This is an important and innovative deal, fully in line with the spirit of Partnership 2000 and in accordance with the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium.  It gives the employees in Telecom Éireann an important stake in the future of their company.  Telecom Éireann is now well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities presented by the expansion of the telecommunications sector in the evolving information society.</P>

      <P>Apart from the powers conferred on the Director of Telecommunications Regulation by the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1996 which established that office, additional powers have been conferred on the director by the following instruments: (a) the European Communities (Telecommunications Services Monitoring) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 284 of 1997); (b) the European Communities (Telecommunications Infrastructure) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 338 of 1997); (c) the European Communities (Application of Open Network Provision to Voice Telephony) Regulations, 1997, (S.  I. No. 445 of 1997); (d) the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 15 of 1998); (e) the European Communities (Electromagnetic Compatibility) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 22 of 1998).</P>
      <P>The total responsibilities of the director are set out in the instruments mentioned.  In summary the powers relate to: the issue and enforcement of licences for all telecommunications services; the management and control of the radio frequency spectrum including the licensing of users of the spectrum; the management and control of the national telecommunications numbering plan; ensuring that commercial agreements in relation to interconnection of networks conform to EU regulatory principles; ensuring that services provided by Telecom Éireann as the dominant national operator are provided in accordance with EU Regulatory requirements; and the enforcement of standards in relation to certain apparatus.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this summary is not exhaustive.  Additional powers are to be given to the director over the next 18 months through the transposition of further EU Directives concerned with the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 the director is currently obliged to submit to me both the accounts of her office and a report concerning the performance of her functions in the previous year.  I am, in turn under the Act obliged to lay these documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The question of the accountability of the Director to the Oireachtas is one which I will consider in the context of legislation dealing with the powers of the director which I hope to introduce later in the year.</P>

      <P>In December last I received from Telecom Éireann its proposals on the future development of Cablelink and I am considering them carefully. I am not in a position to make the proposals publicly available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Government's overall policy in relation to the information society, it is vital that the correct decision is made in terms of Cablelink's future development, particularly given <Col N="968" /> the enhanced capability of cable networks to deliver interactive multimedia services, voice telephony and digital TV.  In that regard the consultative process is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Since receiving the proposals, I have met the management of the company, the unions representing employees in the Company &mdash; SIPTU and the ATGWU &mdash; and the Communications Workers Union representing the employees in Telecom Éireann.  There have also been consultations with the strategic partners.</P>
    <P>I met the board of Telecom Éireann on 26 March and the future of Cablelink was one of the issues raised.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> These regulations are the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, S.I. No. 15 of 1998, which came into force on 22 January of this year, and they implement EU Directive 97/33/EC.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide that arrangements for co-location or facility sharing shall normally be a matter for commercial and technical agreement. In cases where the operators cannot come to an agreement, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is empowered to intervene to resolve disputes.  The director may impose facility or property sharing arrangements only after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views.</P>
    <P>I fully support the principle of sharing of masts and other telecommunications infrastructure in order to promote economic efficiency and minimise the adverse environmental impact of telecommunications infrastructure.

      <P>I am aware of the incident to which the Deputy refers.  The UK authorities have advised my Department that the incident involved the derailment of the front wheels of the locomotive which was transporting two empty nuclear fuel flasks to the Heysham nuclear power plant in Lancashire.  The train was, I understand travelling at five miles per hour when it left the track.  The UK Authorities' investigations are continuing and it is not yet clear whether the incident occurred because of a fault in the tracks or the train.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that the incident is of no radiological significance to Ireland.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about this incident which highlights the dangers associated with the transport of nuclear fuel.</P>
      <P>The question of the safe transport of radioactive materials has been raised with the UK authorities on a number of occasions.  For many years now, radioactive materials have been transported in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's regulations for the safe transport of radioactive materials.  These regulations provide strict standards of protection to facilitate the safe transport of radioactive materials.</P>
      <P>I understand the UK is reviewing its current regulatory requirements and procedures in regard to the transport of radioactive materials and that the 1996 IAEA regulations in this field are being used by the UK as a basis for further updating of its procedures for land, air and sea transport of radioactive materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 48 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The Deputy is aware of the thorough investigation carried out by my Department into this tragic accident, the report of which was published in 1970 and a copy of which is in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The final conclusion of the report is as follows:</P>
    <P>There is not enough evidence available on which to reach a conclusion of reasonable probability as to the initial cause of this accident.</P>
    <P>I offer my sympathy to the families of the victims of this tragedy and to the colleagues of the Aer Lingus crew.</P>
    <P>It is always unsatisfactory when an accident investigation fails to establish clearly the cause of the accident.  I appreciate that it is particularly difficult for the families and friends of the victims of such an accident to come to terms with their loss.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Deputy's questions.  If by new information the Deputy is referring to recent television and newspaper articles regarding the possible involvement of another aircraft, missile or airborne object, and to activities of the Royal Navy in the crash area, then I would specifically refer to the section of the report where such a possibility is discussed.</P>
    <P>The report states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that while Viscount EI-AOM was in normal cruising flight at 17,000' and within 6 minutes of reaching Strumble Head, another aircraft, which could have been a manned or unmanned aeroplane or a missile, passed in close proximity, possibly even colliding with the tail of the Viscount, causing an upset which led to a manoeuvre which was either a spin or a spiral dive from which the Viscount was recovered in a disabled condition, to fly thereafter for approximately 10 minutes over the sea before control was finally lost.</P>
    <P>The other aircraft could have been the one seen over Fethard-on-sea, and might have fallen in the sea near the Saltee Islands.</P>
    <P>In considering this very speculative theory, attention must be given to a number of matters which discount it's credibility.</P>
    <P>These include the fact that no aircraft, civil or military, manned or unmanned, were reported, or known to have been in the area at the relevant times, nor was any aircraft other than EI-AOM reported missing on that day.</P>
    <P>The missile and target ranges on the Welsh coast are closed on Sundays, and were known to be inoperative on Sunday, 24 March 1968.</P>
    <P>No aircraft carriers were operating in the area.</P>
    <P>The altitude of 17,000' at which EI-AOM was cruising is considered unlikely to be used by military aircraft.</P>
    <P>The manoeuvre of recovering a loaded Viscount aeroplane from a spin or a spiral dive would require a very remarkable feat of airmanship on the part of the pilots.</P>
    <P>In fact there is only one known case in which <Col N="974" /> this was effectively accomplished during a test flight by expert test pilots.  Even in that case, the airframe suffered some distortion of the tail unit.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to account for the lack of communications during the presumed 10 minutes before the final catastrophe.  The aircraft may have been too low for V.H.F. communication with ground stations, but if there were transmissions they should have been picked up by other aircraft.</P>
    <P>On account of these matters, the hypothesis must remain in the realm of speculation and on present evidence cannot be given a higher status than a remote possibility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to this report and to the detailed appendices to the report which have, since the publication of the report, been available for inspection by interested parties.  These appendices, numbering in excess of 150 pages, give details of: (1) the search and recovery operation; (2) transcripts of tape recordings of radio exchanges between the Viscount St. Phelim and the Air Traffic Control service of Cork, Shannon and London; (3) meteorological data; (4) investigation of the recovered wreckage: (a) Airframe; (b) Engines and propellers; (5) investigation of Auto Pilot; (6) summary of witness statements, maps of witnesses locations; (7) photographs.</P>
    <P>These records, which have been available since 1970 in my Department, illustrate the great lengths to which the officials of my Department, at the time, went to establish the cause of this accident.</P>
    <P>It is important to make clear that the purpose of aircraft accident investigation, which like all international aviation activity is governed by the International Civil Aviation Convention (ICAO), specifically Annex 13 to the convention, is to try to establish the cause of the accident, in order to prevent a similar accident or a reoccurrence.  It is not the purpose of the investigation to establish blame or liability.</P>
    <P>A large passenger aircraft accident is an international event by it's very nature and consequently several states may have rights and obligations, i.e. the state of manufacture, the state of registry.</P>
    <P>In the case of the St. Phelim, Ireland as the state of operator and as the state of registry was responsible under International Convention for holding an investigation and publishing a report. This we have done.</P>
    <P>In carrying out this obligation, help in the search phase of the operation was given by the UK in accordance with the international convention.</P>
    <P>At the time, our own Naval Service had only three Corvettes.  Only one was at sea at the time of the accident, off Donegal, and as soon as possible she assumed the role of co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>The salvage operation was Ireland's responsibility under international convention.  This operation was conducted with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy which were considered, at the <Col N="975" /> time, to present the best, if not the only, possibility of locating and recovering the wreckage.</P>
    <P>This, regrettably, took a long time and unfortunately the fuselage of the aircraft, which may have been of considerable help in establishing the cause of this accident, was not recovered intact.</P>
    <P>The wreckage lay in a depression on the sea bed in 42 fathoms with the surrounding area at 39 fathoms, or over 250 feet down.  Recovery of the wreckage was a difficult and dangerous task.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall the publicity surrounding the recent fatal accident to TWA 800 off the coast of Long Island.</P>
    <P>Despite all the sophistication of present day technology and at an estimated expenditure of 125 million dollars, the investigation has not established the cause of the accident in which over 200 people lost their lives.</P>
    <P>My Department has consistently done all that was possible to establish the cause of the loss of the Viscount and more importantly the loss of 61 lives so tragically 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>My Department has always examined any new information as it became available.  It did so on several occasions since 1970, including the examination of parts of target aircraft dredged up in 1974 and 1978.</P>
    <P>However there was nothing found which could positively be linked to the loss of the St. Phelim.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House again to the passage in the report which I quoted earlier, which states:</P>
    <P>These include the fact that no aircraft, civil or military, manned or unmanned, were reported, or known to have been in the area at the relevant times, nor was any aircraft other than EI-AOM reported missing on that day.</P>
    <P>The missile and target ranges on the Welsh coast are closed on Sundays, and were known to be inoperative on Sunday 24 March 1968.</P>
    <P>No aircraft carriers were operating in the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These statements were reaffirmed by UK Officials to my Department by letter in November 1974.</P>
    <P>I am willing to republish the report of the investigation and its appendices and to make copies of these documents available in the Oireachtas Library.  However, in the absence of significant new evidence, I am not persuaded to reopen the investigation.</P>
    <P>Should such new evidence become available, I, like all my predecessors, would be more than willing to have such evidence examined.</P>

Such regulations would then be subject to my consent.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what link the Deputy is drawing between policy on re-broadcasting and any possible sale of Telecom Éireann's shares in Cablelink. The obligations of Cablelink in relation to the provision of services would not be affected by a change of ownership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann receives an annual subvention from the Exchequer for the provision of socially necessary services which cannot be provided on a fully commercial basis.  The allocation of the subvention to the individual companies within the CIE group is currently a matter for the board of CIE.  The total subvention for 1998 is £107.205 million and I am advised that of this amount some £7 million has been allocated to Bus Átha Cliath by the CIE board.</P>
      <P>In so far as fares are concerned, the three CIE operating companies require the approval of the Government before they can implement increases in standard fare rates.  In the case of Bus Átha Cliath, the approved standard rates are those for single fares.  However, the CIE companies have discretion to offer discount or promotional fares, including multiple journey tickets, in accordance with their own commercial judgment, provided that the approved maximum standard rates are not exceeded.  I have no approval function in relation to such discretionary or discount fares.  I also have no approval function in relation to the types of discretionary or discount tickets which the companies may choose to introduce or withdraw. I do not propose to change the existing approval arrangements so as to extend the Government's role in relation to CIE's fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to place the financial relationship between the Government and CIE on a more <Col N="978" /> structured and transparent basis.  To this end discussions are ongoing between my Department and CIE, and its operating subsidiaries, with a view to the introduction of public service contracts, initially to cover a three year period, between the two parties.  It is envisaged that, among other things, these contracts will identify three specific elements in respect of each of the CIE entities: the services (including those which are socially necessary but are non-commercial) to be provided; the specific payments to be made for those services and the standard fares to be charged.</P>
    <P>In 1996 CIE submitted proposals for a fares increase of the order of 10 per cent.  Consideration of those proposals was deferred so that they could be examined within the context of the formulation of the public service contracts.  That remains the position.  As the discussions on the contracts have yet to be concluded it is not possible to comment on any possible fares increases which may be approved under the new system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The rail services between Kilcock and Dublin are benefiting from an EU assisted investment package in the Dublin-Sligo line.  This includes a major upgrading of track and signalling currently being undertaken with assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  In addition, an allocation of Structural Fund assistance under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 includes provision for a new station at Kilcock.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these projects is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann. However, Iarnród Éireann has advised me that track renewal work will be taking place at Kilcock over the coming fortnight and that the station will be completed by the summer and on this basis the EU funding is secure.</P>
      <P>In relation to current proposals for enhancement of services, the specific requirements of this line are being evaluated as part of a study of Dublin's suburban rail development needs in respect of which a consultants' final report is expected shortly.

      <P>
        <i>Measure 1 &mdash; Access to Finance Scheme.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This is by far the largest of the measures and provides a fixed interest subsidy on business loans of seven years duration involving amounts ranging from £20,000 to £500,000.  A fund of £208 million was established which was fully subscribed by 31 December 1996.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Measure 2 &mdash; Access to Public Markets.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This measure is designed to assist small firms gain a greater share of the public procurement market.  A team of six public procurement specialists has been appointed to provide an advisory service to small firms on procurement opportunities within the public sector and to provide information on issues such as tendering procedures. The team also works closely with public sector buyers to identify opportunities for small business.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Measure 3 &mdash; Adaptation and Development of Services Firms.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This measure is designed to provide assistance to improve the strategic and business organisation of new and existing services firms and to facilitate their access to new markets.  Priority is given to firms in newly emerging growth sectors. This measure is operated by Forbairt.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Measure 4 &mdash; Small Business Best Practice Manuals.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This measure aims to address the knowledge gap identified as a problem for small enterprise through the development of best practice manuals and identification of innovative methods of information dissemination.  A &ldquo;How To Guide&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;Starting Your Own Business&rdquo; was launched in January 1998.  This is available priced £10 from County Enterprise Boards, Area Partnerships, Business Innovation Centres and the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Measure 5 &mdash; Pilot Training Projects.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This measure involves the fostering of 11 innovative pilot training projects concerned with the improvement of know-how and the business environment.  All available funding under this measure was fully committed in 1996.</P>
      <P>
        <i>County Enterprise Boards.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 35 City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were established in 1993 to support the development of micro-enterprise throughout the <Col N="983" /> country through a range of activities, including direct and indirect enterprise supports for such enterprises.</P>
    <P>The boards are cofinanced by the Exchequer and by the European Union under Sub-Programme 1 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99. Sub-Programme 1 is divided into four measures, which cover the preparation of enterprise plans and the development of an enterprise culture, Measure 1; advice, information, counselling and mentoring, Measure 2; financial assistance, Measure 3; and management development assistance, Measure 4.</P>
    <P>Measures 1, 2 and 4 are forms of indirect financial assistance, commonly referred to as &ldquo;soft supports&rdquo;. Measure 3 constitutes direct financial assistance in the form of grants and equity support.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Forbairt</i>
    </P>
    <P>The development needs of small businesses are essentially common across sectors and, as a result, Forbairt's information, education and technology based activities and services are available to all companies irrespective of size or sector.  Forbairt also administers and manages, on behalf of the office of science and technology, a wide range of EU programmes including the 4th Framework, measure 1, the Industry Research and Development Initiative, and Retex.  Forbairt works closely with the third level sector to enhance its linkages with Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In its direct funding activities, Forbairt has national responsibility for stimulating the development of Irish manufacturing and internationally traded companies together with all &mdash; Irish and overseas &mdash; natural resources based companies.  Within this overall framework, Forbairt places a particular emphasis on promoting the development of the small business sector. Forbairt's direct funding programmes are primarily directed at start-up small businesses with potential to employ more than ten people, together with high potential start ups &mdash; companies which have less than ten employees, but which have the potential to grow rapidly &mdash; and Forbairt's client base of existing small companies. Funding for smaller businesses, essentially micro businesses, comes within the ambit of the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>In stimulating small industry development Forbairt works to provide direct financial support to help start-up companies and established small businesses to grow employment, expand capacity and grow profitable sales: assistance typically takes the form of employment grants.  In addition to grants, Forbairt can provide preference share capital and/or invest in ordinary share capital.</P>
    <P>It also helps companies to enhance their capability and become more competitive by providing an individually tailored range of information and consultancy products, of an advisory, technical and business nature; supports include grants to <Col N="984" /> help pay for the cost of business strategy reviews, feasibility studies, product development programmes, introduction of world class manufacturing as well as the recruitment of key technical and managerial staff.</P>
    <P>The following programmes are provided: the management development programme provides funding to companies that want to recruit new management skills into a company or to employ a consultant to undertake a strategic review; the mentor programme provides support to companies which require advice on specific challenges facing the company.  Experienced business professionals are placed in small companies to help the enterprise to address those issues; the national linkage programme run by Forbairt, works with small businesses to maximise the level of raw materials, components and services sourced in Ireland by multinational companies; the world class manufacturing scheme provides support to companies which employ consultants to assist them to introduce more competitive manufacturing techniques.  The programme also supports training for company staff; the Forbairt information services and enterprise link &mdash; an initiative of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is managed by Forbairt &mdash; provide library and phone line services for entrepreneurs and businesses aiming to expand; the learning centre at Forbairt provides technical and business educational seminars, conferences and workshops for Irish small businesses; Forbairt's graduate placement programme offers a practical way of introducing new skills into small companies.  Graduates placed in small businesses contribute to the development of language, information and other technology skills in those businesses; under the techman/tecstart programme, which is operated in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology, Forbairt assists small companies to become more focused on technology issues and to introduce new skills in the company by funding the cost of employing technical graduates and managers; as part of its ongoing support to Irish business, Forbairt's management consultancy services provide technology audits and technology assessments to companies; the seed and venture capital scheme managed by Forbairt and funded by the European Union has, in the past year, supported high potential start ups and expansions with one venture capital fund specifically supporting small enterprises; the graduate enterprise programme is a one year rapid incubation programme designed to provide a comprehensive business development and financial support to third level graduates who wish to start their own small businesses support.  This is operated in conjunction with Waterford Institute of Technology; the Office of Science and Technology, in co-operation with Forbairt, provides funding and support for the research and development effort in Irish small business; the National Research Support Fund Board oversees joint industry-third level collaborative projects under the basic, strategic and applied research <Col N="985" /> grant schemes, as well as research and industry scholarship programmes; Forbairt's Campus Companies Programme was set up to assist academics to commercialise R&amp;D projects; Forbairt actively promotes participation by Irish companies in the various calls for proposals in EU research contracts; the research, technology and innovation initiative, which is operated in co-operation with the Office of Science and Technology, encourages companies of all sizes to become more involved in research and development projects.  This programme is funded by the European Union; the R&amp;D management scheme, which is operated in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology, is designed to provide a range of support to companies that require support to implement their research and development programmes.  This programme is funded by the European Union.</P>

      <i>An Bord Tráchtála</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme for New and Emerging Exporters</i>
    </P>
    <P>This programme addresses the individual needs of potential and new exporters through specialist workshops covering all aspects of preparing for successful exporting.  This is complemented by intensive hands-on assistance from experienced Irish Trade Board staff.  They can call on all appropriate resources of the organisation to help companies achieve its targets through an agreed action plan.</P>
    <P>A strong market position in Ireland gives a better foundation for profitable exporting.  ABT's Ireland Market Team, based in Dublin, helps companies to grow sales to multinationals and international retailers in Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>ABT's design and product development programme helps companies to create and launch new market-adapted products for export markets.</P>
    <P>Limited non-repayable grants may be offered, subject to budget availability, to companies with total exports of less than £1 million who are planning new initiatives with substantial growth potential.  Eligible companies may apply each year, for a maximum of three years, for support towards 50 per cent of the eligible expenditure detailed in an agreed marketing plan.  Innovation and realistic growth potential are the key criteria for winning this financial support.</P>
    <P>
      <i>FÁS Training Support Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The training support scheme is the principal FÁS programme aimed at assisting business and those in employment.  The TSS enables Irish small and medium enterprises to increase competitiveness, quality and productivity in national and international markets.  The scheme specifically seeks to improve the skills of employees at all levels &mdash; from the shop floor to management &mdash; by providing financial assistance to enable firms to train and develop their staff.</P>
    <P>The scheme is open to firms in the following sectors of industry: clothing, footwear and textiles; chemical and allied products; construction <Col N="986" />&mdash; Manufacturing; engineering; food, drink and tobacco; motor; printing and paper; physical distribution; internationally traded services; wholesale and retail distribution; non-manufacturing construction firms who trade internationally; and contract cleaning.</P>
    <P>Evidence must be produced that the training need has been clearly identified and that this development is linked to a business plan or strategy, using the firm development and training plan framework.</P>
    <P>The relevant level of training grants for small business is as follows: 80 per cent of programme costs are available to firms employing 20 staff or less; and 65 per cent of programme costs are available to firms employing 21 to 50 staff.</P>
    <P>

      <i>Jobstart</i>
    </P>
    <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme aimed at enticing employers to fill new or existing vacancies with a long-term unemployed person.  The overall thrust of the scheme is to increase the proportion of jobs in the economy filled by those unemployed for three years or more against a background where such persons are often by-passed in job selection.  Under the scheme, a subsidy of £80 per week for one year, is paid to employers in respect of each eligible employee.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Workplace</i>
    </P>
    <P>The aim of workplace is to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment by bringing together, employers and persons who are unemployed for six months or more, for a five week trial period with no strings attached on either side.  During this period an unemployed person retains their previous social welfare entitlement and status and receives a top up allowance towards the cost of travel and meals.</P>

      <P>The Government has received with concern disturbing reports from Irian Jaya/West Papua that the Indonesian authorities are interfering with the activities of church groups and are hampering the distribution of humanitarian relief supplies in the area.  The matter has been raised with partners in the European Union and an approach will be made to the Indonesian authorities if considered appropriate in the light of the consultations and inquiries that we are now making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> Since April of last year, the humanitarian situation in drought-affected Irian Jaya has been a source of concern.  The entire island of New Guinea, which is shared by Irian Jaya/West Papua and by Papua New Guinea, has been suffering from resultant widespread malnutrition.  The United Nations estimate that approximately 10 per cent of the population has been affected.</P>
    <P>The Government has attempted to alleviate the situation by contributing to humanitarian assistance operations, in particular to efforts being made by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNDHA, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC.  A total of £150,000 has been provided by the Government over the past four months.  The greater part of these funds, £125,000 has been specifically earmarked for use in Irian Jaya.</P>

He stated that wreckage material recovered by HMS Penelope was landed at Plymouth, Milford Haven or some other UK port.  He did not specify where or when this material was found.</P>

      <P>On 26 March 1997 an application for the ten-month special beef premium was made on two animals under this herd number.  Payment of £108.20 or 60 per cent of the premium was made on 28 November 1997.  A second instalment of 30 per cent (£27.05 per animal) will issue shortly. The balance of the entitlement has yet to be determined as it depends on the reduction arising from the special beef premium quota cut for 1997. It is expected that this final amount due will be paid before the end of June 1998.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 41 animals including 15 beef cows on the 30 May 1997 under the 1997 cattle headage scheme.  At an inspection on the 23 July 1997, the inspecting officer was not satisfied that three of the beef cows had ever calved.  The person named was requested to provide veterinary evidence to support his claim that the animals were in fact cows.  The evidence provided was not acceptable to the Department and the person named was notified on 31 March 1998 that he is ruled out of the scheme for 1997 and 1998.  The person named was also advised that he may appeal this decision to the headage and premia appeals unit.</P>

      <P>Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997, makes provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas.  The airports in question are Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo and Waterford. The designation order may be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations. It would be necessary at that stage to get the approval of the EU Commission with reference <Col N="999" /> to the State aids aspects of the reliefs available at the proposed regional airport enterprise areas.</P>
      <P>Qualifying trading operations are (a) manufacturing companies which qualify under the Finance Acts for 10 per cent corporation tax and (b) internationally-traded service activities i.e. data processing, software development, technical and consulting, commercial laboratory, healthcare, research and development, media recording, training, publishing and administrative headquarters. Companies must also have been approved for financial assistance by the State industrial development agencies &mdash; Forbairt, IDA Ireland or Údarás na Gaeltachta.  In this year's Finance Act, I introduced an amendment to extend the definition of qualifying trading operations to include freight-forwarding and certain allied services, subject to approval from the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The approval of qualifying companies will be given through a certification process involving, <i>inter alia</i>, Forfás and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance.  The tax reliefs for the enterprise areas are those set out in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995, and include capital allowances of up to 100 per cent on expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies as well as a double rent allowance for ten years for the lessees of such premises.  The tax reliefs for the new enterprise areas relating to the regional airports will apply from the date specified in the designation order until 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>As I am not in receipt of any proposal for the carrying on of such qualifying trading operations immediately adjacent to Kerry airport, no area has been designated there.  The designation process, as outlined above, can only commence when qualifying projects are proposed for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 96 to 99, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is not the normal practice of my Department to engage solicitors who work in private practice. There are no records of my Department using private solicitors during the period 1990 to date other than one occasion in 1997 when a solicitor was retained at a cost of £600 to provide a half day's training course on the legal aspects of the employee assistance service.  The solicitor in question was Mr. Peter O'Boyle, 7 North Great George's Street.  My Department does, however, regularly avail of the services of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO.</P>
      <P>All cases referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office by Government Departments-Offices are processed by the staff of the CSSO and never by solicitors in private practice.  There is, however a 1985 Government directive which states that all State work should be done by the CSSO and that, where solicitors in private practice are to be engaged, the Chief State Solicitor should be consulted in advance.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, avails of the legal services of the CSSO for litigation and recovery of moneys.  However. private firms of solicitors are used by the Office of Public Works where the commissioners are acting in their capacity as trustees and in certain commercial transactions or where specialist advice is required, e.g. planning advice, advice on industrial relations issues and advice on the Office of Public Works bid for the national conference centre.</P>
      <P>Specialised work relating to the collection of revenue debt is carried out for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners by two firms of solicitors. The volume of cases, the need for Revenue to maintain overall control of the debt and the complexity require a dedicated resource within a solicitor's firm to ensure efficient and cost-effective action.  These factors militate against the use of a large number of solicitors.  The use of external solicitors has proved to be a very effective method of dealing with debt collection work in the District and Circuit Courts.  The Office of the Revenue Solicitor handles most debt collection at High Court level.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners have recently completed a review of the role of external solicitors in the context of changes in the operating procedures in Revenue and have explored means of streamlining the system and further enhancing effectiveness.  Following this review the business will shortly be put out to tender.  It should be noted that the State solicitors are engaged by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for certain prosecutions taken in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I understand from the CSSO that some other Departments have, on occasion, engaged private solicitors for particular items in the past.</P>

      <P>The levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency hospitals experience periods of exceptional demand.  On occasion, it may be necessary to retain patients in the A&amp;E department while they are awaiting admission to the hospital.  Waiting times for beds can vary depending on demand and patients may experience a long waiting time for admission during busy periods.  However, in no instance would this waiting time extend into days.</P>
      <P>All patients attending the A&amp;E department of James Connolly Memorial Hospital are prioritised for examination and treatment in accordance with their medically assessed needs.  It is important to note that patients awaiting admission to the hospital receive appropriate medical treatment at all times.</P>
      <P>In addition, a special allocation of £300,000 to the hospital has enabled the opening of 20 additional in-patient beds since 16 January this year to assist in meeting the demand for admission through the A&amp;E department.</P>

My Department, in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, prepared the <Col N="1003" /> brief for a design team for the development of Phase I at this hospital.  Phase I provides for the development of individual hospital departments including the accident and emergency unit.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of all health services, including psychiatric services, in its catchment area.  Acute in-patient psychiatric services for the north Dublin catchment area are currently provided for in St. Ita's Hospital.  The board's plans for the development of St. Ita's Hospital and for the development of acute psychiatric services in north Dublin includes the provision of a modern acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital to replace acute in-patient facilities being provided at St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
      <P>I am committed to providing the necessary resources to enable this development to proceed and for the completion and commissioning of the acute unit at the earliest possible date.  Pending the provision of the acute unit at Beaumont Hospital, the admission and assessment facilities at St. Ita's Hospital will be upgraded.  I have provided capital funding of £550,000 to the Eastern Health Board for this purpose and this funding has been included in my Department's capital programme.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has also submitted its development plan for the mental handicap services in St Ita's Hospital.

In the meantime, a special maintenance programme has been established for the mental handicap services in the hospital and I have made £250,000 available for this programme in 1998.

Free dental services to other teenage children without medical card eligibility are not available.</P>
      <P>Routine dental treatment is provided by health boards to eligible children by extending the targeted approach which is currently used in the national schools.  Children who have left national school are recalled for screening and provided with appropriate preventive and primary care dental treatment for any defects noted in the course of screening.

      <Quest>his views, in the context of the Naas Hospital development plan, on the extent to which the thirty five beds proposed to be dedicated to patients who will have surgery at Tallaght Hospital will be of benefit in alleviating overcrowding at Naas Hospital; if state-of-the-art surgical facilities are likely to be provided at Naas Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Phase II of the development at Naas General Hospital will result in the provision of additional medical and surgical beds at Naas General Hospital.  When the development is complete, the in-patient bed complement will be 164 beds.  In addition, the hospital will have a day service facility of 25 beds and a day hospital for the elderly with ten places.</P>
      <P>Naas General Hospital provides a general acute medical, surgical and psychiatric service for its catchment area.  Patients who require more specialised treatment are transferred to the appropriate hospital facility and back to Naas Hospital when they have completed their specialised phase of treatment.  The provision of additional beds at the hospital will ensure the availability of complementary facilities to medical and surgical patients from the Naas area who will have completed specialised treatment in Tallaght Hospital and will require a further period of recovery in a hospital setting.  This will also help to relieve the overall pressure on acute hospital bed provision in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Phase II of the development includes a developed geriatric assessment and rehabilitation service and a physical therapy department, incorporating physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  This will provide enhanced rehabilitation services and more effective and efficient discharge planning of patients.  A central operating department is also provided for in the development, comprising three self-contained theatre suites including one clean air theatre. <Col N="1008" /></P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the existing arrangements for child dependant allowances payable with short-term social welfare payments would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing substantial increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Bill, 1998, this policy direction is being continued through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be <Col N="1012" /> introduced.  These measures will take effect from next September.</P>

      <P>The costings requested by the Deputy are not readily available.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, to qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions or 24 in the case of a retirement pension registered since January 1953 when the unified social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later. The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last.  To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured person prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>In 1996 my predecessor published a proposed strategic plan for Doneraile Court and Demesne.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have announced my intention to carry out a review of my predecessor's policy on the use of the Phoenix Park for large-scale public cultural, musical and heritage events, which was published in May 1997, and as part of this process to engage in broad consultation with interested parties.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the report of the steering group on efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Sìochàna, the Government appointed a steering group to develop and implement the overall programme for change recommended in the report. The chairman of the steering group is Mr. Kevin Bonnar former Secretary of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Details of the other members of the steering group were given in the Government press release dated 22 December 1997.</P>
      <P>One of the tasks of the steering group was to oversee the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review of the force. This involved the establishment of an in-depth examination to reach conclusions on the optimum number, structure and deployment of the Garda This involved the establishment of an in-depth examination to reach conclusions on the optimum number, structure and deployment of the Garda and the appropriate mix between gardaì and civilians. A &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; group was established to conduct this examination, the chairman of which is Mr. Declan Brennan, a former Secretary of the Department of Education, who is also a member of the steering group. The other members of the group are a management specialist and representatives of Garda management, the Department of Finance and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A mechanism was identified whereby Garda pay issues could be discussed within this implementation structure. The chairman of the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; review group, Mr. Brennan, also chairs these discussions which take place between the official and staff representatives. Various meetings have taken place within this forum on the <Col N="1016" /> subject of pay and, while it is a matter of public knowledge that the latest meeting has given rise to a level of disagreement between the relevant parties, I am convinced that the right course would be for the parties to resume their discussions. I now urge them to do so.</P>

The equivalent costs in respect of the years 1990-1993 are not readily available and could not be compiled without a disproportionate expenditure of resources by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>Garda escorts are also provided to An Post, and some private security firms.  The total manpower cost of providing all such Garda escorts in each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 was in the order of £3 million, £3.7 million and £4 million.</P>

      <P>Schools are at different stages in the introduction of relationships and sexuality education RSE.  In the case of many schools, the policy development process is beginning.  My Department has provided a number of supports for schools in this work: information seminars have been held for chairpersons of boards of management and for parents, and support documentation, including guidelines for the development of policy and a newsletter, have issued to all schools.  Policy development seminars are due to begin shortly.  As the overall implementation process moves further forward, specific data in relation to the implementation of the programme will be collected.</P>
      <P>The introduction and implementation of RSE is being monitored through the RSE implementation Group, established to provide a forum for ongoing discussion between my Department and the partners in education.  In addition, the implementation of RSE in schools will, like any other area of the curriculum, be monitored through the inspectorate.</P>

      <Quest>the support available to Irish students conducting post graduate studies overseas in view of the obvious benefits; his views on whether there is a need to provide further support in this area; his views on whether it is cheaper to support these students abroad rather than to provide the investment in student places at home; and if he will make a statement on his plans to develop support in this area.</Quest>

      <P>Students pursuing postgraduate courses at approved colleges in Northern Ireland can <Col N="1019" /> apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance under the higher education grants scheme.  The student support schemes were extended, with effect from the 1996-97 academic year, to provide maintenance grants to students following approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state.  However, due to limited resources there is no provision under the current student support schemes for funding for postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.  There are a number of scholarships available to Irish students pursuing postgraduate studies abroad.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing postgraduate places, there were some 11,000 full-time postgraduate students in State funded third-level institutions in the 1995-96 academic year.  I accept that view of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education that a dynamic postgraduate element is critical to the quality of a university to complement and support undergraduate work and research efforts. Whereas it may, under certain circumstances, be cheaper to provide student support for postgraduate students studying abroad, such an approach in itself would not be desirable as an alternative to the development of postgraduate facilities in our own third level institutions.</P>

This application is currently being examined within my Department's planning and building unit in terms of enrolment projections and architectural feasibility.

      <P>Prior to December 1997, no application for grant-aid for building related works had been received from the school for a period of 15 years. Since the devolved grant came into operation in 1997, it is open to schools to spend the grant money on minor improvement works to the buildings.</P>
