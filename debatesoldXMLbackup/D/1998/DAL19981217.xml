      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with these two topics separately.  As regards the first topic, I have received notices from Deputies Noonan and Quinn.  I will call them in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance, namely, that findings of tribunals of inquiry that taxes were evaded may no longer be relied on as evidence by the Revenue Commissioners in the collection of such taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss an issue of national importance, particularly with regard to the outrage among the public, namely, the need to publish under section 134 of the Finance Act, 1998, the decision by the Appeals Commissioners in respect of the Haughey case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the matter to be one contemplated by the Standing Order and, accordingly, to be in order.  As Deputy Noonan's motion was received first, I propose to take it.  I now ask the Deputies who support the request to rise.</P>
      <P>
        <i>More than 12 Deputies rose.</i>

      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific matter of public interest, namely, the bomb and missile attacks launched last night by the United States and the United Kingdom against Iraq and the need for the Irish Government to seek an end to that attack and a peaceful settlement to this feud with Iraq in accordance with the principles of Article 29.2 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance, namely, the launching of a massive bombing attack on Iraq by the United States and Britain, the potential for appalling casualties among innocent Iraqis, particularly when hospitals are desperately short of equipment and medicine due to embargoes, and the urgent need for the State to strongly condemn this attack and to call for an immediate end to it.</P>

I cannot reconcile the order to which we are now agreeing and the decision which you have made with regard to the matter raised by Deputy Noonan and me, how we can fit that item into the timeframe to which we are now agreeing and take all of the business on the programme for today's Order of Business.  I seek an amendment so that the Dáil may rise at a time it may decide following a meeting of the Whips.  We may need extra time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Opposition Deputies and parties do not have the right to propose an amendment to the Order of Business but the Taoiseach does have such a right.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, there will have to be a new order today anyway because you have allowed a request to raise a matter under Standing Order 31, which means that the business between 3.30 p.m. and 4.45 p.m. must be pushed back.  That would still mean that, under any new order, the House would adjourn at that stage.  The Dáil on its rising today at whatever time is agreed &mdash; the Government Whip will put a time on it later &mdash; shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 January 1999.  That is how I see today's business.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of great public concern and Members of the House should not underestimate the extent of public feeling on this matter.  I say that responsibly.  The House cannot agree this morning on an adjournment of the Dáil for over a month in these circumstances.  It may well be that when we hear the explanations this afternoon there will not be any difficulty, but we have not heard any explanations which would convince us of that.</P>

      <P>I seek your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle, in relation to the position which arises with regard to Private Notice Questions before we accept or do not accept this ordering of business.  You have decided in favour of one of two matters which were submitted to you at the start of business.  This means that those of us who wish to raise the matter of UNSCOM and Iraq have only the mechanism of Private Notice Questions in the Chamber.  What is the position now in relation to a Private Notice Question? Will it be facilitated in the normal way at the end of Question Time?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The order is before the House and I have decided on one request under Standing Order 31.  That precludes consideration of any other request under Standing Order 31.  If it might satisfy the Deputy, I will allow a brief question from party leaders on that subject if we get to the Order of Business.  The sooner the Deputy allows the Chair to proceed, the sooner we can take brief questions on that matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I fully appreciate the importance of what you have chosen under Standing Order 31 but under Standing Order 21 there is a facility for Private Notice Questions.  In view of the attack on Iraq which is convulsing the world, I ask that you would make provision today for Private Notice Questions under Standing Order 21.  If necessary, the Dáil can meet tomorrow, Friday.</P>

I am seeking clarification in support of the point made by Deputy Bruton that we cannot agree to the adjournment of the Dáil at some time today without hearing the consequences of the debate for which you have made provision.

      <P>I do not want to find myself in a <Col N="1412" /> situation whereby we agree to No. 7 and cannot raise the issue of the Dáil coming back tomorrow morning, for example, to deal with the consequences of what might be revealed.  I am not agreeing to adjourn at some time today until 27th January.  The Taoiseach can resolve this matter by making time available for a new order which does not commit the House to rise today at whatever time.</P>

A Cheann Comhairle, the order which will come back from the Government Chief Whip will be to make time available to deal with the issue on which you have ruled.  However, the order will not change the arrangements for the House to rise today.  I am sticking to my proposal that, at the end of today's business, the House rises until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 January 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asking patiently in the House about the legislation on the Convention for the Protection of UN Personnel and other Persons Serving Abroad.  Irish officers are serving on the Iraq-Kuwait border.  I have been pressing the Government to introduce the legislation which cannot take effect internationally until 21 countries sign it, so we can press other states to do so.  Will the Taoiseach bring forward this legislation in the new session as a matter of urgency? Perhaps we could start Question Time a half an hour earlier today.  I realise the Ceann Comhairle has already been very generous in his interpretation of Standing Orders so I will not press this matter too far.  It will be hard to explain to people how the House adjourned without discussing Iraq, particularly since Irish officers are serving on the Iraq-Kuwait border.  I ask that the Private Notice Question which I put down last night be allowed and perhaps we can start Question Time a half an hour early to allow for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the unilateral action taken by the US and UK forces against the people of Iraq is unwarranted?  Does he agree the security council should at least have had the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Butler report from UNSCOM on allegations of non-compliance with the inspection force by the Iraqi Government?  Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach intend to raise this matter with our European colleagues to ensure the institutions of international security affairs under the aegis of the United Nations are properly respected?  The actions taken last night and apparently between now and the commencement of Ramadan will kill Iraqi men, women and children and will not, in so far as we can see, have any effect on the lethal capacity of Saddam Hussein to wage aggression on his neighbours.</P>

      <P>No. 42 &mdash; statements on Iraq &mdash; has been on the Order Paper for some time.  Will the Taoiseach, in considering a new date for the adjournment of the House, provide time for statements on this attack on the people of Iraq?  Was the Taoiseach, the Government or the Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed by the United States before or since the attack?  Is Shannon being used as a stopover for refuelling, as was the case during the last Gulf War?  Does the Taoiseach accept that this attack on the people of Iraq is in gross breach of the United Nations charter and that no resolutions currently provide for military action against Iraq?  No opportunity has been given for a debate on the Butler report at the security council.  Does the Taoiseach agree we also need to raise at UN level the manner in which sanctions causing the death of 6,000 children per month are being imposed on Iraq?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept this is a clear breach of international law?  Does he agree this is a cynical attempt by President Clinton to divert attention from his domestic difficulties? Is it not outrageous that innocent people can lose their lives so President Clinton can save his political skin?  Will the Taoiseach dissociate himself, in the same way as the French, Chinese and Russian Governments have done, from this attack and make it clear where he stands on this atrocity?  Does the Taoiseach agree the Iraqi people are suffering, despite what Tony Blair has said?  Does he accept the findings of Deputy Albert Reynolds and Senator Lanigan who have gone out of their way to show that the Iraqi <Col N="1415" /> people are suffering?  Will the Taoiseach tell President Clinton he cannot use Shannon as a base, if it is being used?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Will the Taoiseach condemn, in front of the world, this appalling deployment of destructive military capacity against Iraq?  Will he warn against the slaughter and injury of innocent Iraqi children, women and men, compounding the crimes of the economic embargo against the Iraqi people, as a result of which up to 5,000 children die each month from a lack of medicine?  Will the Taoiseach point out that the result of previous attacks was to allow the merciless dictatorship of Saddam Hussein to continue, rather than weakening him?  Will the Taoiseach condemn the transparent hypocrisy and fathomless opportunism of this attack on the day when impeachment proceedings were to begin against the US president?</P>
      <P>Innocent lives are being sacrificed to save the political hide of the president of the most powerful country on earth.  Will the Taoiseach publicly rebuke the craven support of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, for this bombing?  Will he declare that those who paraded themselves as peacemakers following the atrocity of Omagh cannot do that and reconcile it with being the destroyers of the Iraqi people?  Will he call for an immediate end to this atrocity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The air strikes against Iraq by the United States and Britain took place following the report of the UN inspectors, UNSCOM, stating it would be unable to complete its work on the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction because of obstruction by the Iraqi authorities.  This Government regrets that it was impossible for the UNSCOM team of inspectors to complete its work.  We are disappointed that the use of force was deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>Iraq must comply fully with the decision of the United Nations security council and international law must be respected and upheld.  The security council has met to discuss the issue.  It is important that following the air strikes, the emphasis should be placed on the efforts to resolve the crisis by peaceful means, avoiding the loss of innocent lives.  We would also like to see, regardless of any dispute with the Iraqi Government, the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people being properly addressed.  I join those who have emphasised for many months that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people cannot be ignored in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>The use of force should be kept to a minimum to avoid further suffering by the Iraqi people and the potentially destabilising consequences in the Middle East.  The Government is maintaining close contact with its partners in the EU and is monitoring developments in the UN through our UN delegation in New York.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that many people have a difficulty with the fact that this decision has been taken by the military authorities in two states, without consulting other European states and that there is a lack of information on the legal basis for the attack?  There is also a lack of information on the causes of the attack.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Austrian Presidency of the European Union to convene a meeting where all EU members will be informed of why this attack has been carried out, the implications of it for European relations with the Arab world and Islamic countries and the level of UN approval of the measures being taken?</P>

      <P>In what circumstances was the decision to withdraw UNSCOM taken?  Was it taken with the permission of the Secretary General of the UN?  What diplomatic discussion took place which involved Ireland, its European partners or anybody else?  Does the Taoiseach accept the principle that the UN, in its decision making process, is seriously damaged when two members of the Security Council abrogate the right to interpret UN resolutions, their implementation and the conditions attaching to their implementation? Finally, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs seek meetings with his partners &mdash; it is not clear from the Taoiseach's statement what precise meetings will take place and when &mdash; to discuss the relevant policy aspects?  Will the Taoiseach unequivocally deplore the replacement of diplomacy by military action?  This is a matter of principle.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's reply to the earlier questions was disgraceful.  Without saying so and using weasel words, the Taoiseach is supporting the bombing of Iraq.  This is in blatant breach of Article 29.2 of the Constitution which states &ldquo;Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.&rdquo;.  In his reply the Taoiseach said <Col N="1417" /> that following the air strikes he hopes to have discussions and that the military operation should be kept to a minimum.  Will he explain how this can be reconciled with the obligation on the Government to pursue Article 29 of the Constitution? Was the Government briefed beforehand and has it been briefed since the start of these attacks on Iraq by the US?  The question concerning refuelling at Shannon Airport has not been answered.</P>

Will he explain his understanding of how this is not a breach of international law?  It is a clear breach of international law.  Will he unequivocally condemn this attack or at least disassociate himself from it?  From what I have heard the Opposition is in agreement that this is unacceptable.</P>

I am not aware of any proposals or requests for refuelling at Shannon by US military planes involved in Gulf operations.  The issue concerning the mandate is disputed.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the EU Council meeting in Vienna last weekend with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  The Council, the second time the Heads of State or Government have met during the Austrian Presidency, the first meeting having taken place at Portschach in October, presented a key challenge to the Presidency in terms of progressing the complex issues contained in the Agenda 2000 portfolio.  For a variety of reasons which I will highlight throughout my statement, I believe the meeting was a success and a tribute to the competence of the Austrian Presidency and, in particular, to Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps outline the format of the Council.  It began last Friday morning with a meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Giles Robles, where there was a useful exchange of views on issues such as employment, the further potential of the Single Market <Col N="1423" /> and the key items to be considered by the summit, including Agenda 2000, enlargement, common foreign and security policy, subsidiary and the common statute.  A detailed discussion of economic co-ordination formed the bulk of the first working session which followed, while issues such as Agenda 2000, justice and home affairs, common foreign and security policy, subsidiary and the internal market were examined on Friday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Over dinner on Friday evening, leaders discussed the enlargement process and gave particular attention to the situation in Russia and how the Union should respond.  I know this is a matter which the Minister, Deputy Andrews, will address in greater detail in his concluding statement. On Saturday morning, as is usual, leaders focused on the draft Council conclusions and subsequently met the Heads of the 11 applicant states.</P>
    <P>The Council considered the employment guidelines for 1999 and the possibility that the guidelines might be strengthened to ultimately evolve into a European employment pact within the framework of the Luxembourg process.  The emphasis given to the discussion of employment underlines its status as the top priority for the Union, a situation being sought by Ireland. Accordingly, the issue of job creation underpinned the whole of our discussion on economic matters, the concern being to promote greater economic growth and to maximise its employment intensity.  The call for a greater synergy between the guidelines and the broad economic guidelines also reflects this approach.</P>
    <P>In calling for the 1999 guidelines, the Vienna conclusions asked member states to take into account important areas such as promoting equal opportunities between men and women, using benchmarking and mainstreaming approaches; making lifelong learning a reality and setting targets in this regard; exploiting the potential of the relatively employment intensive services sector, especially in information technology and environmental areas; developing small and medium sized industries; reviewing tax benefit and benefits systems; supporting the re-entry of other workers to the labour force and promoting greater social inclusion.</P>
    <P>In addition to these factors, I add that in the Irish context when forming our next national employment action plan, we must retain a strong focus on supporting the re-entry of the long-term unemployed to the workforce.</P>
    <P>The leaders also discussed the launch of the euro on 1 January next and the related issues of the external representation of the Union to EMU matters and enhanced policy co-ordination.  A practical arrangement has been found in relation to representation at the G7 Finance Ministers and Governors group and at the International Monetary Fund and in relation to the composition of ECOFIN delegations for missions to third countries. That arrangement was based on the report <Col N="1424" /> from ECOFIN on the state of preparation of stage three of EMU which, <i>inter alia</i>, stressed the need for the Union to speak with one voice in this area and that the Commission should be involved appropriately.  I fully supported this approach.</P>
    <P>I also welcomed the ECOFIN report's conclusions and fully share the view that closer community surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies is essential, if the full benefits of the single currency are to be obtained.  Existing institutional arrangements and instruments must be given time to work before any additional measures are considered.</P>
    <P>The somewhat contentious issue of tax co-ordination or co-operation was also discussed. Clearly, there is a strong case for the elimination of harmful tax competition between member states which I fully supported, but, equally, harmful tax competition between the Union and third countries must also be examined.  I made it clear in my intervention that we welcome proposals for a fully comprehensive study of corporation regimes within the Union &mdash; a study which would address not only corporation tax rates but also allowance and incentive arrangements together with the accounting standards and other practices which determine the tax base in individual member states.  Ireland's tax system is fully transparent and will compare favourably in the forthcoming study by the Commission with the regimes in place in other member states, especially as regards the all important effective rates of tax which are applicable in each country.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to report that the conclusions on taxation specifically state that co-operation on tax policy does not mean the pursuit of uniform tax rates and instead is aimed at eliminating distortions in the single market and the development of tax structures which are more employment friendly.  After the Vienna Summit, there is a fuller understanding of what needs to be done in the areas of tax co-operation and, more importantly from an Irish point of view, of the situation which pertains in this country.  This represents a real improvement over the level of debate on this issue in the European media in recent times.</P>
    <P>In other areas of taxation, there was progress on proposals for new directives on the taxation of savings and on interest and royalties and an endorsement also for the framework on energy taxation, taking into account its implications for the environment.  I argue strongly that its implications for competitiveness should also be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>There was real progress on the subject of duty free sales.  Ireland secured a valuable agreement that the Union will examine the 1991 decision on the abolition of tax free sales within the Union. This examination will focus on the employment impact of the abolition and will, EU leaders concluded, consider also &ldquo;a possible limited extension of transitional arrangements&rdquo;.  The Commission and ECOFIN are to examine by March the employment problems which will arise from <Col N="1425" /> abolition and consider proposals for addressing them.  Together with other EU leaders, I intend to pursue the matter directly with President Santer to ensure that work on this item proceeds as rapidly as possible.  We will press for a full five year extension of the transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>In addition to addressing employment, the other major area which was considered by European leaders at Vienna was that of Agenda 2000 &mdash; ensuring that the progress called for by the Cardiff conclusions was made in advance of the German Presidency.  I am happy to report that the Austrian Presidency succeeded in a comprehensive examination of the proposals for the next financing period from 2000 to 2006, identifying both areas of potential agreement and, perhaps more importantly, those areas where further work and compromise is likely to be required.  A key outcome was a strong endorsement of the end of March deadline for the conclusion of negotiations. The deadline should be adhered to to avoid protracted negotiations as in previous rounds and to force all member states to address issues which will ultimately have to be resolved in any event.</P>
    <P>I understand the German Presidency is considering the need for a special summit on Agenda 2000 to be held in Germany in late February to ensure that the end of March summit in Brussels is not overburdened.  The handling of the Agenda 2000 negotiations was a theme which I addressed in Bonn on Tuesday with Chancellor Schro1der. I went through with him in some detail Ireland's position with regard to phasing out Objective One Status for the better off part of the country, its retention along the Border and in the west, and the reasons in terms of our underdevelopment infrastructure we need it for a few more years to remain recipients of the Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>We agreed the Austrian Presidency has laid a sound foundation for the work of the German Presidency and is to be complimented on that. This will allow for the end of March deadline for political agreement to be met and, more importantly, for the final adoption of an agreement in advance of the European Parliament elections in June of next year.</P>
    <P>The need for all member states to adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach was discussed and the Chancellor outlined to me the need, as perceived in Germany, to address the level of Germany's contribution to the Union's budget.  We discussed the progress made to date at a technical level in the consideration of the draft regulations on Structural and Cohesion Funds and the various proposals for reform in the agriculture area. As well as recording our concerns on Structural and Cohesion Funding, I indicated Ireland's rejection of any proposal for co-financing of the Common Agricultural Policy both because it breached the fundamental principles of policy and because of the disproportionately negative effect it would have on countries like Ireland.  I also mentioned the value of the milk and beef sectors to the Irish economy and that, for <Col N="1426" /> instance, current Commission proposals on milk quotas and proposals favouring intensive rather than extensive beef systems, would impact very negatively on Ireland, especially when compared to the position of other member states.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in our expectations, but so must other partners and an equitable outcome is what is required.  We cannot resist all suggested avenues to reform.  All member states, be they net recipients or contributors, will be forced to compromise in the course of negotiations.</P>
    <P>The German Presidency realises fully the challenge presented to it, but I am confident on foot of my discussions with the Chancellor that he is determined to conclude the negotiations during his Presidency.  Having said that, I fully appreciate that until there is agreement on all aspects of Agenda 2000, including the issue of own resources, no single element can be finally signed off.</P>
    <P>In Luxembourg last December probably the most significant decision on enlargement was taken in terms of the admission of the so-called &ldquo;ten plus one&rdquo; applicant countries.  The Commission's reports on the progress that has been made by each of the applicant states was welcomed by leaders at Vienna and reinforced our belief that each country should be dealt with on its own merits.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in our approach to enlargement since meeting the eligibility criteria for joining the Union is a very substantial task for all applicant states, and we must support in practical ways in helping them to meet those criteria. The &ldquo;five plus one&rdquo; countries, the so-called &ldquo;ins&rdquo;&mdash; Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia &mdash; have made substantial progress in their respective accession conferences, while the remaining countries, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria have made good progress in their preparatory process and will move to bilateral rather than multilateral negotiations with the Commission from the beginning of next year.  In the course of our detailed considerations of the enlargement issue, we noted also the reactivation of the Maltese application for membership and welcomed that the Commission would bring forward a report early next year updating its opinion of 1993, which was favourable.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity of the meeting with the leaders of the applicant countries to have a short bi-lateral meeting with the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr. Ivan Kostov, and assured him of Ireland's full co-operation throughout the accession process.  Irish agencies and private sector companies have a small but growing presence in the Bulgarian market, and I expressed the hope that this growth would accelerate in tandem with the transformation of the Bulgarian economy, a process under way since 1990.</P>
    <P>The European Conference which was inaugurated in March of last year provides a useful forum for political consultation with participant countries and a further meeting at Foreign Minister <Col N="1427" /> level will take place next year.  It is a potentially useful forum for the improvement of EU-Turkish relations and I hope it proves so during the course of 1999.  However, it is right that we should review the role and functions of the Conference in Helsinki next December to ensure its effectiveness. On the European Conference, I welcome the extension of an invitation to Switzerland to become a member elect.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the Vienna summit was the second of the Austrian Presidency. The first took place on 24 and 25 October at Portschach and was convened to discuss the wide range of institutional, organisational and administrative issues facing the Union.  At Vienna we were able to build on those discussions and agree key elements of the so-called Vienna Strategy for Europe contained in the conclusions.</P>
    <P>I covered the main employment aspects of the strategy already and will address the justice and home affairs issues shortly, but I wish to focus briefly on those elements aimed at reforming the Union's policies and institutions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the final ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty in the second quarter of next year and the progressive implementation of its provisions.  I welcome the decision at Vienna to agree to examine at Cologne in June of next year, how and when to tackle the institutional issues which were not resolved by this treaty.  I accept that we must look at the size and composition of the Commission and the reweighting of votes in the Council in line with Article 1 of the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty.  However, we should be careful about the timing of any changes.  I would also be concerned lest we re-open any wider discussion of institutional arrangements and the treaties generally at too early a date given that we are still in the process of ratification of the most recent treaty.  There are wide-ranging instruments and provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty and these must be allowed to be implemented and developed before we turn our minds to any fundamental reviews.</P>
    <P>The measures put in place by the General Affairs Council to separate the internal and external affairs of the Union within its agenda, will allow for the more efficient processing and co-ordination of the Union's internal issues and I look forward to further consideration by the Council of how its work can be organised for greater effectiveness.  In that regard also, I welcome the conclusion at Vienna that the number of Council formations should be reduced and the initial recommendation that the Internal Market and Industry Councils be merged.  I look forward to the reports from the President of the Commission on the Internal Reform of the Commission and from the Secretary General of the Council on its functioning in light of an enlarged Union.  The Vienna strategy usefully encapsulates the medium-term actions required across a variety of areas of concern to maintain the organic development of the Union.  In this way, it prefigures <Col N="1428" /> to some extent the &ldquo;millennium declaration&rdquo; planned for agreement at Helsinki, which is intended to outline the Union's priorities for future years.</P>
    <P>The area of justice and home affairs is one of increasing importance since many of the issues faced by individual member states are best dealt with collectively at European level given their transnational nature.  An action plan on freedom, security and justice was considered by leaders at Vienna.  It sets out the priorities for action in this regard over the next two years after the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Co-operation in this field will allow for a co-ordinated approach to tackle serious problems such as drug trafficking and organised crime.</P>
    <P>EU level co-operation also allows for the development of global solutions on asylum and immigration.  To progress work in this area, a high level working group on asylum and migration has been established by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The diverse strands dealt with in the broad justice and home affairs area will be brought together for detailed consideration in the special meeting of the European Council to be held on 15-16 October 1999 in Tampere, Finland.</P>
    <P>I have often noted that the European Union has provided a useful framework within which progress in Northern Ireland can be made and I welcome the reiteration of support from our European partners provided in the Vienna conclusions. They recall the conclusions at Cardiff which mandated the Commission to bring forward proposals for the continued support of the peace process.  I look forward to the Commission's proposals and thank our European partners, as well as the Commission and the European Parliament, for their ongoing and genuine support.</P>
    <P>As far as common foreign and security policy issues were concerned, the Vienna European Council discussions and conclusions broadly covered three areas: human rights, the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty and a number of external policy issues.  The 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights fell on 10 December and, to mark the occasion, the European Council reaffirmed its commitments to the rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in that historic human rights document.  The European Union is founded on the principles and values enshrined in the universal declaration &mdash; liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>In the context of the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty which will come into force in May or June next, the European Council took some decisions of a procedural nature.  These concerned the new instruments of common strategies, the appointment of a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy as soon as possible, and the new impetus given to debate on security policy issues.  While the Council stated that the CFSP must be backed by credible operational capabilities, which has an <Col N="1429" /> immediate application to the Petersberg Tasks, and welcomed the Franco-British St. Malo Declaration, it also stated that European solidarity must take into account the various positions of European states, including the four neutral states.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State and Government had a detailed discussion on Russia over dinner on the first day when concerns were expressed about the economic challenges facing the Russian people. The European Union stressed its solidarity with Russia and its people and reaffirmed the importance of Russia as a strategic partner.  Foreign Ministers at their dinner discussion focused on the western Balkans.  Progress was noted, where such had been made, in respect of Albania, Macedonia and, to a lesser extent, the return of refugees in Croatia.  With regard to Kosovo, the Council expressed concern at the lack of progress on political talks between the Serb and the Albanian sides, but reiterated its support for the process as well as the readiness of the EU to provide further humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The European Council also considered the Middle East peace process, and in that context reviewed the important Wye River Memorandum Agreement.  The Council welcomed the new dynamic for peace created by that agreement. However, all members of the European Council are conscious of the serious difficulties which have arisen in its implementation.  We deplored the recent violence which led to several deaths and the setting of new conditions which impede its implementation.  We called on the parties most concerned to implement the agreement fully in accordance with the agreed timetable and in good faith.</P>
    <P>Since the European Council, President Clinton has visited the Middle East.  I pay tribute to his great personal efforts in support of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, efforts which we in Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, fully support.  The European Council reaffirmed its determination to make its own political and economic contribution to the peace process.  The Union and individual member states made pledges at the recent donor conference held in Washington.  On that occasion, Ireland pledged a minimum of $10 million during the five year period 1999-2003 for projects in the West Bank and Gaza.</P>
    <P>In my meeting with Chancellor Schröder in Bonn, I raised Ireland's campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2001-2 and asked for favourable consideration when the new German Government comes to consider the issue, highlighting Ireland's commitment to the UN, multilateralism and peacekeeping over many decades.  I had a very friendly and productive meeting with the German Chancellor in Bonn, in which we went over all the issues which must be decided in March and clarified Ireland's position on them.  The meeting represents a new start to a good working relationship, <Col N="1430" /> which will be very important when vital decisions have to be taken.</P>
    <P>The Austrian Presidency managed to host a very successful summit which saw advances on many key items on the Union's agenda.  The Austrian contribution will be more evident in the medium term as the many reports commissioned are produced and the deadlines they hope to set are met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on a sentence in the Taoiseach's speech which illustrates clearly why Ireland and Europe are not able to influence events such as the bombing of Iraq.  The Taoiseach stated:</P>
      <P>While the Council stated that the CFSP must be backed by credible operational capabilities, which has an immediate application to the Petersberg Tasks, and welcomed the Franco-British St. Malo Declaration, it also stated that European solidarity must take into account the various positions of European states, including the four neutral states.</P>
      <P>That sentence constitutes a complete fudge as far as European security is concerned.  What is being said is that there should be an operational capacity to support European security but also that everyone should be free to follow their own course of action.  That is a complete contradiction. The Anglo-American attack on Iraq demonstrates that there is no such thing as a common security policy in Europe.  The attack was not discussed in Europe nor at the summit in Vienna, even though it was being planned while the summit was taking place.  There was no word about Iraq in the Taoiseach's speech.  The attack was being planned at the time by a body, one of whose members, Britain, says it is a part of a common security policy with other members but it did not discuss the matter with them.</P>
      <P>As a country which insists on the one hand that it is neutral but on the other puts forward someone to be the representative of a common security policy, we have a deep ambiguity in our position. How can it be credibly stated we are neutral and that we do not have any position on these matters as far as common European security is concerned when we believe one of our citizens should be the person to represent that policy?  It does not add up and this is because the Fianna Fáil Party has not been able to make up its mind on the issue of common European security.  It is wrong that Ireland is not a member of Partnership for Peace when all the countries of eastern Europe, former members of the Warsaw Pact and Finland and Austria are willing to join it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is not willing to join it, not because of any strong sense of Ireland's interests but because of sheer political cowardice.  There is a populist view within Fianna Fáil that it could not explain Ireland being involved in Partnership for Peace or being committed to European defence without difficulty, so it will not put itself to the trouble of explaining it.  We are standing outside <Col N="1431" /> a common foreign and security policy for Europe. The reality is that if one wants to influence what people do, one has to be part of the decision, part of acceptance of and the taking of responsibility for the decision.  It is not possible to sit on the sidelines and say we are the moral conscience of the world, that we will take no part in any of the decisions and will not pay for any of the decisions but we want to be able to preach from the sidelines and then complain we have not been consulted. If we have not been consulted it is because we have not opted in.  This is an issue other parties in the House need to come to terms with.  We cannot become great purveyors of moral outrage if we are not willing to contribute to European common security.  There is a provision for common European security in the treaties and under the present Government we have not been willing to live up to it.  I am sorry that is the case.  This has serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that United Nations law on the matter is ambiguous.  The Taoiseach was able to say there is one view that the British and the Americans are entitled to do what they have done and there is another that they are not.  While the people are arguing about this, people are being killed.  There should be a European determination for Europe on this issue and Europe should be able to come to a conclusion, at least as a United Europe, as to what is the correct legal interpretation.  Is it legally correct that action of the kind being taken can be taken?  In the absence of any genuine common European security policy where people pool their discussion one is forced into a situation where countries will take unilateral action.  In a sense the British will claim they could not wait for Europe to make a decision because Europe would never make a decision.  Therefore, they would claim, they had to act on their own.  Equally we have to play our part to ensure Europe can act together if we want to restrain others from acting unilaterally.  We have not done that.  That is the problem about Ireland's approach to the common European security.  The idea that one would have a common economic policy, a common budget, a common currency, a common political structure and no common defence is unsustainable.  If we are to have a common policy on all these matters and are not prepared to defend it, that is unsustainable and people have got to come to terms with that.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Taoiseach said about tax harmonisation.  Our tax system, while it is a low rate system so far as corporation tax is concerned, is transparent.  There are no sweetheart deals for individual companies.  There may be a low rate of corporate taxation which is privileging trading sectors over other sectors of the economy, but there are no sweetheart deals as there are in other countries.  The Taoiseach was right to make that point which is a <Col N="1432" /> valid one.  It is a strong defence against any criticism that could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no designer taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, it is all off the shelf.  It is the same for everybody.  If you meet the criteria you qualify for the 12.5 per cent corporation tax and that is how it should be.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated Ireland's rejection of any proposal for co-financing of the Common Agricultural Policy because it breached the fundamental principles of the policy.  I agree with the Taoiseach on that point.  The idea of moving back to renationalising the Common Agricultural Policy is not only bad for Ireland, it is bad for Europe because it dismantles one of the few long-term policies at a time when we are trying to create common policies in other areas.  The Taoiseach went on to say the current Commission proposals on milk quotas and proposals favouring intensive rather than extensive beef systems would impact negatively on Ireland.  This is probably true and is undoubtedly true in the short-term in the sense that Irish farmers would lose substantially.</P>
      <P>It is time we took a long-term view on what the Common Agricultural Policy, with all the aids, grants and controls, is actually doing to Irish farming.  When I entered this House, farming was a commercial activity.  Farmers were independent, stood on their own feet, made and lost money in the market and occasionally complained to politicians but broadly speaking they worked as free agents in a free market.  That is not the case now. Farmers no longer operate in a free market. Effectively they are people on a rural reservation. We are turning the agricultural community of Europe into an equivalent of the inhabitants of an Indian reservation in the mid-west.  That is not what farmers want.  It is important that that be said in this House.  There is an idea that farmers want this situation and that farmers want to live on handouts.  They do not.  They want the freedom to farm, to produce, to buy and sell land, to buy and sell cattle and to make their own decisions as independent people.  Independence is something they have had through generations. They do not want to become the pensioners of the European Commission which, unfortunately, is what farmers are becoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should reflect on the damage the Common Agricultural Policy is doing to the quality of Irish production.  I was shocked to read in the McKinsey report the evidence of the deterioration in the quality of Irish beef since 1990.  In Ireland or Britain about 56 per cent of Irish beef would qualify as being of sufficient quality to go on a supermarket shelf in 1990.  By 1997 we had reached the position where only 26 per cent of Irish beef would be of sufficient quality in Ireland by the retailers.  The remaining 74 per cent would not be accepted.  Why has that happened?  It has happened because the Common Agricultural Policy pays people a cheque on the head of an animal <Col N="1433" /> whether suitable for sale or not.  People are encouraged to have animals to qualify for cheques, not to to feed people but simply as a passport for a cheque.  They do not care about breeding or feeding policy.  They just have the animals to qualify for the cheques.  The extent of the rapidity of the deterioration in Irish beef quality since 1990 is shocking.  I do not wonder why the McKinsey report was not published.  Had it been published, the damage would have been great.  I say it in the House, safe in the knowledge that this is one place in Ireland where one can say anything with an almost certain guarantee it will not be published.  I say to the Taoiseach in this effectively private meeting that what is happening to Irish beef is very serious.  I have some familiarity with the sector from my professional background. It is awful that the quality is so bad.  It is due to the Common Agricultural Policy because the dairy policy encourages milk production on a quota basis regardless of implications for the quality of the beef herd.  When the bullocks are sold and go into the beef sector the quality of the beef sector deteriorates because the Holstein breed is unsuitable.  There is also the headage payment system which encourages people to hold on to these animals rather than slaughter them. The position is getting worse.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to take a long-term view of agriculture.  It involves taking short-term decisions which are not very popular.  I know some of the farming organisations would not support him in taking a long-term view because they are totally fixated on the short-term.  They are far more political in the way they operate than any of us here, in the sense that they live from headline to headline, from pressure group to pressure group.  Their sole imperative is unity and they have no regard for the medium-term consequences for the sector.</P>
    <P>Someone must take a long-term view of the future of agriculture and it is the Government's responsibility to do so.  It must consider developing commercial agriculture. There is no way we can realistically support the number of commercial farmers currently involved in the industry because there is not enough land available from which they could earn incomes comparable to the average industrial wage.  No one involved in farming or any other occupation should be asked to work for less than the average industrial wage. For individuals to be commercially successful in farming they must be able to purchase and farm adequate areas of land.  The Government will encounter difficulties in this area.  If we do not deal with this matter now, there will soon be no commercially viable farmers working the land and everyone will be claiming pensions.  Irish land, which has the capacity to feed the people of Europe, will not be capable of doing so because the structures will have been overrun by the pension and headage payment mentality.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the single currency.  I am concerned about the German Government seeking <Col N="1434" /> to get its money back.  It is being supported in this approach by a number of other countries. The European Union is not some kind of defined pension scheme where every country must pay in a certain amount and receive a certain amount in return.  The common budget creates a common market and Germany has benefited more than almost any other country from that market. Richer countries benefit more from the common market than poorer ones, while poorer countries benefit more from the common budget than richer ones.  That is the deal, the richer a country, the more it pays into the common budget. Equally, however, that country will gain more from the common market because of its larger productive capacity.  Likewise, a small, poor country will gain little from the common market because it is not competitive in terms of its production.</P>
    <P>Those countries adopting Mrs. Thatcher's &ldquo;I want my money back&rdquo; approach do not understand what is going on.  I have heard reports that Chancellor Schröder stated he is tired of being &ldquo;ripped off&rdquo; and that German money was &ldquo;squandered in Brussels&rdquo;.  That is not the case. The European Commission's budget is probably smaller than those of London County Council or Berlin City Council.  The European budget is quite small when compared to those of municipalities in many member states.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Europe is becoming a focus for people to air their opposition to globalisation, free markets or change.  No one likes change, particularly politicians who are in Government because it might mean the end of their term of office.  In my opinion, Opposition politicians are more open to change.  The truth is, however, no one really likes change.  To some extent there is so much change happening throughout the world because of globalisation that someone must be blamed.  There appears to be an increasing tendency for people to blame Europe for change.  The changes taking place would occur in any event, regardless of whether the European Union existed.  In reality, the EU provides us with an instrument by which we can influence change for good or ill.  Without the European Union, we would be simply the victims of change.</P>
    <P>The globalisation forces to which I referred would be taking effect regardless of whether the European Union or the the European currency existed.  However, through the EU and the single currency, we will have some influence on the shape of change.  That is the way this matter should be considered.  In my opinion Europe's leaders are failing abysmally in their duty to explain the value of the European Union to their electorates.  They are allowing anti-sentiment to flourish because of a Euro-minimalist approach on their part, which is related to the Government's weak approach to common European security.  The philosophy of this approach is &ldquo;We want something out of this but we do not want to put anything in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is under pressure on a number of <Col N="1435" /> fronts, including the common agricultural policy, the budget, taxation, etc.  The country is also a net beneficiary and it receives a great deal of money from Europe comparative to its wealth.  I am surprised, therefore, that Ireland has the second worst record in Europe in respect of implementing EU directives.  Deputy Quinn tabled a series of questions on that matter a number of weeks ago, the answers to which proved highly informative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were highly depressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They show that Ireland has failed to implement 76 directives it should have implemented under the Single Market.  Only Luxembourg, with 80 un-implemented directives, has a worse record.  However, Luxembourg is tiny and its civil service probably employs fewer staff than Dublin Corporation.  Given the other matters with which it must deal, Luxembourg's civil service cannot be blamed for failing to implement those directives.  However, that Ireland, the greatest single net beneficiary from Europe in <i>per capita</i> terms, should have the second worst record in terms of implementing EU directives, is a gratuitous invitation to get ourselves kicked.</P>
      <P>We should try to be the best, not the second worst, in implementing directives so that we do not leave ourselves open to criticism.  I remind the Taoiseach that Finland, a country which joined the European Union after Ireland, has the best record on implementing directives.  Finland is a small country but it has failed to implement only 15 directives while Ireland has failed to implement 76.  That country's civil service is obliged to translate EU directives into Finnish, a language which most other people cannot understand. The Finnish civil service is comparable in size to Ireland's, but that country has managed to implement a far greater number of directives. Ireland, which receives the directives in English and which has a sizable Civil Service, has failed to implement 76 directives.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should ask the secretaries general of the Departments which have not implemented EU directives &mdash; virtually every Department is guilty in that regard &mdash; what they are doing exposing Ireland to this sort of criticism. The last thing we need when trying to defend or position on taxation or the common agricultural policy is to be criticised for not implementing the directives to create the Single Market.  We do not need to expose ourselves in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now comment on the enlargement of the European Union.  Prior to the Taoiseach's meeting in Vienna, I had an opportunity to meet the Prime Ministers of Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia, the Polish Finance Minister and others.  We should recognise the difficulties faced by the Governments of countries hoping to join the EU in terms of modernising their economies.  One of the ways they can sell EU membership to their <Col N="1436" /> electorates is by informing them they have to do these things to qualify for entry into the European Union and escape from under the umbrella of Russian influence.  Ireland did the same thing in 1973 partly for the same reason, namely, escaping from under the British umbrella.</P>
    <P>For the countries to which I refer, EU membership is a political as much as an economic imperative. They are having to make terribly difficult decisions.  For example, the five party coalition Government of Romania will have to decide to make redundant approximately 70,000 state sector employees of loss making state companies. These people have to be laid off because the companies must be closed down.  Even if they were paid for doing nothing, the country would save far more than if they were working.  Poland will be obliged to close seven coalmines in the short-term. That country, which ten years ago was still under communist rule, has a more liberal rail system than Ireland and it allows private sector trains to use rail lines.  Ireland has not yet liberalised its rail system and I am sorry the Minister for Public Enterprise is not present to reflect on that.</P>
    <P>As already stated, these countries are being forced to make difficult decisions and they sell those decisions to their electorates by stating that they must be taken to facilitate entry to the European Union.  Member states of the EU are slowing down enlargement and the will for enlargement does not exist.  I understand that at one level because if it is difficult to create a sense of Euro patriotism &mdash; which will be needed to hold the Union together &mdash; in western Europe, it will be even more difficult to convince people living in Connemara that they have something in common with their counterparts in Gdansk or Bucharest and that they are all part of the same team.  Galway people, wherever they live, support the Galway team when it reaches the All-Ireland Final and they must take the same approach to Europe.</P>
    <P>There will ultimately have to be a sense of a common European identity that will support the European team when difficult decisions have to be made.  The more the European Union enlarges the more difficult that will become, but the price of not enlarging reasonably quickly is to put these democratic countries under pressure.  It should be borne in mind that they were let down and serially betrayed by western Europe in the 1930s when they were gobbled up one by one by Hitler. They are waiting to discover &mdash; this is not said at meetings &mdash; if the precedent will be repeated in the 1990s and the early years of the new century. We should be generous in our approach.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal for Malta.  The Maltese should not lose out because for a few months they had an anti-EU Government which, mercifully, was voted out of office recently.  They should be treated as if their application was always on the table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although one does not get this impression from the Taoiseach's report, the <Col N="1437" /> European Council in Vienna was the first occasion on which it was apparent that Ireland's status as a favorite younger child or struggling participating member state, which was used by successive Governments to secure concessions, was at an end.  We are no longer looked upon in a benign way.  If one reads the popular press in a number of member states and listens to debates in the European Union, it is apparent that Ireland is no longer seen as a good player entitled to receive a little extra, as happened in Edinburgh when we received the largest <i>per capita</i> increase in Structural Funds notwithstanding the fact that we are not the poorest member state.  Although different parties have different views on some issues, there is a possibility of consensus in a number of areas around which we should build positive positions.  Does the Taoiseach accept there has been a fundamental shift in the perception of Ireland among other member states at all levels?</P>
      <P>On economic and monetary union and the proposal for co-ordination, the perception of Ireland as a tax haven presents a serious problem.  As the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, is well aware, it is erroneous but it is being promoted by ill-informed or envious comment. There is an obligation on the Government &mdash; the Taoiseach shares my view &mdash; to engage in a diplomatic counter exercise, for which there is a precedent.</P>
      <P>When we were attempting to ensure Ireland would qualify, through our observance of the Maastricht Treaty criteria, to participate in the first round of the single currency Ireland was not mentioned by some continental commentators and senior institutional officials such as Mr. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, even though we were more compliant than some of the countries mentioned such as Belgium.  During my time in the Department of Finance a concerted effort was made to ensure this erroneous impression was corrected and Ireland would be one of the founding members.</P>
      <P>That campaign was won but it did not happen by accident.  There were systematic briefings, interviews and contact with the financial media by the NTMA, the Department of Finance and other relevant bodies.  This required much resources and was hit and miss because there was no guarantee of success.  I have no confidence that the Department of Finance has analysed the need for such a campaign or that the Minister for Finance is attempting to pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the points made on tax co-ordination, from which Ireland has nothing to fear.  The rates of 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent have been decided.  Changes would require unanimity and a new treaty.  Ireland's effective tax rate is similar to that in other countries which have a higher nominal rate of taxation but a narrower base, particularly in the area of corporation tax.  In the Netherlands there are designer tax rates &mdash; I have direct knowledge of this &mdash; whereby in a special deal an individual company can negotiate an effective 7 per cent corporation tax rate with the <Col N="1438" /> Dutch authorities.  No one is suggesting that should happen here, but this information was conveyed directly some years ago to the Department of Finance.  The IDA is also aware of it.</P>
    <P>The tax havens of Jersey and the Channel Islands are under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.  Ireland is not a tax haven.  There are no brass plate operations in the IFSC, although some German and Luxembourg commentators are attempting to suggest there are.  Envy and worry, particularly on the part of Luxembourg, and the rise of the IFSC are factors which will give rise to adverse comment and distort political opinions.  This has to be addressed.  Although it is primarily a matter for the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach should have a co-ordinating role.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach is satisfied about the arrangements with regard to the representation of the euro countries and the G7, but I appreciate the efforts being made by the German and French Finance Ministers to secure economic co-ordination in the member states which have a common currency.  The Maastricht Treaty did not provide for monetary union.  It provided for economic and monetary union.  The focus of attention is on economic governance now that the technicalities have been resolved. Greater co-ordination is in everybody's interest and we must look at how we perform in relation to that.  There must be a better dialogue between the citizens of this State, their representatives in the European Parliament and their representatives in the Oireachtas about the implications of such economic co-ordination and closer economic governance.  We have heard nothing from the Minister for Finance about emergent thinking in this area and there is no indication from the Taoiseach of what that thinking might be.</P>
    <P>My opening comments inform my attitude to Structural Funds.  I look forward to the day when Ireland is a net contributor to the European Union budget because when that happens Ireland will be a seriously rich country.  We are today a rich country but I look forward to the day when we become a net contributor, not a big contributor but a net contributor.  The Finnish contribution of 0.5 per cent would initially meet my requirements.  We must assert clearly and unreservedly that after 25 years of membership of the European Union, we aspire to paying our way and to returning some of the economic solidarity and support we received when we were growing up economically, so to speak.  We must declare our willingness to see substantial amounts of Irish taxpayers' money going to countries and regions of the European Union which need it.  We must say this without equivocation.  I have said this to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and in bilateral meetings in other European countries. I have yet to hear it from the Taoiseach or from the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  I suspect that in the course of the complex and intense negotiations which will take place between now and next March, including the <Col N="1439" /> special summit which the German Presidency envisages in February, we will not be able to negotiate the best possible transition deal in the next round of Structural Funds unless we assert what our end position is, what our aspirations are and our willingness to make a clear and full contribution to the European budget.  We have benefited immensely from membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I return to the point I made at the outset and which cannot be repeated often enough.  There has been structural shift in the perception of Ireland by the other member states which informs their attitude to our approach to Structural Funds.  We have already had a debate on regionalisation.  The Government was forced into a political compromise for domestic reasons and perhaps will not be unhappy if EUROSTAT comes to a conclusion which does not support our application.  That is for another day and I do not wish to prejudice the negotiations.  As far as I am aware, the matter will be adjudicated on very clear objective criteria.</P>
    <P>Ms Máire Harkin who represents the Western Development Commission and the alliance which sought regionalisation for the west of Ireland, has said the Government, by including parts of regions not connected one with the other, has damaged the prospects of a clear success in that area.  We must wait and see what comes from that decision.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that while it is legitimate to maximise the amount of money this country will get, the idea of forcing regionalisation up to the point where, according to various estimates, we would only get perhaps an additional £100 million to £130 million over the seven year period of Agenda 2000 is not.  This idea has not been convincingly argued by Ministers or spokespersons. It will prejudice our success in the wider set of European negotiations if we are seen, in a mealy mouthed, béal bocht manner, to squeeze that part of the entire European agenda for a few extra million pounds when we enjoy twice the rate of economic growth of the whole of Europe, our national debt is falling dramatically in terms of GDP and our projected set of total budget surpluses is substantial in absolute and real percentage terms.  In addition we have, after the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, one of the largest private sector pension fund industries in Europe with massive reserves.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance commissioned a study which reported while I was Minister for Finance. This demonstrated that, on today's figures, the accumulated value of private Irish pension funds such as the Aer Lingus and ESB workers' funds and private sector funds, is between £23 billion and £25 billion, or approximately half our GDP. The European Union is aware of our budget surpluses, our economic growth and our tax take which is the lowest in the European Union and projected, in the documents which accompanied the budget, to fall in real terms.  We are not in a <Col N="1440" /> strong position to make a case for an extra £100 million to £200 million to countries who do not enjoy such a strong economic background.  The potential for a succesful set of negotiations across a wider front could be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>I remind the Taoiseach that we have already run into that resistance in one operational area. Leaving aside the impasse in relation to the docklands project and the conference centre, every town which confidently expected to be granted urban renewal or integrated area planning status on 31 July last is still awaiting an announcement. These towns had hoped for an announcement on this matter in the early autumn so that plans could be made.  However, this item has fallen into the crevasse of envy, opposition and suspicion which is being aggravated by the béal bocht bleatings of some people in our approach to European funds.</P>
    <P>Tipperary town is considered an economic black spot compared to other towns in south Tipperary such as Clonmel or Carrick-on-Suir.  Tipperary South Riding decided to make only one application to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to integrated area planning.  On a recent visit to Tipperary town I met the chamber of commerce and others who want to make their investment plans but have been put on hold while a decision is awaited. This kind of investment money will flow to other places and the people of Tipperary fear they will miss the boat.  This is an example of how a strategic political position and a set of perceptions, which are not being countered by our embassies or by the Department of Finance, works its way through the Commission and DG4 down to the underdeveloped parts of Tipperary town.  Urban renewal type projects are being deliberately stalled because of the change in atmosphere and of attitude in the European Union as a result of what has been happening during the past year or so.</P>
    <P>I very much support what Deputy John Bruton said about the Common Agricultural Policy.  The CAP is the last command economy in the world. It has distorted market mechanisms to the point where it is run on forms and applications with no regard to market mechanisms as we know them. It is doing more than that.  It is conning a generation of people living in rural Ireland into thinking that by lobbying or by invading Farm Council meetings in Killarney or elsewhere, they can continue to live on an economic drip feed.  It is easier for the Labour Party to say this than for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  Perhaps the House should be saying that.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy death-knell was sounded by the former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry when the Blair House Agreement, which was part and parcel of the WTO institutions leading to the liberalisation of trade, was signed.  European food prices will move inexorably towards world market prices with some give or take.  Rural decline is a reality in Ireland. When we joined the European Union in 1973, 27 <Col N="1441" /> per cent of the workforce was engaged in primary agriculture.  The rate is now 11 per cent or 12 per cent and falling and it will continue to fall.  The IFA must be confronted with this and told that instead of fighting a rearguard action which is doomed to failure, we need to construct a positive and constructive policy of rural renewal and rural settlement that will take into account the reality that primary agriculture will decline and the numbers engaged directly in primary agriculture agribusiness will consequently decline, the rural population of Ireland is not made up of only farming communities, people are living in rural Ireland who do not earn their living directly from agri-business activities, and, the needs of growth of our economy and our population growth.  We have a population of 3.8 million, the highest since 1870 and much of that population, which has been generated by urban growth is choosing, of necessity or by choice, to live in rural Ireland.  In rural Ireland there is an immense capital stock of communal buildings, such as, schools, post offices, churches, community halls, clubs and so on.  If we do not have a positive policy on rural renewal, we will not be able to ensure the economic use of that capital infrastructure and we will have even more congestion in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement, Ireland should be positive with respect to Malta, but we should be proactive in relation to the three of the six applicant countries, in which we do not have a resident embassy, which will join the Union fairly soon.  I refer to the Republic of Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia.  We have resident embassies in the other three applicant countries.  To construct a new alliance of friendships and contact in an enlarged Union, Ireland through the Department of Foreign Affairs, should run a bilateral programme to facilitate and assist those applicant countries to make the transition so that they qualify to implement the <i>Acquis</i> communitaire and fully participate in the membership of the Union. That is an enormous task, as we heard earlier today.  We have considerable expertise and we should offer to share it in a bilateral programme run by the Department of Foreign Affairs in a manner that will enable us to win friends and allies, which we will need for the future.</P>

      <P>In the ten minutes available to me I will not be able to cover all the aspects of European policy in the Vienna Summit that I would like, particularly as I want to spend some time speaking on the current appalling attacks on the people of Iraq.  Before dealing with other matters arising from the summit, I wish to refer to last night's attack by the United States and the United Kingdom on Iraq.  EU leaders discussed the Iraqi situation at Vienna, but the Presidency Conclusions did not refer to any support for military action against Iraq.  Everyone acknowledges the major contribution made by President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair to the peace process on this island, but that does not <Col N="1442" /> mean our critical faculties should be put into cold storage when it comes to other actions they may take.</P>
      <P>The decision to launch bomb and missile attacks against Iraq was wrong.  It was immoral, unjustified, contrary to the UN Charter and disproportionate to the issues involved.  Many people seem to believe a decision was made some time ago by the US authorities to teach Saddam a lesson and, regardless of what attitude the Iraqis had adopted to the UN inspection teams, that it was only a matter of time before the military would be let loose.  It is important to emphasise that there is not a United Nations mandate for these attacks.  Attempts by the US and Britain to wrap the blue flag around themselves is fundamentally dishonest.  The attacks have already split the Security Council and are likely to damage the standing and credibility of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>History has shown that Saddam Hussein is an unsavory, unstable and unpredictable dictator who has been unspeakably cruel to his own people.  However, those who will suffer most from these attacks will not be Saddam or the Iraqi generals but the ordinary Iraqi people.  In addition, the penal application of sanctions in the aftermath of the Gulf War has created real hardship for the Iraqi people.  The World Health Organisation estimated that up to 6,000 children are dying each month.  These sanctions have allowed Saddam to depict himself as a defender of his people.  Military strikes are likely to add further to his prestige with ordinary Iraqis.  Far from ousting Saddam Hussein these attacks may serve only to strengthen his hold on power.</P>
      <P>In addition, given his unpredictability, these attacks on Iraq could set off a chain of events, which would have dire consequences for the people of the region.  The failure of Iraq to comply with UN resolutions is deplorable and requires a strong diplomatic response from the world community.  Unfortunately, the failure of the international community to take sanctions against countries like Israel, Turkey and Indonesia, which have been allowed to ignore UN resolutions time and again, may simply have encouraged Saddam Hussein to believe he could get away with this defiance.</P>
      <P>Are we also to take it that there has now been a change in international law and that possession or alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction which pose a potential threat to neighbouring countries are legitimate grounds for military intervention by third countries.  If they are, Israel, Libya, Syria, India, Pakistan and a host of other countries are legitimate targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make an analogy with our own island, we all know the IRA and the other paramilitaries continue to possess weapons of destruction, that they pose a potential threat to others, that the paramilitaries are refusing to destroy those weapons, that they are defying the democratic will of the people of the two jurisdictions and that they are failing to co-operate with the duly appointed decommissioning body.  Is anyone seriously suggesting <Col N="1443" /> that the British and Irish Governments should launch pre-emptive military strikes?  When international crises have arisen before, especially those involving the United States, the tendency for Irish Governments has been to bury their heads and hope that nobody will ask them what is their position.  I hope we will not have a similar silence on this occasion, although I am not at all sure that will be the case given the Taoiseach's response in the Dáil this morning.  Already other European countries like France and Germany have made it clear that they do not approve of these actions.  Why does the Taoiseach not also make it clear that this country does not approve of this action?  Ireland should join with like minded countries in the EU and the United Nations and work for an immediate ending to the attacks and for a peaceful settlement of the dispute with Iraq.  Article 29.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states &ldquo;Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.&rdquo; It is now time that we started to live to those fine principles.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Summit seems to be more notable for the number of decisions deferred by the EU than the number taken.  Apart from the resolution agreeing to award the designation of honorary citizen of Europe to the former German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, one can search in vain through the usually lengthy Presidency Conclusions for another single decision of significance. The Presidency Conclusions is littered with the words &ldquo;welcomes, asks, invites, encourages, reiterates, underlines, takes note,&rdquo; but the word &ldquo;decides&rdquo; hardly appears in the document.  A number of important issues requiring decision have been deferred.  Agenda 2000, agricultural reform, new employment initiatives, Structural Funds and duty free issues have all been deferred to future summits.  Unless care is taken we will end up with a serious logjam in the decision-making process in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The one issue on which a decision, or what might be described as a half-decision, was made, was duty free sales, an area of particular concern to this country.  As an island nation on the periphery of Europe, with a high level of travel between here and other European countries and a tourism industry that is vital to our economy, the proposal to abolish duty free sales is a matter of vital interest.  The decision to ask the Commission to examine again the implications for jobs of the decision to abolish duty free sales provides a window of opportunity to have the matter fully aired again.  Every study to date has identified serious potential job losses and the Commission study is hardly likely to find otherwise.  However, we should not assume that the battle has been won. Strong opposition to reversing the decision remains, especially in Denmark, and the Taoiseach needs to continue to exert pressure.</P>
    <P>The move to abolish duty free within the EU is a reflection of the type of rigid and inflexible <Col N="1444" /> free market dogma which drives the decision-making process and makes people cynical about the European project.  The disclosure a few weeks ago that duty free facilities will be retained for members of the Commission will increase the degree of cynicism.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the issue of the next round of EU Structural Funds has not been raised, given how important Fianna Fáil claims it is to Ireland. The next round of Structural Funds will have a huge impact on regionalisation and the fight against poverty and disadvantage over the next decade.  The decision by the Government to draw an artificial line through the heart of the country was a cynical move which has more to do with the perceived political needs of the Government than the needs of disadvantaged areas.  The 70 per cent of unemployed people who live outside the areas singled out for preferential treatment by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been told they are on their own.</P>
    <P>The Government has made a nonsense of its own claims to have a coherent policy on regionalisation by creating, for purely political purposes, a totally artificial region that leads over the Shannon Estuary and bypasses impoverished communities in the city of Limerick.  There is every chance the EU will recognise this proposal for the political stroke it is and reject it, thus damaging the standing of Ireland in the Community and diminishing our prospects of getting a sympathetic hearing.</P>
    <P>One item I welcome in the Vienna conclusions is the statement that employment is the top priority of the European Union.  It also states that this is the best way of providing real opportunities for people and combating poverty and exclusion effectively, thereby serving as a basis for the European social model.  The jobs must be good with decent pay and conditions.  Few reasonable people could disagree with those sentiments. Direct investment must be targeted specifically at those areas of highest unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>We are about to engage in a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy and its reform.  The IFA and other organisations which primarily reflect the interests of commercial farmers will do farmers and the rural community a disservice if they start to cry gloom and doom again.  There is an urgent need for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure that, where resources are available, they are used to assist those who need them and not, as happened under the MacSharry proposals, to give 20 per cent of farmers the benefits of 80 per cent of the money available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for facilitating me in meeting my German colleague, Joschka Fischer, this morning.  As the Minister is probably aware, Mr. Fischer has issued what are regarded in some quarters as controversial statements on NATO.  The German Greens policy has always been to &ldquo;denatify&rdquo; the <Col N="1445" /> European security architecture and this has met with widespread criticism in the United States.</P>
      <P>What type of vision does this country have for Europe?  How do we see the common foreign and security policy progressing as we enter the new millennium?  It seems we are in a quandary.  Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats are in favour of Partnership for Peace and Fine Gael favours joining NATO, which is based on nuclear weapons.  That is not the way the German Greens or Joschka Fischer want to go.  We would like to take NATO out of the equation.  By joining Partnership for Peace, we are heading in the direction of NATO.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in previous debates that neutral countries are joining Partnership for Peace.  It may be of interest to the Minister to know that NATO personnel and generals have referred to those countries as the former neutrals, which gives some insight into their way of thinking. Partnership for Peace is a stepping stone towards NATO.  It is not the direction in which Europe should be heading.  The Western European Union is based on NATO and could be seen as the European leg of NATO.  This country should be steering away from that.</P>
      <P>It is no good saying that Austria and Switzerland are involved in Partnership for Peace.  There have been internal debates in those countries on Partnership for Peace.  The governing elites are pushing this issue.  NATO literature refers to them as the &ldquo;political elites&rdquo;.  It is clear the establishment, including the media, is pushing for membership of Partnership for Peace.  Those of us who oppose this issue &mdash; I issued approximately eight press releases on it &mdash; cannot get any coverage.  That is deplorable.  We need an open debate on this issue so we can tease out the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people want to retain our neutral status.  They are confused by the name Partnership for Peace.  This is an advertising agency's dream; Saatchi and Saatchi could not have thought of a better title.  What could be nicer than partnership and peace?  When they are asked if they favour Partnership for Peace, 70 per cent will say yes.  They do not know the problems involved and that it is a stepping stone to NATO. I hope we have a proper debate on this issue in the new session so that we can tease out the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to head in the direction of the German Greens who want to take NATO out of the equation.  The statements by the French about the bombing of Iraq show they want to dissociate themselves from it.  We should be courageous enough to take a similar step.  Which camp are we in?  We seem to play it both ways by saying we love the Americans and the Europeans.  We should develop a proper European identity and shape Europe towards the type of vision we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister addressed the issue of Sellafield with Joschka Fischer this morning.  As he knows, the programme of the SPD and the Greens in Germany refers to the decommissioning <Col N="1446" /> of various power plants, the majority of which run on nuclear fuel.  If the German Greens hold true to their promise, there will be decommissioning which will have huge effects on the operation of Sellafield which depends on spent fuel for reprocessing.  If that was stopped, Sellafield would no longer be economically viable.  I hope this issue will be pushed during the German Presidency.  It is in our interests to push this issue and to stop spent fuel being used at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The euro has not been properly debated.  During the so-called Maastricht debate we spoke about whether we would get £6 billion or £8 billion.  If we asked the people if the single currency was debated, they would not be able to remember.  It is regrettable the debate focused on funding.  This is, as Deputy Spring said, a huge step.  It is even bigger than joining the EEC about which we had a long debate.  We did not go into the details of the implications.  At this stage there are many people who fear the consequences. Many people do not understand the full implication, that we are giving up our economic sovereignty and the tools of economic management. They believe it is simply a question of having euro notes so that when returning from abroad one no longer has pesetas in one's pocket.  That is a gross simplification but is the idea which people have of the euro.  It is time to inform people of the seriousness of the issue.</P>
    <P>Europe is ill-prepared for this.  In the United States, for example, where there is an economic union, there are fiscal transfers for those states which cannot maintain their position.  Mr. Hans Tietmayer has stated that it is up to us and we are on our own.  If one cannot maintain one's position, so be it.  It seems to me to be an extremely harsh regime and quite undemocratic. The utterances of Mr. Wif Duisenberg do not inspire confidence.  This man seems to think that he is now king of Europe and he can do whatever he wants.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs to state that this is not satisfactory. We must have some input.  We do not seem to have any input on the European Central Bank &mdash; Deputy Quinn has raised that essential matter. All of these things have been conveniently put to one side and we are entering an unprecedented stage in our economic development without any real lifelines.  It is certainly uncharted territory. All we can do at this stage is hope for the best.</P>
    <P>I remember at the time saying that before long we would come to the issue of tax harmonisation and I was told that was nonsense.  In fact, Deputy Dukes told us we could talk about that perhaps 40 years down the line.  Chancellor Schröder is stating this is now on the agenda and Mr. Lafontaine is certainly pressing this issue.  What we are witnessing especially within Germany is a sort of new Euro scepticism.  Perhaps it is politically convenient to blame Europe for many of Germany's ills but we are under pressure from the Germans. The Germans are pressing for tax harmonisation and I do not know how long Ireland can hold out. <Col N="1447" /> Ireland is a relatively small player within Europe and it will take all of our resources to withstand that sort of pressure.  It must be remembered that it is our good tax regime which has helped improve our economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that some of the issues I have raised will be addressed by the Minister in his response.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with Deputy Gormley's arguments and I will deal with further arguments about the Partnership for Peace.

      <P>I do not agree with that either. The whole thing was a little messy and I am trying to put it right.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his statement earlier has reported comprehensively on the outcome of the Vienna European Council.  In relation to Agenda 2000, the outcome of the European Council in Vienna was a satisfactory one from Ireland's point of view.  Following Vienna, the negotiations are now moving into their final phase under the incoming German Presidency.  Although the negotiations promise to be difficult, they remain on course for political agreement in March.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gormley said, I met my colleague, Mr. Joschka Fischer, this morning and outlined a comprehensive overview of our concerns and interests in the context of the up-coming deepening negotiations on Agenda 2000 which the German Presidency hopes to conclude by the end of March.  We said we will be constructive but nevertheless, taking account of our membership of the EU, we also had to take account of our national interests.</P>
      <P>The detailed report submitted to Vienna reflects considerable progress, especially on the more technical aspects of the negotiations, gives an overview of the state of play on the main outstanding elements of the negotiation, and includes a series of addenda setting out in detail the various legislative proposals as they now stand.  Ireland's concerns are adequately reflected in the report.  The European Council noted that the progress report and the Commission's proposals constitute a good basis for further work on Agenda 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress on the more sensitive political aspects of the negotiations has inevitably been slower. This is reflected in the relatively brief conclusions of the European Council which focus on some broad considerations for the remainder of the negotiations.  The European Council reiterated its commitment to meeting the deadline of March 1999 for reaching agreement on Agenda 2000, and recalled that agreement can only be reached <Col N="1448" /> on the package as a whole.  It invited all member states to make their full contribution to achieving a fair, balanced and acceptable outcome.</P>
    <P>Difficult and challenging negotiations lie ahead.  As we enter this critical phase of the negotiations, we will continue to approach the Agenda 2000 negotiations in the constructive spirit which has informed our approach to date.  However, I can assure Deputies that constructive approach to the negotiations will be accompanied by a continued, robust defence of Ireland's interests across the range of areas encompassed by the Agenda 2000 package.  I expressed Ireland's deep concern at the Commission's proposals on CAP reform, particularly under the headings of beef, milk, co-financing, the prospect of renationalisation and so on.  We will insist on the importance for Ireland of a satisfactory outcome of the proposals for CAP reform, and we will seek to ensure that adequate and equitable transitional arrangements are available for those regions moving out of Objective One status.</P>
    <P>European integration gained new momentum at Vienna.  From the reports presented to the Council it was noted that the elements of economic policy co-ordination in relation to the third stage of EMU were already in place and working well and that there will be a successful and smooth transition to the introduction of the euro on 1 January.  This event will be a milestone in the evolving process of European integration as well as strengthening our capacity for economic development.  The Council was able to take important decisions about the external representation of the euro-area in the international monetary system consistent with the major role which the euro will play after its launch in the new year.</P>
    <P>Discussion on economic policy co-operation highlighted the increasing importance being given to the efforts of the member states to expand employment opportunities in Europe.  The co-ordinated efforts already under way are showing encouraging results.  The review of the National Employment Action Plans for 1998 and the setting of the employment guidelines for 1999 mark a deepening and strengthening of economic policy co-operation in this vital area to ensure the success of EMU and to support sustainable jobcreating growth in Europe within the framework of the Growth and Stability Pact.  We welcomed the recognition that the social partners have an important responsibility in contributing to the overall strategy for employment, growth and stability.</P>
    <P>In the past year the global economy has suffered as a result of the economic setbacks in Asia, Japan, Russia and elsewhere.  The Vienna Council demonstrated that the member states share a common outlook on the appropriate response to the global financial crisis in terms of the key role that Europe should play and how the international system might be strengthened and reformed to enable it to respond more effectively to such problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The remainder of my statement is devoted to <Col N="1449" /> CFSP issues.  As the Vienna European Council took place immediately after the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it took the opportunity to highlight the primary importance it attaches to this seminal human rights document.  It noted, in particular, that the European Union is founded on the principles and values enshrined in the universal declaration &mdash; liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law &mdash; and that its actions are based on those values.</P>
    <P>The European Council also endorsed a solemn declaration of the European Union on human rights which was issued during a commemorative event held in Vienna on 10 December.  This declaration set out the Union's achievements to date in the field of human rights and it outlined how human rights might be strengthened, both internally and externally.  The Commission and member states will now examine how best to implement these proposals.</P>
    <P>The European Council availed of the current focus on human rights issues to stress the need to combat all forms of racism, both in the Union and in third countries, and it invited the Commission to draft proposals for its Cologne meeting for measures to counter racism in the candidate countries. Member states have also been invited to consider similar measures.  With the Treaty of Amsterdam expected to come into force in May or June of next year, considerable attention was paid to preparations for its implementation.  However, despite the fact that there had been the intention to appoint the new high representative for the common foreign and security policy at Vienna, it was clear that the time was not right for a decision.  Therefore, the European Council agreed that the high representative would be appointed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Four common strategies were agreed.  It was decided that Russia would be the first to be dealt with.  Hopefully, that will be taken at the Cologne Council.  I set out my views on security policy and they were reflected in the conclusions of the European Council.  Account was taken of the need to emphasise the Amsterdam Treaty and the Petersberg Tasks thereafter, and the special position of the neutral states in the Union.  We also raised the position of the &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has pre-empted me. I thought I had more time to respond to this debate.  I was making my formal statement.  I understand the constraints of the Chair but if I had sufficient time I would have dealt with the points raised, particularly by Deputies Gormley, De Rossa and others.  I do not have the time to <Col N="1450" /> deal with those points in the manner in which Deputy Bruton properly suggested.  I had intended doing as he wished but I cannot do so in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Middle East process was raised, as was Russia and the common strategies relating to four countries.  I will conclude by mentioning the situation in Iraq.  Since the European Council, there have been dramatic developments with the air strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom last night.  These followed the report of the UN team of inspectors, UNSCOM, to the effect that it had been unable to complete its work on the issue of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction because of obstruction by Iraqi authorities. We regret that it was not possible for UNSCOM to complete its work and we are disappointed that the use of force was deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>Iraq must comply fully with the decisions of the United Nations Security Council.  The Security Council has been meeting to discuss the issue and it is important that, following the air strikes, the emphasis should be placed on urgent efforts to resolve the crisis by peaceful means, avoiding the loss of innocent lives.</P>
      <P>Regardless of any dispute with the Iraqi Government, we would also like to see the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people properly addressed.  The use of force should be kept to the minimum in order to avoid further suffering for the Iraqi people and potentially destabilising consequences in the Middle East.  Time will be given for a discussion on Iraq later today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House would wish to join me in offering its warmest congratulations to John Hume and David Trimble on becoming Nobel laureates.  Throughout his political life, John Hume has devoted himself to the cause of peace and to the building of a new, inclusive society in Northern Ireland.  This award was a fitting tribute to his life's work.</P>
      <P>The First Minister, David Trimble, showed true leadership in the negotiations which achieved the British-Irish Agreement and has the onerous task, together with Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon, of leading the implementation of crucial aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate gives us an opportunity to discuss where the Agreement stands, to review achievements over the past year and to explore how we might get through our current difficulties. I would have wished to be able to report to the House that the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement is proceeding on schedule.  After the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement which so clearly embodies the will of the people North and South, I would have expected the Executive to be meeting at least in shadow form, likewise the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council to have held inaugural meetings in shadow form.  I would have <Col N="1451" /> expected more significant progress to have been made on the normalisation of security, including a clearer start to the process of decommissioning paramilitary weapons.</P>
    <P>In so far as it has been in our power, the two Governments have sought to fulfil their obligations. We have advanced legislation, bodies have been established or their establishment prepared, and the programme of prisoner releases has been implemented, notwithstanding some criticism from certain quarters in the British Parliament. Under this programme, the British Government has released 220 prisoners on licence, including 68 life prisoners, and has transferred almost all prisoners involved from British jails.  So far the Irish Government has released 12 prisoners since the enactment of the release of prisoners legislation.</P>
    <P>Many of the Northern parties have done their utmost and have been frustrated at the lack of progress beyond establishing the Assembly.  All parties need to show a strong commitment to fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement and not creating unnecessary difficulties for others.  It is highly undesirable to give any impression that a political vacuum is being allowed to develop or that any party will be allowed to hollow out or evade its obligations under the Agreement.  There must be credibility regarding the implementation process and that is what we have been seeking to secure since the roundtable meeting of 2 November in Belfast attended by myself and Deputies Andrews and O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed and concerned.  However, at another level, it is necessary to take a longer perspective in looking backwards and forward.  This time last year, we were in the disappointing situation of not having reached agreement on the agenda for the talks, and while the parties had detailed their positions, there had been no real engagement in a negotiating situation.  From that position we were able to come to the proposition documents &mdash; the various debates and the amended version of that document, then to the multi-party talks which led to 10 April where all of the parties to the negotiations were able to sign up to the Agreement.  On 22 May, the people of this island, North and South, endorsed that Agreement in overwhelming numbers.</P>
    <P>This time last year in Derry, we were in a situation where there was a very considerable amount of violence at the time of the Apprentice Boys' parade.  It is fair to say that, in the course of the past year, the Apprentice Boys and residents groups have made strenuous efforts to develop a better atmosphere.  While it was unfortunate that it was not possible to achieve agreement this year and that there was some violence last weekend, there is the prospect that we will have peaceful parades in Derry in the future.  The violence that occurs on these occasions is an expression of the tensions that surround the parades issue and <Col N="1452" /> underlines the need to continue to work to achieve accommodation in disputed situations.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if we continue to focus on what divides and polarises people in terms of the Agreement, it will be difficult to make progress in its implementation.  From the moment of the achievement of the Agreement, I have continuously emphasised that partnership, equality and mutual respect lie at the heart of the Agreement. To make the Agreement a reality we must make these concepts a reality.  The Irish Government, in fulfilling its commitments under the Agreement, has sought to do so in a spirit of partnership. We do not see our position on the North-South aspect of the Agreement as threatening and we have no intention of engaging in a onesided take-over of the areas involved.</P>
    <P>We have always said that this is a balanced Agreement.  The Agreement recognises the substantial differences between equally legitimate political aspirations.  We seek to accommodate these aspirations through meaningful institutions, while also believing that the practical benefits of these arrangements are clear.</P>
    <P>The North-South ministerial council will bring the Irish Government and those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland together in equality.  Council decisions will be by agreement, operating in accordance with the rules for democratic authority and accountability in force in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas, respectively.  In all its dealings on these matters, the Government has sought to be realistic and businesslike.  We want the relationship between North and South to be similarly disposed.  Were our current proposals in regard to implementation bodies to be published today, I would defy anybody to conclude that they were excessive or threatening.  They are eminently reasonable. However, there has to be a balance between the different strands of the Agreement.  Those who fail to recognise this and who seek to empty Strand Two of substance need to consider carefully the risks they are taking.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Northern Ireland Assembly, we would wish to see everyone involved in politics working to the same objective &mdash; the betterment of the people of Northern Ireland.  In the ordinary political landscape, diversity of view, even healthy partisanship, is to be welcomed.  The basis of political discourse is people with similar views coalescing and forming alliances to get things done.  It would be a very dull political environment if every party was of the same persuasion. However, it is very difficult to comprehend politics that has stagnation at its very heart. In any evolving situation, and the political situation in Northern Ireland has evolved radically in recent years, politics must move and shift with the changing times, and this change must be embraced.  As part of this, all political and sectarian violence must be in the past.  The Northern Ireland Assembly provides the opportunity for politicians from all of the parties to work on behalf of their constituents, for the people of <Col N="1453" /> Northern Ireland as a whole and to forge better relations on the island of Ireland and, through the British-Irish Council, between the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>In short, we want to get on with it because, at the end of the day, politics is not about making shapes on the tightrope, it is about delivering a service to the public.</P>
    <P>There are exciting opportunities to be grasped. Society on this part of the island of Ireland has changed in a particularly dramatic way in recent years.  We have achieved a level of prosperity that once we would scarcely have aspired to.  We look towards Europe in a spirit of partnership and equality, playing our own distinctive role on the European scene.  We are a more confident, outward-looking people now than possibly at any time in our history.  We value the peace that has resulted from the cessation of paramilitary violence and we want it to endure and to use the opportunity it provides for co-operation, greater economic activity and the development of relationships between the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, our negotiations on implementation bodies and areas for co-operation have centered mainly on the areas identified in the British-Irish Agreement.  I do not intend now to add substantively to what I have said earlier or to go into the details of our negotiating strategy, but I will say that a considerable amount of progress has been made; and that in so far as full agreement has not been reached, it is not because of lack of enthusiasm, homework or flexibility on the part of the Government.  It is disappointing that full agreement has not yet been reached, but work will continue and we will continue to try and achieve agreement at the earliest possible time.  In so far as we are concerned, this round of discussions began on 2 November. This last phase has been going non-stop in Belfast since Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, because of the numerous occasions when people were not available, we have been unable to conclude matters. I thank the party leaders, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Trimble and, in particular, Mr. Mallon with whom I have had endless discussions over the past three or four days.  Even last night when the British Prime Minister had other issues to deal with he still engaged in those discussions. For minor reasons matters are not yet concluded. I hope they will be but I cannot say with certainty.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many horizontal issues such as financial, legal and personnel issues on which a considerable amount of work has been done but which, until final agreement has been reached on the areas, cannot be brought to finality.  Many of the issues will have to be considered carefully with staff interests.  As has been said many times, in addition to the practical benefits that they bring, the North-South arrangements provide institutional expression to the identity that northern Nationalists share with people in the South.  The creation of any new institution brings change, indeed radical change, for those directly involved.  People's work practices, <Col N="1454" /> their reporting arrangements, sometimes their physical locations change, and these must all be considered carefully and in consultation.  We want to see these arrangements agreed quickly so that we can get on with the practical work early, so that we can realise the benefits they will bring.</P>
    <P>The coming months will see activity intensify in the legislative area.  In addition to the legislation necessary to implement Strand Two arrangements, the Government's legislative programme will include the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, equal status legislation and the amendment of the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Other legislative measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights may be decided on in the light of the provisions of the Agreement which requires us to consider the possible incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law and the implementation of the recommendations of the committee which will review the Offences Against the State Acts.  I acknowledge the helpful contributions by Opposition parties and party leaders throughout the year to this process and I would also like to acknowledge and thank them for their ongoing support for the difficult process which we are going through.</P>
    <P>This process is difficult, but since it began there have been many periods where it seemed stalled and where some began to lose faith.  However, it has survived.  At crucial times we have, all of us, been able to take the actions necessary to move on.  We have, on all sides, had to take actions that we did not necessarily want to take, and we know and acknowledge the pain and suffering caused to others by some of these.  All of the actions, and all of the risks, have been taken to consolidate peace and work towards a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.</P>
    <P>If there are some organisations who are contemplating the use of violence for political ends, they should recall very well the actions and the determination of the Government and all people in political life following the Omagh bombing.  I am frankly dismayed that there remains any organisation claiming to be republican that is contemplating any further acts of violence in clear defiance of the wishes of the whole Irish people. While they invoke Wolfe Tone's end, complete separation, they have entirely forgotten and ignored his means which was to unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenters under the common name of Irishman.  The Irish Government will act quite ruthlessly within the laws passed by the Oireachtas against any group that tries to restart the terrorist violence of the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to decommissioning. We believed, in concluding the British-Irish Agreement, that we had found a way to provide the conditions and the formula whereby political progress and decommissioning would, and could, take place sooner rather than later. Eight months on from the signing of the Agreement, it is disappointing that the issue could <Col N="1455" /> remain an obstacle.  If demilitarisation is the objective, no one can opt out of making a real contribution to it.  Everyone knows the situation, but I would return to what I said earlier.  All of the parties to the negotiations, all those who signed up to the Agreement, all those who continue to support the Agreement, must act in a spirit of partnership.  We must recognise that for all of us there are difficulties, that stalemate is the enemy of everyone.  The progress we have made, we have made together, bringing our supporters and the people with us.</P>
    <P>On 22 May the people of this island, North and South, gave us their support because they wanted accommodation.  We have a duty to the people to move forward together, to implement all of the Agreement, in the letter and in the spirit, and to build that lasting accommodation.  At all stages of the peace process, it was agreed that a normal civil society was the ultimate goal, and on the Nationalist and republican side that this would involve complete demilitarisation.  An armed peace is not demilitarisation.  If the Agreement and its institutions are to work, then their establishment must be accompanied by a tangible commitment to dismantling, on all sides, the structures and arsenals of conflict.</P>
    <P>I would like to have been able to say that the three central matters which we have been negotiating this week, the implementation bodies, the areas of co-operation and the make-up of the Executive in terms of numbers and portfolios, had been settled.  Substantial progress has been made but nothing can be finally agreed until every part of it is agreed.  For several days now minor matters have been holding the process up. Although one is tempted to do so, clearly it would not be helpful if I were to spell those out.</P>
    <P>Lastly, let me thank in particular Séamus Mallon, who is due to undergo quite a serious operation, on the advice of his medical advisers, which he postponed last weekend and again at the beginning of this week with a view to being in position to conclude these matters.  His doctors have ordered that the operation must take place first thing tomorrow morning, but he still remains at his desk until tea-time this evening to try to conclude these matters.  Although he has been in substantial pain, he has continued to work 18 or 19 hours a day for the past week.  We appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start my contribution by agreeing with what the Taoiseach has just said about the dedication of Séamus Mallon. He is quite right to take his doctor's advice and have the operation tomorrow.  I compliment him on the patriotic approach he has taken to this matter despite the acute personal pain he has been suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am optimistic that this phase of the peace process will be successfully traversed and that agreement will be reached on the number of Ministers and on the number and function of the implementation <Col N="1456" /> bodies.  It is right that the two issues are being dealt with together.  There might be temptation in some quarters to deal with one first and leave the other over until after Christmas.  The truth is that they inter-relate so much that they must be dealt with together.  It comes down basically to two issues &mdash; who will have the most Ministers and the number of ministries, which determines to some degree at least the balance in numbers between Nationalists and Unionists. There will be a different balance between Nationalists and Unionists if there are eight ministries than if there are ten under the d'Hondt proportionality system, the result being more favourable to the minority with ten ministries under the proportionality rule than it would be with eight.  This issue is understood by anyone who can count and has caused some problems.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation bodies, the issue is not whether to have them &mdash; everyone is agreed there should be at least six chosen from a list of 12 topics.  On the face of it, there is not too much difficulty in this regard.  However, the substance of these bodies is important.  Intensive discussions are continuing.  I believe an agreement will be reached.  I do not think it would be a good idea to settle the executive numbers and leave the implementation bodies aside.  The two should be dealt with together.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a difficulty with meeting next week.  Most people welcome Christmas, but from the perspective of completing negotiations, it could not be coming at a worse time, when agreement is within reach.  I have spoken to those involved in the negotiations in the past couple of days.  It is interesting, as someone who is not involved, to hear the different perspectives of each person and how the position changes daily. One day it is a disaster, people are walking away, going to other meetings and there is no communication. Twenty four hours later the same people say there is constructive engagement and it is almost as if one did not have the previous conversation.</P>
    <P>This is what happens in negotiations.  They are inherently stressful and those involved get matters out of focus because they are under stress. Sometimes they fail to see the big picture and see a move by someone on the other side in the worst possible light because they are under stress.  To some extent, they transpose their stress into an over lurid interpretation of the conduct of another party, which is doing the best it can from its point of view.  Sometimes being unavailable to take a call is a legitimate part of negotiations.  It gives people an opportunity to think or sweat it out.  We should not get too excited about these matters, which I do not think the Irish Government is doing.  It is pursuing these matters with a deliberate approach and is not being panicked, which I support.</P>
    <P>I think agreement will be reached today &mdash; I hope it will.  If it is not, it should be possible today to refine the issues to some net points which can be settled between now and Christmas, if necessary <Col N="1457" /> by other methods than face to face negotiations that involve everyone.  We should not despair if agreement is not reached.  There is no doubt these matters will be settled.  Today is a deadline, as one of the key participants will be going into hospital tomorrow.  It is an important day.  However, if agreement is not reached tonight, it is important people do not overreact.  I appeal to those who are distrustful and may feel let down not to react in that fashion tomorrow if my hopes and expectations are not fulfilled.  I am convinced that matters will be satisfactorily concluded. All the participants have gone so far and are in mid-stream.  They cannot go back.  It is important that everyone knows that in realistic political terms, none of them can go back to the other bank of the river &mdash; they must proceed to the opposing bank.</P>
    <P>Equally, we should not elevate success, today or whenever it happens, to a fantastic and historic breakthrough.  We have a penchant for hype about the peace process which leads from an excess of exuberance to a hangover later when we discover circumstances are not as good as we thought.  I punctured the hype on one occasion in the Dáil when I pointed out, at the time of President Clinton's visit, that there was a huge divergence between what the IRA was saying and what Sinn Féin was trying to convey.  What I said was felt to be unhelpful as I was spoiling the party atmosphere.  We subsequently saw that what I said about the IRA position was accurate and it has reiterated that position.  It does no harm to point out these matters so people realise there will be problems down the road.</P>
    <P>If we reach agreement on the implementation bodies and the executive today &mdash; which I think we will, and if we do not I will not complain &mdash; we should remember there are many other difficult issues to be dealt with.  Policing is a huge problem from the perspective of the Nationalist and Unionist communities.  One might ask what is in a word as regards &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; in the title of the Ulster constabulary &mdash; from a Nationalist point of view, absolutely nothing.  However, from the Unionist point of view it is of huge symbolic importance. The police is the implementation arm of a civil democracy.  If a symbol which people hold dear is removed, it is not an insignificant matter.  It should be understood that Unionists have genuine feelings about this.  They are not just creating pre-conditions for the sake of being difficult. The Unionist community has invested its sense of identity in the police.</P>
    <P>Equally, from the Nationalist point of view, there is a record of distrust of the police.  There is a sense of its composition being completely skewed.  This was contributed to by the systematic assassination of any Catholic who joined the police. We should recognise that the sectarian division of the RUC is in part created by the IRA who actively discouraged any Catholics from joining the force.  It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, there is no doubt there is a legacy of <Col N="1458" /> distrust, on justifiable grounds.  We should not get too excited as this issue has not been solved.</P>
    <P>The other issue which has not been solved is decommissioning.  Decommissioning has almost become a bad word.  Some of the media almost equate decommissioning with surrender or see it as a British imposition.  Decommissioning is common sense.  If one is committed to peace, one does not need guns.  Political parties do not need to be associated with people who have guns if they are entirely committed to peace &mdash; they are irrelevant.  It is not surrender to follow the logic of one's policy.  The policy of Sinn Féin is commitment to a peace process.  The logic of this policy is that it should cease its association with people who hold guns or that they should get rid of them. That is the logic of a peace process.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community argues that there are a great number of licensed guns in the hands of the Unionist community.  The Nationalist community feel they are potentially pointed at them. Why should there be so many licensed guns?  I would be happy to see this reviewed.  I am surprised that more pressure is not exerted to withdraw gun licences.  I do not see the need for that amount of licensed firearms in Northern Ireland. Equally, I do not see a need for the IRA to hold on to semtex.  Semtex is not a defensive weapon &mdash; it is purely an offensive weapon.</P>
    <P>John Hume's call on the IRA to make a gesture by decommissioning semtex is reasonable.  It is important to understand why the IRA or the UVF having arms in commission is detrimental to the normal participation of Sinn Féin and the Progressive Unionist Party in Government. Threats have to be made in coalitions sometimes &mdash; people have to say that unless one thing is done they will do another.  The consequences of one side failing to comply are purely political.  In other words, people will withdraw support, bring down the Government or vote against it.  For example, a political party in the Executive may say it wants £3 million for the promotion of Irish, not £1 million, and that if it does not get its way there will be grave consequences.  If this was said by a political party which had no association with guns, nobody would construe what was being said as meaning other than that the party was making a political threat to withdraw from the Executive. However, as long as the party is associated with a body which has guns, utterances that unless it gets its way on the budget for the Irish language &ldquo;there will be grave consequences&rdquo; will lead some people to think that the grave consequences may not be political but relate to the possible use of guns.</P>
    <P>It is important that this issue is understood in its political context.  Decommissioning is a political requirement.  It is not an act of surrender but an act of movement into politics.  We are not talking about a gesture of decommissioning, but the total disarmament of paramilitaries within the two year period.  I believe the IRA, the UVF and the UDA will decommission within two years. There are mixed sentiments within those organisations <Col N="1459" /> on the issue and I do not think a decision to decommission has yet been taken.  However, I believe it is inevitable that they have to do so, as the political gains they have made will not survive if they do not decide to decommission.  They are committed to decommissioning under the British-Irish Agreement within two years.  It is not a precondition but it must be carried out.  It is a condition subsequent which must be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government well in its work.  I am optimistic about what will be achieved.  I ask the people to remember the principle canon of good negotiation is not to think about the needs of oneself and one's community, but to begin by wondering what the feelings and fears of one's antagonists.  If this approach in taken in negotiations, be they political or otherwise, they are likely to succeed.  If one wonders about the attitudes of one's own supporters first, one will not succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a remarkable year for the people of the island.  What the late Professor John Whyte referred to as the intractable problem, namely, the relationship between the two traditions on the island, has been put in its proper historical context.  Quite considerable progress has been made this year between the two Governments and the political parties in the North.  The current difficulties which face the peace process do not detract from this basic fact. We should take confidence from the great progress we have made this year.</P>
      <P>The remaining obstacles to the full implementation of the British-Irish Agreement can be overcome. In this regard I share the optimism expressed by Deputy Bruton.  I say this because the momentum generated behind the peace process is too great to allow any turning back.  For the first time in my lifetime, the success and future of most political parties in Northern Ireland is intertwined.  They cannot succeed in their chosen strategies without the assistance and support of others.  There may be, as of yet, a reluctance among political parties to realise or appreciate this.  Such slowness is understandable. The rivalries and hostilities of generations do not disappear over night.</P>
      <P>When in Government my party appreciated the support of the Taoiseach in relation to Northern Ireland and in Opposition we have sought to reciprocate. Of course, we would try to pursue a bipartisan approach even if Fianna Fáil had not done so.  Bipartisanship is not a complete <i>carte blanche.</i>  We will continue to point out areas where we think progress is not being made or where it can be made more speedily.  We published our Human Rights Bill in this spirit.  It is one of our major contributions to the process to date.  Its importance is that we must all make clear that the new agreed Ireland must respect the rights of all and not seek the dominance of any group or section over another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated that the current difficulties facing the <Col N="1460" /> peace process should not detract from the achievements of this year.  They are resolvable. The mandate from the people of the island to politicians is absolutely clear and no theology or ideology from either side should stand in its way. There is a bottom line.  The British-Irish Agreement is a package which must be implemented in full.  It is often repeated but nonetheless true that there can be no cherry picking of the Agreement. It contains elements which are distasteful to both sides.  This is the essence of a compromise agreement between opposing sides.</P>
    <P>The current position seems best summarised by the saying that one side, the Ulster Unionists, are seeking to insert into the Agreement something which does not exist while Sinn Féin is seeking to suggest that a clause which is in the Agreement either does not exist, should not exist or can be minimised in importance.  The fact is simple &mdash; decommissioning is not a precondition under the Agreement for entry to the Executive.  Therefore, it cannot become one now.  However, this is not the end of the story.  The Agreement envisages a two year programme towards decommissioning but the people on the island want to see decommissioning commencing as soon as possible.  They want decommissioning to be an end in itself and an important step towards the demilitarising of Northern Ireland and the attainment of normal civic society.  There must be decommissioning of the military mindset as well as the destruction of arms.  In this context I support what Deputy Bruton said in relation to the apparently excessive number of gun licences in Northern Ireland which should in future be part of a review.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, I believe the people of Northern Ireland do not wish to see the issue of decommissioning elevated to the point where it can endanger the implementation of the Agreement. I have already stated on the record that I wish to see an immediate contribution from the IRA on this issue.  I try if possible to take an optimistic view of things, and for this reason I wish to read Mr. Trimble's recent speech as indicating that a gesture of intent and good will is all that is needed either at this time or in the near future. Such a gesture from the IRA would indicate the continued support of the republican movement for the process and acknowledge some of the gains, such as prisoner releases which must continue in any event.  These gains have accrued to the republican movement since the signing of the Agreement and a gesture or response would be positive in every sense.</P>
    <P>Such a gesture on the part of the republican movement cannot be viewed as an act of surrender. Rather it should be viewed as a recognition by the movement of the democratically expressed will of the Irish people.  It is ultimately a function of self-determination, and this has informed the ideology, if not the theology, of the so-called republican movement since 1919 and certainly since 1922, according to which the Irish people had never expressed their right to self-determination. This clearly must stand side by side with <Col N="1461" /> the referendum of 22 May 1998 when such a right was exercised and the results of which were loud and clear.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning would also mean a recognition by the republican movement of the genuine problems facing the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.  There are no longer any zero sum situations. A problem for David Trimble is simultaneously a problem for the republican leadership, while a problem for the republican leadership is also a problem for David Trimble. While a gesture of this kind would be highly desirable in advance of the formulation of the Executive and would be an act of considerable imagination and confidence on the part of the republican movement which would cost it absolutely nothing, I believe that even an indication of an intention to engage in this context shortly thereafter could provide the necessary momentum to drive us forward to the next stage of the process.</P>
    <P>I find considerable merit in the suggestion of the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, to whom I extend my good wishes as he approaches his medical operation, that Sinn Féin be permitted to enter the Executive on the strict understanding that failure to bring influence to bear on the IRA for decommissioning in compliance with its obligations under the Agreement would have implications for its continuing membership of the Executive.  It is the best formulation I have heard so far to ensure compliance with the terms and spirit of the Agreement.  It deserves a more considered response from the Ulster Unionist Party than it has received so far.  That party's position is incompatible with the terms of the Agreement and there is an obligation on it to move, notwithstanding internal difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is a view that the logjam on this issue has hardened opinions and hindered movement on other areas of the Agreement, so I welcome recent reports of progress in these areas.  I share the Taoiseach's view that one way to increase pressure on the parties to overcome the decommissioning hurdle is by making progress on other areas.  I was concerned at reports a number of weeks ago that the Government was adopting an ungenerous position with regard to North-South ministerial bodies.  My support for the merging of the two primary industrial agencies on the island is well known and I regret it does not look likely to happen at this stage, although I am satisfied the Government was prepared to suggest and implement it.  The importance of these bodies for Nationalists cannot be underestimated.  The question is not whether Nationalists view these bodies as a type of Trojan horse leading towards Irish unity, as some Unionists suspect, but rather whether the Unionist community can be sufficiently generous to Nationalist concerns and display its commitment to govern Northern Ireland in partnership with them, so that, notwithstanding their ultimate aspirations, Nationalists would be in a position for the first time since 1922 to give their loyalty to the new Administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> In relation to the Executive, it is Unionist commitment to partnership which Nationalists are seeking to secure.  I welcome the fact that it now appears the Executive will consist of 12 members, including the First and Deputy First Ministers. This is an important step to ensure full Nationalist inclusion.  It is to be hoped agreement can be reached soon on the assignment of portfolios. This is a crucial stage in the process.  Members of the Executive, regardless of party or tradition, will work closely together, not as opponents but as colleagues under the system selected.  Northern Ireland has been denied real politics for too long. Real politics involves the subtle tension between ideology on the one hand and compromise, conciliation and mutual interest on the other.  All essential components of a working democracy have been denied the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While my party remains committed to supporting the Government in its attempts to progress the peace process, we must be critical of the Government in one area.  There are issues where, to ensure implementation of the Agreement, agreement is needed between both Governments and the Northern parties.  However, there are other issues where the capacity for action lies solely within our hands.  For example, while no legislative action can be taken on the North-South Ministerial Council until there is an agreement between the Northern parties on the number and nature of those bodies, other legislative measures stipulated in the Agreement have not yet been enacted.  The human rights Bill, the equal status Bill and other measures have been promised but, six months after the Agreement was signed, none of these has been delivered.  It is now clear, and has been for some time, that the decision to abolish the Department of Equality and Law Reform is a critical factor.  The amount of legislation pending in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has reached ridiculous proportions.  There is legislative gridlock in the Department.</P>
    <P>The downgrading of the Department of Equality and Law Reform does not, however, reflect the Government's priorities on human rights and equality issues.  My understanding is that the Government's human rights Bill does not intend to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into law.  Neither has any progress been made on the framework convention on the protection of national minorities or on the commencement of the Employment Equality Act, which remains in deep freeze awaiting a commencement order some months after its enactment.  The lack of suitable premises has been put forward as the ridiculous excuse for not bringing it into force.</P>
    <P>The Government's record on human rights conventions has been lamentable.  Since coming to office.  It has not ratified any.  The Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998, has only just been published. The United Nations race discrimination convention remains unratified, while serious question <Col N="1463" /> marks hang over the Government's policy towards non-citizens, especially refugees and asylum seekers.  Even Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires no legislation in its implementation, has not been ratified and the ridiculous excuse has been offered that the Department of Foreign Affairs is examining the legal issues, even though the convention's obligations are already binding upon us through the UN covenant.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to end on a sour note.  I extend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State my sincere good wishes in the difficult tasks ahead in making the British-Irish Agreement work.  The Labour Party wants to be as supportive as possible of movement towards our common goal: an agreed Ireland which respects the rights of all and a new set of relationships within Northern Ireland, between the islands and between Dublin and London.  The British-Irish Agreement is in draft stage on a series of issues, such as the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Act, the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  The Labour Party has taken considerable pains to maintain that supportive and bipartisan position and, subject to the conditions I have outlined, that is the approach we intend to continue while I hold my present office as leader of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and other party leaders in congratulating John Hume and David Trimble on their being awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.  I also wish Séamus Mallon well in his operation and hope that he has a quick recovery.  He has played an enormously positive role throughout the process, often quietly and without much publicity.  Since he became Deputy First Minister, he has played a key role in ensuring the Agreement is progressed.</P>
      <P>The year 1998 will certainly be remembered for the historic British-Irish Agreement which offered the people of Northern Ireland new hope and optimism and the expectation that a way was being found to lead them out of the terrible sectarian strife and conflict which had blighted Northern Ireland and distorted politics in this State for more than 70 years.  Speaking at my party conference last Saturday, I expressed the opinion that the British-Irish Agreement had dwarfed all the petty squabbling which passed for politics in our State.  I described it as a thing of beauty crafted by ordinary politicians practising the art of politics at its best.  I pointed out the Agreement did not obliterate differences or dissolve Unionism or Nationalism but sought to accommodate them.  The British-Irish Agreement is not in itself the solution to the political problems of Northern Ireland.  It provides the framework or the scaffolding on which the politicians of Northern Ireland can build the edifice of a permanent, lasting political structure which will deliver a permanent and lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> It is disappointing that, in the seven months since the British-Irish Agreement was concluded, more progress has not been made in implementing its terms.  It is disappointing but not surprising given the depth of the problems and the extent of the bitterness and divisions within that area of the island.  Initially, encouraging progress was made in the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement.  There were the positive referendum results in both jurisdictions, the Assembly elections and the early and successful meeting of that body, the election of the First and Deputy First Ministers, the reduction in the level of troops, the closure of a number of military bases and checkpoints and the establishment of a commission on policing.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the process seems to have run up against a series of formidable obstacles.  There was great hope that, at the time of the visit of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair to Belfast last month, agreement would be reached on the issues of the number and nature of cross-Border bodies and ministerial positions but hopes were dashed amid further bitterness and recrimination. There have been conflicting reports in recent days about whether progress is being made and on the prospect of agreement on these issues prior to Christmas.  The message seems to change from optimism to pessimism and back again, sometimes in the same day.  I very much welcome the indications from the Taoiseach today that significant progress has been made.</P>
    <P>It does not serve any useful purpose to try to apportion blame for obstacles that have arisen but it seems a genuine opportunity for a breakthrough was missed on the occasion of the Blair visit last month.  Had agreement been reached on cross-Border bodies and the number of ministerial positions, it would have put enormous pressure on the paramilitary organisations to respond with some movement on the decommissioning issue.  Of the problems facing democratic politicians in Northern Ireland, questions such as the areas to be covered and the number of ministers rate fairly low on the scale of seriousness. If progress cannot be made rapidly on these issues it does not augur well for tackling the far more difficult problems such as policing and decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The search for a solution to many of the problems to which I referred earlier has been made much more difficult by the failure to make any progress on decommissioning.  If we are to overcome the logjam and move forward, flexibility on decommissioning is required on all sides.  Given what has been achieved so far and the potential that remains within the framework of the Agreement, it would be tragic if rigid and inflexible positions were allowed to prevent further progress.</P>
    <P>The paramilitary organisations have been among the principal beneficiaries of the Agreement. All but one of the republican prisoners have been repatriated from the UK to jails in Northern Ireland.  More than 200 paramilitary <Col N="1465" /> prisoners have been released from jail in Northern Ireland and many more will be out by Christmas.  Society has taken a great leap of faith and as a result prisoners who were convicted of what were often vile and vicious crimes are walking free.  It is time for the paramilitaries to repay that trust.  The very minimum required is a willingness on the part of the paramilitaries to address decommissioning in a much more forthright manner than has been the case to date.</P>
    <P>There is a need for Nationalist members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Sinn Féin members to acknowledge the political difficulties faced by David Trimble.  With the support of a bare 50 per cent of the Unionist members in the Assembly, Trimble's room for manoeuvre is severely limited.  Some <i>realpolitik</i> is required if the process is not to run into the sand once again.</P>
    <P>Arguments that decommissioning is unimportant because decommissioned weapons or explosives can be replaced are missing the point. Decommissioning is about building trust and demonstrating absolute commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means of pursuing political beliefs.  Without trust and an absolute commitment to democracy the process may well founder.</P>
    <P>The other festering sore that continues to poison the body politic in Northern Ireland is the Drumcree-Garvaghy Road dispute.  This reflects in microcosm the wider problems of entrenched bitterness and sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland.  It is disappointing that the talks this week brokered by the Prime Minister's office have again failed to find a solution.  Members of the Orange Order have camped at Drumcree since July.  Residents of the Garvaghy Road remain under a virtual state of siege and large numbers of the security forces are required to keep the protagonists apart.</P>
    <P>The situation threatens to deteriorate further this week when up to 10,000 members of the Orange Order are expected at Drumcree.  Surely the advent of Christmas offers an opportunity to find a way out of this problem without any side losing face and without any side being able to claim victory.  Even for non-believers Christmas is a special time and one which everyone associates with peace.  Even in those times over the past 30 years when violence was at its peak, the paramilitaries generally declared ceasefires for the Christmas period.  Even in the bloodiest and most senseless of conflicts &mdash; the First World War &mdash; the protagonists halted the conflict over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>If a solution is not found now it will inevitably drag on until July of next year.  I offer the following suggestion as a possible formula for a way out of the dispute.  A small number of members of the Orange Order, without bands, should be allowed to return to Portadown along the Garvaghy Road from a special service to be held in Drumcree Church on Christmas Day.  A Christmas Day service would be different and would have none of the political connotations of <Col N="1466" /> the Battle of the Somme service on which the July march is based.  Most people on the Garvaghy Road would, I am sure, spend Christmas day with their families and would be unlikely to be offended by a small group of people walking along the road in this way.  The Orange Order would have fulfilled the objective of marching down the Garvaghy Road before the end of 1998 and when it was all over everyone could go home and resume some sort of normality in their lives. I accept this formula would not be a permanent solution and that the dispute could erupt again next summer but it would provide some time and space for a more lasting solution to be brokered before next July.  Ultimately this formula would depend on the people of the Garvaghy Road showing charity and goodwill, something which is not easy to find in the highly charged atmosphere of Portadown, especially against the background of the disgraceful conduct of some members of the Orange Order and some loyalists in the period since July of last year.  Unless both sides want to continue with this stalemate and continue to inflict misery and pain on each other, a solution will have to be found.  Nobody should casually pass over the opportunity presented by the Christmas period to do this.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Comhaontas Glas as an deis chun labhairt sa dispóireacht tábhachtach seo.  I thank the Green Party for the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  I regard it as totally unacceptable that the statements on such an important and urgent matter have been so curtailed and that speaking time has been allocated in such an inequitable way.  On a related matter, not having had the opportunity this morning, in the context of this discussion I utterly deplore the US and British bombing of Iraq last night.</P>
      <P>I have to reflect to the Dáil today the deepening disappointment and disillusionment among growing sections of republican and Nationalist opinion that over eight months after the conclusion of the Agreement its central elements have yet to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago we progressed as far as agreement on the number and functions of departments and the number and functions of all-Ireland implementation bodies.  There was consensus among ourselves, the Irish Government, the British Government and the SDLP, on these matters two weeks ago.  Sinn Féin would like to go further but in the interests of the British-Irish Agreement we were and are prepared to support this accommodation.  The accommodation is still on the table and it is up to David Trimble today to take it up.  Two weeks ago, David Trimble led the British Prime Minister and Deputy First Minister designate Seamus Mallon to believe he was in agreement with the proposed structures.  Our negotiators were clear that this was not the case, that once Tony Blair left Stormont David Trimble would revert to his stalling strategy.  That is <Col N="1467" /> what Gerry Adams told Tony Blair and that is exactly what has happened.</P>
    <P>Up to today there has been no movement from the impasse reached two weeks ago when the Unionist Party reneged on the agreement then reached.  At that time John Taylor urged everyone to take a week's holiday.  The Unionists duly did so.  While newspapers were carrying stories yesterday about expected progress before Christmas, both David Trimble and John Taylor were absent from Stormont.  The reality which needs to be recognised is that the Unionists have been engaged in a strategy of delay and disruption designed to knock the stuffing out of the British-Irish Agreement.  They are deeply uncomfortable with its all-Ireland ethos and its commitment to equality.  They do not want to share power with the Nationalist community in the Six Counties, almost 50 per cent of whom are represented by Sinn Féin.  Look at the ungenerous and unstatesmanlike speech of David Trimble in Oslo last week.  Was ever a more party political speech made at a Nobel Peace Prize ceremony? The speech was an effort by David Trimble to use political philosophy to justify the political codacting and filibustering of the Unionists as they resist the implementation of the Agreement to which he was a party on Good Friday.  It bewildered his international audience and infuriated many people of disparate opinion in this country but its purpose was clear.  It was political cover for the stalling of the Unionists as they seek to undermine the equality and inclusiveness of the peace process and to hollow out the British-Irish Agreement nullifying its cross-Border aspects.  I hope some of the people on this side of the House take note of these points.  Week after week during questions to the Taoiseach, leading Members rise in their places and in addressing a narrow agenda they contribute to the myth that the barrier to progress is decommissioning.  That tune is sounding increasingly discordant.</P>
    <P>The guns on the streets in the six counties are those of the British Army and the RUC.  There are also an estimated 150,000 weapons, deemed to be legally held, which are predominantly in the hands of the Unionist section of the community. The entire British military infrastructure remains in place.</P>
    <P>As on previous occasions, I must refer to the situation in south Armagh.  There has been no abatement of the occupation endured by the people of that area.  On Saturday last, 12 December, electricity supplies were disrupted and roads blocked for hours when a British Army Lynx helicopter malfunctioned and crashed into overhead cables.  The scepticism of the people of south Armagh is understandable when one realises that they regard as routine the RUC's initial denial that this crash took place.  The RUC later admitted the truth.  I am sorry to say that scepticism in that area has been added to by the delay in the promised visit of the Minister for <Col N="1468" /> Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to south Armagh. The credibility of the South Armagh Farmers' and Residents' Committee, a key player in the promotion of the peace process, has been undermined because of this.  I urge the Minister to fulfil the undertaking given by him to representatives of the committee on 13 October when he said he would visit the area at their invitation to see the problem at first hand.</P>
    <P>The lesson of the negotiations on the British-Irish Agreement must again be applied.  It was the direct intervention of the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach which proved to be the key factor in delivering the Agreement.  Tony Blair has a particular role to play in encouraging First Minister designate, David Trimble, to remove his barrier to the implementation of the Agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish people.  It is imperative that we seek early consolidation. In that context, I conclude by stating that, from my perspective, today will not be too soon.</P>

      <P>In those circumstances, I will dispose of my script.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to allow Members to express their views on the report on Tallaght Hospital.  The report is important and it was provided to me on the basis of a situation which came to my notice in September involving a significant overrun in the operating costs of Tallaght Hospital.  It sets out that important governance and general management issues must be addressed.  Everyone should be aware that this issue casts no reflection on the level of patient care provided in the hospital.  The terms of reference for Deloitte &amp; Touche stipulated that its representative should deal only with governance and general management issues and report on service planning and the way in which the hospital's budget is being spent.</P>
      <P>An allocation of almost £54 million was given to Tallaght Hospital.  Comments have been made about the adequacy or otherwise of the funding and I must make it clear that the only process for funding hospitals in this country is the process of determination.  The report refers to the possibility of introducing another method of funding in respect of the opening of hospitals.  In this case that would not have been possible because the board did not appoint a director of finance until September 1997, despite the fact that it was originally intended to open the hospital on 1 January 1998.  However, the opening was subsequently postponed to 21 June 1998 on the recommendation of the management team to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the adequacy of the funding, the base funding contained finance for the three hospitals plus an additional £5.8 million to allow for the commissioning to take place.  The report refers to the complexity of that aspect of the matter, <Col N="1470" /> which, it must be emphasised, constitutes only 10 per cent of the total budget.  On that basis a figure of £5.9 million was provided which, as far as the Department was concerned, would be deemed adequate.  The hospital was also provided with £3.7 million in both 1996 and 1997 in preparation for the changeover.  A once off payment of £2 million was also provided for IR issues relating to the changeover.  Despite the fact that 76 fewer beds than were in operation in the three base hospitals were available when the hospital opened, finance for those 76 beds was included in the base funding.  In addition, of the 60 beds in a unit in the Meath Hospital which is funded by the Eastern Health Board and which provides stepdown facilities for St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals, 35 are red circled for Tallaght.  The benefit of that to the hospital will be over £4 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Adequate funding has been provided.  The report confirms that there is no justification for the board to suggest that the level of funding provided would allow for the sort of management and performance we have seen in the six months since the changeover.  People should hang their hats on such assertions because by doing so they are moving away from the core problem.  I made it clear to the board when I handed over the report that it is not a matter for hospital boards to determine the level of service and the Department to pay the cheques.  Under the accountability legislation health boards must deliver service plans within the allocations made by the Department.  It is clear from the report that planning in the hospital in question leaves much to be desired and that there is much room for improvement.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there has been a selective leaking of the report.  I categorically deny this.  I did not leak the report nor did I authorise that it be leaked.  I gave the board an opportunity to read it.  I issued a statement on the Wednesday night giving the minimum information. It stated that I had handed over the report, that there was a revenue overrun of £12.8 million gross and a capital overrun of £4.2 million gross, that there were serious governance and management issues to be resolved and that there could be no further development of services until the existing level of service was bedded down.  I reject the suggestion that I compounded the matter by replying to an Adjournment debate, which is an exercise in accountability, and that it was misleading.  I ask those who have an interest in the matter and who read the full report to make their own judgment as to whether what I said was balanced.  It was designed to give room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>I wish to resolve this matter.  The board should detail how it proposes to deal with the revenue overrun.  We could then proceed with the 1999 determination process.  It is critical that that issue is faced up to.  I am meeting the board this afternoon.</P>
    <Col N="1471" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter on which the Minister and I agree.  It is important to look to the future.  Tallaght Hospital should be placed on a sound financial basis so that patients have full confidence in it.</P>
      <P>Criticism of the manner in which the report has been dealt with by the Minister focuses not just on the fact that extensive extracts were leaked and appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> but that a departmental memorandum was leaked and appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> They could only have come from one source.  I did not receive a copy of the memorandum.  I assume no other Member did either.  The problem is that this undermined public confidence in the hospital.</P>
      <P>Having met the board the Minister should not have mentioned in the statement issued on the Wednesday night that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report indicates serious governance and general management problems in the hospital.  It was agreed that the board would have time to consider the content of the report, following which discussions would take place.  It should not have discovered on the night it commenced its deliberations that the Minister had launched an attack on it.  That was a breach of faith which is of concern to Members.  In criticising the governance and management of the hospital the Minister should look at his Department.  Members are entitled to know who leaked the departmental memorandum.</P>
      <P>It is important that the board and management tackle the serious problems in the hospital.  The management structure was suitable in facilitating the move of the three base hospitals to one site. Neither the board nor the Department, however, gave any consideration to whether it would be appropriate when the hospital opened.  Departmental officials, who have long experience of establishing new hospitals and extending existing ones, did not pursue that issue with the board with any vigour.  The focus was on moving the three base hospitals to one site.  When that was achieved the focus should have been on the appropriate management structure.</P>
      <P>The report states at page 26:</P>
      <P>In our view the decision to base the 1998 determination on the cost structure of the three base hospitals plus certain additional moneys was inappropriate.  We have concluded that the determination process does not lend itself well to a situation of major change such as the opening of a major new hospital unless supported by a fundamental review of the likely costs profile of the hospital.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the process used was not the appropriate one to determine the level of funding for the hospital for 1998 or 1999.  I suspected that this would be addressed in the report but the Minister was not prepared to admit it.  It was, therefore, a source of contention between us.</P>

    <P>The report refers, at page 58, to the importance of the hospital and the Department agreeing in principle a medium-term development plan and a <Col N="1472" /> service plan for 1999 within whatever determination is made.  It must be recognised that new methodology must be applied to determine what the 1998 determination should have been, by which one can determine the 1999 allocation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to the hospital to make up the shortfall.  There is already a waiting list of 1,200.  If the Minister fails to provide funding for a proper service plan, the number on the waiting list will increase and the hospital will not be able to provide for the community the services it was constructed to deliver.</P>

      <P>According to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, Tallaght Hospital, the most ambitious health care project in the history of the State, is &ldquo;in a financial crisis of the most serious kind.  .. In the absence of an injection of funds in the short-term the hospital will run out of funds&rdquo;.  This is not an impersonal business institution, it is a major hospital serving the needs of Tallaght and surrounding areas.  It provides life and death services. We must keep in mind the patients who depend on those services.</P>

      <P>The Minister has tried to avoid responsibility for his role in the crisis.  He attempted to keep the report under wraps and sought to lay the blame for the financial crisis on the board of the hospital, but people have seen through his stance.  The report does not absolve the Minister or the Department of responsibility for the crisis in the hospital.  For example, serious questions arise concerning the letter of determination sent to the board in December 1997.  This is the critical document which established the funding level of the day to day expenditure in the hospital this year.  The figure was set at £53.7 million. If the Minister did not have doubts about this figure in December 1997, alarm bells must surely have rung in his mind when, in March 1998, the board adopted a service plan for the hospital which established a £59.5 million cost for the day-to-day running of the hospital.  This service plan was submitted to the Department on 7 April, 1998.  What action did the Minister take when the board adopted this plan?  Did the Minister seek a meeting with the board or the chief executive of the hospital?  No letter issued from the Department rejecting the Tallaght Hospital service plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a critical stage in the financial crisis which now engulfs Tallaght Hospital.  It seems that this is the stage in the process when the Minister sought to distance himself from the project.  It appears from the Deloitte &amp; Touche report that a stand-off developed between the Department and the hospital board from this point.  The board was adamant that it would execute the service plan it <Col N="1473" /> had adopted while the Department maintained its stance of the original letter of determination and also maintained a certain silence.</P>
    <P>It now appears, from comments made by the Minister at the press conference on the publication of the report, that the huge difference regarding the funding requirements of the hospital belies an even greater difference of opinion as to how the hospital should have been established.  While the board was intent on establishing a state-of-the-art medical facility in Tallaght from day one, according to the comments made by the Minister, he had a conflicting view. The Minister was of the opinion that first, the key services provided by the three base hospitals should have been transferred to Tallaght and then, over a period of time, the services available at the hospital could have been expanded.  I find it hard to believe that no effort was made to reconcile the Minister's view and that of the board on this key issue.  This was a crucial failing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>No cognizance was taken of the fact that the hospital was to serve an entirely new catchment area.  Tallaght has a growing population, as Deputy Conor Lenihan will testify, with a new set of health needs and demands.  The view of the Minister and of his Department was that one could simply add up the cost of the three original hospitals and add a little extra.  There was no appreciation of the fact that this new modern hospital was to serve a new catchment area and that its needs could not have been based on the funding needs of the three original hospitals.  The Minister did not take a proactive role.  He did not seek to arrive at a resolution before the hospital opened.  The relationship between the board and the Department was strained from this point on.</P>
      <P>The report details the failings both of the hospital board and the management to control costs since the hospital began operations.  No one is attempting to hide this fact.  There are two factors in the current crisis.  One is the attitude taken by the Department and the flawed manner of agreeing the original allocation.  The other factor is the problems in the hospital itself.  The board failed to develop adequate management information systems to monitor its financial performance. Pay costs are well ahead of budget and overtime costs are a huge strain on the budget. The report reveals that a realistic staffing plan should have been instituted and followed closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind that we are presented with a completely new situation.  The letter of determination and procedure may work for existing hospitals.  It does not work for the establishment of a new hospital in its first year of operation in a new area and with new services planned.  The Minister must accept this.  There must also be an acceptance of the role the board has played to date in bringing together three separate <Col N="1474" /> institutions dealing with the organisational difficulties involved.  The Minister must sit down with the board and work out a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember that Tallaght Hospital is a story of success.  The construction of a new hospital to replace three existing hospitals has been a formidable logistical, administrative, professional and engineering feat which has required much skill and dedication. That has been acknowledged in the consultants' report which notes that patient care was not compromised in the transfer.  That, in itself, was a significant achievement.</P>
      <P>That achievement has its cost which is now putting Tallaght Hospital at risk.  The consultants' report has assessed the various problems and has clarified what needs to be done.  On the revenue side it is clear that there were shortcomings in the management approach to staffing.  The level of non-pay costs could not have been accurately predetermined and, in relation to capital costs, the report exonerates management of any dereliction of duty and makes it clear that the overrun was inevitable and that money had to be spent in order to open the hospital and rectify defects.</P>
      <P>The report points out deficiencies in relation to the letter of determination.  Expectations were raised by the approach adopted by the Department and the hospital board that more money would be forthcoming.  The report is comprehensive and provides a good overview of the difficulties, failings and the task ahead.  It looks at management weaknesses and provides a foundation for the future.  However, the question of how future funding is to be structured which has been raised by other Deputies must be addressed.  This is a unique situation which must have a unique response.</P>
      <P>The approach taken by the Minister when he handed over the report to the hospital board is regrettable.  The board understood that there was an agreed strategy between himself and the board for managing a response to the report.  The Minister did not adhere to that agreement but made a public statement and thereby damaged the board and his own reputation.</P>

I find recent reports from the board that a political game is being played out within the board very disturbing.  I ask the Minister to speak to his Fianna Fáil colleagues about their commitment to the future of the hospital and to ensuring that the issue is not further politicised.</P>

      <P>It is important to remember that <Col N="1475" /> problems existed in the three existing run-down hospitals and problems attached to providing a new quality hospital on a greenfield site.  These cumulative problems required extra funding.  I ask the Minister to remember the difficulties which accompanied the establishment of Beaumont Hospital.  Wards lay idle, bitter turf wars were fought among consultants which were finally decided by the courts and enormous costs ensued.  The Tallaght Hospital board learned valuable lessons from the problems which arose in Beaumont and no such problems attached to the transfer to Tallaght.  Thousands of professionals were brought into a new situation with no industrial relations problems.  That is greatly to the credit of the Tallaght Hospital board.  I urge the Minister to build a new relationship with the hospital board so that problems can be addressed.  It is feared that the Department is not happy with Tallaght Hospital and with its unique nature and ethos.</P>

      <P>The report does not identify the root causes of the problem.  The Minister may not agree with me when I say that while Tallaght needed a hospital it did not need this monster that is eating up money.  We have deprived my constituency of Dublin South-East, which includes the south inner city, of two hospitals, the Meath and the Adelaide.  There are no acute hospital services in my constituency despite the fact that there has been a demographic change, more families have moved into the area and there are more children.  People are being asked to use Tallaght Hospital.  The strategy in this area has changed in more progressive countries.  They are not promoting large hospitals, but medium-sized ones that serve smaller catchment areas.  We should also examine that.  This problem is the inevitable consequence of a decision that was taken many years ago before the Minister came to office.  When we saw the writing on the wall we should have taken a step back and said &ldquo;this is a bad decision.&rdquo; We will live to regret this in terms of cost long after the Minister ceases to be in office.  All Ministers will have to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard the single low rate of corporation tax as under threat for several reasons.  First, as the Deputy is undoubtedly aware, the German Ministers are now talking about tax co-ordination and not tax harmonisation.  Second, at the Vienna Summit, the agreed Conclusions were as follows and I quote:</P>
      <P>The European Council welcomes the report of the Council on reinforced tax policy co-operation and emphasises the need to combat harmful tax competition.  Co-operation in the tax policy area is not aiming at uniform tax rates and is not inconsistent with fair tax competition but is called for to reduce the continuing distortions in the single market, to prevent excessive losses of tax revenue or to get tax structures to develop in a more employment-friendly way.</P>
      <P>In particular, the European Council:</P>
      <P>welcomes the fact that the work of the Code of Conduct Group has proceeded satisfactorily and encourages the Group to conclude its work at the latest by the Helsinki European Council; asks the Commission to submit a study on company taxation to the Council in accordance with the ECOFIN Council conclusions;</P>
      <P>The European Council invites the Council to submit to it a second progress report on tax policy co-operation in time for the European Council in June 1999.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with Mr. Lafontaine in Bonn prior to the European Summit in Vienna I made a number of points: I stated that each country has a fundamental democratic right to decide on its own tax policy in accordance with the wishes of its electorate; as regards business taxation, I favoured the route proposed by Commissioner Monti, which was the Code of Conduct Group; our corporation tax system was transparent and although the rate was low it was levied on a very wide base.  In contrast, Mr. Lafontaine stated recently that Germany had the lowest effective tax rate in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise again that our proposed new standard rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent across the board is in line with the EU Code of Conduct and in accordance with the agreement <Col N="1477" /> on corporation tax reached with the EU Commission last July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister made those points to Mr. Lafontaine what was his view on our 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Lafontaine did not express any view on our 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate at the meeting I had with him in Bonn last week. He was reported in other fora as having made comments on Ireland's corporation tax regime, but he did not make any comments on it during last Wednesday's meeting in Bonn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention that the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate, which will come into force here following reductions on an instalment basis, will apply to the retail and agricultural sectors?  Is that in accordance with what he expects to be the central element of the code of conduct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not want to confuse the Code of Conduct Group and its review mechanism with the Irish agreement to set a single low rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent on 1 January 2003.  As I pointed out in my Budget Statement and on previous occasions, it is my intention to have a single low rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent for all businesses except on non-trading income.  I gave some outline in the Principal Features of the budget on the areas I consider could be regarded as non-trading income for inclusion in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The 12.5 per cent rate will apply to the retail and agricultural sectors because the outline I gave in the Principal Features of the budget indicated that sectors such as those will come under the 12.5 per cent regime and they are not in the non-trading income area to which the 25 per cent rate will apply.</P>

    <P>Note 1: Total Exchequer issues at end-November to cover departmental spending was £10,788 million.  This understated actual spending by about £300 million because below normal issues were made from the Exchequer to the Vote accounts.  This was due to temporary operational problems.  This technical issue will be regularised in establishing the end quarter statement on the Exchequer position, in accordance with normal practice.  The amount of about £300 million will then fall to be added to the total of £1,703.6 million for December shown in the table above in determining total Exchequer issues in that month.</P>
    <P>Note 2: The net reduction in Exchequer issues in respect of Agriculture reflects the receipt of £128 million in EU funds.  These are brought to account as appropriations-in-aid on the Vote and reduce the requirement from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Some discretion arises out of an interview given by Dr. Michael Somers, chief executive of the NTMA.  He and the Minister attended the Select Committee on Finance and Public Service yesterday evening when we had some opportunity to tease out the issues underlying the interview given by Dr. Somers.  I had an opportunity to check the Minister's statement overnight and I wish to ask him a question about it.  In reconciling the estimate of the national debt for the end of the year and the current estimate, the Minister indicated there was a deficit of £800 million in the first 11 days of December.  Yesterday evening he gave me a breakdown of those figures which suggest some £260 million of Central Fund expenditure was paid out during those 11 days.  Given that that is nearly 10 per cent of the total annual expenditure of the Central Fund, why is that figure so high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information with me.  I had information on the total amounts paid out of the Central Fund and I gave the Deputy that information at yesterday's committee meeting.  I cannot give a breakdown of the amounts paid out of the Central Fund, but considering that Central Fund annual expenditure is approximately £3.5 billion, I regard the amount of Central Fund expenditure for the first 11 days of this month mentioned by the Deputy as extraordinary. I can have that figure checked for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just less than 10 per cent of the Central Fund annual expenditure, which is extraordinary.

He appeared to indicate in his response that he has not decided on that yet.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the discrepancy between the estimate of the national debt given by the chief executive of the NTMA, and his Department; the plans, if any, he has to arrange a bilateral meeting between senior officials of the NTMA and his Department to eliminate this discrepancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28068/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue was the subject of discussion at a hearing of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service yesterday and I made a detailed statement to the committee outlining the correct position.  For the benefit of the House I will reiterate the main points of that statement in response to the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>In the first place, Dr. Michael Somers, chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, advised me that, despite some reports to the contrary, the agency did not give any forecast for the surplus for the full year, nor did he give any figures for the projected level of national debt at the year end.  A figure of £28.3 billion was given by the NTMA for the national debt, but this was the level as of 7 December 1998 and was not an end year forecast.  This figure was valid as of that date.</P>
      <P>The end year debt figure as estimated by my Department is approximately £29.6 billion.  This estimate reflects our current view of the likely Exchequer surplus for the year as a whole, as well as other factors which affect the level of debt such as the impact of exchange rate movements on the Irish pound value of the foreign currency debt and net discounts or premia arising on bonds issued during the year.  Accordingly, it should be clear to the House that there is no discrepancy between the NTMA's figure, which was for the debt as of 7 December 1998, and the Department's end of year estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that statements made by Dr. Somers have given rise to the perception that the forecast for the 1998 fiscal outturn, which I included in my budget of 2 December, might have been inaccurate to a substantial degree.  I assure the House this is not the case.  The estimate of a full year surplus of £668 million published at budget time remains largely valid, although information which became available too late for incorporation in the budget day figures suggests that tax revenue may be £75 million higher than forecast.  On the other hand, a recent review of the emerging expenditure <Col N="1481" /> outturn suggests that spending may be higher than the White Paper estimate by approximately £25 million.  Taking account of these two factors, my current estimate for the overall surplus is now above £700 million.</P>
    <P>Given that there was a surplus of £1.9 billion at the end of November, my full year forecast implies there will be a deficit of £1.2 billion for the month of December.  I advise Members that there was an overall deficit of almost £800 million in the period from 1 to 11 December.  Thus, a deficit of £430 million for the remaining days of the year is forecast.  Considering that the comparable figure for last year was a deficit of almost £370 million, it can be seen that this forecast is not unusual.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>My Department's estimates of supply services spending during the course of the year and the forecast outturn are based on information supplied to the Department of Finance by Departments as part of a well established monitoring system.  Before the White Paper figures for the expected 1998 outturn were published, my Department checked with all Departments, as a normal element of this process, that the figures were the most reliable projections of the outturn that could then be made.  These figures have now been updated and, apart from a shift of £25 million already mentioned, they remain largely as at budget time.</P>
    <P>I emphasise four critical points.  As I have already indicated and as Dr. Somers has confirmed, there is no discrepancy between my Department's national debt figures and those of the NTMA.  Forecasts of the outturn for all spending and for all revenues are always made on the basis of the most up-to-date assessments possible.  Updating is constantly under way.  As Members will have noted, the anticipated outturn for supply service spending made in conjunction with the publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume on 11 November was updated in the interim between then and the White Paper.  I am confident the outturn for the Exchequer surplus will be above £700 million when the final figures are published on 5 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 January, when we enter the euro, much of the debt denominated in deutschmark, guilder or French francs will be exchange risk free.  Is it the intention to transfer it to the domestic borrowing side of the balance sheet?  Could the Minister indicate what proportion of the debt will be represented by euro currency debt which will be exchange risk free from 1 January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>All loans held in deutschmark, French francs or any of the 11 euro currencies will be reclassified as domestic debt rather than foreign debt.  The figure given for the national debt at 31 December will be in the old format.  I cannot tell the Deputy the percentage but it will <Col N="1482" /> be easy to ascertain on 1 January.  The bulk of Irish debt at that time will be classified as domestic debt because all loans will become domestic debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this result in a big decrease in the activity of the NTMA?  Has the Minister considered an extended role for the NTMA in other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have put his finger on an issue which is on the minds of people in the NTMA and elsewhere and which may have formed the background for recent utterances. The NTMA has done a successful job since its inception some years ago.  There will be less activity in the trading of debt from 1 January on account of the new structures.  There must be good management of the national debt.  The NTMA has various proposals on how to maximise savings to the State as a result of trading in debt and these matters are being considered.</P>
      <P>I have heard the activities of some of the bond houses in Dublin over recent months have not been great and that some people who engaged in these activities have moved to other fields.  There should be less activity, but there is still a clear necessity for an agency such as the NTMA because it has garnered expertise in this area and has done an excellent job.  It will fulfil a useful function for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Dr. Somers outlined to the committee meeting yesterday and in various interviews, there will be increasing activity in Irish bonds.  He has made contacts and changes to ensure there will be a good market in this area. I am confident he will succeed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently had discussions with Mr. Oscar Lafontaine, the German Finance Minister, on a number of issues, including tax matters.  The question of the IFSC being used by German finance companies for tax evasion purposes was not discussed as it does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the Taoiseach's special adviser, Dr. Martin Mansergh, had discussions recently with German bankers on this issue?  Was the Minister briefed on <Col N="1483" /> the conclusions of those discussions and will policy decisions be taken arising from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The article in one of the national newspapers was based on a memorandum which was prepared by German bankers based in the International Financial Services Centre. In it they outlined their concerns about the uncertainty created by German controlled foreign company tax legislation in relation to the activities of German banks in the IFSC and also their views on our corporate tax regime.  That memorandum was sent by the German bankers to Dr. Martin Mansergh who forwarded it to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
      <P>I reject any implication that the IFSC is a tax haven.  It is not a tax haven under any guise, but an International Financial Services Centre and is recognised as such.  It is properly legislated for and controlled.  There are no brassplate operations there.  Tax havens are places where there is no regulation and there are brassplate operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on that point.  Can he confirm there is a mechanism in German tax law whereby tax on earnings of a subsidiary can be recovered from the parent company in Germany if the corporate rate of tax which applies to the subsidiary is below 30 per cent?  What are the implications for that trigger mechanism arising from the Minister's decision to reduce corporate tax to 28 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that there is a trigger mechanism in German tax legislation. If the Irish tax rate goes below 30 per cent, which is the trigger mechanism rate, it should not have any major impact because German tax legislation incorporates a provision which exempts income of substantive projects.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will defer the imposition of the new rates of vehicle registration tax to April 1999; if he will extend the lower rate of vehicle registration tax to cars under 1.6 litres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the House approved a resolution on budget night to implement new rates of vehicle registration tax for certain cars with effect from 1 January 1999. Therefore, cars registered with effect from that date will be subject to the revised rates if above 1,400cc.  I have no plans to introduce an amendment to the resolution in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall package of measures announced in my budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax, will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including the motor industry which has been experiencing considerable growth in car sales.  VRT figures for 1998 to date show that 57 per cent of new car sales are <Col N="1484" /> in the up to 1,400cc bracket.  These sales are not affected by the budget announcement.  A further 39 per cent of new car sales are in the 1,401 to 2,000cc bracket.  These face a price rise of 3.3 per cent.  Only 4 per cent are in the 2001 plus cc bracket which face a price rise up to 10.7 per cent. Most manufacturers have models of 1,400cc, the exception being manufacturers of luxury and sports car marques.  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the vehicle registration tax, that the average increase in VRT in respect of 1,600 cc motor cars is in the region of £468 which, given the lower rates of interest for borrowers, could not be deemed excessive in the context of the overall price of a new motor car.</P>
    <P>Delaying the coming into effect of the rate changes to 1 April 1999 and increasing the threshold from 1,400 ccs to 1,600 ccs, as suggested by the Deputy, would yield £18.7 million to the Exchequer, that is a net reduction of £24.3 million in the figure of £43 million announced in my Budget Statement which was to be financed by the VRT package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of today's statement by the SIMI and its personal representation to the Taoiseach, would the Minister consider a deferral until the end of January?  Would the Minister agree that many consumers had entered into contracts to buy new motor cars before the budget? These people rightly feel that they have been conned by this increase in the budget.  Because of the contracts into which they have entered, would the Minister at least consider a deferral until the end of January?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister reconcile this increase in VRT with European tax harmonisation? As the Minister will be aware, the average European spends 25 per cent less on a motor car than his or her Irish counterpart.  If the Minister wants cross-Community tax harmonisation, how can he justify this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is not the only country to have a tax on vehicle registration.  Although the base for charging tax in the eight other EU countries which have a registration tax varies, the highest rates are applied in Denmark, Finland, Greece and Portugal.  It is true to say that Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the UK do not have a registration tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined in my budget speech the reasons for increasing VRT.  It was a reasonable imposition on a sector which has been doing extraordinarily well in recent years.  I pointed out in my reply today, and in reply to written parliamentary questions <Col N="1485" /> last week and this week, that 57 per cent of cars will not be affected; 39 per cent of cars will be slightly affected; and only 4 per cent will be affected by the higher increase of 10.7 per cent. As I further pointed out in my reply, the average increase for a car in the middle bracket will be £468, which in the context of lower rates of interest for borrowers, is not an unreasonable imposition.  I do not take on board much of the bleatings from some sectors of the motor industry, and neither does anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Taoiseach or any other Minister, no matter when he or she would address any particular group, would not indicate that there would be a tax increase in any area.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 23, 28 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 17 November on an application for the reclassification of Ireland's single NUTS II region status into two NUTS II regions: one comprising the Border, midlands and the west, including counties Kerry and Clare; and the other comprising the rest of the country.  This application has now been lodged with EUROSTAT. The proposed inclusion of counties Clare and Kerry in one region means that the total west coast from counties Donegal to Kerry is now encompassed.  This provides a plausible, integrated and realistic view of a peripheral area of the Community, in good balance with the overall Community picture.  It is also fully consistent with the Commission's declared overall objective of greater concentration in the delivery of regional assistance.</P>
      <P>My Department produced a number of papers on this issue for inter-departmental consideration and for consideration by the Ministers and Secretaries-General group on EU policy.  It also drafted in the normal way a memorandum for Government along with accompanying aidemémoires on foot of which the decision of 17 November last was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> In regard to poor areas outside of the proposed Objective One region, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Government's commitment in its press release on the regionalisation proposal that the proposal will not in any sense deflect the Government from its commitment to tackle social exclusion, urban or rural.  Furthermore, Ireland, supported by some other member states, is pressing for the retention of the URBAN Community initiative.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department and the Central Statistics Office have met EUROSTAT to discuss the proposal.  Contact is continuing and I do not propose to speculate on the outcome of the application or on what course the Government might pursue in the event of a negative response.</P>
    <P>I have no specific plans at present to meet Commissioner Wulf-Mathies but I have no doubt that such a meeting, if necessary, could be arranged at short notice.  Officials of my Department are in regular contact with officials of DG XVI, for which Commissioner Wulf-Mathies is responsible.</P>
    <P>If the proposal to split the country into two NUTS II regions is approved by EUROSTAT, those parts of counties Clare and Kerry adjacent to the Shannon Estuary would be in the region which should qualify for Objective One status and therefore for the most favourable regime with regard to state aid for industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I protest at the Minister taking all of these questions together because they deal with distinct aspects of this issue.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to allow some latitude in that regard in the pursuing of supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>Question No. 6 asks the Minister about the papers, studies and documents on which the Government's decision was based.  There is, as the Minister will be aware, a widespread belief that the decision to constitute a new unprecedented region has more to do with the configuration of the Dáil than the configuration of disadvantage around the country.  The Government has been defending that on the grounds that the decision was made on its merits.  If it was made on its merits, then let us see what were the merits. Will the Minister make available the various papers, in particular, the papers which were produced on 24 April, 11 June, 21 July, 18 September and 25 September last?  Will he make those papers available so that Members and the public can objectively assess the basis on which this remarkable decision was made?  If the decision was made on its merits, surely there are no grounds for the Minister to withhold the background papers and documents on which the Government made its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Withholding the documents and reports had nothing to do with Kerry or Clare.  The refusal is permitted by the Freedom <Col N="1488" /> of Information Act in the context of ongoing negotiations.  When we conclude negotiations on sub-regionalisation with the European Commission, a request for the release of these documents under the Freedom of Information Act will be granted.  I assure Deputies they will not be able to find that any political considerations entered into the decision.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out that this matter was considered by the Government early this summer on foot of a Department of Finance report on regionalisation.  The Department was asked by the Ministers and Secretaries group, which meets regularly to discuss European matters, to prepare proposals on the sub-regionalisation options.  The possibility of including Kerry and Clare was contained in that document.  It was not until late autumn and winter that representations or speeches mentioned the inclusion of Kerry and Clare.  That will be shown when it is possible to release these documents when the negotiations are concluded with the Commission.  I give that assurance to Deputy Gilmore as I did to members of my party some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>A September edition of one of the business magazines referred to the matters to which I have referred and to the inclusion of Kerry and Clare. That was long before there was any political controversy about their inclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of the Minister's narrative about what was included or when it was included, it would be preferable if he simply produced the documents.  This is a matter of major public policy &mdash; whether the country should be divided into two regions and the basis on which the Government arrived at its decision.  It is in the public interest that this information is placed in the public domain.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should ask a question as this is Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be deliberately withholding this information rather than placing it in the public domain.  Question No. 7 concerns initiatives to be taken to deal with disadvantage in the areas outside the new Objective One region.  The Minister gave a fleeting reply to this question.  Can he assure the House that the various projects and schemes in existence under the URBAN and other EU-funded programmes will be continued through the period 2000 to 2006?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the first part of the Deputy's question.  The reason for withholding this information relates to the fact that such a measure could undermine our negotiating position.  That is the proviso included in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just about including <Col N="1489" /> Kerry and Clare, which only comprise a small part of the Government's consideration.  There are other matters relating to overall strategy and how we are to pursue all of these issues in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Then take out the paragraphs on strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was part of the Government which introduced the Freedom of Information Act.  He specifically included that proviso in the Act for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not stop the Minister releasing the documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be the first to criticise the Government if we lost out in Europe by releasing such documents during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>As regards the Community initiatives to combat social and urban exclusion, I have already stated that the Government will not be deflected from its commitment to tackle urban and rural social exclusion.  Supported by other member states, Ireland is pressing for the retention of the URBAN Community initiative.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about the continuation of projects and schemes currently being funded. When the negotiations on Agenda 2000 are concluded and we know what the next tranche of funds will be, the Government will do as it has done in the past.  A national plan will be prepared and submitted to Europe.  The plan will include a wide range of activities which the Government will pursue over the next tranche of funding.  All matters will be reviewed at that time, including all projects and schemes, taking into account Exchequer, EU and private sector contributions. This was the case with the previous plan.</P>
      <P>Although we have had substantial European funding for many years, we still have social deprivation. European funds represent only a tiny fraction of total Government spending in this area. The Government is committed to tackling all problems of social exclusion, irrespective of the outcome of the EU funding negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether EUROSTAT has sought clarification on the Government's submission?  Will he confirm that some reservations have been expressed, particularly by the Commission, regarding the composition of the proposed region?  Will he also confirm once and for all that Deputy Healy-Rae had no influence on the proposal which went to Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government made its proposals, there have been meetings between the Department, the CSO and EUROSTAT to discuss the Irish proposals.  These negotiations are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment on them.  I anticipate that they will continue into the early months of 1999.  I have said inside <Col N="1490" /> and outside the House, that the inclusion of Kerry and Clare in the new Objective One region was first raised in the documentation prepared by the Department of Finance on foot of a request by the Ministers and Secretaries-General group. It was discussed by that group in early summer, long before there was any political controversy about including Kerry and Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be interested or shocked to hear that the same rules of secrecy do not apply to EUROSTAT as appear to apply in Merrion Street.  EUROSTAT is happy to tell anyone of the status of the Irish application.</P>
      <P>Have the consultants advising the Department on the national plan been asked to consider the implications of regionalisation?  Have they been given terms of reference which invite them to submit different plans for different regions?  What is regionalisation all about?  Are we talking about different schemes which might apply to different problems in the two regions or are we simply talking about different funding mechanisms?</P>
      <P>To take the example of the ESF, is it conceivable that programmes in an institute of technology in the Objective One region will be funded by the ESF and a similar project in an institute of technology in the non-Objective One region not funded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of the national plan has been ongoing for some time.  It is, as its name suggests, a national plan.  The decision on sub-regionalising the country was made by the Government only a short time ago.  I answered many questions from Deputy McDowell and other Deputies in this House on why the Government decided sub-regionalisation was the best option for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not part of the terms of reference of the consultants drawing up the national plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no briefing at present regarding the terms of reference of the consultants, but the question of sub-regionalisation was decided by the Government only some weeks ago whereas the preparation of the national plan has been ongoing for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might check and let me know whether it is included as part of the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the inclusion of County Clare in this submission, will the Minister ensure that in the negotiations that are to take place account will be taken of the very big fall in the population of west, north and parts of east Clare, in areas like Kilrush, Ennistymon, Scariff and so on where the number of people leaving agriculture has accelerated and the population is ageing at a significantly faster rate than in the rest of Ireland and where, in some district electoral divisions, the percentage of elderly people is 30 <Col N="1491" /> per cent to 40 per cent above the national average? Will the Minister ensure also that account will be taken of the Shannon Estuary which links Kerry, Clare and Limerick and which is probably one of the least developed national harbours in the European Union?  In making the case for regional funds 20 years ago, the Shannon Estuary was put forward as the ideal location for largescale investment to ensure the creation of employment there.  Will the Minister ensure account is taken of the very high unemployment rates in towns like Ennistymon, Scariff and Kilrush in the detailed negotiations on these matters which are of enormous importance to the area and to the survival of the population in an area where the existence of local schools is threatened and post offices are being closed?  There is an urgent need for significant Structural Funding to be invested to ensure the population is not wiped out in this unique county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was possible to include counties Clare and Kerry in the proposed new Objective One region because of the matters to which Deputy Daly referred.  Not all parts of County Clare are as wealthy as the eastern part of Clare near Limerick.  When the totality of the figures was arrived at, the factors mentioned by Deputy Daly kept down the overall wealth of that region. Regarding his question about the area adjacent to the Shannon Estuary, if the proposal to split the country into two regions is approved by EUROSTAT, those parts of counties Clare and Kerry adjacent to the Shannon Estuary would be in the region which would qualify for Objective One status.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where there is very serious disadvantage.  Since the Minister could not give me an assurance earlier that the various schemes and projects which are under way in those areas to tackle poverty and disadvantage will be continued, how many of those schemes and projects <Col N="1492" /> will be discontinued as a result of the Government's decision to divide the country and create a spurious poorer half and a richer half?  How many disadvantaged areas will find themselves with schemes and projects to tackle poverty discontinued as a result of the Tarbert Ferry scheme of regionalisation?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the amount of income tax refunded under section 823 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for each of the tax years ending April 1995 to 1997; the number of people that availed of the refund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 823 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 154 of the Finance Act, 1994, provides relief by way of a deduction against earnings in the case of certain Irish resident employees who work overseas during a tax year.  The relief is known as the foreign earnings deduction, and was introduced with effect from the tax year 1994-95.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy on the extent of the use of this relief to be provided.  Such information could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.  If the Deputy has any particular issue or concern regarding the operation of the relief and lets me know of this, I would be happy to have my Department contact him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Would he not agree it is most unusual that in regard to a section in the Finance Act, of which not too many people avail, it is not possible to get the figures?  Is there no budgetary projection in this year's budget to take account of moneys that might be refunded under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible, but only at disproportionate cost.  If I explain how this relief operates, the Deputy will understand why. The computer records show gross incomes for classes of taxpayers.  This relief depends on the number of days a person works abroad.  A proportion is deducted from the person's income and he or she is taxed on the balance.  For example, if a person's income is £30,000 and he or she spends two-thirds of the year abroad and qualifies for relief, only £10,000 of the income would be taxed. Gross income, therefore, would be shown as £10,000.  At the end of the year the person would apply for relief and the Inspector of Taxes would recompute the tax liability on a gross income of £30,000, less foreign earnings relief of £20,000, giving a net amount of £10,000.  The person is taxed on that basis and gets a refund of tax.  The Revenue Commissioners would have to rejig their accounts at a disproportionate cost to show this.  That is the reason the figures are not available. That is why it is not done.  When computerisation improves it will be possible to get further information.  It would not be cost effective to calculate the figures required by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware from previous questions on this issue that detailed discussions have been ongoing for some time, involving my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners, with a view to bringing forward proposals to address problems arising from the use of Irish registered non-resident companies.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech, I indicated that a package of measures to deal effectively with the problem was close to finalisation.  This package will now be submitted to the Government very shortly so that it can be announced with the publication of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>The use of this country by Irish registered non-resident companies for money laundering, depositing proceeds of fraud and tax evasion abroad has been given a great deal of consideration in the past year.

      <P>I do not have that information nor is it possible for me to provide it.  As I said in previous replies to parliamentary questions and on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, it is not possible to even make an estimate.  I said on Committee Stage that the figure of 40,000 Irish registered non-resident companies was reproduced in an Irish newspaper.  Through research in my Department, we discovered it was based on an article in a British tax journal, which I outlined to the committee.  The same article had been featured in another tax journal some months earlier. In the absence of any contradiction from the Irish newspaper, I assume it took the figure of 40,000 from that article.  I read out the details of the article, which did not give a basis for the figure. There is no basis for the figure.  It may be a great deal less or a great deal more.  We do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper article to which the Deputy refers points to the shortage of office space in the IFSC and in Dublin, generally, and makes the point that there will likely be a continuing high demand for office accommodation in the city.  The supply of office space for IFSC companies has historically lagged behind the numbers of projects approved for the centre.  Buildings were simply not available for occupation at the time the centre was established and it was necessary to allow companies to trade outside the Custom House docks area until suitable space became available.</P>
      <P>What has happened since is that the original Custom House docks area site which houses the IFSC is now almost completely developed from the point of view of office accommodation. Almost all of the 1.2 million square feet of office accommodation there is occupied, in the main by IFSC companies.  I understand that some 30,000 square feet of new additional office space will come on stream there next year and some 600,000 square feet of office accommodation is currently under development in the extended 12 acre site adjacent to the original docks area.  While the bulk of this office space has already been committed to, there is at least 55,000 square feet which will be available for letting.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the success of the IFSC has facilitated this physical development and helped to rejuvenate the north inner city area of Dublin in the way that it has.  I am satisfied that the continued development of economic activity at the IFSC is not being inhibited by office space considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the report of the international advisory group on the IFSC which he, as the then Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, established and which was published last year.  Among its recommendations, the report suggested that IFSC companies be permitted to locate within the newly defined greater Dublin docklands area as opposed to being required to locate in the Custom House docks area.  This is one of the issues currently being examined by the IFSC clearing house group <Col N="1496" /> which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and which has been requested by the Taoiseach to prepare a strategy for the long-term development of the international financial services industry here, building on the success of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>In this context, and given that the preferential IFSC tax regime will be phasing out in the coming years with the IFSC becoming part of the general economy, there may not be a longer term need for a specific or limited IFSC location.  I look forward to the report of the clearing house group in this matter.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority that the authority is in the process of preparing a planning scheme and action area plan to facilitate further commercial development, including office accommodation, in the greater Dublin docklands area.  This will facilitate the supply of additional office space in the city.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to share time with Deputies John Bruton, Quinn, Rabbitte, Gormley and Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>In 25 years of public life I have never experienced such outrage among taxpayers.  Their outrage is matched only by their cynicism &mdash; that the system has failed them, that it does not work in a fair and just manner, that there is one law for ordinary taxpayers and another for the well heeled and influential and that, in the memorable words of Mrs. Helmsley, &ldquo;taxes are for little people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has accurately measured the mood of the nation today in allowing this motion and I thank him for it.  GUBU is back in town in all its former ignominy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judge McCracken in his report said he &ldquo;became satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that all of the moneys paid by Mr. Ben Dunne were received by or on behalf of Mr. Charles Haughey for his benefit or, in one case, for the <Col N="1498" /> benefit of a member of his family.&rdquo; Anybody who has even scanned the McCracken Report should not be surprised at this conclusion as Mr. Ben Dunne had in sworn evidence said he gave £1.5 million to Mr. Haughey, and Mr. Haughey in his last appearance before the tribunal admitted this was so, that he had received the money and that it was for his personal benefit.</P>
    <P>Members of the House are well aware that &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; is a legal phrase which describes the highest level of proof required in a criminal court.  A judge or jury must find &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; before they can convict.  In simple terms they must be certain. There is no higher level of proof.  Judge McCracken was certain that Mr. Dunne was the donor and that Mr. Haughey was the beneficiary. Both are quite clearly domiciled in Ireland and it defies reason that a Revenue appeals commissioner struck down an assessment by the Revenue Commissioners made against Mr. Haughey on the grounds that the evidence of the McCracken Report was an insufficient base on which to move to collect outstanding capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>Much of the work of this House, I believe, will be set at nought as a result of this decision.  We have had scandals, controversies, parliamentary debates, motions, rows about terms of reference, the establishment of tribunal after tribunal, evidence and legal arguments before tribunals, reports of tribunals and findings of tribunals, and when the taxpayer had hoped payback time had finally come and that outstanding tax would be collected from those who had evaded it, the very ground on which the Revenue Commissioners were standing has been taken out from under them.</P>
    <P>Currently there are two tribunals of inquiry sitting. The tax evasion issue is a central issue for both, particularly the Moriarty tribunal.  If the findings of these tribunals cannot be relied on as a basis for collecting tax which has been evaded, then the effectiveness of the tribunal process is substantially diminished and the intent of this House is set aside.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Act, 1998, the Oireachtas made provision that rulings of Revenue Appeal Commissioners could be published at the discretion of the Appeal Commissioners.  It is vital in this case that Mr. Kelly's ruling and the arguments which led to his conclusions are published without delay.  Until this happens we will not know what the policy implications of this decision are or what amending legislation the Minister for Finance may have to bring forward.  I invite all Members of the House to join with me in calling for the immediate publication of Mr. Kelly's ruling.</P>
    <P>One of the most astounding aspects of this debacle has been the fact that the Appeal Commissioner who made the decision is the brother-in-law of the Taoiseach.  The brother-in-law of the present Fianna Fáil Taoiseach judged the case of a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach.  I am not questioning <Col N="1499" /> Mr. Kelly's probity, but I believe it was extraordinarily imprudent of him not to have disqualified himself from hearing this case.  There is a provision in section 856 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which disqualifies a commissioner in cases of personal interest.  A commissioner is debarred from involving himself or herself in any income tax appeal, proceedings or matter in which he or she has an interest either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another person.  Mr. Kelly did not in my view have an interest under the terms of section 856 in Mr. Haughey's appeal, but the existence of the section should have acted as a red flag to him when he decided to adjudicate on Mr. Haughey's appeal. If he had stepped aside as, for example, Mr. Justice Andrias O'Caoimh did at the time of the arms trial, he would have saved the Government and the current Taoiseach much embarrassment. Why did Mr. John O'Callaghan, the other appeal commissioner, not take the case?  Was he conflicted?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, as a matter of urgency, should return to the practice of appointing at least one of three appeal commissioners from the senior ranks of the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The two current office holders were political appointments from the private sector, made by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, after the 1992 general election when it was unclear whether Fianna Fáil would form part of the new Government.</P>
    <P>Appeal Commissioners drawn from the private sector, because of their professional background, have contact over their working lives with a very significant number of clients.  Their function as Appeal Commissioners is semi-judicial and the possibility of conflicts is quite high simply arising from their professional practice over so many years.  Senior officials at the Revenue Commissioners have less possibility of conflict and the Minister for Finance should appoint a third appeal commissioner with a public service background who does not have a background of dealing with so many clients.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, has not adequately explained the circumstances of the appointment of his brother-in-law.  There are questions which he must answer before the Dáil goes into recess, including the considerations he took into account when he appointed Mr. Kelly? Was Mr. Kelly selected from a list of suitably qualified persons, or did Deputy Ahern simply pluck him from the private sector after forming the view that he was the most suitably qualified person for the job?  Did Mr. Kelly personally seek the office or was the office sought on his behalf by a third party?  Were representations made to Deputy Ahern by persons in politics or in other professions to appoint Mr. Kelly?  The Taoiseach claims he has not spoken to Mr. Kelly in the past five years.  What was the nature of his contact with Mr. Kelly in 1992?  Did Deputy Ahern inform the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert <Col N="1500" /> Reynolds, of the appointment and that Mr. Kelly was his brother-in-law?  Was the appointment mentioned by him or discussed in Cabinet?  Was the Cabinet informed that Mr. Kelly was Deputy Ahern's brother-in-law?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is very familiar with the findings of the McCracken tribunal.  He is uniquely well briefed on the findings and, like every other Deputy in the House, he knew that the Revenue Commissioners intended relying on Judge McCracken's findings in pursuing Mr. Haughey's unpaid tax.  Did it ever strike the Taoiseach that if Mr. Haughey disagreed with the assessment of the Revenue Commissioners, there was an even money chance his brother-in-law would hear the appeal?  Did he take steps to avoid the potential embarrassment?</P>
    <P>The central figure in this debacle, however, is not Mr. Kelly, but Mr. Haughey, and as Mr. Bruce Arnold wrote in this morning's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>. the recent revelations about his receipt of large sums of money have inextricably linked together his exercise of power, his by-passing of constitutional requirements, his arrogant interference on a wide range of financially sensitive deals &mdash; on property, on beef, on passports, on unspecified favours which earned handsome cash presents &mdash; with his occupation of the highest political office.</P>
    <P>This by definition is corrupt.  It was seen as such and challenged as such by intrepid politicians from within his own party, led by men like George Colley and Deputy Des O'Malley, and their fate, like that of other lesser names, was confrontation and isolation.  The rest of the Fianna Fáil Party, the vast majority, watched and did nothing.  They saw the abuse of power. They saw the acquisition of gross unexplained and unjustifiable wealth.  And they simulated incomprehension, bewilderment, ignorance, amnesia, stupidity.</P>
    <P>They were intelligent, in some cases, gifted men and women.  Yet through their inertia, they subscribed to a constitutional nonsense, to a leader of their party, of successive Governments and of the country over long periods of office, acting against the country's interest and increasingly in his own personal interest.  Several are in power at this moment, including the Taoiseach who enjoyed an extremely close and intimate association from the time he was Assistant Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil to his enjoyment of the powerful position of Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Despite his attempts in recent years to distance himself from the Haughey era, this debacle has again reminded the public that the Taoiseach, for much of his political career, was Mr. Haughey's closest lieutenant.  No amount of spin doctoring will erase this fact from the public consciousness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the heart of this issue is a sense among the Irish people that if one is powerful <Col N="1501" /> enough, one does not ultimately have to pay tax.  The House, in response to these revelations, must prove that is not true.  If that belief were to take hold, the damage it would do to the House, the respect in which it is held and the respect in which the laws it enacts are held would be extremely serious.</P>
      <P>I will deal with six issues.  The first is equality before the law.  A sufficiently wealthy person who receives an unfavorable tax assessment can appeal it all the way to the Supreme Court because he can afford to pay the lawyers to represent him and the accountants to find the loopholes in the law so that he does not have to pay the tax.  On the other hand, if one is not sufficiently wealthy, one cannot afford the lawyers or accountants to make a case to the Revenue Commissioners or the Appeal Commissioners, or to appeal any determination by the latter to the Circuit Court or higher.  This fundamental issue of resources, which disqualifies ordinary people from taking full advantage of the law while wealthy people can, is at the heart of the deep sense of public outrage felt at present.</P>
      <P>Second is the apparent abuse of company law. The abuse of limited liability, whereby a person can make a payment through an offshore company with nominee directors acting on their behalf and, as a result of availing of the anonymity of the legislation in other countries, avoid their true liabilities, goes to the heart of the integrity of our business system.  If limited liability and company law continues to be abused in the manner it was by Mr. Haughey to receive this money, the situation is serious as far as business ethics is concerned, let alone political ethics.  Third is the apparent abuse of domicile which is a related issue in the sense that, by domiciling a company offshore, the same responsibility can be avoided.</P>
      <P>Fourth is the issue of the stupid decision of a Minister for Finance to appoint his brother-in-law as Appeal Commissioner, given that it is well known that there must be a clear distinction between the responsibilities of the Minister for and the Department of Finance for the making of tax law and the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and the Appeal Commissioners for the administration of that law and the collection of taxes.  Putting a close relative in the position of appeal commissioner while one is Minister for Finance places that person in an acutely embarrassing position and lays him open to the type of difficulty now facing Mr. Kelly.  It was not fair to him he was placed in that position and the person who made that unfair decision and who is accountable for it is the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Fifth, the decision of the Appeal Commissioner is contrary to the express wish and understanding of the House when it enacted the relevant legislation, and I propose to demonstrate that.  Sixth, why did the Appeal Commissioner hear the case on his own?  I understand it is normal in an important case for both commissioners to hear it together.  Why did only one and not both hear it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Appeal Commissioner's decision was not <Col N="1502" /> only wrong but was contrary to the understanding of Deputies in 1975 when they enacted the legislation. The two arguments advanced to justify Mr. Kelly's decision in media reports are: one, the gift was made to Mr. Haughey by a company outside the jurisdiction and, two, the shareholders could not be identified.  In both cases, the Appeal Commissioner can be demonstrated to have acted in a fashion contrary to the understanding of the House when it enacted the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the debate on 18 November 1975, Deputy Enright asked the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>In the event of an owner of a large estate who lives in Ireland giving a gift of shares in a foreign company or property or land in a country outside this State, do I take it this will be liable for tax because he is domiciled in Ireland?</P>
    <P>The answer given to that pertinent and prophetic question by the Minister for Finance was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The understanding of the Dáil when it passed the legislation was that Mr. Haughey would be liable if Mr. Dunne was the original source of the gift, regardless of the fact that the gift came from a company controlled by Mr. Dunne outside the jurisdiction.  Mr. Kelly's decision clearly defied the will of the House as expressed and understood on 18 November 1975.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other issue of the identifiability of shareholders in the company, it can be demonstrated that it was clearly intended that gifts provided indirectly by a disponer through another party to an ultimate beneficiary would be liable to tax.  The provisions of section 2 of the Act, the definition section, make clear that a disposition includes one made directly or indirectly.  Section 35 of the Act makes clear that the giver of a gift can be liable for tax if the recipient is not made liable.  It is clear from section 35 that, in the case of a gift, those who may be accountable for the tax include the disponer.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me it was the intention of the House at the time in 1975 that, if Mr. Haughey could avoid paying the tax, Mr. Dunne could not. Either one or the other would have to pay and that is clearly demonstrated in my reading of sections 2 and 35.  It is also clear from a question on this matter posed by the late Deputy Colley to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, on 18 November 1975, the clear answer to which was that, even if the donor had given the money earlier to a third party to be received later by someone else, either the recipient or the donor would be liable to tax, regardless of the intermediate third party.</P>
    <P>This decision by the Appeal Commissioner is completely and demonstrably wrong and not in line with decisions of the House.  It should not have been made.  The inexplicability of that decision creates even more concern.  It would be normal for people to expect in this instance that the Dáil might not have done its job property and there might have been a loophole in the law but the quotations I have read from the debate show the Dáil did its job and, in particular, Deputy <Col N="1503" /> Tom Enright in asking the relevant question of the Minister for Finance, from the then Government benches, made sure the Dáil established the facts before it passed the legislation.  Those facts are such that clearly either Mr. Haughey is liable for the tax or Mr. Dunne is liable for the tax but there is no case in which neither could end up failing to pay.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the fact that it is strange that Mr. Kelly sat alone on this case.  I understand that in other cases it is normal, where there are two Appeal Commissioners and the case is important, to sit both of them so that they are collectively responsible for the decision.  If ever there was an important case where one would want collective responsibility among the Appeal Commissioners to apply, surely it is the case of a former Taoiseach and his tax liability where one of the Appeal Commissioners happens to be the brother-in-law of the Taoiseach and both Taoisigh happen to be members of the same party.</P>
    <P>The sense of outrage in the country is of immense proportions and I advise the party opposite not to underestimate it.  There are times when we in this House, where we are meeting one another in the corridors and where our only contact with the outside world is by telephone, may not be in touch.  I can assure all Deputies that the idea that a former Taoiseach shamelessly frustrated a tribunal, shamelessly told lies to a tribunal and shamelessly abused the law to evade tax liability is causing outrage.  The outrage is deepened by the fact that there has never been the slightest hint of contrition.  There has never been the slightest demand for contrition from Mr. Haughey from the party he led.  There has never been a demand from Fianna Fáil, which gave so much to Mr. Haughey and reposed so much trust in him, for a genuine heartfelt apology for the way in which he conducted himself over so many years.  It is time now for Fianna Fáil, which contains many honourable people who would never dream of doing anything of the kind Mr. Haughey did, to rise up and ask this man to say he is sorry for the appalling things he did and for the way in which he misled this country and demeaned our profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is a test of how much progress we have made in recent years and a test of the Taoiseach and his new model Fianna Fáil.  So far he has failed to understand the absolute outrage among the public which believes, now more than ever, there is one law for the rich and one for everybody else and that the golden circle is not dead but is still alive and thriving.  The Taoiseach is the only leader of Fianna Fáil to whom the public has given the benefit of the doubt since Mr. Haughey took out Jack Lynch in 1979.  He should not believe for one second that the high poll rating he currently enjoys has anything to do with the performance of those sitting beside him. Not one of them is responsible for his Government's poll rating.  The Irish people have placed <Col N="1504" /> their trust in the Taoiseach and in him alone.  The people have been battered and bruised by the revelations of recent years.  He promised them a new beginning and from day one, from the appointment of Ray Burke and his refusal to have the Ansbacher accounts investigated by a tribunal, he has failed them.  Despite the talk, the rhetoric and the annual Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis speech about ethics in Fianna Fáil Nua, he has failed them miserably and they know it.  They are hurt because they feel codded, fooled and duped. If he does not know it he should ask his backbenchers and also about the phone calls they, like me, have received over the past 24 hours.</P>

      <P>If it has stopped ringing, that is even worse.  It is amazing how some things hurt. There is an old maxim: justice not only needs to be done but must be seen to be done.  Make no mistake about it, nobody among the wider public believes that justice has been done in this case.  A former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, a former Taoiseach, a patron, a mentor is making a fool of the institutions of the State and of the people he once claimed to serve, with the active support of his party by its silence.  He will not like to hear this but it is the truth: Jack Lynch once said he would not stand idly by.  That is precisely what the Taoiseach and others did for more than a decade.</P>
      <P>During all his visits to Kinsealy, did the Taoiseach ever ask where Mr. Haughey's wealth, all that unexplained fortune, came from?  Will he continue to stand idly by as he did when others, including the Tánaiste and Deputy Des O'Malley, asked the same questions?  The public want to know if he will hold Mr. Haughey to account? Will he ever be held to account or is the blasé approach displayed by the Minister for Finance to continue?  Quite frankly, the performance of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, beggars belief. Either he has no understanding, no comprehension of the damage being done to the systems for which he is responsible or he does not care.  If the Taoiseach doubts me, or if the press gallery do not know to which I am referring, I invite him and his backbenchers to read the Minister's contribution in the Seanad yesterday.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister for Finance does not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has a number of questions to answer, not just to this House but to the public. Does he believe it is appropriate that his brother-in-law, appointed by him, should sit in judgment on his former mentor, Charles Haughey?  Does he believe that Mr. Kelly, notwithstanding his competency, should have stepped aside so that justice could not only be done but be seen to be done?  Did he &mdash; as this morning's newspapers <Col N="1505" /> allege &mdash; recruit his brother-in-law for this position and, if so, why?  Those are key questions for the Taoiseach.  He has a responsibility to outline clearly the process of recruitment.  His failure to answer them thus far has tainted him in the public mind.  On television last night the public saw Deputy Rabbitte drag information from him which he should have offered to this House as soon as this matter was raised yesterday.  What the public did not see was the shocked expression on the face of every other Fianna Fáil Deputy behind him, because the camera was on him.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach choose not to speak yesterday?  Did he think the issue would go away, that no one would cop on or was he, like the Minister for Finance, hiding behind the law?  I know there is no obligation under the ethics legislation for the Taoiseach to make a declaration.  However, if he was true to the spirit of that legislation, the Taoiseach would have done so.  If he had, he would have spared Members the ignominy of seeing yet another Fianna Fáil Taoiseach being called to account.</P>
    <P>Like my predecessor, Deputy Spring, I stated on numerous occasions that Fianna Fáil and its political culture are destroying politics in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche knows that the eternal truth of politics is this: Fianna Fáil comes before everyone else.  Once again the House has been damaged by Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach has talked a good game but actions speak louder than words.  Inaction speaks louder than anything else. That, sadly, is the Taoiseach's record to date.</P>
      <P>Make no mistake, damage has been done to the most valuable yet fragile of commodities, namely, trust in politics and trust in our political institution. The Taoiseach cannot undo that damage but he can begin to repair it.  He should publish the decision in respect of the Haughey case, discover who is responsible for this mess and vindicate the people's right to know.  The people want and deserve to know what happened in this case. If the Taoiseach comprehends the trust they have placed in him, he should discover the truth on their behalf.  The bottom line is that no one &mdash; no former Taoiseach or Leader of Fianna Fáil &mdash; should be above the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point relates to the Appeal Commissioners and the question of secrecy. Many Deputies and members of the public did not know of the existence of the Appeal Commissioners and they certainly had no idea of what their work entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect the chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to be privy to such knowledge.  I have no doubt the Deputy appeared before the commissioners in a professional capacity on more than one occasion.  However, it is clear that a number of Members did not know about the existence of the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Having regard to Article 34 of the Constitution, which requires the law to be administered in public, there are causes for concern as a result of this case which involves extremely powerful people who are seized of decisions which amount to millions of pounds and no one knows anything about their work.  In this case we have seen the significance of that.  Is there any other position in the public service in respect of which people are not required to submit an application and curriculum vitae, attend for interview, etc.  ?  Judicial appointments in respect of courts up to and including the Supreme Court are made by means of a process which includes application, interview and selection.  However, in this instance, a person appointed as an Appeal Commissioner was not obliged to do any of that.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach indicates whether it is true that he headhunted the person appointed in this case.  It is extraordinary that a vacancy was not advertised, that the appointment was made during the interregnum and that confirmation to the House was made on 8 January during that interregnum when no Deputies were aware of it.  The Taoiseach should state whether he headhunted this individual.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matter which are cause for concern.  I do not believe people outside the House are interested in whether Mr. Haughey &ldquo;got off&rdquo; because of a technicality, a stroke or a deficiency in the law.  The fact is that he got off. The cavalier fashion in which the Minister for Finance dealt with questions yesterday would leave one with the impression that taxpayers ought to be thankful that Mr. Haughey did not receive a rebate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance's thoughts on tax evasion <Col N="1507" /> in the wake of the banking scandals are a matter of record.  He trivialised, poured scorn upon and ridiculed the story broken by George Lee and Charlie Bird in respect of those scandals. It is easy to divine where the Minister's heart lies on this matter, namely, with the &ldquo;nod and wink&rdquo; men.  There is no doubt about that.  Legitimate questions of public policy were put to the Minister yesterday and he chose not to address them. He simply ignored the whole affair.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the tax system must be a cardinal precept of our democracy.  People believe in equality before the law in respect of tax collection, in the efficacy of tax collection procedures and in the fairness of assessment.  These are cardinal principles.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is whether everyone is equal before the law.  The only conclusion people are in a position to reach is that we are not all equal in that regard.  One need only consider what happened in this case.  At the 11th hour, although the information was ultimately dragged out of him, Mr. Haughey stated that he received the money.  The person who donated the money confirmed that Mr. Haughey received it and the judge at the tribunal declared that he did in fact receive it.  Given that the High Court judge presiding over the McCracken tribunal found that a former Taoiseach had received a donation of £1.3 million, that the identity of the donor was known and that the Revenue Commissioners made an assessment that almost £2 million in taxes should be levied against Mr. Haughey, how does one explain to the ordinary taxpaying citizen that an Appeal Commissioner could decide that Mr. Haughey's liability is zero?  I know the Government came to office on the basis of zero tolerance but this will give an entirely new meaning to the term.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach to indicate what he proposes to do about this matter.  I find it as difficult as does Deputy John Bruton to understand the decision of the Appeal Commissioner. Having regard to the facts set out in the McCracken tribunal report I cannot understand how he could decide to set it aside.  What are his qualifications to set it aside?  He is not trained in the law.  A High Court judge decided on the evidence adduced in public hearings before the tribunal that Mr. Haughey got the money and that the donor was Mr. Ben Dunne but an Appeal Commissioner who was headhunted by his brother-in-law, the Taoiseach, during the Christmas holidays and appointed to the office has decided to set his findings aside.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that if the findings of a tribunal of inquiry can be set aside in this way, irreparable damage has been done to tribunals so much so that I cannot see what purpose they serve.  We do not know what arguments the Appeal Commissioner can advance because the findings are given in secret.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was especially annoyed yesterday when I sought <Col N="1508" /> to make what I thought was a reasonable point in the circumstances.  What message is sent to the public if a brother-in-law of the leader of Fianna Fáil is seen to be adjudicating on the taxes of a former leader of Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the people want to know.  I gave an example yesterday &mdash; I do not want to go into the same graphic detail &mdash; about what would happen if it happened on this side of the House.  It is relevant.  How is it that the tax affairs of Deputy Lowry were considered by two Appeal Commissioners?  Why is it that one Member involved in this controversy has had his affairs raked over by two Appeal Commissioners but the case of the most prominent politician in the land for 25 years has been studied by only one who happens to be &mdash; this is a coincidence &mdash; a brother-in-law of the Taoiseach?  The Taoiseach has to answer that question.</P>
      <P>It is widely known and written that the boys from Malahide are back in town.  How come the Taoiseach did not know that this matter was before the Appeal Commissioner?  I am puzzled by this.  I understand that many of the downstairs staff at Kinsealy have had to be left go and that land might have to be sold to clear the tax bills. It is a bit like the member of the royal family in &ldquo;Spittin' Image&rdquo; asking for the letter opener and being informed in reply, &ldquo;He is on his day off&rdquo;. If the Revenue Commissioners had raised an assessment, it is extraordinary that the Taoiseach had no knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>How could somebody considered to have the nous to sit in a quasi judicial capacity on major tax matters not have the cop on to say he would stand aside and not allow himself to deal with this case?  It is extraordinary that, when the most notorious case in the land appears on his desk, he decides, given his connections, to hear it on his own.  Why was it not heard by both commissioners?</P>
      <P>Charges should not be made against this side of the House for raising these questions.  I remember the row that continued for weeks when the Deputy sitting beside me, when Minister of State, employed his brother-in-law as a driver. That was supposed to be the biggest scandal until Michael D. won £1,200 on a race night.  We now have a brother-in-law sitting in a quasi judicial capacity who decided to exonerate the man who played ducks and drakes with us in this House and is now doing it outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can become inured to the impact on public opinion.  The people are scandalised.  Deputy Quinn mentioned the number of telephone calls <Col N="1509" /> he received.  The people's outrage is not conditioned by the party they support in this House. Members of Fianna Fáil make telephone calls to radio programmes and to Members on these benches who are small business people or who are self-employed explaining what happened in their circumstances.  Last night I received a telephone call from a woman in Rome &mdash; I will give her name if she permits me to do so &mdash; who on the death of her mother in this jurisdiction had to dispose of her house to pay the tax levied.  She was outraged by what she picked up on the internet yesterday.  Throughout the country ordinary tax compliant citizens, members of every party in this House and none, have had a similar experience. The Revenue Commissioners have put them through the hoops.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Haughey paraded his retinue like an Arab sheik for many years the Revenue Commissioners did not see anything wrong with it.  It did not occur to them that they should ask questions. When Mr. Justice McCracken found certain facts for them they could not effectively defend their assessment before the Appeal Commissioner. The Minister for Finance should ask the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners why was that allowed to happen.  Like their colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Food in the case of the beef tribunal, did they just photocopy the page out of the McCracken report and send it to the Appeal Commissioner?  Did they call Mr. Justice McCracken to defend their assessment? Did they call Mr. Ben Dunne and Mr. Noel Smith?</P>
    <P>How come the Revenue Commissioners whose job it is to collect tax fairly could raise an assessment of £2 million against Mr. Haughey and have it reduced to zero?  The people are unable to understand this.  One would expect the Revenue Commissioners, independent of Mr. Justice McCracken, to use the information to compile a case to defend their assessment before the Appeal Commissioner.  Most people are mesmerised. After parading his great wealth for years the old boss is finally caught but with one bound he is free.  This has to be explained to the people who pay their taxes as best they can.  It is unconscionable that something like this could come about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many Deputies have had the experience, when showing friends around Leinster House, of coming to the portrait of Mr. Charles Haughey in a prominent position. Invariably, people ask what it is doing there after all the scandals and disgrace associated with him. Many Deputies will be familiar with the portrait. Charles J. Haughey looks down on us with those famous gimlet eyes and that imperious gaze. What does the portrait say?  It says, &ldquo;You are mere minions.  I am above you.  I am above the law.  I am untouchable.&rdquo; Let the message go out to Mr. Haughey from Dáil Éireann today that he is not untouchable or above the law, that his day will come and justice will be done.  At the very <Col N="1510" /> least, that portrait should be in the basement where it belongs because we need a gesture of censure.  The people want justice to be done.</P>
      <P>They want leadership from the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach's response to the question of Mr. Haughey has been equivocal, to say the least. Recently, on the Late Late Show, the Taoiseach said he would be quite happy to have tea with Mr. Haughey.  What would he talk about?  Would he talk about Manchester United Football Club? I believe Mr. Haughey visited Old Trafford last week.  Would the Taoiseach have the courage to tell Mr. Haughey that he is a disgrace and should apologise to the country for his behaviour?  That is what people want.</P>
      <P>Despite all his talk about honesty and integrity, the Taoiseach has not severed the link with Mr. Haughey.  He is umbilically tied to Mr. Haughey and that umbilical cord will strangle him and his Government if he does not act decisively.  I ask the Taoiseach to close all loopholes pertaining to tribunals and insist that the reasons for this bizarre Appeal Commissioner's decision be published. The Taoiseach should not underestimate public anger.  He is driving into GUBU land and he is at the wheel.  He can decode which way to go, but he and his Government are indecisive on this matter.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wishes to restore public confidence in the body politic he must act decisively, distance himself from Mr. Haughey and condemn his actions.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> We have here a tale of two Irelands.  In one, on 25 January next, Dublin householders will be dragged in front of the Dublin District Court facing threats of entry into Stubbs Gazette, seizure of goods by a sheriff, steep court costs and judgments registered against their mortgages.  This will be because they owe £210 arrears of an unjust and discredited water tax, now abolished, which they had objected to paying.  A very sick heroin addict was sent to prison for six years for stealing a handbag.  A Galway man is serving two weeks in prison for putting up posters.  In the other Ireland, powerful bankers who facilitated tax evasion systematically over ten years have yet to darken the doorway of a courthouse.  Will they ever?  A former leader of Fianna Fáil, former Taoiseach and millionaire property owner who, following a tribunal of inquiry which found he had evaded substantial amounts of tax, is judged to owe nothing.</P>
      <P>The Ireland of the golden circle used, abused and sucked dry the Ireland of the majority of tax compliant citizens, especially PAYE workers and now walks away scot-free.  It is high time our people called an end to this and pulled down the corrupt edifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Equity in the tax system is one of the foundations of a fair society and the Government and I are totally committed to it. None of us could accept a situation in which major tax evasion escapes the net for whatever <Col N="1511" /> reason and where relatively minor offenders or the majority of compliant taxpayers face the full rigours of the law.  Such a position would, I agree, amount to a public outrage and would be intolerable. It would be very wrong, however, to jump to conclusions at an intermediate stage of any process.</P>
      <P>It can often happen in emotive cases, in any area of law, that in the course of a lengthy procedure involving multiple appeals an unexpected or unwelcome verdict is given for essentially technical reasons.  It has been suggested by some tax practitioners that the law in relation to the case presented may have left no choice in the matter. Those who administer the law are entitled to an absolute presumption of their professional integrity and that any decision they take is based on sound, objective and defensible grounds without any personal or political bias.</P>
      <P>Because of the confidentiality to which every taxpayer is entitled, with such exceptions as are provided by law, and because of the absolute independence of the Appeal Commissioners, it is not possible to question the details of any particular case or the grounds of their decision.  Legal provision exists for later publication of the grounds for decisions abstracted from the particular case.  However, the Appeal Commissioner's decision is far from being the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>Under section 942 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, any person aggrieved by the determination of the Appeal Commissioner may, on giving notice in writing to the inspector, appeal within ten days to a judge of the Circuit Court.  It is specifically provided by section 52(5)(b) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, that in a capital acquisitions tax appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, if unsuccessful before the Appeal Commissioners may also appeal to a Circuit Court judge.  Any such appeal amounts to a complete rehearing by the Circuit Court judge of all the relevant issues.  It is also provided by section 943(9) of the Taxes Consolidation Act that any such appeal shall be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that should either party to an appeal to the Circuit Court require that a case be stated to the High Court for its opinion on any point of law, that issue is heard in public.  Similarly, in the event that either party appeals the decision of the High Court on that point of law to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court hearing would also be held in public.  This is provided for in section 9 of the Finance Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be taken as axiomatic that the Revenue Commissioners will pursue due process, if necessary to its ultimate limits, to recover the liabilities which they believe are due and recoverable. There will be no let or hindrance on the part of the Government to that.  On the contrary, we are prepared to grant the Revenue Commissioners any powers they may seek to combat tax evasion, consistent with any reasonable balance of rights. We cannot have a situation where anyone, either <Col N="1512" /> high or low, visibly fails to pay his or her dues to society, as that is demoralising to all other taxpayers. If one person can get away without fulfilling his or her obligations, it creates a deep resentment and feeling of unfairness.  We cannot override anyone's constitutional rights but we can and will go to any lengths to ensure equity is upheld in the tax system.  If, at the end of the process, there were shown to be serious deficiencies in the law, we would have to consider all options necessary to repair them, to ensure that the letter of the law is brought into line with its spirit and to recover any tax due but for some technical gap in the law.  However, we are far from that stage now.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the process of appointing Appeal Commissioners.  In this case the appointment was made at my instigation.  I was not lobbied.  I asked a person whom I know to be highly qualified and highly competent and who was switching from one employment to another if he would be interested in the position. All the correct procedures were followed. Appointments are made by many Governments. This is one of the few cases in which the names of appointees must be laid before the House on their appointment by the Minister for Finance.  I laid the name of my brother-in-law before the House, a procedure which allowed any Member of the House to raise questions about it over a number of days.  No such question was raised by any Member.  The name of Ronan Kelly, along with that of John O'Callaghan was laid before the House on 8 January 1993.  Mr. Kelly had 25 years experience as a chartered accountant, holding senior positions in Coopers and Lybrand and Sedgwick Dineen and was eminently well qualified for the position.  All other due processes connected with the appointment were followed.  The relationship of the appointee to myself was publicly referred to at the time in a number of publications. It was mentioned in a <i>Sunday Tribune</i> article of 31 January 1993.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been ample opportunity long before now for anyone to express any difficulties or reservations about that appointment or about the manner in which the person concerned has adjudicated on literally hundreds of cases since then.  Deputy Quinn was Minister in that Department and, to the best of my knowledge, he did not find any difficulty and neither he nor any <Col N="1513" /> members of his party raised any issues about that appointment when Deputy Quinn had full access to the details of it.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, a newspaper by no means noted as being favourably biased towards my party, on 9 August last states that Mr. Kelly is regarded as a model professional.  The same article makes the point that any decision whatever he might take in this case might be open to political misconstruction.  I am sure if he had any fears about his ability to deal with the case in an absolutely impartial manner he would have declined to sit.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer in this regard to an article by a former Member of this House, Mr. Michael McDowell, S.C. in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> which states &ldquo;the Appeal Commissioners enjoy universal respect among tax practitioners for their independence, impartiality and probity&rdquo;.  He goes on to state that it would be very unfortunate if the public were to get any other idea.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, I have had no contact with the person concerned, direct or indirect, about this case.

      <P>It is natural that grave concern and deep unhappiness should be expressed at the decision and I expressed such concern yesterday. The slant or construction that the Opposition may have put on this story has been deeply embarrassing to me, but I reject absolutely the insinuation that the appeal commissioner, because he happens to be my brother-in-law &mdash; he is not particularly close to me, but that is irrelevant &mdash; has acted with anything less than total professional integrity or competence in this matter. To the best of my knowledge, he is not a member of Fianna Fáil, he never was and he <Col N="1514" /> never worked for the party or any other political party.  It is deeply unfair that an honourable public servant should be attacked without any opportunity for self-defence and that the privileges of this House should be abused, as they have been in recent days.  If Deputies believe there has been a lapse of standards in the conduct of this case at any level by the relevant authorities, they are profoundly mistaken.</P>
      <P>I have no insight into the details of the case or the decision, but I imagine that when the Revenue Commissioners lose any particular stage in an appeal process they will do all they can to fill in any gaps or repair any weaknesses in their case before it reaches the next stage.  Evidence or findings produced in a tribunal cannot of themselves of course be taken as proof for purposes of a court of law or indeed for purposes of tax law.</P>
      <P>There is very little further that I can add.  I assure every member of the public that there has been no breach in the integrity of public administration, that due process will continue to its ultimate conclusion, and that illegal tax evasion will not go unpunished as long as I am in this position. I wish to share the remainder of my time with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity once again to respond to this issue.  The motion refers to public outrage at the appeal commissioner's decision, the issue of publication of the decision and the question of whether the findings of tribunals of inquiry that taxes were evaded may no longer be relied upon as evidence by the Revenue Commissioners in the collection of such taxes.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, I acknowledge the strength of feeling on this issue in the House.  That is why I came in and gave a full reply over 45 minutes to the various questions posed.  I had hoped that these explanations and information would be of benefit to the House.  I am not privy to the basis on which the appeals decision was made and I can throw no light of the evidentiary issues involved.  I am not sure, therefore, what further assistance I can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points I underlined in my replies to the House in response to the four Private Notice Questions which are worth repeating. First, I made it clear on my part and on the part of the Government that all reasonable or necessary measures will be pursued to counter tax evasion.  I also made it clear that I regard evasion as an abhorrence.  Second, I pointed out that the issue of an individual's tax affairs is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in the question of tax liability, and I intend to follow this practice. Third, I said the appeals system is there for all taxpayers to use.  Every taxpayer, irrespective of whether they pay a large or a small amount of tax, has the right to use the law to vindicate his or her position if he or she wishes to do so.  Fourth, I said the Appeals Commissioners are independent in the exercise of their duty.  The current Appeals <Col N="1515" /> Commissioners were appointed validly within the law by the Minister for Finance in December 1992, and, as required by law, their appointments formally notified to the Houses on 8 January 1993.  Fifth, I said the Appeals Commissioners are only one step in the process of establishing and enforcing a tax liability.  I made it very plain that, in my experience, in cases such as this where a large tax liability is at issue, it would be normal for either side to appeal the matter further within the provisions of the law.  The publicity surrounding this case suggests that the decision of an Appeals Commissioner is final.  That is not the case.  It is only the first stage in a process.  Sixth, I reiterated what I said in my Budget Statement, namely, that the issue of Revenue powers is under active review; that the Revenue Commissioners have recently made proposals to me in this regard; and that I will be examining these in the context of the Finance Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>The issue arose yesterday of making a tribunal finding into a form of binding tax assessment.  I said that the Oireachtas could consider that under the Finance Bill or at any other time.  Naturally advice would have to be taken on such a proposal before it could be included in the law.  I pointed out that as regards the case in question the law is there for the further pursuit of the tax liability and that this was the best course of action.</P>
    <P>As regards Appeals Commissioners' decisions, I pointed out that it was I who had provided the Appeal Commissioners with the discretion to publish their findings under certain conditions.  If there is any further assistance I can give the House on this matter, I am ready to respond constructively as I did in the Chamber yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a long and honoured tradition, I take this opportunity to wish every Member of the Oireachtas and all of the staff who work with us a very happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I offer you and your staff a happy Christmas.  As always, yours is a difficult job.  I thank you for your unfailing courtesy and patience during the year on my behalf and behalf of everybody else in the House, particularly my colleagues.</P>
      <P>I extend season's greetings to my fellow party leaders, Deputies Harney, Bruton, De Rossa and Quinn and to all of the independent Members; to the Superintendent, the Captain of the Guard, the Clerk of the Dáil and all of their staff; and to all of the staff who work in the House.  There are so many people in the House that sometimes we forget some of them, particularly those who work directly within the precincts of the House at all levels, all of the ushers and all of those who serve us.</P>
      <P>I extend season's greetings to the distinguished members of the media who report all that we do. Some days I wish they did not; other days I wish they would.  I thank them for all their work here during the year.</P>
      <P>It has been an extraordinary, remarkable year as we try to move forward the British-Irish Agreement.  I thank everyone in the House, as I did earlier today.  I take this opportunity to wish everybody, particularly those North and South who watch our proceedings, a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party, I wish you, a Cheann Comhairle, a happy, relaxing Christmas so that you will return refreshed to face the troubled waters yet again.  I thank the staff who assist you in your work, the Clerk of the Dáil and all the other staff of the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the media who sometimes report the proceedings here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank those who provide us with sustenance. I acknowledge Deputy Seán Ryan's apt points yesterday.  I say a particular word of thanks to those who provide us with our food every day in the House, and also those who guard the House, <Col N="1519" /> the members of the Garda and the Army who guard the House at night.</P>
    <P>I hope not only will we have a peaceful Christmas &mdash; no doubt we will &mdash; but that also it will be a Christmas during which further progress will be made in building an understanding between the two communities on this island who are slowly but inexorably coming to a better understanding than they have had over a long period of 300 years.  I pay particular tribute to my predecessor as Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for the work he did in starting the present process.  That is sometimes forgotten and I acknowledge it in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join other speakers in wishing everyone well for the season.  I thank the media, the staff, including those outside this Chamber, the Garda, Army and all associated with this institution of democracy. We could not do our job without that constant support system which the public does not see.</P>
      <P>This has been an important year for many of us, particularly for the people of Northern Ireland.  I associate myself with Deputy Bruton's comments on complimenting the Government on its work on Northern Ireland.  We will reserve the right to criticise but it has our full support in pursuing an objective which successive Governments have pursued, an objective initiated in part by Deputy Reynolds when Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The people who watch this programme are not all insomniacs.  Some watch it at different times and they are not all in this jurisdiction.  They are in our thoughts as they are part of the extended Irish family in the global village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish you well, a Cheann Comhairle.  I hope you will return vigorous and vibrant.  I am the only leader that you have sanctioned so far.  That is a demonstration of the kind of independence being expressed elsewhere at this time.  I thank you for the difficult job that you and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have in presiding over proceedings in this House.  I wish you and your family a happy Christmas and a healthy new year so <Col N="1520" /> that you return invigorated and refreshed to face 1999.</P>

      <P>It is important that we maintain civilities even though we may fight hard across the floor.  A Cheann Comhairle, I wish you a happy Christmas and a more peaceful year in 1999 than 1998.  I thank the staff, the press and everyone who makes this House operate smoothly.  It is important that we look to the future.  This is the last occasion on which I will address the House as leader of Democratic Left. That is an occasion of some sadness but I look forward to working with colleagues over the coming years to make the Government's life a bit more uncomfortable.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish you a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.  I extend that wish to all those who work in Leinster House, particularly the staff who carry out the hard work and are not acknowledged, except at times like this.  It is also appropriate that we think of those who will be in hospital or waiting to go into hospital this Christmas.  I seem to know more people in that situation this year than in previous years.  There will also be those who will be alone this Christmas, who will be at work and far from home, or serving the community in different ways while the rest of us enjoy Christmas at home.</P>
      <P>I hope 1999 will see the fruition of much of the work done to secure peace on this island and between these two islands.  I hope 1999 will see sectarianism begin to melt so that we can look forward to a mature future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House a month ago, my Department has undertaken an examination into the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions.  That investigation identified potential legal and constitutional issues, particularly in relation to property rights, which must be taken into account in the development of policy in relation to such accounts.  I pointed out that this is a very complex issue and one which requires very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>I am happy to state again that I have no intention of letting this matter rest.  My Department has prepared proposals designed to resolve the difficulties identified by the earlier examination. I will be examining those proposals and will be consulting the Office of the Attorney General on the legal issues involved.  I expect then to be in a position to submit a proposal to Government on the issue of dormant accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, however, statistics available for some <Col N="1522" /> important classes of assets such as financial assets and property.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware there has been very strong growth in the prices of these assets over the last two years.  For example, the ISEQ index of Irish share prices has increased by over two thirds over the last two years, notwithstanding the volatility experienced in recent months, and new house prices have increased by over one third since the third quarter of 1996.</P>
      <P>Strong growth in asset prices overall is not surprising in the light of the exceptional performance of the economy over recent years with the value of nominal GDP estimated to have increased by almost 30 per cent since 1996.</P>
      <P>Increases in asset prices are not in general a cause for concern providing they are consistent with overall economic stability and with the fundamental determinants of the asset's underlying value, and are not fuelled by speculative forces. In such circumstances changes in asset values are a key mechanism through which savings are channelled into their most productive uses in the economy and transformed into investments which boost output, employment and the economy's growth potential.</P>
      <P>In this respect the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent announced in my 1998 budget is an important structural measure to improve the functioning of asset markets in the Irish economy.  By releasing pent-up investment funds and improving the incentive for the acquisition of capital assets this measure is helping to encourage investment and economic growth in the future.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to houses is, of course, a special case since investment returns are not the primary motivation for the majority of purchasers.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures released by the Department of the Environment and Local Government early last week and developments in the Irish Permanent index of house prices indicate that the measures introduced by the Government in response to the conclusions of the Bacon report are being successful in dampening down house price increases.  The rate of increase in new house prices has slowed markedly in the third quarter of this year to an annualised rate of increase of under 7.5 per cent as compared with annualised increases running in excess of 20 per cent over the preceding three quarters.</P>
      <P>As far as future prospects for asset prices are concerned my role as Minister for Finance is to provide a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to long-term output, incomes and employment growth in the economy.  The realisation of this objective will help underpin sustained long-term growth in the value of financial assets in the economy which in turn will be crucial in helping to meet the challenge of an ageing population which we face in the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned the most recent figures on house price developments in the economy. I am confident that the measures being <Col N="1523" /> taken in response to the Bacon report will continue to be successful in rectifying imbalances in the housing market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The tendering process for the construction of the European Union Food and Veterinary Office at Grange, Dunsany, County Meath was completed in June 1998 and a developer has been provisionally selected.  The Advisory Committee on Purchase and Contracts of the European Commission has given outline approval to the scheme subject to agreement on legal documentation. The legal documents required for the procurement and lease-purchase of the building are almost agreed with the Commission.  When the legal service of the European Commission gives its approval to the documentation work on the European Union Food and Veterinary Office will commence.  I am confident that work will start very early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has tabled proposals for a new financial perspective to cover the period 2000-2006.  The financial perspective sets out the maximum amount which may be spent on any category of expenditure in a given year.  Negotiations are on-going within Council, but it is fair to say that the perspective will only be agreed as part of the overall Agenda 2000 package &mdash; including such issues as agriculture and Structural Funding as well as enlargement financing, at the European Council in March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the implications of Agenda 2000, in terms of limiting expenditure under the Community budget, in such areas as agriculture and Structural Funds, are of major importance for Ireland.  Ireland has expressed serious concern at the more recent proposal of some member states for &ldquo;stabilisation&rdquo; of expenditure, and about the <Col N="1524" /> suggestion of national co-financing in the Common Agriculture Policy.  The issue of contributions to the Community budget is receiving examination as part of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy is based on the promotion of Ireland's strategic interests throughout the negotiations.  As Deputies will appreciate, I cannot go into more details of our negotiating stance but I assure them we intend to protect our interests to the greatest degree possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of bodies on their records which hold tax exemption as charitably exempt bodies at 1 December 1998 was 6,305.  As I informed the House in response to a number of questions asked on 17 November 1998, the Revenue Commissioners commenced a special project earlier this year to identify those charities granted exemption that are no longer in existence.  This project continues to detect bodies that have become defunct and the Revenue Commissioners believe that the number of active tax exempt bodies is less than 5,000.</P>
      <P>As I also informed the House previously, the Revenue Commissioners intend to make public a list of charitably exempt bodies.  The procedure being followed is that bodies which hold exemption are currently being consulted in relation to the publication of this list.</P>
      <P>Where an objection is raised by a body to its inclusion on the list the Information Commissioner will determine whether the objection should be upheld.  Subject to the outcome of these arrangements the Revenue Commissioners will provide the Deputies with a list of bodies granted exemption since 1967.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 29 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting with the German Finance Minister lasted one hour and two main topics were discussed, namely the EU budget and the German contribution to it and tax co-ordination within EU.  Mr. Lafontaine and myself set out our respective positions on various matters relating to these two issues.  It was not a negotiating session but a preliminary exchange of views in the light of the fact that Germany will take over the EU Presidency on 1 January next.  I emphasised that as far as Ireland was concerned tax harmonisation was not part of the scenario and that I favoured the route proposed by Commissioner Monti which was the code of conduct on business taxation aimed at combating harmful tax competition. Mr. Lafontaine spoke in terms of improving co-ordination of tax policy within the EU rather than establishing uniform tax rates.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the meeting with Mr. Lafontaine and from the subsequent discussions at the Vienna Summit that harmonising business or personal tax rates in the Community is not on the agenda.  This is confirmed in the agreed conclusions to the Vienna Summit:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-operation in the tax policy area is not aiming at uniform tax rates and is not inconsistent with fair tax competition but is called for to reduce the continuing distortions in the single market, to prevent excessive losses of tax revenues <Col N="1527" /> or to get tax structures to develop in a more employment-friendly way.</P>

      <P>I accompanied the Taoiseach to the European Council in Vienna on 12 and 13 December, which the European Commission and the European Central Bank also attended.  In addition, my Department communicates with the European Commission regularly, both formally and informally, in respect of a wide range of matters. However, I assume that the Deputy is specifically referring in his question to communications in relation to the budget, In that respect, following the presentation of the budget for 1999 on 2 December 1998, I submitted Ireland's Stability Programme for 1999 to 2001, to the Council of Ministers and to the European Commission on 3 December, in accordance with Council Regulation No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997.</P>
      <P>The Stability Programme was submitted in accordance with the Council's 1 May declaration, in which Ministers undertook to submit national stability or convergence programmes at the latest by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the Irish Stability Programme will be considered by ECOFIN at its meeting of 18 January 1998.</P>
      <P>Regarding the European Central Bank, it has not been assigned any formal role in the mechanisms for multilateral surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact, and therefore the question of submitting the Stability Programme to the ECB, in that context does not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment and training levy and the health contribution combined currently amount to 2.25 per cent.  The restructuring which I announced in my Budget Statement on 2 December will reduce the overall levies burden by 0.25 per cent, to 2 per cent.  This is consistent <Col N="1528" /> with the commitment in the Government's policy programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, which aims to lower the burden of levies and PRSI.  It is also consistent with the approach recommended by the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, that the levies should be phased out over time as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to apply the reduced yield from the levies to support the provision of health services for the public.  This involves abolition of the employment and training levy and the application of the reduced yield from the combined levies to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish the employment and training levy reflects the changed employment situation. The increase in employment, the fall in unemployment and the continuing rise in the qualifications of those seeking work mean that we no longer need a dedicated funding mechanism to provide resources for the drive to achieve full employment.  On the other hand, spending on health services is increasing very rapidly.  When adjusted for extraordinary factors such as the hepatitis C compensation payments, this expenditure reached £2,000 million for the first time in 1994, but will total some £3,000 million in 1998. In these circumstances, the Government considers that the public should be made aware of the cost of the continued improvements in the health services and have, therefore, decided that the proceeds of the levies should, from now on, be devoted entirely to financing the health services. The effect of the change is expected to bring the share of the gross Vote for the Department of Health and Children paid for by the health contribution to just over 11 per cent in 1999.</P>

      <P>I have been made fully aware of the concerns of the Debt and Development Coalition, and other organisations and individuals who have taken an interest in the alleviation of Third World Debt and the issue of the social impact of adjustment programmes.  Their views were taken into account by the Government in the formulation of its response to the requests for funding for the joint IMF/World Bank HIPCs debt initiative.  The Deputies will already be familiar with the Government's debt relief package and the principles which will guide the Government's policy on third world debt and structural adjustment, the details of which were announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me on 16 September last.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Finance I have taken a deep interest in the issue of Third World debt and I have through my Department maintained an open policy as regards contacts with all interest groups on the issue.  My officials and I have had numerous contacts with the NGOs concerned, and have sought to address their concerns on matters relating to the debt initiative and the ESAF facility of the IMF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sought to give them assurances that Ireland will continue to use the influence available to it to work for the implementation of both ESAF and the debt initiative on the most favourable terms possible for the countries affected.  I have also sought to convey to them that the current debt relief mechanisms &mdash; the HEPCs and ESAF programmes &mdash; represent a major step forward on the issue of dealing with the indebtedness of the poorer countries.  The HEPC debt initiative marks the first concerted effort by international governments and financial institutions to deal with this huge and complex problem in a pragmatic and workable fashion.  Clearly, the debt initiative as it stands is not the final destination for the international effort.  Nothing short of the complete elimination of poverty can be accepted as the ultimate goal of all our development efforts.  I am on record as saying the debt <Col N="1530" /> initiative will need to be accelerated, widened and deepened.  However, I am concerned that for at least ten years Ireland has been to the fore in the advocating debt relief but has not made a single contribution to debt relief.  This position is no longer acceptable to me or my Government colleagues. The time has long since passed for this country to move from rhetoric to action by supporting debt relief by actual cash payments.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to note that the developing countries within the United Nations sponsored a resolution calling of the developed countries to support the ESAF facility and the debt initiative financially.  The resolution on enhancing international co-operation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries was adopted unanimously on 15 December by the UN General Assembly. The resolution calls for a speedy and determined extension of the HIPC framework &mdash; something which has been strongly urged by the Irish Government and by me in my ongoing contacts with the World Bank and the IMF &mdash; and also expresses &ldquo;strong support for the continuation of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that neither HIPC nor ESAF are perfect instruments &mdash; no administrative system ever was &mdash; and I am determined to ensure that the WF and the World Bank will take ownership and social impacts into account in planning, designing and implementing their programmes. Yet I hope that everybody will at last recognise that both tools, as the UN resolution which was endorsed and supported by all developing countries points out, are accepted internationally as valid components of the response of the international community to the needs of the developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting of the euro 11 group, held on 23 November 1998, was attended by the Secretary-General of the Department of Finance and me. Among the items discussed were general economic policy, corporate tax harmonisation and external representation.  As the Deputy is aware, discussions at euro 11 are of a strictly confidential nature.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Finance Ministers of the European Union, held on the same day, consisted of the following issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ECOFIN considered the progress of Agenda 2000 negotiations, focusing on stabilisation and the own resources system.  Some member states have suggested a system of budgetary stabilisation, as opposed to the Commission's proposed financial perspective.  During this debate, I <Col N="1531" /> emphasised the clear need to provide sufficient resources for the orderly development of the Unions' policies.</P>
    <P>The Council held an exchange of views on the Commission's own resources report on the operation of the own resources system.  Items discussed included the performance of the present system as well as the equity of gross contributions.</P>
    <P>On Communication or a Framework for Action, I can also report that the ECOFIN Council considered a document prepared by the European Commission titled &ldquo;Financial Services: Building a Framework for Action&rdquo;.  The Council had instructed the Commission at the Cardiff Summit to prepare a paper on a framework for action to improve the single market for financial services.</P>
    <P>The Commission paper reviewed financial services relating to wholesale markets, retail financial markets, supervisory co-operation and taxation. In its communication the Commission concluded that, against the background of the introduction of the euro, EU financial services legislation needs to be enforced effectively but does not require a major overhaul.  Delegations stressed the need to achieve the single market in financial services and welcomed the Commission's proposal that a high-level group be set up to identify priorities in this area.</P>
    <P>The temporary high-level Financial Services Policy Group, to be composed of personal representatives of ECOFIN Ministers and chaired by the Commission, is to draw up a report identifying the political priorities in the area of financial services.  The report is to be presented to ECOFIN next June.  The group is to examine four areas: where new legal initiatives will be required, where existing provisions have to be adapted to new developments, where existing provisions need to be simplified and where existing provisions should be more coherent.  The Council underlined that the group should give the necessary consideration to consumer protection.</P>
    <P>A proposal for a directive concerning the distance selling of financial services, which was adopted by the Commission on 14 October, was presented to the Council.  The proposal is intended to amend Directives 90/619/EEC, 97/7/EC and 98/27EC and thus complement existing provisions on distance selling of goods and services other than financial services.  The aim of the proposed directive is to ensure a high level of protection for consumers of retail financial services marked by telephone, electronic means, such as the Internet, or by mail.  The proposal was welcomed by the President, who emphasised that consumers should have the same legal certainty for transnational business in financial services as they enjoy at national level.  The Council mandated the examination of this proposal with a view to reaching an agreement on a common position.</P>
    <P>Ministers were presented with a report on services <Col N="1532" /> of general economic interest in the banking sector which was prepared by the European Commission.  The Commission's report contains a study of services of general economic interest in the banking sector and sets out the criteria that will be taken into account when evaluating these services.  It is up to the Commission to ensure the application of competition and state aid rules and in this respect the report does not preclude or prejudge any decision that the Commission may arrive at as it evaluates, on a case by case basis, the practices set out in the report.  There are currently no credit institutions in Ireland that perform services of a general economic interest.</P>
    <P>Ministers had a brief exchange of views on developments in the area of risk capital focusing on the aspects highlighted in the communication and action plan which the Commission had submitted to the Cardiff European Council, a revised version of which was considered at the June 1998 ECOFIN in Luxembourg.  The Commission's paper included an action plan to remove barriers to risk capital markets contributing to the growth of SMEs leading to increased employment.  I welcomed the Commission's communication on risk capital and the timely opportunity it presented to examine the role that pan-European risk-capital markets can play in job creation in Europe.</P>
    <P>While I should point out that the majority of the proposals under the action plan will fall to be implemented by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I can, however, assure the Deputy that that Department has indicated that the Commission paper represents a reasonable attempt to identify the shortcomings of the EU risk capital market and to present solutions thereto.</P>
    <P>On employment, the Council pushed forward with the agenda for completing a joint employment report and preparing employment guidelines for 1999.  Account was taken of progress that had been made on this same agenda also at the Labour and Social Affairs Council of 20 November, that is a few days previously.  Considerable progress was made so as to permit the ECOFIN and Labour and Social Affairs Councils at a joint meeting of the two Councils on 1 December, to be in a position to clear the report and the guidelines for submission to the Vienna European Council.</P>
    <P>The President of the Court of Auditors presented the Court's report on the execution of the 1997 budget.  The report will now be examined in detail and ECOFIN will return to it early next year when it will deal with the discharge recommendation.</P>
    <P>On Efficient Financial Management and SEM 2000 &mdash; Council Conclusions &mdash; the Council welcomed the fourth progress report on the matter of sound financial management and complimented it on progress since its first report in 1996. The importance of continuing to improve co-operation between the Commission and member states, particularly in order to remedy shortcomings identified by the Court of Auditors, was <Col N="1533" /> emphasised.  The Council invited the group to become actively involved in other aspects of financial management and control especially in relation to applicant countries, implementing Agenda 2000, re-casting the Council's financial regulation &mdash; relation to the Communities general budget &mdash; and any proposals conducive to improving financial management and control and fighting fraud.</P>
    <P>The Council urged the Commission to monitor EU expenditure more efficiently so as to reduce the concentration of budget transactions at the end of the financial year.  It invited the Commission to ensure more systematic development of evaluation of results achieved and of the costeffectiveness ratio of Community expenditure and Community measures pursuant to the Council's financial regulation.  Finally, the Council underlined the need for effective financial control of all categories of expenditure, including external aid, in the light of the necessary decentralisation of the management of Community expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of the Commission's anti-fraud work programme.</P>
    <P>On combating counterfeiting of the euro: the Council welcomed measures being undertaken by the European Central Bank and member states to combat counterfeiting.  The ECB and the Commission were invited to consider whether there was a need for any further action in this area.</P>
    <P>On regulations on agents authorised by the Commission to carry out controls and inspections on the communities' own resources the Permanent Representatives Committee was mandated to reach agreement on one outstanding issue relating to this regulation.</P>
    <P>Some member states raised specific points relating to the 1999 EU Budget.  It was agreed that this matter is best considered at the Budget Council.</P>
    <P>Ministers at the ECOFIN Council met with the EU social partners over lunch.  The discussion was conducted in broad terms and consisted of an exchange of views on the economic and employment situation in the EU.  On foot of the introduction of the euro, dialogue between the Council and the social partners will be intensified in view of the need to achieve a balanced macroeconomic policy mix covering monetary, fiscal and income policies.</P>
    <P>The Council approved a number of principles to apply to the issue of collector coins in euro.</P>
    <P>Ministers informally discussed the possibility of further assistance to Central American Countries hit by hurricane &ldquo;Mitch&rdquo;.  The Monetary Committee was asked to examine, in particular, the question of a common EU approach to debt relief for these countries.</P>

      <P>At this stage, I am unable to provide this information as the details of staffing by grade and Department will only be known when the details of the 1999 Estimates allocations have been settled. However, I do have information regarding the overall projected level of recruitment to the different sectors in the public service in 1999, based on the approved Estimates allocations for Departments and Departments' best estimates of additional recruitment arising from these allocations.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this information, approximately 7,150 extra staff are expected to be employed in the public service at the end of 1999.  Most of these extra staff will be recruited in the health sector, where numbers are expected to increase by approximately 5,000 due to service improvements. A further 1,300 or so will be recruited in the education sector.  The balance of the increase will be in the Civil Service and other sectors.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the recruitment of extra staff inevitably arises from increased allocations for priority services, mainly in health and education.  The Government will confine increases to those areas which have the most direct and effective impact on the provision of necessary public services, having regard to the Government's overall budgetary policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals on the table for harmonising business or personal tax rates within the EU.  Recent discussions at the ECOFIN Council and at the Vienna Summit last week have taken place in the context of improving cooperation in tax policy and combating harmful tax competition. This was confirmed in the agreed conclusions to the Vienna Summit.  Co-operation in the tax policy area is not aiming at uniform tax rates and is not inconsistent with fair tax competition but is called for to reduce the continuing distortions in the single market, to prevent excessive losses of tax revenues and to get tax structures to develop in a more employment friendly way.</P>
      <P>As tax harmonisation is not on the agenda, the question of consulting the International Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group does not arise.</P>

      <P>As no ECOFIN meeting took place on 7 December 1998, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the ECOFIN meeting which took place on 1 December 1998.  The following issues were considered at that meeting.</P>
      <P>The Council noted the first interim report of the group which was set up to implement the code of conduct on business taxation agreed by ECOFIN in December 1998.  Council also noted a report by the Commission on the code of conduct and a communication from the Commission on the application of state aid rules to business tax measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed that a conclusion on a draft Directive on savings taxation should be aimed for by June 1999.  The importance of equivalent measures being adopted with non-EU countries was recognised.  It was agreed that a Troika approach made up of the past, present and following presidencies of the Council together with the Commission should conduct exploratory contacts with specific third countries to this end.  It is anticipated that the Commission would present a <Col N="1536" /> report on the discussions with third countries at the ECOFIN Council meeting in March 1999.</P>
    <P>ECOFIN took note of discussions to date on the question of energy taxation and that further work would continue during the German Presidency. Ireland and other member states stressed the need to take account of the impact on industrial competitiveness and on price trends in future discussions.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on a progress report to the Vienna European Council setting out developments in relation to the code of conduct, tax on savings, abolition of withholding taxes on interest and royalties between associated companies and energy tax.  It also agreed that the Commission should do a further study on company taxation in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on a report to the Vienna European Council on the state of preparation of Stage 3 of EMU concerning, in particular, the external representation of the Community.  In its work on this matter, the Council has benefited from substantial help from the Commission and the ESCB/ECB in their respective fields of competence.</P>
    <P>The external representation in Stage 3 of EMU will imply changes in the current organisation of international fora.  Therefore, third countries and institutions will need to be persuaded to accept the solutions proposed by the European Union. The Council considered that a pragmatic approach might be the most successful which could minimise the adaptation of current rules and practices provided, of course, that such an approach resulted in an outcome which recognised properly the role of the euro.  In developing this pragmatic approach, the Council concentrated its work on three important areas: representation at the G7 Finance Ministers and governors group; representation at the International Monetary Fund; and composition of ECOFIN delegations for missions to third countries.</P>
    <P>As far as G7 is concerned, non-European partners have already accepted that the President of the ECB attends meetings of the group for discussions which relate to EMU.</P>
    <P>Regarding the representation of the Community at ministerial level on EMU issues, the Council agreed to suggest to the other G7 partners to have the President of ECOFIN, or if the President came from a non-euro area member state, the President of the euro 11 at the table.  If the President came from a non G7 euro area state, he/she would attend in addition to the euro area members already present at G7 meetings.</P>
    <P>In a transitional phase, one of the euro area Ministers who are involved in the G7 group on a permanent basis will, for the sake of greater continuity, provide support for the President of the ECOFIN-euro 11 on a rotating basis for a term of one year.  The Council also agreed to suggest to the other G7 partners that a Commmission representative shall be a member of the Community delegation.</P>
    <P>With regard to representation at the IMF, the <Col N="1537" /> Council considered that pragmatic solutions for presenting issues of particular relevance to EMU may have to be sought which do not require a change in the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. A first necessary step has already been taken; the IMF executive board agreed to grant the ECB an observer position on that board.  Second, the views of the European Community-EMU would be presented at the IMF board by the relevant member of the Executive Director's office of the member state holding the euro 11 presidency, assisted by a representative from the Commission. As for missions to third countries, the composition of ECOFIN-euro 11 delegations may vary with the circumstances and the objectives, it being the responsibility of the President of the Council-euro 11 to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed a report to be presented to the Vienna Council on economic policy co-ordination. The report identifies the reasons for economic policy co-ordination and the means by which this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Council approved a report to the Vienna European Council on strengthening the international financial system drawn up further to the request of the Heads of State or Government meeting in Portschach in response to the recent financial crisis.</P>
    <P>The report, prepared by the Monetary Committee, underlines the need for EU member states to show both leadership and willingness to push forward ideas for reform in order to deal with weaknesses in the mechanisms of the international financial system for crisis prevention and resolution as well as weaknesses in emerging market economies, as exposed by the recent financial turmoil.</P>
    <P>The Council reached political agreement on the two decisions concerning respectively the composition and the statute of the Economic and Financial Committee which is to replace the Monetary Committee at the beginning of Stage 3 of EMU.  The resolution on co-ordination of economic policies adopted by the 1997 Luxembourg European Council had established that the EFC should be composed of high-level officials from the national Finance Ministries, the national central banks, the Commission and from the ECB.</P>
    <P>Under the first decision concerning the composition of the EFC, the member states, the Commission and the European Central Bank will each appoint two members and may also appoint two alternate members.  These members will be selected from among experts possessing outstanding competence in the economic and financial field.</P>
    <P>The second decision concerning the statute of the EFC stipulates in particular that the tasks to be carried out by the Committee are those described in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 109 (c) of the Treaty and, moreover, that the Committee be consulted in the procedure leading to decisions relating to the exchange-rate mechanism of the third stage of economic and monetary union <Col N="1538" /> (ERM 11); prepare the Council's reviews of the development of the exchange-rate of the euro, without prejudice to Article 151 of the Treaty; provide the framework within which the dialogue between the Council and the European Central Bank can be prepared and continued at the level of senior officials from ministries, national central banks, the Commission and the ECB.</P>
    <P>This decision also establishes that the Committee will elect, by majority vote, its President from among its members who are senior officials in the national administrations, for a period of two years.  This term is renewable.</P>
    <P>The Council invited the Commission to put forward a recommendation for a Council Decision enabling the French Government to negotiate new monetary arrangements with the Monegasque authorities.  These monetary arrangements relate to the rules governing the relations between credit institutions located in Monaco and the Bank of France.</P>
    <P>On Agenda 2000 Council discussed a number of detailed options and possible solutions to some key questions which were raised at the informal ECOFIN meeting in Vienna.  It was generally acknowledged that the new financial framework should be based on two fundamental principles: the need to ensure strict budgetary discipline at EU level and the need to ensure that there are sufficient resources at the disposal of the Union to ensure the orderly development of its policies and to cope effectively with the process of enlargement.</P>
    <P>Council examined the future volume of expenditure. Following this examination discussions focused on the concept of real stabilisation of expenditure and how it relates to the drawing up of the new financial perspective.  The interdependence between successful policy reform and the principle of strict budgetary discipline and their mutual compatibility is acknowledged by most member states.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Community's own resources system, a preliminary examination has taken place on the issues and options mentioned in the Commission's report on the operation of the own resources system.  The report is considered by many member states to provide a good basis for guiding future discussions.</P>
    <P>The Council reached political agreement on a common position concerning a proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of transEuropean networks.  The Council will adopt formally the common position at a forthcoming session before the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>The proposal for this regulation was tabled by the Commission on 11 May 1998 in the framework of the Agenda 2000 exercise.  The European Parliament has given its opinion on 19 November in the framework of the cooperation procedure.</P>
    <P>The Council examined and welcomed the Stability Programme of the Netherlands 1999-2002. The Council opinion on the programme was <Col N="1539" /> adopted.  The Council noted that the programme was based on significant progress towards fiscal consolidation and aims to reduce further the general government deficit and debt.  The objective of limiting growth in Government expenditure was welcomed.  In addition, the Council welcomed the continued emphasis on economic reform.</P>
    <P>The Council also examined the Convergence Programme of Denmark 1998-2005.  The Council opinion on the programme was adopted.  The focus in the programme on budgetary consolidation underpinned by continued economic reform was welcomed.  The Council noted that the programme was consistent with the broad economic guidelines.  In addition, it was noted that the programme is already consistent with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
    <P>On employment, the Council approved the draft 1998 joint employment report on the draft employment guidelines for 1999, and subsequently on the same day held a joint meeting with the Labour and Social Affairs Council on the same subject.  This cleared the way for the employment initiatives in the guidelines to be brought forward and adopted at the Vienna European Council.</P>
    <P>On Facilitating the Reconstruction efforts in Central America, the Council and Ministers meeting in the Council agreed a statement covering humanitarian aid, bilateral and multilateral debt and reconstruction efforts.</P>
    <P>The Council discussed the issue of duty free and tax free shopping for EU travellers after 1999.  While a number of member states were in favour of retention of this facility, others did not agree to an extension and the presidency concluded that there was no unanimity.  This was also the subject of a later discussion at the European Council in Vienna.</P>
    <P>As part of its ECOFIN conclusions, the Council issued a detailed timetable for the adoption of the conversion rates on 31 December 1998 as follows.  One, at the end of the regular central bank concertation procedure &mdash; 11.30 CET &mdash; the Commission will calculate the final official ECU exchange rates for the participating currencies in line with the established procedure.  The Commission will propose these rates for adoption by the Council as the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro at 12.30 &mdash; CET &mdash; in a televised</P>
    <P>Council session.  At the same time the Commission will make these rates public via internet and financial information providers.  Two, the Council will adopt the regulation and inform the public of its adoption at around 13.30 &mdash; CET.  In addition, the Commission will make the adoption public by the same means as when it publishes the proposed rates.  Three, the regulation will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and the regulation will be applicable as from 1 January 1999, 0.00 a.m. local time.</P>

      <P>The tribunal of inquiry on payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry was appointed by instrument of An Taoiseach dated 26th day of September 1997 pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979.</P>
      <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1997 provide that a tribunal may make such orders as it considers necessary for the purposes of its functions, and it shall have, in relation to their making, all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court or a judge of that court in respect of the making of orders.</P>
      <P>The Acts also provide that where a person fails or refuses to comply with or disobeys an order of a tribunal, the High Court may, on application to it in a summary manner in that behalf by the tribunal, order the person to comply with the order and make such other order as it considers necessary and just to enable the order to have full effect.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made to date by the construction industry sub-group of the black economy monitoring group, particularly in regard to subcontracting in the construction industry and the operation of the C45 system; the number of occasions on which the committee has met during 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that comprehensive recommendations made by the construction industry sub-group of the Black Economy Monitoring Group in 1994 resulted in administrative and legislative changes in the operation of the C45 system.  The majority of the group's recommendations concerned closer monitoring of the system by the Commissioners, improved information flow between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Revenue, and the redesign of forms to ensure that sufficient information is available to match records in both Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative changes were made in the Finance Act, 1996 and came under two broad headings. First, a requirement was introduced making it necessary for parties who intend to enter a relevant <Col N="1541" /> contract to complete a specific declaration. The declaration confirms that the parties to the proposed contract, having read the Commissioners' guidelines &mdash; which are printed on the reverse of the declarations &mdash; as to the difference between relevant contracts and contracts of employment have satisfied themselves that the contract which they propose to enter is not a contract of employment.</P>
    <P>Second, where a principal contractor makes any payment to a leader of a group he must deduct tax at 35 per cent by reference to each member of the group for whom he has not received a relevant payments card from the Inspector of Taxes.  Details of amounts due to individual members must be supplied to the principal contractor to enable him to determine the tax to be deducted from each individual.  The RSI number and date of birth of each group member must also be supplied for inclusion on the relevant contracts tax deduction certificate.</P>
    <P>During 1997-1998 the Revenue Commissioners undertook a very intensive special project to monitor all aspects of compliance in the construction industry.  In the course of that project more than 7,000 principal contractors were visited.  No problems were found in 52 per cent of cases.  Of the balance, 76 per cent agreed with Revenue rulings. The remainder are subject to different aspects of follow up action which many include additional visits, a comprehensive Revenue audit and assessments of additional tax where necessary.</P>
    <P>The construction industry sub-group did not meet during 1998 but, of course, as I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy on 17 November 1998 any member of the sub-group may call for a meeting of the group if he or she considers that there are black economy issues relating to the construction industry which could usefully be dealt with by the sub-group.  However, I must point out that black economy issues relating to the construction industry are also dealt with by the main Black Economy Monitoring Group which meets approximately every two months and met on six occasions in 1998, the most recent such meeting being on 8 December 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the financial services sector, the 1996. ESRI report entitled The Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU concluded that this sector will have to meet significant, non-recurring, conversion costs with the introduction of the euro. The report also concluded that this sector will suffer <Col N="1542" /> the ongoing loss of a proportion of its foreign exchange business, which, of course, is the counterpart of the transaction cost savings of other sectors.  The report pointed out that the losses arising from a reduction in the size of the foreign exchange market would be reduced by a UK decision not to join EMU from the outset. The report also considered that, assuming economic activity generally increases as a result of the single currency, much of the losses could be expected to be offset by the resultant increase in business in the financial services sector so that eventually the net change in employment should be relatively small.</P>
      <P>EMU will significantly enhance the size and liquidity of the financial markets and facilitate the completion of the internal market in the financial sector.  The financial sector will be in the front line of the changes arising from the introduction of the single currency.  An efficient financial sector is vital not only to secure its own future growth but also to transmit the full benefits of the single currency to the economy generally.  The efficiency of the financial sector is a crucial component in the competitiveness of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The primary macroeconomic objective of the Government is the continuation of sustained economic and employment growth supported by social partnership, low inflation and prudent budgetary policies.  This is essential to ensure Ireland's successful participation in stage 3 of EMI and is critical to a continuation of economic and social progress.  Such stability-oriented policies will provide a sound footing for all sectors of the economy, including the financial services sector, to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the introduction of the euro in about two weeks time.</P>
      <P>With particular regard to the International Financial Services Centre, the IFSC Clearing House Group, a working group under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department, and made up of private and public sector representatives, including representatives from my Department, is currently preparing a strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strategy, building on the success of the IFSC, will focus on the need to maximise the level of sustainable economic activity and employment in international financial services in Ireland.  Steps have already been taken in this direction, of course, with the decision made by the Government to apply into the future a single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax on company profits, generally, in place of preferential tax regimes such as the IFS which will come to an end in a few years time.  Other issues which the strategy being developed will address include: measures necessary to further enhance the competitiveness of international financial services activities in Ireland; the future marketing and promotion of the sector; measures to ensure a continued supply of skilled employees for financial service companies; <Col N="1543" /> the implications of the introduction of the euro; new business opportunities based around the existing level of financial services activity in the IFSC, and the future location of international financial services companies and the provision of infrastructure for the continued growth of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>In short, appropriate structural policies for the development of the competitiveness of our economy, as well as prudent budgetary and incomes policies will be the key to ensuring that we cope successfully with the challenges of EMU and take maximum advantage of the new opportunities which will emerge.</P>

      <P>The independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks in the exercise of the tasks of the European system of central banks &mdash; composed of the ECB and national central banks &mdash; is explicitly guaranteed by the Treaty establishing the European Union.  Article 107 of the Treaty provides that when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body.  The Article also provides that Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between the independence of the ECB and the need for accountability. The Treaty provides for an appropriate degree of accountability as a counterbalance to independence of the ECB and the national central banks.  Under the Treaty, the ECB must draw up and publish reports on the activities of the European system of central banks at least quarterly. The ECB must submit an annual report on the activities of the ESCB and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and also to the European Council. The President of the ECB must present this report to the Council and to the European Parliament, which may hold a general debate on the report.  The President of the ECB and the other members of the executive board may, at the <Col N="1544" /> request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, appear before the competent committees of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also provides for a framework for continuous dialogue between the Council of Ministers and the ECB, respecting their respective competences.  The President of the Council of Ministers may participate, without having the right to vote, in meetings of the ECB Governing Council and may submit motions for deliberation. The President of the ECB shall be invited to participate in Council meetings when the Council is discussing matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.</P>
    <P>In addition to these Treaty requirements, the ECB will be invited to take part, when appropriate, at the informal meetings of the euro 11 group &mdash; comprising the Ministers of the states participating in the euro area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the President of the ECB has indicated that he will hold a press conference, normally once a month, after one of the fortnightly meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB.  Also, I understand that the ECB intends to keep the public informed about its activities through speeches and regular publications.</P>

      <P>The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIC, is to be established under the British-Irish Agreement to replace and subsume both the conference established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council set up after the 1980 summit.  The BIIC will bring together the British and Irish Governments to promote bilateral co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  At this stage it is envisaged that the conference will concentrate primarily on non-devolved matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  In that context, I would not expect that the issue of links and co-operation in the area of standards in public life will arise on the conference agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the matter might be more appropriately raised at the British-Irish Council, BIC, which will also be established under strand three of the British-Irish Agreement.  The Agreement provides that the purpose of the BIC will be: &ldquo;to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of the islands&rdquo;.  Membership of the council will comprise representatives of the British and Irish Governments, devolved institutions <Col N="1545" /> in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales together with representatives of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>However I should point out that both of the bodies mentioned are not yet fully operational and detailed work programmes have yet to be worked out.  Against this background, the broad area of regulation of standards in public life is being raised with the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has ministerial responsibility for the British-Irish Council.</P>

      <P>In my budget speech at the start of this month, I restated the Government's commitment to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and improve the incentives to work.  I also stated my view that high tax rates in many areas of taxation &mdash; personal, corporation, capital, inheritance &mdash; lead to disincentives, evasion and finally less yield to the Exchequer, constraining Government in implementing socially progressive policies.</P>
      <P>Ireland's low rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and certain internationally-traded services has been one important element in attracting foreign direct investment and in encouraging, domestic enterprise.  The policy has contributed to a substantial increase in employment. The yield from corporation tax has increased significantly during the present decade. With regard to capital taxation, there has been a significant increase in the yield from this area. Some of this increase may be attributable to the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax in the 1998 budget.  The buoyancy of these tax categories has supported the significant reduction in the burden of personal taxation which I introduced in my first two budgets.</P>
      <P>In budget 1998, I reduced both the standard and higher rates of tax by 2 per cent, and in budget 1999, earlier this month, I introduced a major reform of the tax system to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to further maximise the incentive to work.  I also made reference to environmental taxation issues in the budget speech, and among the measures I announced in this context were a reduction in motor LPG and an increase in the vehicle registration tax on certain motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to green tax policy I made it clear in the budget that there was a need to put in place an agreed indirect tax policy which will assist us in meeting our environmental obligations on CO 2 emissions and I indicated that the formulation of <Col N="1546" /> such agreed policy measures should be part of the discussions on the successor to Partnership 2000. I also acknowledged that green taxes might help shift the burden from other areas such as labour but that there were inflation and low income aspects that needed to be addressed in formulating such a policy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is not possible for a Minister for Finance to act on all the proposals, pre-budget submissions and recommendations which are received.</P>
      <P>With regard to recommendations in relation to so called green taxation, I refer the Deputy to the following specific measures which were announced in my budget: restructuring of the VRT rates; the tax incentives for park and ride facilities; that monthly rail and bus passes provided by employers for employees will not be subject to benefit-in-kind tax; the review of the introduction of benefit-in-kind tax on car parking spaces made available by employers; and a reduction of excise duty on liquid petroleum gas. These particular initiatives were sought as part of a process of greening the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Multiannual budgeting aims to put in place a framework within which the Government can consider and decide its overall budgetary, taxation and expenditure priorities in a medium-term context.</P>
      <P>Progress towards putting that framework in place was made in the 1997 and 1998 budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the presentation of the medium-term implications of my 1998 budget, projections were published showing expenditure by individual ministerial Vote groups for the period 1998-2000. <Col N="1547" /> The projections were on the basis of a no-policy-change assessment of the final 1998 expenditure allocations decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>In my 1998 budget, I said that I would be considering, as part of the preparations for the 1999 budget, the next stage of the move to multiannual budgeting.  This would involve the Government making decisions for resource allocation over a three-year period covering the main budget aggregates of taxation, expenditure and borrowing.</P>
    <P>Voted expenditure, current and capital, would be disaggregated into financial envelopes for ministerial Vote groups.  The envelopes would be the amounts to be allocated to Departments for the three years, 1999-2001, within which they would be expected to manage their spending, including the cost of any new policies or improvements in existing services, provided that the economy and the overall budgetary magnitudes developed as predicted.</P>
    <P>The methodology for deciding on the financial envelopes is as follows: aggregate limits on spending, current and capital, are decided by the Government, in the overall budget context, on my recommendation, for the relevant period; the Estimates and public capital programme are decided by the Government for the first year of the period and the associated no-policy-change costings for the later years are agreed and decided; the difference between the decided aggregate spending limits and the aggregate no-policy-change costs is the margin by which planned spending should change.  This margin, and any further margin, created by the reallocation of resources between Vote groups, is allocated across Vote groups and, when added to their agreed no-policy-change costings, equals their financial envelopes.  Any decisions taken to reduce allocations below the no policy change level would add to the margin to be allocated. With my 1999 budget I again published projections showing expenditure by individual Vote groups for 2000 and 2001 on a no-policy-change basis.</P>
    <P>These were set out in two tables in the document on Budget statistics and tables.  Table 4(a) covers current expenditure.  It includes, as well as no policy change projections for each Vote group for the years 2000 and 2001, a provision for unallocated current expenditure.  That provision is the amount which is available within the Government's limit of 4 per cent average annual growth in net current expenditure for allocation across Vote groups above the projected expenditure for those groups on a no policy change basis.  Table 5(a) dealt in a similar manner with capital expenditure, except that there the unallocated amount was that available consistent with an annual increase of 5 per cent over the total 1999 budget capital allocation.  Both tables are subject to the outcome of the national plan and community support framework negotiations.</P>
    <P>The figures for Vote groups in these tables are <Col N="1548" /> not financial envelopes.  In the budget I said that I would address the final phase of the move to multi-annual expenditure budgeting which will involve the Government making decisions on the allocation of resources across all Vote groups, and that decisions by the Government on this issue by the end of the first quarter of 1999 will allow Departments ample time to plan their spending in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>The principal mechanisms for ensuring that multi-annual budget decisions are arrived at and held to are basically the same as those long used in deciding budgetary issues, namely decision making, by the Government, and approval by the Dáil.  The Government will make the decisions on budgetary targets and financial envelopes.  Dáil approval will continue to be required for the annual taxation measures and Estimates.</P>
    <P>Multi-annual budgeting does not aim further to constrain any of the principal actors in their decision making or actions, nor to limit dialogue on what the Government's and the community's future priorities should be.</P>

    </table>
    <P>I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the motor industry, which has been experiencing considerable growth in car sales.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the VRT figures for 1998 to date show that 57 per cent of new car sales are in the up to 1,400 cc bracket.  These sales are not affected by the budget announcement.  A further 39 per cent of new car sales are in the 1,401 to 2,000 cc bracket. These face a price rise of 3.3 per cent.  Only 4 per cent are in the 2,001 cc + bracket which face a price rise up to 10.7 per cent.  Most manufacturers have models below 1,600 ccs, exceptions being manufacturers of luxury and sports car marques.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the vehicle registration tax, that the average increase in VRT in respect of 1,600 cc motor cars is in the region of £468 which, given the lower rates of interest for borrowers, could not be deemed excessive in the context of the overall price of a new motor car.</P>

      <P>Following, the changes announced in the 1999 budget, the number of taxpayers who will pay income tax at the higher rate for the 1999/2000 tax year is estimated to be of the order of 485,000.  This represents a reduction of 17,000 on the numbers who <Col N="1550" /> would have been paying tax at the higher rate if no changes had been made in the budget.</P>
      <P>Deputies should note that, because the main personal allowances and the PAYE allowance are now standard rated, they will no longer count towards the threshold at which taxpayers become liable to the higher rate of tax.  In future, the standard rated personal allowances and PAYE allowances will be deducted after tax is calculated rather than before the tax calculation as was the case up to now.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, at my specific request, the proposed abolition of duty free sales was placed on the agenda for the ECOFIN Council meeting on 19 May 1998.  While some member states were broadly supportive of my request, it was not possible to get the EU Commission to agree to undertake an EU wide study into the consequences of the abolition of duty free sales.  On 2 November 1998, I wrote to a number of my ECOFIN colleagues to say that, should the issue be raised again, we would appreciate their co-operation and assistance in handling it at Council.  I again raised the question of duty free at ECOFIN on 2 December 1998 and supported retention beyond June 1999.</P>
      <P>The issue was discussed at some length at the Vienna summit last weekend.  At the summit, the European Council asked the Commission and the Finance Ministers to examine, by March 1999, the problems which could arise with regard to employment should duty free sales be abolished, and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of the transition arrangements.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no responsibility for vehicle registration taxes applicable in member states.  Vehicle registration taxes of one form or other are applied in some member states.  These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and as such are not directly comparable. Some states' taxes are based on cc while others are based on fuel consumption; Germany, France, Luxembourg, Sweden and the UK do not charge VRT.</P>
    <P>The question of the harmonisation of vehicle registration taxes is a matter for the EU Commission in the first instance.  I am not aware of Commission proposals in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the reason traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and other forms of nonconventional treatments are not recognised within the meaning of paragraph three of the first schedule of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, which states that the professional services of a medical nature shall be exempt from VAT, in view of the fact they are medical or paramedical in nature; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Paragraph (iii) of the First Schedule of the VAT Act provides for the exemption from VAT of &ldquo;professional services of a medical nature&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is in line with the provisions of the EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.</P>
      <P>Article 13A(1)(c) of the directive states that the exemption shall apply to &ldquo;the provision of medical care in the exercise of the medical and paramedical professions as defined by the member state concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the treatments concerned in the Deputy's question are not officially recognised as professional services of a medical nature in the State by either the Department of Health or the governing body of the medical profession, they cannot be treated as exempt activities within the provisions of the VAT Act.</P>
      <P>Such treatments do however benefit from the lower rate of VAT of 12.5 per cent, under the Sixth Schedule to the VAT Act, as &ldquo;services consisting of care of the human body&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Because of this, practitioners who provide such services are entitled to recover VAT incurred on all purchases relating to the provision of such services. This is not the case with practitioners who are exempt from VAT.</P>

      <P>I have recently published full results of the outcomes of the first month of implementation of the preventative strategy.  I have arranged to have a copy of the report forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A total of 884 persons were scheduled to be interviewed by FÁS by end October 1998.  By that date 41 per cent of these had actually signed off the live register.  Of this 884, a total of 454 persons were actually interviewed and 42 per cent of these were placed in a job or placed in, or referred to, a training programme.</P>
      <P>A further 34 per cent continue to receive FÁS supports following their first guidance interview. Intensive interventions in the forms of further guidance, counselling, labour market programmes and job clubs supports are provided for this cohort attuned to the individual needs of clients to prepare them for transition into employment.</P>
      <P>No current action was being taken by FÁS in relation to the remaining 24 per cent of those interviewed, as persons had either dropped out of the process or declined an offer of intervention or no action was taken due to their personal circumstances. In many of these latter cases the persons concerned had by the end of October, left the live register.  Over time, the EAP process will provide a detailed profile of young unemployed and will assist in developing and designing further appropriate interventions.</P>

      <P>There is no formal adjudication procedure in place for members of the public who complain about nuisance or damage from aircraft using specific flight paths.  The Irish Aviation Authority, which is statutorily responsible for matters relating to air traffic control and air safety regulation, has published statutory requirements for aircraft operating in Irish airspace.  The authority will examine all complaints received in relation to aircraft flight paths, in accordance with its established internal procedures, and will take action if a breach of the statutory requirements has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise the Deputy that section 47 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, as amended by section 72 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, provides that unless the IAA <Col N="1561" /> statutory requirements are not being met there are no grounds for taking any action.  Section 47 states: &ldquo;An action shall not lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property at a height above the ground which, having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of the flight, so long as the provisions of any order made under Part II of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, to give effect to, or to supplement, the Chicago Convention have been duly complied with.&rdquo; It should also be noted that the authority's published departure flight procedures for jet aircraft at Dublin include noise abatement elements to minimise exposure to noise on the ground.  A Dublin airport noise management group has been established with the participation of Aer Rianta, the authority and representatives of the aviation industry, with the aim of developing and agreeing a noise management policy for Dublin airport. The group is currently examining ways of implementing a noise monitoring system for Dublin airport traffic.</P>

      <P>Due to the volume of work a backlog has arisen in the processing of applications under the scheme of early retirement from farming.  There has been considerable improvement in the situation in recent weeks and this application will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer.  The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Ireland has long been supportive of the retention of duty free sales and we have raised the issue at Council and with ECOFIN colleagues on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The House will also be aware, that the initiative in relation to having the decision to abolish duty free sales for intra-community travellers post 30 June 1999 overturned rests with the EU Commission, as a Commission proposal would be needed for any change from decisions already made.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House previously, at my specific request, the proposed abolition of duty free sales was placed on the agenda for the ECOFIN Council meeting on 19 May 1998.  While some member states were broadly supportive of my request, it was not possible to get the EU Commission to agree to undertake an EU wide study into the consequences of the abolition of duty free sales.  On 2 November 1998, I wrote to a number of my ECOFIN colleagues to say that, should the issue be raised again, we would appreciate their co-operation and assistance in handling it at Council.  I again raised it at ECOFIN on 2 December 1998 and supported retention beyond June 1999.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware, that the issue was discussed at some length at the Vienna Summit last weekend.  At the summit, the European Council asked the Commission and the Finance Ministers to examine by March 1999 the problems which could arise with regard employment &mdash; should duty free sales be abolished and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of the transition arrangements.</P>
      <P>This was very welcome news and I am hopeful that further progress may be made in the issue during the forthcoming German Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is treating the year 2000 problem very seriously and has instructed all Departments and offices to afford it top priority.</P>
      <P>Each Department and office is individually responsible for ensuring it achieves year 2000 compliance in good time.  All of them have comprehensive year 2000 programmes in place and remedial work has been ongoing since 1996.  The Government has instructed senior management to take a personal interest in overseeing this year 2000 compliance work, and each Department/office has established an internal monitoring committee, chaired by a senior manager, which reports to its senior management and Minister regularly on the progress they are making.</P>
      <P>The Government has also established an inter-departmental year 2000 monitoring committee, with private sector representation, to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment across the Civil</P>
      <P>Service.  The committee levies status updates on each Department/office every two months and, based on these updates, the committee reports to Government on the progress being achieved.  The committee has reported on five occasions to date.</P>
      <P>Some delays have been experienced from time to time by a number of Departments/offices in progressing this year 2000 programmes.  These have been caused primarily by staff losses and difficulties getting solutions from suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of actions have been taken to offset staff losses.  Many Departments/offices have deferred planned IT projects and the staffing resources established for these projects have been diverted to year 2000 remedial work.  In the case of the most critical Departments/offices, almost all IT staff are now working on year 2000 compliance programmes.  A sizeable number of staff who have been working on making systems euro compliant will become available very early in 1999 and many of these will be redeployed to year 2000 remedial work.  The Civil Service Commission and the Department of Finance are working together to ensure that effective recruitment/selection systems are in place to <Col N="1569" /> assure a constant and timely supply of suitable appointees to IT grades in Departments and offices throughout 1998 and 1999.  The Department of Finance is also concluding negotiations with the Civil Service unions on a package of measures aimed at stemming losses from key IT areas.</P>
    <P>Senior management in all Departments/offices have been instructed to personally engage themselves in the year 2000 effort and implement whatever measures are necessary to ensure a timely response from suppliers.</P>
    <P>While a lot of work remains to be done, reasonable progress is being made and all Departments and offices are satisfied that they will achieve full compliance in good time.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on progress since the formation of the Government in relation to promoting greater openness, accountability and democracy participation in the conduct of public business.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25750/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its formation, the Government has progressed a range of measures to promote openness, accountability and participation in the conduct of public business.  These include initiatives in the following areas: Partnership 2000 provides for a National Centre for Partnership which will operate, in the first instance, for the period of P2000.  This has been established.  The following roles for the centre were identified in P2000; promotion of involvement and partnership; monitoring developments; technical assistance and support to organisations involved in developing involvement and partnership arrangements; dissemination of best practice, and training for management, union, employer and workplace representatives.</P>
      <P>The work programme of the centre reflects these roles.  The Deputy will be aware that the Freedom of Information Act commenced on 21 April 1998 for Government Departments and certain Government bodies.  This Act asserts the right of members of the public to obtain access to official information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.  The Act establishes three new statutory rights: a legal right for each person to access information held by public bodies; a legal right for each person to have official information, whether manually or electronically held, relating to him/herself amended where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading; and a legal right to obtain reasons for decisions affecting oneself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities and health boards came within the scope of the Act on 21 October 1998. Following consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, I have agreed to extend the Freedom of Information Act to voluntary hospitals and major voluntary agencies in the health sector who are in receipt of significant <Col N="1570" /> public funding.  These bodies will come within the scope of the Act at a date no later than 1 September 1999.</P>
    <P>This lead in time is required to allow adequate time for preparation of publications required under the Act, training of staff and implementation of necessary organisational arrangements to handle FOI requests.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be also be aware of the Government's proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill which are aimed at restoring confidence in public life through a credible policing mechanism for ethical issues.  Following resolutions in the Dáil and Seanad in July 1998, these proposals are currently being considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service in conjunction with the Committees on Members' Interests in both Houses.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, commits the Government to the restoration of real decision making and power to local authorities and local people.  In this context a significant range of initiatives which will facilitate greater participation in local government, both directly and indirectly, have been progressed.  These were referred to in detail by my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, in his reply to Deputy Gormley on 9 December 1998 and include: strategic policy committees, including representatives of local sectoral interests, have been established in city and county councils to enhance the policy making role of elected councillors and to involve the local community more closely in the work of the authorities; implementation of the recommendations of the recently published report of the Task Force on Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems will see local government and the wider community at the local level, including local development agencies and the social partners, working together on the proposed county/city development boards on the basis of real partnership.  The task force is overseeing implementation of the recommendations.  Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, to which my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government referred in his reply to Question No. 243 of 1 December 1998, will be established shortly and will deliver on the Government's commitment to increasing partnership and consultation on environmental policy.  It will also facilitate broad public participation in issues of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>Under the Public Service Management Act, 1997 organisational arrangements for civil servants are being made more transparent and effective in a number of ways.  The accountability of a Secretary General to his or her Minister is put on a statutory basis.  Such accountability is in respect of the exercise of authority and responsibility in relation to duties set out in the Act, subject to the determination of matters of policy by the Minister or the Government.  It includes the following: managing the day-to-day business of the Department; <Col N="1571" /> implementing Government policies appropriate to the Department; monitoring Government policies that affect the Department; delivering outputs as determined with the Minister; preparing and submitting to the Minister a strategy statement in respect of the Department; providing progress reports to the Minister on implementation of the strategy statement; providing advice to the Minister; ensuring proper use of resources and the provision of cost-effective public services; and assigning duties, analogous to those assigned to the Secretary General, to other officers or grades down through the Department.</P>
    <P>Officers who have been assigned functions are now being made accountable, in statute, to their Secretary General and to their line manager as appropriate.  Secretaries General, or other designated officers, must now appear before Oireachtas committees when requested to do so in relation to the strategy statement for the Department.  Civil servants assigned to crossdepartmental groups may now be made accountable for the utilisation of related financial resources with the agreement of, and in a manner to be specified by, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Subject to amendments to other legislation and consultation with staff, Secretaries General will exercise authority in relation to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of all civil servants below the grade of principal or its equivalent. Authority in relation to appointments, performance and discipline, but not dismissal, of all civil servants below the grade of principal or its equivalent may be assigned by the Secretary General to other grades of civil servant.</P>
    <P>Officers assigned duties will be directly accountable to the secretary general or other superior officers for the achievement of objectives and the delivery of specified outputs.</P>
    <P>Under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, all civil servants may be compelled to appear before an Oireachtas committee with power to send for persons or papers and, in such circumstances, may be granted privilege and immunity in relation to evidence.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of proposals for a Comptroller and Auditor General and Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Special Provisions) Bill 1998 which is currently before the Houses.  This will empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to Dáil Éireann on a range of issues relating to the deposit interest retention tax, non-residents' accounts, controversy.</P>
    <P>The QCS initiative was launched in May 1997 with the adoption of the principles of QCS by participating Departments and offices.  These principles include the setting of service standards, provision of information, timeliness and courtesy in service delivery, provision of complaints and redress mechanisms, meaningful consultation with customers and clients, choice in service <Col N="1572" /> delivery including payment methods and better access to public offices.</P>
    <P>The customer service action plans of Departments and offices, published at end 1997 or early 1998, set out steps the organisations are taking to achieve full implementation of the principles by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Regulatory reform is part of Delivering Better Government and is aimed at reducing red tape and increasing administrative simplification.  This is important internationally in the interests of reducing the burden on business, especially SMES.  A package of proposals in this area is being finalised and will be put to Government early in 1999.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Article 109L(4) of the Treaty on European Union, the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, will, acting with the unanimity of the member states without a derogation, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank, adopt a Council Regulation irrevocably fixing the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the member states adopting the euro.</P>
      <P>A joint communiqué of 1 December 1998 from the Council and the Commission announced that the Commission will propose the rates for adoption at 12.30 Central European time on 31 December 1998 in a televised Council session and that the Council will adopt the regulation and will inform the public of its adoption at around 13.30 CET.  The communiqué also states that the regulation will be applicable as from midnight local time on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>I will be attending the council meeting in Brussels.</P>
      <P>A reception to mark Ireland's entry into EMU, the launch of the euro and the announcement of the conversion rates for the euro will be held on 31 December in Leinster House. Members of the Government, all Members of the Oireachtas, Ireland's members of the European Parliament and the social partners will be invited.  The timing of the reception will coincide with the commission proposal and council adoption and will be hosted by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      <P>Those attending the reception will be given an information pack, copies of which will be sent afterwards to all members of the Oireachtas, on preparations for the changeover to the euro, including information on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland's public information programme and the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign.</P>

      <Col N="1573" /> With regard to ceremonies on 1 January 1999, it is planned to hold an event in the morning, in conjunction with the governor of the Central Bank, to which the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have been invited.  This event will involve a display of the euro conversion rate against the Irish pound.</P>

      <P>In the article in <i>IMPACT News</i> the Taoiseach spoke about the need for a new approach to public service pay in the period beyond Partnership 2000. Public service pay is an area of concern to the entire Government and to myself in particular. There are two basic issues behind the desire for a new system of public service pay determination: first, the need to get away from the old approach of leap-frogging pay claims and, second, the need for pay to more closely reflect performance.</P>
      <P>We have seen the effects of the old approach over the last year.  Pay increases achieved by one group of public service workers became the target increase for other groups on the basis of past relativities or perceived relativities.  The pursuit of comparable increases by certain groups was in disregard of the agreed terms of national pay agreements.  The use of industrial action was a regrettable feature in a number of cases.</P>
      <P>The effect of this system has been a major contributory factor to the substantial increases in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in recent years. The pay and pensions bill increased by over 10 per cent in 1997 and will increase by 9 per cent in 1998.  As public service pay and pensions account for around half of current supply expenditure, such increases put pressure on current public expenditure targets.  Any new system of pay determination must recognise the limits on public spending within which the Government must operate.</P>
      <P>Any new pay determination system must also support the culture of service to the public and the focus on improving service and performance which is part of the strategic management initiative across the public service.  We wish to explore how new public service pay arrangements can meet the aspirations of staff while maintaining the unavoidable limits on public spending as well as delivering the level of service and performance which public service management and public service customers demand.</P>
      <P>I expect discussions with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a new approach to public service pay in the period beyond Partnership 2000 to begin shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I have been made fully aware of the concerns of the Debt and Development Coalition, and other organisations and individuals who have taken an interest in the alleviation of Third World debt and the issue of the social impact of adjustment programmes.  Their views were taken into account of by the Government in the formulation of its response to the requests for funding for the Joint IMF/World Bank HIPCs debt initiative. The Deputies will already be familiar with the Government's debt relief package and the principles which will guide the Government's policy on Third World debt and structural adjustment, the details of which were announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me on 16 September.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Finance I have taken a deep interest in the issue of Third World debt and I have through my Department, maintained an open policy as regards contacts with all interest groups on the issue.  My officials and I have had numerous contacts with the NGOs concerned and have sought to address their concerns upon matters relating to the debt initiative and the ESAF facility of the IMF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sought to give them assurances that Ireland will continue to use the influence available to it to work for the implementation of both ESAF and the debt initiative on the most favourable terms possible for the countries affected.  I have also sought to convey to them that the current debt relief mechanisms, the HIPCs and ESAF programmes, represent a major step forward on the issue of dealing with the indebtedness of the poorer countries.  The HIPC debt initiative marks the first concerted effort by international governments and financial institutions to deal with this huge and complex problem in a pragmatic and workable fashion.  Clearly, the debt initiative as it stands is not the final destination for the international effort.  Nothing short of the complete elimination of poverty can be accepted as the ultimate goal of all our development efforts.  I am on record as saying the debt initiative will need to be accelerated widened and deepened.  However, I am concerned that for at least ten years Ireland has been to the fore in the advocating debt relief but has not made a single contribution to debt relief.  This position is no <Col N="1575" /> longer acceptable to me or my Government colleagues. The time has long since passed for this country to move from rhetoric to action by supporting debt relief by actual cash payments.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to note that the developing countries within the United Nations sponsored a resolution calling on developed countries to support the ESAF facility and the debt initiative financially.  The resolution on enhancing international co-operation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries was adopted unanimously on 15 December by the UN General Assembly. The resolution calls for a speedy and determined extension of the HIPC framework, something which has been strongly urged by the Irish Government and by me in my ongoing contacts with the World Bank and the IMF and also expresses &ldquo;strong support for the continuation of the enhanced structural adjustment facility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that neither HIPC nor ESAF are perfect instruments &mdash; no administrative system ever was &mdash; and I am determined to ensure the IMF and the World Bank take ownership and social impacts into account in planning, designing and implementing their programmes.  I hope everybody will at last recognise that both tools, as the UN resolution endorsed and supported by all developing countries points out, are accepted internationally as valid components of the response of the international community to the needs of developing countries.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(¹) This figure is based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanisms which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(²) Income tax on farming profits is collected with schedule D tax generally and figures of tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>(³) This heading includes tax paid on income from trades and professions, other than farming, together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income. The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified.  Included in this figure is witholding tax deducted under the provisions of Chapter III of Finance Act, 1987 from payments for professional services.</P>
    <P>The amounts paid by each sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and self-employed, including farming sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reducing the burden of personal income tax.  In my first budget, in December last year, I introduced personal tax reliefs with a full year cost of £517 million. In budget 1999, earlier this month, I introduced further personal tax reduction amounting to £581 million.  I propose to continue to reduce the burden of personal taxation in further budgets, as resources permit, in keeping with the commitments given in the Government's policy programme, An Action Programme of the Millennium.</P>

      <P>It is not clear how the return of £240 is arrived at, but I can confirm to the Deputy that a qualifying capital investment of £12,000 would provide allowances of £1,800 each year over the first six years and an allowance of £1,200 in year seven.  These allowances would be available for offset against the person's marginal rate of tax and therefore can be considered to be an incentive of value in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the Deputy's question, I wish to clarify the position generally.  All central banks hold assets of various kinds.  In most countries, a proportion of those assets is held in foreign currencies, known as the external reserves.  Such external reserves are held for two principal purposes &mdash; to assist in protecting the currency and to ensure that the country does not lack the foreign currency needed to pay for essential imports.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the adoption of the single currency, it will be the euro area as a whole rather than individual participating member states, such as Ireland, which will need such external reserves. Consequently, the ECB is empowered under its Statutes to call up, from participating national central banks, up to 50,000 million euro in foreign exchange reserves &mdash; that is, assets in currencies other than the euro.  Each national central bank's contribution will be in proportion to its shareholding in the ECB, which in turn will be in proportion to each member state's shares of the euro-area's GDP and population &mdash; like shareholdings in the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the ECB, at present.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of Ireland is transferring to the ECB the equivalent of around 419 million euro, or around £330 million, which will be Ireland's share of the ECB's pooled reserves.  The amount transferred amounts to about 6.3 per cent of the bank's total foreign exchange reserves.  The Central Bank is also subscribing around £42 million euro, or £33 million, to the share capital of the ECB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These will remain assets on the balance sheet of the Central Bank, although they will not be under the control of the bank.  However, it should be noted that both the foreign reserves contribution and the capital shareholding will earn <Col N="1579" /> income for the Central Bank and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.</P>
    <P>This will leave a substantial amount of assets, both domestic euro assets, and foreign non-euro assets, with the Central Bank of Ireland. However, just because they are not needed as official external reserves does not make them &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  The Central Bank of Ireland's balance sheet includes liabilities as well as assets; these include deposits from financial institutions, the Exchequer deposit, and legal tender notes.  The bank will also continue to need its own external assets, as well as those provided to the ECB, in order to play its part as a member of the European System of Central Banks.  The remaining reserves will continue as heretofore to be managed by the bank in accordance with risk parameters and benchmarks set by the board of the bank.  The aggregate of the national central banks' non-euro assets plus the pooled reserves transferred to the ECB will comprise the foreign exchange reserves of the ESCB.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank does have some assets which are not needed to meet liabilities, these are known as the bank's &ldquo;accounting reserves&rdquo;, However, the value of these reserves fluctuates, depending on changes in the values of the assets held by the bank.</P>
    <P>As of the end of October 1998, the latest date for which published figures are available, the official external reserves, held by the Central Bank of Ireland, totalled £5,616 million.  The accounting reserves stood at £1,191 million.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is too early to say what will happen to the balance sheet of the Central Bank in the early stages of the single currency.  What we can say with certainty is that both the overall level of assets and the surplus reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility.  For example, adverse exchange rate movements could, in the absence of a sufficient level of accounting reserves to absorb such movements, have negative consequences for the net asset position of the Central Bank.  It is not my intention to act in a fashion which could undermine either the credibility or independence of the Central Bank, and indirectly the ESCB, or the credibility of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to the legal position of the accounting reserves of the Central Bank.  In summary, the advice is that any transfer of the accounting reserves should only take place with the agreement of the Central Bank and, as appropriate, the European Central Bank.  The bank and the ECB are the appropriate bodies to determine the level of reserves which are required for the purposes of the monetary policy <Col N="1580" /> of the euro area and in order to achieve price stability, The contribution which any surplus assets of the Central Bank would make to the Exchequer should not be exaggerated.  Assets of the bank earn a return for the bank.  The Exchequer receives the surplus income of the bank, thus indirectly benefiting from the bank's reserves.  If the assets, corresponding to the accounting reserves, were used by the Exchequer for other purposes, we would be losing the benefit of that income.  To the extent that the bank's accounting reserves would be used to reduce the national debt, the net annual benefit to the Exchequer would be the difference between the cost of servicing the repaid debt and the return on the assets in the accounting reserves, i.e. effectively the margin between the interest rates for borrowing and lending.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to tax rates in other member states, nor do I have comprehensive information about such rates which often vary from time to time.  I can say however that the standard rate of VAT for example, ranges from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  The standard rate of corporation tax ranges from 28 per cent to 45 per cent although simple comparisons of normal tax rates ignore the important question of the base to which the rate applies.  I have no information on local taxation to hand.  If the Deputy is interested in particular rates of tax applying in particular circumstances throughout the EU I can see if my Department can assist him if he wishes to contact my office.</P>

      <P>The following table includes taxes on personal income, including employee social security contributions, as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total taxation for Ireland and other EU countries for 1996, which is the latest year for which information is available.  The data are taken from the 1998 edition of the OECD publication &ldquo;Revenue Statistics 1965 &mdash; 1997&rdquo;.  Employee social security contributions are included for completeness, as some countries place a greater reliance on this <Col N="1581" /> source of revenue than on personal income taxation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no responsibility for the taxes applicable in other EU member states.  Vehicle registration taxes or taxes relating to vehicles, of one form or other, are applied in some member states.  These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and, as such, are not directly comparable with VRT as applied here. Some states' taxes are based on cc and others on fuel consumption.</P>
      <P>Germany, France, Luxembourg, Sweden and the UK do not charge taxes similar to VRT. Many EU states, including the UK, have far higher taxes on petrol than that applied in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the United Kingdom ran a media campaign about the euro directed at business earlier this year.  I understand that there is no campaign of information about the euro for the general <Col N="1582" /> public in the UK.  Needless to say, decisions on what the UK does in relation to the euro are a matter for that country.</P>
      <P>In relation to this country, I am very satisfied that the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland's (ECBI) public information campaign and the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign have made a very substantial amount of information widely available, as the following shows.</P>
      <P>Around 2.5 million public information leaflets have been made available by the ECBI, including one to every household last June, and some 88,000 posters have been distributed to schools, libraries and post offices.  The ECBI has also set up a web site, www.  irlgov.  ie/ecbi-euro, a LoCall number, 1890 20 10 50, and a teletext page, Aertel, RTE 1, page 678, produced a public information video and co-sponsored a six-part TV series which ran on RTE 1 in October-November entitled Living with the euro.  In conjunction with the National Council for the Blind (NCBI), the ECBI has produced 250 audiotapes of its information leaflet for visually impaired people.  Other initiatives are currently under way with the NCBI.  In addition, the ECBI has produced a signed and subtitled version of the public information video for people with a hearing disability.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ECBI has run major advertising campaigns, in June and November, conducted an extensive training programme in the civil and public service and a set of information briefings for nationally-representative organisations, published the results of a nationally representative survey, produced an information leaflet for teachers in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and compiled the third edition of EMU and the euro Ireland's National Changeover Plan, which I published in November.  A set of frequently asked questions and answers is now also on the ECBI web site.</P>
      <P>The ECBI is also responsible for the administration of the EU-funded non-governmental organisation, NGO programme for euro information activities.  Under this programme, a total of 26 NGO bodies have been approved for EU funding amounting to a total of £200,000 in respect of information activities on the euro in 1998.  These bodies include organisations representing consumers, community, elderly people and women's groups, trade unions and trade and professional associations.</P>
      <P>The ECBI has also set up a consultative panel to advise it on how to cater for those with special needs and to help it to disseminate information to them.</P>
      <P>A further extensive communications campaign is planned by the ECBI following the start of EMU on 1 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, which has been running for two years now, has produced and disseminated, <i>inter alia</i>, a very extensive information pack, 45,000 copies, which includes a set of possible actions for companies in relation to sterling.  The campaign has also distributed <Col N="1583" /> a guide for small and medium enterprises, 98,500 copies, a guide for the retail sector, 82,000 copies, a guide for trade unions, 35,000 copies, and an information technology guide, 37,000 copies.  In addition, the ninth issue of the business campaign newsletter <i>Eurochange</i> has just issued, circulation 26,000.  New documents are being prepared for inclusion in the business campaign pack.</P>
    <P>Campaign material, outlining how firms should deal with EMU issues, has been distributed to over 140,000 businesses as part of a mailing by the Revenue Commissioners with company VAT returns.  In addition, material has been included in a new guide on the issue that has been produced by Revenue and is available to all businesses. Contact details for the campaign have also been included in a special Revenue newsletter for businesses, of which 350,000 copies have recently been distributed.</P>
    <P>Press and radio advertising campaigns have been run by the campaign, using national media, business journals and specialist publications, as well as national and local radio.  Currently a press campaign is under way which runs until the middle of December.  A special LoCall number is advertised which allows callers to ring a dedicated Forfás &ldquo;euro-line&rdquo; for information.  More detailed information is provided on the campaign's help line.  Special supplements on EMU have been organised in association with national publications and articles supplied on the topic for inclusion in EMU features of other publications.</P>
    <P>The campaign has undertaken a number of surveys to monitor on an on-going basis the levels of preparations among Irish enterprises.  Fieldwork for the third of these surveys is under way and will be completed by year-end.  The findings of this survey will provide direction for the campaign in 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two sources of information on the euro a wide range of public and private sector bodies is involved in promoting knowledge of the changeover.  Details can be found in Appendix 1 to the third edition of the national changeover plan.</P>

It is proposed, following consultations which are ongoing with the authority and with the trustees of the pension fund, to make a payment of £60 million on account, before the end of 1998, towards the discharge of the actuarial liability. The balance, which has still to be determined and which will discharge the matter fully, will be paid within the time limit laid down by the Act.  Provision for meeting this liability in 1998 was reflected in the expenditure aggregates in the recently published White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to make any additional payments in respect of any other outstanding pension liabilities in 1998.  The White Paper also reflected a payment of £69 million to the small savings reserve fund.  No decision has been taken to make further payments into the fund since the White Paper was published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current legislation in relation to tax relief in respect of redundancy lump sum payments is section 201 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The exemptions and reliefs in respect of redundancy lump sum payments to which an individual may be entitled are briefly as follows: (i) Basic Exemption: The first £6,000 plus £500 for each complete year of service in respect of that particular employment Is exempt from income tax; (ii) Increased Exemption: The basic exemption may be increased by a maximum of £4,000 if no claim for relief has been made in respect of a previous lump sum payment, and no tax-free lump sum has been received or is receivable under an approved superannuation scheme relating to the office or employment.  If a tax-free lump sum of less than £4,000 has been received or is receivable from the scheme, the increased exemption will be the basic exemption plus £4,000, less that amount, or, in the case of deferred benefits, the actuarial value of that amount.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to the above reliefs a taxpayer may, if more favourable, claim an amount known as the standard capital superannuation benefit.  The SCSB is calculated as 1/15th of the person's average yearly salary (i.e. averaged over the last three years of service) per complete year of service, less any tax free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme.  Further relief may arise where an individual has foreign service.</P>
      <P>If a taxpayer is liable to tax on part of the redundancy payment he or she is also entitled to top-slicing relief.  This means that any amount of the payment liable to tax is charged, not at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for the year in which he or she is made redundant, but at an average tax rate calculated by reference to the previous five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lump sums payable from approved occupational pension schemes are not chargeable to tax under section 201, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  However, these lump sums must be paid within strictly approved limits.  The maximum benefit which may be paid to any individual at normal retirement age is 1.5 times final remuneration. This maximum benefit is conditional on the <Col N="1586" /> individual having completed at least 20 years service with the employer up to normal retirement date.</P>
    <P>The above information summarises the regulations governing tax relief available for redundancy and retirement lump sum payments which are rather complex.  Further information may, however, be obtained directly from the Revenue Commissioners if required.</P>
    <P>The exemptions and reliefs available under the SCSB arrangements which I described, are indexed to the extent that they are calculated in relation to a person's salary.  Major changes were made in the tax treatment of redundancy lump sum payments in 1993.  These chances included the introduction of the further tax free addition of £500 per completed year of service in the employment, to the previous tax free basic allowance of £6,000 (or £10,000 in certain circumstances) as well as improvements in the alternative SCSB.  These changes resulted in very significant improvements in the tax treatment of redundancy lump sums, particularly as they apply to workers with a number of years service.  For example, the minimum amount allowable tax free to a worker with 12 years service doubled from £6,000 to £12,000.  The effect of these reliefs is to reduce substantially or eliminate the tax liability on the redundancy payments in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments of major acute hospitals are complex and difficult to predict with any degree <Col N="1588" /> of accuracy and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand.  Patients requiring admission may on occasion be retained in accident and emergency departments on trolleys but statistics regarding the numbers of such patients are not routinely compiled by my Department.  However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I provided additional funding of £2.3 million in the current year to enable the acute major hospitals to implement various measures aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have published the report of the Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented.  The report is one of a number of initiatives which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times.  I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999.  This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided in 1997.  The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work.  It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care.  This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of stepdown or convalescing care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.  Accordingly, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services which will be an important factor in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available.  The £9 million allocated for services for older people will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subverted or contracted by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £2 million allocated for the accident and emergency services will enable acute hospitals to implement various initiatives which will also include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods.  It will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the <Col N="1589" /> development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>Part of the £2 million will also be used to fund a national public education campaign aimed at increasing general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments with particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department in an acute hospital.</P>

      <P>The percentage increase in medical card guidelines since 1993 is 9.6 per cent while the corresponding increase in average industrial earnings is 15.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  The income guidelines which have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of <Col N="1590" /> a person's eligibility are revised annually in line continued with the consumer price index.  As the medical card guidelines relate to an individual's ability to pay for health services without undue hardship the consumer price index is a more relevant guide than average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>I should add that the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the recommendations in the report will require action on the part of a number of different bodies, including my Department, An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, local authorities and a number of other Departments and agencies.  Discussions with some of these bodies on implementing specific recommendations have already commenced.  I propose to arrange for roundtable discussions early next year, to agree an implementation timetable, when the various parties will have had an opportunity to fully consider the report's recommendations.  The implementation of the report's recommendations on ICT, including the provision of Internet access to the public will be dealt with as part of this process.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am taking action to implement the report's recommendations with regard to infrastructure.  The increased provision for libraries in my Department's Vote, up from £3.2 million in 1998 to £7.6 million in 1999, will enable significant progress to be made in the grant-aiding of suitable projects and the provision of additional stock.</P>

      <P>The present speed limit regime in Ireland arises from a comprehensive review of speed limits carried out between 1990 and 1992 as well as new arrangements for the application of limits introduced by the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The Government strategy for road safety, 1998-2002, makes clear that changes to this regime are not proposed in the short term: the immediate-term priority is to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>It is open to county councils and county borough corporations to exercise their powers under the Road Traffic Acts to apply the special speed limit of 50 miles per hour to specified roads in their areas, subject to consultation with the Garda Commissioner and other local authorities in the area, and, in the case of national roads, subject to the consent of the National Roads Authority There appears to be limited international experience of seasonally differentiated speed limits and I have no proposal for such limits.</P>

      <P>Under section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, An Bord Pleanála has a statutory objective of determining appeals within a four month period.  The continuing growth in the number of appeals, which reflects the high levels of economic activity, has resulted in a fall off in the number of appeals being determined within four months.  At the end of November, 64 per cent of appeals determined in 1998 had been determined within four months and 90 per cent had been determined within six months. The average time taken to determine appeals is 18.5 weeks compared to 16 weeks in 1997.</P>
      <P>To ensure the planning appeal process operates in an efficient and effective manner and to help the board meet its statutory objective of determining appeals within four months, I have taken a number of measures this year.  These include an increase in board membership of 50 per cent and approval to all other additional staffing sought by the board during the year.  Appointments to the outstanding posts are expected to be finalised early in the new year.  In light of these measures, I expect the board's performance to steadily improve and I will continue to monitor the board's performance to see if additional measures are required.  The board has set itself the strategic objectives of determining 90 per cent of appeals within four months and reducing the average time taken to determine appeals to 14 weeks by this time next year.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for emergency planning at central government rests with individual Departments within their own area of responsibility and with the emergency services under their aegis.  Planning for dealing with major emergencies at local level is primarily a matter for the three main emergency response services, the Garda Síochána, health boards and local authorities, including the fire service.  The main emergency services can call on the support of the Army and voluntary organisations such as the Civil Defence, Red Cross etc., if necessary.</P>
      <P>All the main local authorities, county councils and county borough corporations, have prepared major emergency plans.  These plans are updated regularly by the local authorities in light of relevant developments.  The plans, <i>inter alia</i>, take cognisance of the roles and responsibilities of the other main emergency services and are designed to provide a co-ordinated response.</P>
      <P>Exercises are undertaken by local authorities, often in conjunction with other agencies, as part of their preparedness for dealing with emergencies and as part of the ongoing review of plans. The frequency and nature of exercises are matters for individual authorities in light of local needs and circumstances.</P>
      <P>In some areas, including Cork, the relevant agencies have worked together to develop joint major emergency plans.  This does not affect the roles and the responsibilities of the individual emergency services as referred to above.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is paid up to age 16 or up to age 19 if the child is in fulltime education or where the child has a physical or mental disability.  I have no plans to extend the payment to other categories at this time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This applies to long-term payments, such as pensions, only; it does not apply to shortterm payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents, and this approach has been followed in the 1999 budget.  Provision has been made in the 1999 budget for major increases in child benefit rates of £3 per month for the first two children and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children, which will bring the rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46, respectively. This measure will cost £40 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not in receipt of a carer's allowance.  Her mother received a prescribed relative's allowance, which was an increase of pension paid to a pensioner being cared for by a relative.  This continued to be paid to her after carer's allowance was introduced because this was more favourable to the household.</P>
      <P>On her mother's death, the prescribed relative's allowance ceased to be payable.  The person concerned applied for pre-retirement allowance, entitlement to which depends on the means of the claimant.  She was assessed with means deriving from her share in the letting income from a holding and on that basis her entitlement is £21.50 per week, including a fuel allowance of £5.  If the person concerned is dissatisfied with the means assessment in her case, it is open to her to appeal the decision on her claim to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>As a first step towards alleviating the sharp poverty trap associated with the complete withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance once the earnings of the spouse or partner of the social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week, regulations were introduced in November 1997 which provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement.  These were the categories of welfare claimants most affected <Col N="1599" /> by the previous arrangements.  The revised arrangements do not apply to any other welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Under the revised arrangements, where the spouse or partner is earning between £60 and £90, a reduced rate qualified adult allowance continues to be payable.  In the 1999 budget, provision has been made to extend the upper limit of the income range from £90 to £105, with effect from next October, to further enhance the incentive for people to avail of employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible to prepare estimates of the cost of extending these arrangements to old age pensioners, and to other categories not currently covered, in the time available.  It should be noted, however, that in the case of the old age non-contributory pension and the blind person's pension, the means test which applies to these schemes ensures that, in practice, the qualified adult allowance is withdrawn on a progressive basis where the spouse or partner of the claimant has income from employment.</P>
      <P>Consideration will be given to extending the arrangements governing the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance to cover other categories of welfare claimants.  It will not, however, be possible to make any such provision in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

On the subject matter generally of this question, the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, gives the force of law to two international conventions on the subject of abduction of a child by a parent from one state to another.

      <P>The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 gives the force of law to two international conventions on abduction of a child by a parent from one state to another.  The Act of 1991 operates, for the most part, by reference to the provisions of those two conventions which form the basis of international agreements.  Those provisions concern, primarily, the restoration of rights of custody of or access to a child in cases where the child has been wrongfully removed to another state in breach of those rights.</P>
      <P>In so far as measures to prevent the wrongful removal of a child are concerned, the Act of 1991 contains provisions which allow the Garda to detain a child who is being abducted by a parent to another state in breach of guardianship, custody or access orders or while proceedings for one of those orders are pending.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals for amending the Act of 1991, the operation of the Act is kept under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1 978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses.  Part Ill of the No. 2 Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property.  The purchase price in most cases at present is about 13 times the ground rent.  The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming.  In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration.  The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found.  There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill entitled the Landlord and Tenant <Col N="1605" /> (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill passed Second Stage in the Drill on 19 March, 1997.  The detail of this Bill is being examined in my Department at present, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Registrar of Titles, particularly from the point of view of the constitutionality and practicality of its proposals in relation to land law generally and in particular the land registration system.  A difficulty, which successive Governments have accepted over the years, is that abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation would not be in keeping with constitutional requirements.  Given the complexities involved, I am not yet in a position to indicate when the examination will be completed, but any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way.</P>

      <P>An application for funding under the sports capital programme operated by my Department was received from the club in November. 1997.  The 1998 round of allocations under the programme was made earlier this year and all funds have now been committed to a number of projects around the country.  The club was advised in April 1998 and again in August 1998 that they are not among the projects approved for grant aid in 1998.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme has been under review by my Department for the past few months.  The review has just been completed, and I expect details of the new programme to be announced shortly.  The programme will be widely publicised and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding.</P>

      <P>Temporary and permanent teachers who are recognised as fully trained are paid salary by reference to the common basic incremental salary scale.  The minimum point of this scale is currently set at £14,304 while the maximum point is £27,803.  The actual point at which an individual teacher is placed on the scale may vary depending on qualifications held as well as previous incremental service given either in this State or abroad.</P>
      <P>The substitute supply panel scheme consists of permanent teachers who provide substitution cover in primary schools.  As permanent teachers, these teachers are paid in accordance with the incremental salary scale.</P>
      <P>The rates of pay for teachers are matters to be determined under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers which was established on 9 October 1973.  The three teacher unions are parties to this scheme.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major new funding initiative for the education sector.  At second level, a total of 225 new teachers will be appointed.  Combined with a very significant change to the manner of dealing with over-quota staffing in secondary schools, these new teachers will enable a move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The new package will be resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home-school provision.  In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be redeployed, this resource will be utilised in the first instance to meet the remedial and home/school needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Following the implementation of the above package some schools will nonetheless have on their staff over quota permanent teachers.  In deciding on whether or not these teachers come within the redeployment scheme, a ratio of 18 : 1 will be utilised.  The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel.  This will give schools greater certainty in relation to the utilisation of these permanent teachers pending the occurrence of retirements. This initiative formed part of the budget package to tackle educational disadvantage and I was not in a position to respond to the letter referred to by the Deputy pending finalisation of the package and the implementation arrangements.</P>

      <P>My Department provides an educational psychological service to all second level schools in County Wicklow and to a number of primary schools in the north of the county.  One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels.  On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase.  Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in early 1999.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are inevitably many primary schools in the country, including most of the schools in County Wicklow, which do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service.  Attention will be paid to the needs of such priority areas as the psychological service is expanded.</P>
