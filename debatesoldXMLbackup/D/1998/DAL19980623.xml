      <P>On a point of order, I ask that Question Time be extended by ten minutes.  If the Taoiseach's Question Time extends for the full period, the time allocated for questions to the Minister for Education and Science will be shorter.  That is unfair to Members who have tabled questions, and, notwithstanding Standing Orders, the Taoiseach's Question Time should be extended by ten minutes in view of the late start.</P>

      <P>Outside legal advice is sought as a matter of routine by the Office of the Attorney General, including the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  This would include seeking opinions and engaging counsel to act on behalf of the State.  The provision in the 1998 Estimates for these offices for fees to counsel and for general law expenses amounts to £5.55 million.  Expenditure under this heading to date amounts to £2 million approximately.  This figure encompasses a variety of legal services and it is not possible to isolate amounts paid for advice only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1418" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, agree that expenditure on that scale in any other Government activity would require a tendering process once it exceeded a certain cost threshold?  Successive Governments, including my own, have facilitated this practice.  Does the Taoiseach consider it wise to allow the Attorney General, members of the Bar and solicitors to decide what the cost of legal advice should be?  Should the process of competition not be used as it is in other matters?  Certain kinds of legal expertise should be open to competitive tendering and the Taoiseach should make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this is substantial expenditure.  Government Ministers have to allow tenders for very small amounts of money and have difficulties in half-yearly reviews with trying to take amounts from £50,000 to £100,000 out of subheads.  The Office of the Attorney General is covered by Vote 13, and general law expenses amount to approximately £300,000, which is not that much.  In this particular period it is mainly the swimming inquiry figures that arise.  The fees for counsel amount to £3.45 million which is a more substantial amount of money.  There are also general law expenses.  In practice the Attorney General allocates these to counsel who look after particular areas on an ongoing basis. There may be a case for examining cases that involve larger fees.  In terms of the offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor, there is a question of getting the right specialist to do the job, and that is the reason for higher fees.  However, I would not be against raising the matter with the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General.  The fees are substantial and there is no reason to believe they will not grow in the years ahead.  If a better way of ensuring best value for money by some form of tendering can be found, I will certainly consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The current practice, which successive Governments have operated, is for the Attorney General, who is a member of the Bar and may very well be a practising member, to decide who should be asked to take a particular brief and, if it goes to court, a judge decides the costs.  The three pillars of that triangle all come from within the same industry.  They effectively agree prices among themselves and the interests of the consumer or the taxpayer are in no way reflected.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that were this the practice in other areas of economic and commercial activity there would be a request under competition law for it to be reviewed?  Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he is prepared to look at this process from the point of view of best practice in every sense of the word, quality of advice as well as cost to the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to look at this issue.  During the current Dáil the Department of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> Finance was directly involved in sanctioning rates.  Where that is possible, that is what is done in regard to larger fees.  In other cases where there is a defence by the State, there are standard procedures for the payment of fees.  Deputy Quinn is stating that they have been in existence for a long time and should be looked at.  I have no difficulty in looking at them.  In many cases dealt with by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and that of the Attorney General the problem is in obtaining certain people for certain cases. There is not the same latitude to go to tender as there is in regard to other public procedures. However, if we know there will be substantial fees in a particular case which is upcoming, it would be worth looking at it from the point of view of best value for money, taking competence as well as cost into account.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will report on the recent work of the National Centre for Partnership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I last briefed the House on 6 May, the work of the centre has been progressing.</P>
      <P>In the private sector, the first of a series of seminars on partnership at enterprise level was held on 9 June at the Industry Centre, UCD.  The seminar was well attended by employers, trade union and employee representatives and included presentations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Productivity Centre. Initial feedback on the seminar has been positive and similar seminars are planned for other regions over the course of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, a joint IBEC/ICTU project &mdash; Partnership in Action at Enterprise Level (PACT) &mdash; under the EU ADAPT initiative is about to commence.  Under the project, eight teams are being established on a regional basis. Each team will be made up of management and employee representatives from selected companies, an IBEC executive and a trade union official. They will be assisted by facilitators and a research consultant.  The teams will assess and survey their own needs and the needs of the companies involved in order to develop enterprise partnership. They will be given the training and development to satisfy those needs and to equip them to develop partnership in their enterprises.  The objective is that the teams would act as catalysts and facilitators for other enterprises in their region.  In addition, training tools will be prepared to support the dissemination of partnership which will build on the experience gained by the teams. The project will run to the end of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> With regard to the public sector, as the Deputy is aware from my last briefing to the House, Civil Service Departments and offices are now putting their partnership committees in place, in accordance with the General Council Report No. 1331. In the wider public service, I want to see partnership structures in place as soon as possible in accordance with Partnership 2000.  I have asked my Department and the centre to assist in this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Will he agree that the deepening of the partnership concept, to which I know he is personally committed, is an essential prerequisite to consolidating Partnership 2000 and laying the foundations for a successor agreement which, in the light of the present climate, may not be easy to achieve?  Certainly five agreements in a row will be difficult to achieve.  Will he indicate how the work of the National Centre for Partnership will be communicated to a wider audience than those directly participating in it?  What plans, if any, does he have to ensure the work of the centre is clearly communicated to the widest possible audience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must continue to build the partnership arrangement to make it more comprehensive as we go on.  The National Centre for Partnership is doing that because it is disseminating information on best practice which has been built up in many enterprises in both the public and the private sector.  There are many good models, particularly in the private sector where a number of limited models are used.  That should be developed.  All Deputies will agree with me, but particularly Deputy Quinn who is an experienced negotiator, that we should move towards the Nordic and Austrian model where this process started.  I recently spoke to a Prime Minister on that issue and tried to gather information on it.  Rather than asking if we will have another agreement &mdash; this has happened since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; we should examine the way this process is structured in these countries.  It has been used in Austria since 1951 and Deputy Quinn will remember that in the mid-1980s that was the model we first examined. To do that, however, we must have partnership in the true sense of the word.  It is not about pay but about recognition, participation and so on.  That is the way I would like the process to go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the second question, we have examined how the centre can best widen the work it is doing.  The work is being done on a regional basis but that will only cover those who are involved and interested.  The role of the liaison group is to act as the consultative forum for the centre and I am examining how we can widen not just the remit of the centre but all the work it has achieved.  I do not want to oversell what the National Centre for Partnership has done to date but it is involved in very useful work.  Over the <Col N="1421" /> next 12 months, as its work develops and there is an increases in the number of conferences, at which it will pick up good ideas, it will put in place various systems.  Mr. Grogan and Mr. O'Dowd, joint general secretaries, are adamant they should proceed in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard about the role of the National Centre for Partnership, is the Taoiseach concerned there is need for one person to keep a watching brief over the centre in terms of its work with the social partners so that there is not a duplication of endeavours by this partnership? Given its role in partnership, has the Taoiseach considered the National Centre for Partnership might be able to intervene in the Garda pay dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the second question, definitely not, that is not the role of the centre. In terms of working and co-operating with other bodies, a group consisting of representatives of a number of Departments and chaired by my Department is considering the modernisation process in the wider public service.  The partnership model, which had been considered for some time, is a good one.  The centre, which works with IBEC, ICTU and the productivity centre and has recourse to other groups, should be allowed develop its work.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Partnership was set up to extend partnership from senior level in the social partners to the agencies.  The centre will examine the best agencies and companies in the private and public sector where partnership operates. It can, and will, do a good job in that regard. That has been done successfully in other countries. An Irish model is being developed for this initiative and the centre should be allowed carry out its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to real partnership, with which I agree entirely. Does he see a role for local authorities in the area of partnership?  Will he agree local authorities can be a dynamic force in generating activity in any given area?  There is failure to recognise the partnership approach to providing job opportunities and so on.  From time to time there is an attitude within local authorities that it is a burden to serve the public, but they should realise they are part of the overall structure for creating jobs and generating wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but I will be glad to answer it.  In reply to Deputy Owen I said that there is a group in place, consisting of representatives of Departments with responsibility for various sections of the public sector, including the Local Government Management Services Board and the Health Service Employee Agency which deal with the public service. If local authorities and local government are properly developed &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, announced reform initiatives &mdash; the <Col N="1422" /> dynamics of local government can work.  Much useful work was done about 20 years ago on the involvement of local government within the community, but somewhere along the line difficulties arose, and we are all aware of those.  I feel strongly that many of the initiatives of the past ten or 15 years have been outside the local government system.  They take place in the area of local government, but they are all linked to centralised Departments or receive direct grant-in-aid from various bodies.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe people who are elected to local government should be part of the driving force behind these bodies, although not exclusively because that would exclude many good people in the community.  These schemes, including the community and employment initiatives, and the funding for them should be part of the local government system and people who are elected should be involved in it.  Elected councillors have to be told by various community organisations what is happening and where the money goes because they are not involved, which should not be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I met representatives of various political parties from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  They are in Ireland to learn about the peace process and to determine what conflict <Col N="1423" /> resolution measures might be learned from us.  I briefed them on the multi-party negotiations that led to the British-Irish Agreement and on the role played by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Since the British-Irish Agreement, in addition to my meetings with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, I have had bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland, Prime Minister Aznar of Spain, Chancellor Klima of Austria and Prime Minister Guterres of Portugal.  While these meetings were predominantly taken up with the broader European agenda, I took the opportunity at each of them to brief the leaders in question on developments in Northern Ireland and on the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I hosted a reception for the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday last Thursday week.  They were visiting Government Buildings for the first time since the announcement of the inquiry.  They raised some concerns they had about the new inquiry, including the issue of representation, and I promised to continue our efforts to resolve the outstanding issues and to support the efforts of the families to establish the truth about the events of that day.  As well as keeping in touch with representatives of the families, the Government will take a keen interest in the tribunal and will closely monitor its proceedings, although it is not proposed that the Government would be represented at it.</P>
    <P>The Saville Inquiry has announced that it proposes to hold a public hearing in the Guildhall in Derry on 20 July to help resolve the question of representation.  The Government will continue to monitor this issue closely and will assist the relatives to help ensure that they can approach the tribunal with confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  On the question to which the substance of his response was devoted, did I hear him say that while the Government would help the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, it would not seek legal representation of behalf of the Government but that assistance to the representatives of the families would possibly consist of financial assistance towards legal costs or the nomination of legal people?  Perhaps the Taoiseach might elaborate because all Opposition parties have received copies of the concerns expressed by the representatives of that group and we are concerned that the matter be handled. Does the Taoiseach agree there seems to be a slight breach of faith in relation to the spirit of generosity in which the inquiry was offered in the first instance and the terms of reference being set up by that inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns of the victims, their family members and legal representatives were that they would not have adequate legal representation.  Preliminary comments suggested there would be one senior counsel, one junior counsel and a firm of solicitors.  That was put to <Col N="1424" /> me.  As the relatives put it, they faced the might of the British legal system.  They did not purport to seek a legal team for each of the victims relatives, although there may have been a feeling that is what they sought. They had a lengthy meeting with officials and I also met them last Thursday week. The Department of Foreign Affairs and the senior official, who has dealt with the inquiry and the case for it, met inquiry officials last Friday. That meeting was reported to me as being positive. The officials emphasised the need to reassure the relatives.  The view is that the officials have accepted their concern.  The official reported that Lord Saville is determined that the tribunal will not be seen as a creature either of the Ministry of Defence or of the relatives but will be totally independent.  While the issue of representation will be dealt with at the public hearing on 20 July, the official reported to me that the tribunal team had a far better understanding now of the relatives' position.  It is hoped that a reasonable attitude will be adopted.  Certainly, if it was the case that the entire group of relatives had only limited representation that would be unsatisfactory given what they are up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the question of costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events that should be covered by the tribunal.  At this stage it is not an issue.  We will take a close interest but will not be legally represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the relatives should have legal representation at this inquiry and, if so &mdash; and he appears to say they should have some limited representation &mdash; will be make his views known to Mr. Tony Blair?  This would help the relatives to feel they are a part of this inquiry and ensure when it completes its work there is not another troublesome period ahead when relatives consider they have not been properly represented.  The Taoiseach said the Government will not seek legal representation before the inquiry.  What will happen the report which the previous Government prepared on Bloody Sunday?  Will it be part of the examination by this inquiry?  Is it likely that members of the Government will be questioned about that report and that he may need legal representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the report prepared by the previous Government, for which I gave credit in the House at the time, was a major part of the basis for my pressing Mr. Tony Blair and his agreeing to proceed with the tribunal.  His was a brave decision because it was known that it would not necessarily have been the response of many of the Establishment on the matter.  On representation, there is no question but that the relatives have to be represented by strong teams.  All I said was that there does not <Col N="1425" /> have to be a separate legal team for every relative. They will combine their efforts.  That is the wish of the relatives though there was some confusion about that matter.  Lord Saville wishes to be independent and to make sure this matter is dealt with properly.  The British Department and legal side know precisely what the Irish Government want.  It is now a question of convincing the inquiry officials.  The Irish Government has made direct representations through the senior official who has dealt with the issue of Bloody Sunday all the way through.  A senior official was also involved in the preparation of the report over the last two years or so.  I hope the issue can be resolved on 20 July.  I have already said publicly, it is important that the issue of representation be dealt with at the public hearing on 20 July.</P>

      <P>On the Taoiseach's meeting with the representatives of political parties in Macedonia, will he clarify whether at that meeting any requests for assistance from Ireland were made by that group and whether the Taoiseach was able to give any commitment on assistance whether financial or by way of staffing or training to that group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they did not ask for any particular assistance.  They had an Irish representative, a person who formerly worked with the Deputy's party, a respected official, assisting them.  I stated to that official that we would give whatever help or assistance we could along the way.  We assisted in the organisation of their trip here, but nothing else.</P>

      <Quest>the commitments, if any, set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium which have been implemented in full; the commitments, if any, implemented in part; the commitments, if any, initiated; the commitments, if any, yet to be initiated and implemented by his Department to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been tabled to all Ministers in written form.  Deputy Quinn is well aware of the broad policies we put to the people at the time of the election which were to cut crime, drugs, taxes and unemployment, to restore peace and to improve the environment.  I believe we have made substantial progress on all these issues in our first year, that we will make further substantial progress in the years ahead and that we will deliver on the vast majority of our promises in the life of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lasting effects of the Government's crime policies must be assessed over the long term.  In the short term, however, the signs are that its policies are succeeding, as indicated by the trend in the Garda crime statistics which show a decrease in serious offences in 1997 by approximately <Col N="1426" /> 10 per cent compared to 1996.  As regards the targeting of certain criminal activity, the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which is before the House, is practical evidence of the Government's policy on serious crime, particularly, but not exclusively, on drug trafficking.  The Bill contains a series of strong measures as a response to those who inflict such harm in our community.</P>
    <P>A programme of accelerated recruitment is under way with the aim of meeting a target of 12,000 gardaí by 2002.  The Court Services Act, 1998, which came into force in April, provides for an independent court agency.  The process of establishing the prison service on an agency basis and a fundamental review of the probation and welfare service are also under way.  In addition, the implementation of the recommendations of an SMI review of the Garda Síochána has also started.  On a practical level, the Garda authorities are pursuing an aggressive policy to bring drug traffickers before the courts.  Considerable success has been achieved under Operations Dóchas, Mainstreet and Cleanstreet with significant seizures of illegal drugs and arrests of pushers. The Criminal Assets Bureau is also effectively targeting major drug barons.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget made a significant start on the income tax commitments contained in the programme for Government.  On a full year basis, £517 million was allocated to personal income tax and PRSI reductions.  These changes include significant increases in personal allowances, a 2 per cent reduction in standard and higher income tax rates, thus reducing the marginal tax rate for more than one million taxpayers, and the widening of standard rate tax bands.  In addition, the allowances were increased by 8.6 per cent while the PRSI allowance was raised from £80 to £100 per week.  The income threshold for levies increased from £10,250 to £10,750 per annum.</P>
    <P>In the budget, the Minister for Finance confirmed the Government's intention to introduce a 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax for trading profits for all sectors of the economy with a 25 per cent rate for passive and non-trading profits. This will be phased in over the coming years to eventually replace the current regime.  Discussions are at an advanced stage with the EU Commission on the timetable for phasing in the new regime.  However, the proposed new rates of corporation tax are not an issue in these discussions. In the budget, the standard rate of corporation tax was reduced from 36 per cent to 32 per cent while the rate on the first £50,000 profits has been reduced from 28 per cent to 25 per cent. Further reductions in corporation tax will be made in the coming years.  While these reductions will benefit business, they will also help to maintain competitiveness and to promote investment and employment.</P>
    <P>Since the Government was formed, about 55,000 more people are at work and a substantial number of the new investments driving this growth have been outside the greater Dublin <Col N="1427" /> area.  The live register has fallen by about 31,000 and this represents a decrease of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the space of one year, we have fulfilled in a way that few would have felt possible most of the immediate tasks we set ourselves in relation to Northern Ireland: an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire, inclusive and substantive negotiations and a political settlement which has been negotiated between all the parties present and endorsed by an emphatic majority of the people, North and South.  Our task ahead is to implement the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects, to set up the agreed structures and arrangements over the next few months and put them on a secure footing.</P>
    <P>A consultative process on the establishment of the National Environment Partnership Forum has been concluded and the forum will be established later this summer.  The development of our water and sewerage services infrastructure will also move considerably further ahead in 1998 with investment of some £185 million.  A green network of Government Departments has been established and will have a key role in environmental integration and the development of an eco-auditing system.  Steps already taken on greening the tax system will be developed further in the years ahead.  In the area of climate change, negotiations on EU burden sharing have been successfully concluded with a greenhouse gas growth limitation target of 13 per cent on 1990 levels by 2008-12 being agreed for Ireland.  This year will see record investment of £288 million in the national road network and the investment needs for the next 20 years will be set out in a national roads needs study to be completed shortly.  Investment in non-national roads also hit a record this year with Exchequer investment of almost £200 million.  A policy on the establishment of public-private partnerships is also being developed.</P>
    <P>The Government has a wide range of policies in the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Defence, Environment and Local Government, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Marine and Natural Resources, Public Enterprise, Social, Community and Family Affairs, my own Department and Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The Deputy is aware that the Government produced a comprehensive programme for Government for the millennium and this is underpinned by the election manifestos of both parties in Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the concentration on matters concerning the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirms the suspicion that many of us had that not only has he taken over responsibility for pay negotiations but also for the operations of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Has the Government received a letter from the European Commission confirming that it accepts the two corporation tax rates &mdash; 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent?  Is that dispute beyond all difficulty?

The policies we put before the people last year were: to cut crime, particularly continuing the work on the drugs issue; to cut taxes and unemployment; to restore peace and improve the environment.  Work was ongoing on most of those issues, but like any Government, this Government has introduced its own initiatives. I do not attempt to take credit for the good work of previous Ministers and I congratulate the Deputy on her good work as Minister for Justice. I would not try to undermine any of that good work.  I am sure the Deputy will congratulate this Government for taking up some of her initiatives and bringing them to fruition.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Attorney General is currently undertaking a project to publish the Acts of the Oireachtas on CD-ROM and it is envisaged that the CD-ROM will be available in mid-November this year.  It will include Acts of the Oireachtas from l922 to l997 and Statutory Instruments from l973 to l997 and will cost approximately £20.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and give credit to the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, who brought this project to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the statutory instruments on the CD-ROM will date only from l973.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is impossible for some people to comply with the law as set out in Statutory Instruments because they simply cannot obtain copies of them, particularly from l922 to l973?  Does his brief state when the statutory instruments for the period not covered on the CD-ROM will be published?  Will the Taoiseach reconsider the merits of this partially completed project?  Does he agree that failure to publish statutory instruments from 1922 to 1973 on CD-ROM <Col N="1431" /> undermines the value of this worthwhile project?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a problem.  I have set out what will be achieved this year. There have been a number of meetings over the past month between the Office of the Attorney General and Juta &amp; Company Limited which has the contract for this work.  The work involves transferral of 177,000 pages.  Dealing with the issue is a matter of logistics.  I accept it is desirable that the remaining statutory instruments should be included as soon as possible.  I have no date for this but it will certainly not happen this year. I understand the same company will deal with them.  It was believed that inclusion of all Acts from 1922 and statutory instruments from 1973 was the best product which could be delivered in 1998.  We are talking about an additional 42,000 sheets.  On the basis that the company has managed to do all the work within the ten month contract period, it should not take much longer to include the additional material.  I will check the projected date with the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A retail price of £20 seems ludicrously low relative to the enormous value of the documents in electronic form.  If the price reflects the amount required to recoup the cost of the current project, it would be desirable that a premium be added to finance the completion of the project which would involve putting on CD-Rom all statute law predating 1922 and remaining statutory instruments.  Thereby, a company carrying out a due diligence search of legal exposure, particularly from a FDI point of view, would have available to it on a single CD-Rom the entire legal framework within which their operations function.  Law firms and legal practitioners would die to pay for the CD-Rom even if the price was doubled to £40.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might seek the information and communicate it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check the matter.  I do not think it will take long as the company is already examining further work, including pre-1922 material.  The Deputy raised a good point in relation to costs.  Statute books alone take up 4.5 metres of shelf space and amount to 35,000 volumes. Regarding statutory instruments, there are 177,000 sheets to transfer to electronic form.  Having the material in electronic form will be a tremendous asset.  The full contract to date has cost £825,000.  I will examine the retail price of £20.  The original argument was that the material should be made available on CD-Rom with some of it being placed on a website.  It is impossible to have it on the Internet due to its volume.  Ordinary people would not be dealing with the CD-Rom. Perhaps the additional material and that relating to pre-1922, including statutory instruments, could be put on CD-Rom at a higher cost, something I will examine</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned a unit cost survey of first and second level schools in 1990.  The survey was based on data related to the 1988-89 school year.  The study was completed in 1992 and the report was published in 1994.  This is the most recent study conducted on behalf of my Department and it indicates that the cost per primary school pupil at that time was £56.95 per year.  At that stage the standard rate of capitation grant to schools was £26.50 per pupil, which was supplemented by a local contribution requirement of 25 per cent or £6.62 per pupil.</P>
      <P>My Department has been advised by the Central Statistics Office that the cost per pupil of £56.95 in 1989 would, taking the consumer price index into account, result in a present day cost per pupil of £70.89. In addition, if the capitation grant to schools had only been increased in line with inflation it would currently stand at £32.99. However, as the Deputy is aware, the current standard rate of capitation is £50 per pupil.  This may be increased by as much as £30 per pupil in the case of schools with 195 pupils or more for provision of caretaking and secretarial supports, giving a total of £80 per pupil.  In addition, a local contribution of £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream primary schools and £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged is required.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain schools may experience difficulties from time to time in meeting their financial requirements.  In order to assist schools which may face particular hardship, my Department provides an additional supplementary capitation grant of £30 per pupil to schools designated as disadvantaged.  An additional grant of £20 per pupil is paid in respect of pupils attending Gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, having been frozen last year, I secured an 11 per cent increase on the capitation payment this year.  I will continue to seek further improvements in the rate of capitation grants to primary schools in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the clear conflict between the CSO's view of what it costs to run a school and that of the national primary parents' council which estimates the capitation grant is currently meeting only 50 per cent <Col N="1433" /> of the cost, implying a cost level of £100 per pupil?  What is his view on the recent proposal that parents may be levied with the deficit between the capitation grant of the Department and the cost of running the school, an idea circulated by the primary school managers association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the proposal unacceptable. We must approach the issue in a spirit of partnership which imposes obligations on all sides.  The CSO was merely updating data contained in the unit cost survey I referred to which was conducted in 1990 by consultants John Sheehan and Joseph Durkan of the economics department of UCD.  The survey was subsequently published. The figure produced by it was updated to £70.89 to take account of current day costs.  There can be varying arguments as to whether the figure produced by the study was accurate in terms of meeting the essential day to day costs of schools.</P>
      <P>There are 724 schools with over 195 pupils which are receiving £80 per pupil.  There are 318 disadvantaged schools serving 75,000 pupils which get an additional capitation grant of £30. Gaelscoileanna receive an additional £20 per pupil.  The situation, therefore, is not as black and white as one may wish to portray.</P>
      <P>We need to do some current work on the issue of capitation which I realise is not adequate.  Last year there was, for some reason, no increase by the previous Government.  I have increased it this year by £5 but acknowledge that more needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The State provides a capitation grant which meets basic requirements although I would like to enhance and increase that.  Abolishing local contributions would not create additional funds for primary education. Funds already being provided by sources other than the State would merely be replaced.  The immediate priority is for primary schools to have increased access to resources and funding and <Col N="1434" /> that will not be achieved by simply abolishing local contributions overnight.  I am open to entering into discussions with partners on the development of a programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 third level student support schemes have recently been issued to local authorities and vocational education committees.  It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.  The inflation figure provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid February 1997 to mid February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses has also been extended.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputies will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing needs generally in the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have identified the creation of additional places as my priority at third level.  I have already increased the number of places at third level significantly. <Col N="1435" /> I have also given a commitment to introduce maintenance grants for post leaving certificate students.  Details of this new scheme will be available shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, against a background where the average industrial wage is £285 per week or approximately £15,000 per annum and the average male industrial wage is £375 per week or £17,000 per annum, an income limit of £18,000 per annum for a family with less than four children is grossly inadequate and is debarring many students from taking up third level places?  The income limit is based on the gross figure but we are all aware that the net figure is a good deal lower.  We are talking here about citizens who are obliged to provide their own accommodation on which a mortgage must be paid and who, in many cases, pay their own health insurance and run a car.  Does the Minister not agree the two figures of £18,300 for families with four children or less and £20,139 in the case of families with four to six children are totally inadequate for eligibility for full maintenance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the limits are not overly generous but they have been that way for quite some time.  The free fees scheme has made a difference to those above the limits in terms of their ability to survive at third level.  There is no strong evidence on hand that the current rates are debarring people from attending third level courses.</P>
      <P>The first priority I set myself on taking office was the creation of additional third level places as the lack of places was a barrier to people's participation in third level education.  Since the beginning of the last academic session, we have increased the number of available places by 8,000 between third level and post leaving certificate courses.  That is a very significant increase and I respectfully submit that the provision of opportunities for people to access third level education must remain our priority.  Where resources permit it, we must attempt to improve the maintenance grant rates and the income thresholds although I would point out that to increase the thresholds by even £1,000 would cost approximately £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the survey published by the Consumers Association of Ireland which reveals that it costs up to £5,517 per annum for a student to survive away from home?  Is he also aware that a recent USI survey on the same subject revealed a cost of £4,200? A comparison between the current and previous academic year revealed an additional cost of £540.  Will the Minister reconsider his decision to increase maintenance grants by a paltry £28 in light of these statistics and in light of the fact that rental costs will increase dramatically in the autumn due to the new Government policy on housing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot increase the rates as the Estimates do not allow me to do so.  Within the overall Government fiscal policy and the resources available to me, I decided to prioritise the creation of additional third level places.  One must take on board that the pursuit of a third level course is almost a certain passport to employment.  The overwhelming number of graduates emerging from third level institutions now secure highly remunerative employment and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the needs which exist across the entire educational spectrum, one must take on board that people are still leaving school at primary level.  Some second level students do not even make it to junior certificate level while others cannot proceed beyond leaving certificate level.  These students require supports and we have made a good start in terms of creating an additional 8,000 places in the third level sector. We will look at the situation pertaining to the student grants system in the context of next year's Estimates to see if it can be improved.  However, as it stands, I do not have the latitude to increase this year's Estimates to accommodate such an increase.  I acknowledge the surveys referred to by the Deputy but regret the grants cannot be increased this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any cognisance taken of the increase in accommodation prices?  While the creation of additional third level places is to be welcomed, they are only one aspect of access to third level education.  Some young people and their families depress their educational ambitions because they realise that, in the absence of a grant, they will be unable to survive at third level. Indeed, the level of the grant is also a source of concern.  Does the Minister agree that the most equitable way of approaching income limits would be to base assessment on net, rather than gross income?  Should the Minister not set that as a target in the context of next year's Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Governments in the past decade or 15 years have not contemplated assessing net rather than gross income levels in view of the cost implications associated with that.  In 1997-8, there was a 1.6 per cent increase in reckonable income limits, while a 2.4 per cent increase occurred in 1996-7.  Increases in maintenance grant levels have been sporadic over the years; there was a good increase in 1995 but a poor one the following year.  We are anxious to try to improve the position in the context of next year's Estimates and are considering it in terms of that process to try to improve the levels and rates, particularly the maintenance grant rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>We must welcome the provision of an additional 8,000 places, but they are not much use to the 35 per cent of young people who drop out of those courses.  Why do they drop out? Some of them drop out because they cannot afford to stay in college.  For example, a high number of unemployed people are in receipt of social welfare benefit in Dublin l7 and only 1 per cent of the population go on to third level.  Does the Minister agree that the level of the maintenance grant prohibits students from a disadvantaged background from entering the third level education system?  Has he any plans to mainstream student support from the partnership boards to encourage more disadvantaged students to participate in third level education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's basic point.  The Clancy report gives a much deeper explanation why young people, particularly from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, do not secure places, gain access to or participate in third level education.  All the observations show that in many of the socio-economically disadvantaged areas a pattern of participation in third level education did not develop and that even by the end of second level many young people from those areas lack the motivation and do not aspire to go on to third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am answering the Deputy's question.  The Clancy surveys down through the years illustrate that we need to do far more at an earlier stage to increase participation in third level education in disadvantaged areas in particular and in areas of high unemployment. There is no point in believing that free fees will make one whit of a difference to young people in those areas who require intervention much earlier on.  That goes back to primary and second level.  The hardship and disadvantaged fund, which we increased this year, will enable third level institutions target disadvantaged areas in a more proactive way, particularly by providing scholarships to students at second level.  It will create better links between second level schools and third level institutions and facilitate the introduction of familiarisation programmes in second level schools in those areas to promote greater awareness that will facilitate participation in third level education.</P>

      <Quest>the number of additional remedial and guidance teachers he will provide at primary and secondary level in the school year 1998-9.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to indicate the precise number of remedial or guidance <Col N="1438" /> teacher posts which will be allocated for the forthcoming school year.</P>
      <P>With regard to remedial teachers, I have already indicated my intention to ensure that a remedial resource is available to every primary school within the next two years.  As a first step in this process, it is my intention to make an allocation of additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the precise number of posts involved and the recipient schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>In that context, my Department sent a questionnaire to all primary schools with the aim of determining their current level of remedial provision and level of remedial need.  All the questionnaires have been returned to the Department and analysed.  Following completion of that analysis, the remedial allocations for 1998-9 will be determined.</P>
      <P>The Department, in consultation with the education partners, commenced a comprehensive remedial education study in 1997.  It is surveying principal teachers and remedial teachers, and focusing on: the numbers of pupils attending remedial classes; the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes; the organisation of remedial teaching in schools; the development and implementation of policy on remedial teaching in schools; and record keeping and reporting.  The outcome of the study is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are already 1,242 ex-quota teachers providing a remedial service in 2,459 primary schools and approximately 90 per cent of primary school children have access to a remedial teaching service.  The Special Education Review Committee recommended that remedial teaching should be aimed in the first instance at those pupils who function at or below the 10th percentile on standardised, norm-referenced attainment tests in literacy, numeracy or both.  The question of increasing the ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial and guidance at second level will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree it is ridiculous that schools are not in a position to recruit staff until they reopen in September because the Minister has not made his allocation?  Has he made provision in his Estimates to provide more staff than that released by the demographic dividend of 190 to meet the great need for remedial and guidance teachers?  Is he aware that 36 per cent of secondary schools do not have the service of a full-time guidance teacher and 62 per cent of secondary schools, 48 per cent of vocational schools and a quarter of primary schools do not have the service of a remedial teacher?  Does he accept there is a need for special provision in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not provided additional resources in terms of the money made available, but we have provided enough resources for the <Col N="1439" /> retention of the demographic dividend.  We had to provide a supplementary Estimate last year to cover the previous Government's lack of provision for the retention of the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>Regarding guidance at second level, we are working with the National Centre for Guidance with a view to beginning in 1999 an audit of the use by schools of current allocations.  That review will cover the requirement set out in the circulars for the appointment of guidance counsellors.  We are spending £13 million per annum on second level career guidance provision and we have approximately 567 whole-time teacher equivalents for career guidance in the context of approximately 700 schools at post-primary level. In the context of this year's Estimates, the room for manoeuvre at second level is limited for additional career guidance posts.</P>

      <P>In 1998, for the very first time, the Government provided extra substantial dedicated finance, for the funding of research and development through the Department of Education and Science.  The new allocation of £5 million has been incIuded in the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science for recurrent funding of research and development projects.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were announced by me on Tuesday, 26 May last for the programme of scientific and technological research in third level institutions, which is now being put in place.  Prior to this, the Higher Education Authority advised the Department of Education and Science on the appropriate mechanisms, after having consulted widely with the Office of Science and Technology and Forbairt, before providing this advice to us.</P>
      <P>This new funding is supplementary to the existing sources of funding for research and development, including the various teaching and research budgets of the higher education institutions and including various schemes, administered by or on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology, at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology at the Departments of Education and Science and of Enterprise, Trade and Technology ensures there is effective co-ordination of science and technology issues and also ongoing contact at official level.  In addition, the interdepartmental committee on science, technology and innovation, which I chair, provides an effective mechanism for full consideration of science and technology priorities among all Departments involved in funding science and technology. <Col N="1441" /> As soon as it was clear in November 1997 that the Department of Education and Science had obtained new additional funding in research and development, the relevant agency and Department were informally told of same.  This was subsequent to Forbairt having made arrangements for a competition to fund additional research projects.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have secured extra funding for science, research and innovation and I have excellent advice available to me from the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, Forfás, the office of science and technology, the Higher Education Authority and the two Departments within which I operate on these matters.</P>

      <P>I have a right to respond.  There was no breakdown of communication.  On 26 May we announced a series of rules because we were expending public funds for which we are accountable. Certain people who had personal and individual interests felt that, because they would have to make statements to their institutions, it might impinge on their pet projects.  As a result, they were peeved and began to squeal and talk to the Deputy and the media.</P>
      <P>The funds are available and the competition has been held.  Prioritising has taken place, final decisions will be taken and funds will be allocated. More money will be spent on science and research this year than ever before.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the loss of teachers due to declining numbers of pupils is causing severe problems for schools designated as disadvantaged in maintaining the high levels of teaching support required by pupils; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns which have been expressed regarding the loss of teaching posts by primary schools which are designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General staffing levels in primary schools are determined by enrolments on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this <Col N="1443" /> effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Schools with disadvantaged status are entitled to a staffing allocation which enables them to operate at a maximum class size of 29:1, based on the agreed approach to which I have referred.  In the case of the junior classes in schools in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project, the maximum class size is 15:1.  However, where declining enrolments are involved, the number of teacher posts required to operate within these limits may also decline.</P>
    <P>Schools in disadvantaged areas may also be in receipt of ex-quota concessionary teacher posts in recognition of their disadvantaged status.  A total of 294 such posts are currently in place in disadvantaged schools.  Schools may also be in receipt of other special supports such as remedial or resource teachers or teaching counsellors.  Where this is the case, there is no suggestion that any such posts will be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There is an arrangement in place whereby schools may contact the Department if their projected enrolments are set to increase for the forthcoming school year.  In such situations, the Department will re-examine the schools' staffing needs based on the projected enrolments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What was meant by the statement in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto that the party would &ldquo;improve the pupil teacher ratio by keeping in their schools the teachers who are freed up by falling numbers, thus continuing a policy we adopted in 1988&rdquo;?  What does it mean in the context of the current policy under which schools throughout the country are losing teachers?  What does it mean in respect of disadvantaged schools?  There are two such schools in the Taoiseach's constituency which I previously tried to draw to the Taoiseach's attention.  Does the Minister not agree that in the case of schools such as the Model School or the school in Dorset Street, where up to 50 per cent of the junior infant class intake will come from refugee and asylum seeking families, it is wholly reprehensible of the Government to withdraw teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was understood by the partners in education before the election that the statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto meant the retention of the demographic dividend.  That policy commenced in 1988 as a result of an agreement between the partners in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and every successive Government has adopted it.  Under this policy teaching posts that are freed up as a result of declining enrolments and falling population are kept within the system.  That is what was meant by the statement in the manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave the same commitment to the INTO when it had a meeting with that union before the general election.  The INTO met every <Col N="1444" /> political party prior to the election and its main concern was the retention of the demographic dividend.  The reason for the union's concern was the fright it got last year from the outgoing Government during an ongoing row about the retention of the dividend, which was large last year.  The result was an eleventh hour agreement prior to the teaching congress and before the general election which secured the dividend for that year.  The INTO's priority was to ensure a commitment on this matter from all political parties. We gave such a commitment and it was recorded in the edition of <i>Turascáil</i> which was published prior to the election.  All parties' views were given equal prominence in that publication so there could be no doubt about each party's commitment.</P>
    <P>I note the spin Deputy Bruton is endeavouring to put on this wording.  It is unworthy of him and unfair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Posts are not being withdrawn, other than per the annual agreement.  This year approximately 393 schools will lose posts.  The net dividend is 190 as other schools will gain posts as their numbers increase.  Last year 603 schools lost posts; in 1996, 341; and in 1995, 425.  In relation to schools included in the Breaking the Cycle scheme, all schools in urban areas will have enough staff to provide junior classes at a maximum ratio of 15:1.  What is unfortunate is that within the schools which have been identified not only is the population of third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes reducing but the population of the infant classes is slow to increase.  We are prepared to look at a number of cases in respect of which representations have been made, particularly those involving refugees and where enrolments are projected to increase next September.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of being rail-roaded into giving commitments by propaganda or spindoctoring on this issue.  The logic behind the Deputy's proposal is that teachers should be retained irrespective of how many turn up next September, even if the ratio falls to 5:1.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Does the Minister plan to review the guidelines governing the granting of disadvantaged status?  In rural areas it is possible to find a boys' school which has been designated as disadvantaged whereas the girls' school has not.  This is causing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to look at the guidelines as the scheme did no more than add one concessionary teacher to most of the schools included.  There was no in-service provision and no overall strategy in terms of how the issue should be dealt with, particularly in rural areas. The report of the Combat Poverty Agency identified that the areas of greatest disadvantage were to be found in small rural communities with a population of less than 10,000.  I am not endeavouring to undermine Deputy Gregory's good faith in terms of what he is trying to achieve for the schools in his area.  The Deputy asked me to set up a new scheme.  I will consider the points made by the Deputy and others in relation to the drug task force areas.  However, it will involve an initiative.</P>

    <P>I am aware that some schools seek and obtain voluntary contributions from parents.

      <P>Deputy Gilmore was in Government for a number of years and he is aware that the information to which he referred is not collected. The education system is State aided, but it is not controlled by the State, particularly at second level.  New types of schools are emerging, such as community schools and vocational colleges, which are 100 per cent funded by the State. Deputy Gormley is correct that different funding arrangements apply to these schools.  People may be astonished but that has been the position for many years.  Representations from owners have been to the effect that they are not happy with over encroachment by the State in terms of their ownership and management responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy O'Shea's point about the Education (No. 2) Bill, I am prepared to consider a Report Stage amendment.  I have been advised that primary and secondary schools are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General but there may be a need to include a provision in the Bill.  The matter will be discussed with the partners in the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to deal with the issue raised by Deputy Bruton in consultation with the partners and not on the basis of a unilateral decision by one partner which would be unacceptable.  I met the management bodies concerned and addressed their annual conference.  I gave my thoughts on the issue of the local contribution.  It cannot be phased out overnight.  It involves a sum of up to £5 million and if that happened, it would be a case of replacing existing contributions from management bodies with Exchequer contributions. <Col N="1450" /> There would be no net gain to primary schools if such a move was made.  The bottom line is that an effort should be made to increase the funding for primary schools and not only to change the system of funding which would have no net impact on schools.  A steering group is considering this matter and I hope to receive its report on the funding disparities in vocational, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools soon.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with Deputy Gormley's question but I can contact the Deputy about it.</P>

I realise this is tabled for the Adjournment but, with no disrespect to the person who has raised the matter, we will not have an opportunity to discuss legislation with the Taoiseach.  This is a different issue.

There were gardaí in the area after the tragic death of the lady from Santry. I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  The Conclusions from the Council have been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to outline the areas I identified as the priorities for Ireland in advance of the Council.  Clearly, the topics for discussion at Cardiff were set by the UK Presidency in the light, <i>inter alia</i>, of the current EU agenda. However, I took advantage of Prime Minister Blair's visit to Dublin on 1 June to highlight Irish interests in the content and handling of the discussions at Cardiff, and I am pleased to record that the Conclusions reflect the strategic outcomes I sought on employment, Agenda 2000 and institutional reform.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the euro on 1 January next year will make the closer co-ordination of the economic policy of member states essential. Much of the summit, therefore, was taken up with the discussion of economic and employment guidelines.  The period leading to the introduction of the euro on 1 January and the historic decisions taken at the last meeting of the Heads of State or Government in May provided the backdrop to a broad-ranging discussion at Council on economic issues with a particular focus on the promotion of employment, growth and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The Heads of State or Government agreed the recommendations on the Broad Economic Guidelines in the member states and in the Community and commended them to Council for formal adoption.  The economic guidelines do not present Ireland with any difficulties because the Government is determined to continue with the sound economic policies which have led to the current healthy state of the economy.  This commitment to good economic management reflects the earlier commitment in the Declaration produced by ECOFIN at the Special Council in May, when EMU members and conversion rates were announced.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome the decision by Council that the preparation of the Broad Economic Guidelines should in future draw on short yearend reports drawn up by the member states and the Commission within their respective areas of competence.  Such reports will be a useful complement to information on national employment plans and they will be drawn up on the basis of a light procedure, avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>The annual guidelines will help to further the process of economic integration and to foster the stable low inflation climate required for sustainable job creation.  Equally, the guidelines should, to the greatest possible extent, reflect the competency of national governments in the area of economic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council also considered progress on the <Col N="1460" /> implementation of the employment guidelines adopted following the Extraordinary European Council on Employment held in Luxembourg last year and which are now reflected in the national employment action plans drawn up by the member states.  The Council urged the member states to proceed with the practical implementation of the action plans as speedily as possible, allowing for continued evaluation and updating.  It is worth mentioning that the plan submitted by Ireland is well regarded.  Ireland's plan contains an account of much of the best employment practice across the Union.  We will take up the employment issue in greater detail in Vienna in December when we consider new employment guidelines for 1999.</P>
    <P>A number of key factors, however, are already identifiable as essential in fostering employment growth.  These include the active involvement of the social partners at European and national level in labour market policy development and implementation; the need for targeted investment in education and training to provide opportunities for those who are long-term unemployed or who experience disadvantage or marginalisation; and the need to promote an enterprise culture which favours risk-taking and minimises the burden of regulation falling on SMEs.</P>
    <P>There was a general consensus, which under-scored much of the discussions at the Council on a variety of subjects, that national discretion for action should be maximised.  Accordingly, as regards employment, while sharing information on best practice and completing the Single Market through the more rapid transposition of directives are certainly necessary, the need for innovation and the opportunity for competition between member states should not be stifled.  The issue here centres on achieving the right balance and it is worth mentioning that our discussions on promoting entrepreneurship crystallised many of the wider subsidiarity related issues.</P>
    <P>At Cardiff, leaders looked at ways to make the Union more relevant to its people through greater transparency in the workings of the Union and its institutions and through continuing to tackle the real concerns of the citizen, for instance, in relation to crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to crime and drugs we examined the implementation of the action plan to combat organised crime; we noted progress in the preparations for the establishment of Europol &mdash; Ireland lodged its instrument of adoption of the Europol Convention in March of this year &mdash; and it is hoped that the three remaining partners who have yet to complete the adoption process will do so shortly; and the UK Presidency reported on work in the drugs area, especially as regards identifying the key elements of the Union's anti-drug strategy for the post-1999 period. The plans for the European Drug Prevention Week in November of this year were also noted.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I had raised particular interests of Ireland with Prime Minister Blair on his visit to Dublin.  One of these was the British-Irish Agreement and the ways in which EU support <Col N="1461" /> might be secured for the future, that is, beyond next year.  I am happy to be able to point to the very positive section on the British-Irish Agreement in the Conclusions.  I took the opportunity at the Council to express Ireland's gratitude for the substantial support from our partners, the Commission and the European Parliament.  The Cardiff Conclusions note the Commission's commitment &ldquo;to go on finding new, creative ways to support the fresh opportunities which the Peace Agreement will bring, and invite the Commission to make proposals accordingly&rdquo;.  We will follow up this commitment with the Commission, in consultation with the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>A key strategic interest for Ireland at European level over the next year is the negotiation of a successful outcome to the Agenda 2000 negotiations. While no substantive decisions were taken at Cardiff, I put down clear markers as to Ireland's expectations from the negotiations and sought to avoid a situation which adversely prejudiced the outcome from an Irish perspective.  This was one of my key priorities for the Council and it was achieved.  The most significant result from the Cardiff Council under this heading was a political commitment to conclude negotiations on Agenda 2000 no later than March 1999.</P>
    <P>In the course of our consideration of the topic, I emphasised again our primary concerns in relation to Structural Funds, namely, the need for adequate full transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Austrian Presidency has been mandated to make progress on Agenda 2000 in advance of the December Summit in Vienna.  I am confident, on the basis of my recent meeting with Chancellor Klima in Vienna, that significant progress can be made during the Austrian Presidency.  This, in turn, will hopefully allow for political agreement on the future financial framework, treating Structural, Cohesion and agriculture funding as a whole package at a Special European Council in March under the German Presidency.</P>
    <P>As regards the CAP in particular, I made it clear that the current proposals from the Commission will need to be substantially amended to meet the needs of Irish agriculture.  At my request the European Council took note of the conclusions of the Agriculture Council of 25 and 26 May 1998, which recognised the importance of particular sectors to individual member states.  I stressed the need for a balanced outcome and for an equitable impact on all member states.  It is fair to say that Ireland is not alone in rejecting the proposals as they now stand.</P>
    <P>Some member states pressed their case at Cardiff to develop mechanisms to limit their EU budget contributions.  In contrast, other member states expressed opposition to such arrangements and some opposed acceptance of the 1.27 per cent ceiling on the basis that they believe it is inadequate to fund enlargement.</P>
    <P>For the moment, we will carry on with the 1.27 per cent ceiling as a working assumption.  This is acceptable to Ireland on the basis that it will be <Col N="1462" /> necessary to ensure the Union is adequately resourced to meet both the costs of maintaining and developing Community policies in existing member states and of enlargement.  In this context, I look forward to the Commission's Report on Own Resources in the autumn which, as indicated by the Cardiff Council, will deal with the question of relative budgetary positions in the light of policy reforms and the issues raised under this heading at Cardiff.</P>
    <P>Together with other leaders, I expressed my satisfaction at the good progress being made in the screening process, particularly with regard to the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&mdash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia &mdash; in terms of beginning the analytical screening of their adoption of the Community acquis, i.e. the entire body of legislation, obligations and objectives that have been agreed or developed within the Union.</P>
    <P>The Conclusions regarding the development of improved relations with Turkey are welcome and reflect accurately the concerns of the Union to develop and deepen those relations.  Unfortunately, we could not progress the issue of unblocking financial assistance for Turkey.  The conclusions welcome the Commission's confirmation that it will submit, at end-1998, its first regular reports on each candidate's progress toward accession.  The conclusions also state that in the case of Turkey, reports will be based on Article 28 of the Accession Agreement and the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council.  The Government's recent decision to establish an embassy in Ankara will make a significant contribution towards the deepening of bilateral relations and improved EU-Turkish relations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the outcome of the wide-ranging discussions in relation to the future development of Europe.  The joint letter to the Presidency by Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac, as to possible outcomes, contributed to our discussions.</P>
    <P>As regards further institutional reform, the general view which is reflected in the conclusions was that the first priority is the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is only at that stage a decision will be required on how and when to tackle the implementation of the Protocol in the Amsterdam Treaty, which involves, in the first instance, the changing of the number of Commissioners and voting weights.  There was considerable support for the view that we should leave the consideration of more fundamental and wider institutional reform for a later date, closer to the date of the first enlargement.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the autumn meeting under the Austrian Presidency &mdash; the planned informal meeting of Heads of State and Government &mdash; on how to bring the EU closer to its people and to focus on the issues which matter most to citizens. This theme and that of subsidiarity ran through almost all the discussions on the Union's future development and the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of its institutions.  Our preparatory meeting, likely to take place in October, should <Col N="1463" /> allow for discussions on this issue to be taken further in Vienna.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to report on the wide range of foreign policy items considered at Cardiff as this will be done in the concluding statement, other than first to recall the real concern which I and other leaders expressed about the position in Kosovo and to reaffirm my commitment to the separate declaration which the Council adopted on 15 June.  In terms which I fully support, the declaration firmly points to the responsibility which President Milosovic bears for the use of military repression against the citizens of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Second, the current status of the Middle East peace process was reviewed by the Council. Together with other leaders, I expressed concern at the lack of visible progress in the peace process and the threat this poses to stability in the region. The Council welcomed the Union's positive role in the process and reaffirmed it would continue to do all in its power to support and strengthen both the peace process and those working for peace.</P>
    <P>President Mandela met with me and the other leaders over lunch where a variety of issues were discussed, including South Africa's economy and its efforts to modernise under its Growth, Employment and Redistribution Programme, its relations with neighbouring African States and EU-South African trade co-operation.  On this last item, the lunch-time discussion was important in securing a more positive approach across all member states towards the finalisation of the outstanding trade and co-operation agreement between the Union and South Africa.  I am hopeful that the next negotiating round which will take place in July will see the conclusion of this matter.</P>
    <P>In a subsequent separate bilateral meeting, I discussed the Northern Ireland peace agreement with the President and thanked him for South African-ANC support for the negotiation process. I also briefed him on the challenges ahead in relation to implementation of the agreement. Finally, I extended an invitation to him to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my congratulations and thanks to the UK Presidency, particularly to Prime Minister Blair, for a successful Presidency of the Union.  The EU conference which took place in March in London with applicant states, the ASEM II conference which also took place in London during April with Asian leaders, the launch of economic and monetary union in May in Brussels and the Cardiff summit can be regarded as significant achievements of the UK Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his report.  I am somewhat disappointed at the outcome of the Cardiff summit which lacked innovation. It has resulted in no less than five further summits in the coming 12 months to deal with unfinished business.  Given the nature of unemployment, not only in Ireland where long-term <Col N="1464" /> unemployment is a big problem but in other parts of the European Union, I am disappointed that in the 30-page Cardiff summit statement there was not one reference to local development initiatives.  At every European summit since and including the Essen summit, local development initiatives were referred to.  Given the investment we have made in local development partnerships in the most neglected parts of this State, we should have ensured that was inserted prominently in the summit statement.  It is a major failure on our part not to have done so.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to EMU and the Taoiseach's acceptance of the 1.27 per cent ceiling as a working assumption.  The goal of EMU was set at a meeting of Heads of State of the then Six in 1969, with 1980 as a target date.  Despite that, people still say we are not properly prepared for EMU. The people who said it would not come about are the people who now say we are not properly prepared.  In 1970 the Werner report caused the Paris summit of 1972 to affirm this objective. EMU was relaunched by Roy Jenkins, President of the Commission, in 1977 and was again taken up by Jacques Delors in 1985, and was mentioned in the preamble and the amendment to the Treaty of Rome contained in the Single European Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>In 1988 work began on the Delors report and this led to a decision to convene an intergovernmental conference on EMU, the conclusions of which were a key part of the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 which set out the convergence criteria. In January 1994 the European Monetary Institute began assuming a co-ordinating role in preparation for EMU.  Never before has such careful preparation been put into a project.  At home we submitted it to independent examination by the ESRI, yet those who said it would never come about say that preparation for it has been inadequate. They ask, what would happen if Ireland was hit by an asymmetric shock.  As things stand, what would happen if we were hit by an asymmetric shock?  We are at the mercy of sterling, the deutschmark, the Bundesbank or what is decided in London.  At least under the proposed arrangements there will be some hope that it will not be a national interest which will prevail but the interests of member states within EMU.  It is time we stopped navel gazing and realised that EMU is about to become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise concerns about political and other supports that are not in place, as they should be, for economic and monetary union. There are many examples of currency union that did not succeed and some that did succeed.  I will refer in particular to two that succeeded because they were based on creating a genuine political union, while those that failed in Europe in the past century failed because political union did not accompany the objectives.  When the single currency proposal for Europe was first launched there was a strong political commitment in Germany and France to political union.  European leaders were not afraid to say they favoured a <Col N="1465" /> federal Europe with ever-increasing pooling of sovereignty.  In the cases of currency union that succeeded, the reason for success was that political union accompanied economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>If we go along with the proposal for a 1.27 per cent ceiling as a working assumption, we are agreeing at the outset to the most likely source of difficulty and trouble for EMU at some point in the future. Resistance by many European states to an increase in the European budget displays a lack of understanding of the political commitment necessary if a single currency is to work.  Let me illustrate this by reference to the United States. The United States has a successful currency union, the US dollar.  There are built in safeguards in the American federal system to enable it to protect states which suffer an economic shock of the type, for example, which might happen if Texas suffered as a result of a sudden fall in oil prices.  Where an American state suffers an economic shock, it is helped by large federal government transfers from Washington.  Because there are federal taxes in all states, a state whose income has fallen will pay less tax as a result.  The expenditure and tax stabilisers help US states survive successfully within a single currency.  In New-foundland, Canada, one third of the provincial income comes from the federal government.</P>
    <P>Given the experience Europe has had where successful monetary union has taken place in the past because it was accompanied by political union, and where it has failed because it was not accompanied by political union, surely the Cardiff summit on the eve of EMU should have been more courageous in looking at this example of 1.2 per cent of GNP as budget, which the Taoiseach said we continue to take as a working assumption. Either we are committed to the idea of political union and integration or we are not.  If we are, then a budget of 1.27 per cent will not deliver that level of political union.</P>
    <P>The European Union has missed a golden opportunity not only to make real political advance in terms of its future budget, but to ensure that the Union becomes a more effective and relevant organisation to its citizens.  Each time an EU summit or an intergovernmental conference is held or there is a meeting of the Council of Ministers or the reflection group, we say we want to make the Union more relevant, to relate more to the citizen and to deal with the issues about which the citizen is concerned, but do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which the Cardiff summit could have made real progress by relating to the Union the concerns of the citizens. We have all seen what happened in Algeria recently and the dangers of Kosovo.  We saw what happened in other parts of former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia.  We issued <i>démarches</i> and sat around luncheon tables deciding on short paragraphs for statements over which we could all stand.  While we await confirmation of the <Col N="1466" /> Amsterdam Treaty in the member states real and purposeful advances should have been made well beyond what was indicated from the Cardiff summit in setting up the planning and analysis unit in the common, foreign and security policy area, the second pillar, so that we can play a more effective part, as a Union, in trying to prevent the type of situation which is evolving in Kosovo and pertains in Algeria.  We should not wait for the full ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty to bring that about.</P>
    <P>We could also make the Union more relevant to the citizen in the area of wasteful expenditure. For whatever reason &mdash; perhaps it is that we have received something of the order of £25 billion in transfers from the European Union since 1973 &mdash; we are slow to draw attention to the fact that the European Union is a source of great wasteful expenditure.</P>
    <P>If the Union is to have up to 30 Commissioners in time, what will they do?  If we want to give encouragement to the contributor member states, the net contributors, which we in the foreseeable future, are likely to become, to increase the budget beyond the 1.27 per cent ceiling, we must be serious about cutting out fraud and wasteful expenditure in the European Union and ensure the Union and those who manage it are accountable. I suggest the Taoiseach push out the boat in relation to the role of Commissioners in appearing at not only European Parliament sessions and committees of the European Parliament but at committees of national parliaments.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason the relevant Commissioner, whether the budget Commissioner or another, should not appear at the relevant committee of the Dáil or the Dáil and Seanad at the beginning and end of a commission year, set out his stall and say what his or her plans are for the year and come at the end of the year to say how it was achieved?  If this is done, a role can be found for national parliamentarians &mdash; not only in the policy area but specifically in relation to wasteful expenditure &mdash; to complement that of the European Parliament in bringing about greater accountability for expenditure.  Nobody would run a business in the way the European Union is run.</P>
    <P>In tandem with that, the role of the Court of Auditors should be strengthened to give greater value for money audit powers based on efficiency, effectiveness and economy.  Members of the Court of Auditors should not confine themselves to reporting to the European Parliament.  We have a precedent for that here in that Richie Ryan, who was a member of the Court of Auditors, appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, as did his predecessor, and gave an explanation of its report.  These are basic suggestions on how to make the Union and national parliaments more relevant, cut out wasteful expenditure and persuade member states to contribute a greater amount to the European Union budget because it will be used more effectively. The Taoiseach and his Minister could advance <Col N="1467" /> these suggestions which would be relevant to the European citizen.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the plan on action for employment.  Given the committees, discussions and considerations, I would have thought that at this stage more advanced and innovative proposals would have emerged from the Cardiff summit, including building on the local development initiatives which were not mentioned.  I was particularly disappointed to note that the role of the European Union in dealing with racism and xenophobia was not mentioned nor was the possibility of it taking a leading role in tackling that problem, given our recent problems and the concerns expressed by President Yeltsin in recent days about the rise of racism and xenophobia in Russia, I also note the summit report referred to the advances being made to admit Norway and Iceland to the Schengen agreement.  It will be a source of great disappointment to our citizens &mdash; I raised this issue not only today but when I was a member of the reflection group and at every opportunity &mdash; to see we are racing ahead to give more advanced and preferential treatment to the citizens of Norway and Iceland in relation to travel within the European Union without a passport while our citizens continue to use one.  The Taoiseach should make a point of this at every summit until the British eventually come on side and fully join the European Union which we all want it to do.  It is unacceptable that citizens of Norway and Iceland should have freer access to the European Union than Ireland as a full member.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his report.  I hope he will note my concerns and that they will be addressed at future summits.</P>

      <P>The European Council in Cardiff was a low key affair which did not make much progress in terms of advancing the European project. However, the six months Presidency of the United Kingdom was marked by a dramatic shift in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The positive transformation of this relationship can be attributed to the attitude adopted by the new British Labour Government led by Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  The British handling of the Presidency was positive and effective and we are indebted to them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Tony Blair said in his final address to the European Parliament on 18 June, the Presidency was marked by the launch of two historic events &mdash; economic and monetary union and enlargement. It is somewhat ironic that Britain presided over the successful completion of the negotiations around the establishment of a single currency while, at the same time, not being one of the 11 participating member states.  It is clear from the tone of Tony Blair's speech in Strasbourg and the repeated remarks of the British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, that the British Labour Government <Col N="1468" /> is committed to joining the single currency in due course.  The probability is that sometime around 2002 Britain will be a full member of the EMU. This is good news for Ireland as it removes the volatile relationship between sterling and the Irish pound.  Volatility in the relationship between the two currencies creates problems for Irish business and consequently for the overall performance of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The political row between France and the rest of the member states of the European Union over the appointment of the President of the independent European Central Bank did no credit to France and has probably damaged the perception of the independence of the ECB.  The compromise which was arrived at is messy but workable. The immediate necessity is to ensure that the ECB gets off to a good start from 1 January next year although it has now come into existence in part.</P>
    <P>Sadly, Ireland will not be represented in the operations of ECB management.  This is a failure on the part of the Irish Government to lobby successfully on behalf of a candidate, whom it would have sought and promoted for one of the top 12 senior management posts.  To suggest, as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance did, that since nobody applied for the job they had nobody for whom to lobby is simply out of step with the realities of politics in continental Europe.  It is not clear what the effect will be on Ireland's fortunes in not having a top senior person involved in the day to day management of the bank.  We have lost the opportunity of having someone well placed who, on critical occasions, could be able to keep us properly informed of and represent our views on what was happening.  In years to come we will regret the omission of the Government to ensure an Irish person was placed in one of those senior slots.</P>
    <P>The decision taken at Cardiff on enlargement was a good one.  The European Union must enlarge eastwards to embrace the countries of central and eastern Europe.  The six countries that have been selected &mdash; Cyprus, and the central European countries of the former Soviet bloc, Estonia, Poland, The Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia &mdash; have made extraordinarily good progress towards the democratisation of their societies and the transition from command economies to market economies.  However, they still have a long road to travel and Ireland should be to the forefront in assisting that transition and adaptation.</P>
    <P>The issue of employment remains high on the European agenda.  Some 18 million European workers are still unemployed.  They are a reminder that the European labour market is not working as effectively or efficiently as it should or could.  The changes proposed at the Luxembourg Summit last autumn and which are incorporated in the employment chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty will, in time, make a significant impact on the high levels of unemployment in certain parts of Europe.  In addition the progress in completing <Col N="1469" /> the single market will ensure the remaining barriers to the full integration of the European market will be removed.</P>
    <P>Since December last year the single market scoreboard shows that the proportion of measures which have to be implemented in all member states to confirm the single market has increased from 73 per cent to 82 per cent.  As Tony Blair said, we must go further and faster. Particular priorities for the future are further progress in financial services, improved enforcement of single market law and tackling unwarranted price differences across Europe.  From 1 January 1999 those price differences will become far more transparent and obvious because of the introduction of the single currency.  While national currencies will continue to be used to 2001 the fact that exchange rates will be irrevocably fixed will ensure people will be able to compare clearly and directly prices in Spain as against Portugal or, indeed, prices in Ireland as against France and Germany.</P>
    <P>I note the question of Agenda 2000 has, in effect, been postponed until the Austrian Presidency with a commitment that the major decisions on Agenda 2000 will be taken during the German Presidency in the first half of next year.  This is an ambitious timetable and there are many issues of concern from Ireland's point of view.  All we can do here today is note the limited progress that has been made to date and to ensure this House has an opportunity on a number of occasions to look in detail at progress in relation to these important negotiations.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have spoken out strongly on this issue.  This side of the House will monitor the progress of these talks very carefully.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disappointed at the failure of the Cardiff Summit to address the issue of the democratic deficit which is now looming as a major issue on the European political landscape. I am also disappointed the Taoiseach repeatedly refused to debate this issue in advance of attending the Cardiff summit so that we might have had a chance in the House to put on record our views regarding this matter.  It would also have given the Taoiseach an opportunity to set out the Government's attitude on these issues. Yet, repeated attempts by me to table questions to the Taoiseach were effectively blocked.</P>
    <P>Many people have commented that the percentage no vote in the recent Amsterdam referendum on 22 May was the highest recorded in any European referendum here since 1972.  Many of the people who voted no indicated a wariness about the future transfer of sovereignty from nation states to European institutions that do not appear to be open to or answerable to democratic accountability.  I share that view.  There is far too much unnecessary secrecy surrounding the proceedings of various Councils of Ministers.  All those meetings should be open to print and broadcast media.  The present situation is farcical. Regularly, during the course of ECOFIN Council <Col N="1470" /> meetings which take place once a month, Ministers from different states systematically leave the Council to brief the gathered journalists on the outcome of a particular issue to give their most favourable spin on it.  As matters stand the same journalists already have access to much more information within the corridors of Brussels and Strasbourg than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The process of decision making is such that by the time a formal Council meeting takes place, many of the difficulties surrounding a particular issue have been resolved.  Consequently there is no threat to the efficiency of decision making by opening the Councils to the full glare of the media, both television and print journalists. Arguments against it are similar to the arguments we heard in recent years against the introduction of radio and television coverage of proceedings in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The other area of concern to European citizens is the manner and the way in which the President of the Commission is chosen.  The process is more akin to the quintessential smoke-filled backrooms associated with the political haggling of conventions for the selection of candidates for the American Presidency.  The previous selection for the President of the European Commission saw the vetoing of Ruud Lubbers, the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, by the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who then, with the French, promoted the candidacy of the Prime Minister of Belgium, Jean Luc Dehaene.  This, in turn, was vetoed by the then British Prime Minister, John Major.  This was entirely for domestic political purposes and on behalf of the troubled, beleaguered and bitterly divided British Conservative Party.  The man selected as a compromise, Jacques Santer, was every bit as much a pro-European and adopted the same stance as Jean Luc Dehaene on all the key issues about which Mr. Major was so concerned.</P>
    <P>I support the initiative launched by the former President of the EU Commission, Jacques Delors, which suggests that candidates for the Presidency of the European Commission should be nominated by the political parties within the European Parliament and proposed to the Heads of Government for consideration.  This proposal has great merit and should be examined in a constructive and positive manner.  The Government should take a formal view in relation to this. There is a clear necessity for a debate about the kind of Europe in which we wish to participate and the sort of democratic checks and balances which it requires.  If there is a lesson to be learned from the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, it is that the original love affair which many Irish citizens have had with European Union appears to be coming to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cardiff Summit marks the closing stages of the British Presidency of the EU.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, and the British Government are entitled to praise for the solid and steady leadership provided over the <Col N="1471" /> past six months.  The British Presidency will be remembered less for Cardiff than for the earlier summit in Brussels which finalised arrangements for EMU.  If there were no single or particular matter of historical importance at Cardiff, EU leaders nonetheless touched on a number of important issues which must be decided in the coming months and which will have a profound impact on the success or otherwise of the European project.  The Cardiff Summit set out a formidable agenda of work with no fewer than five formal or informal summits over the next nine months.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to hold a special summit in Innsbruck to consider ways of bringing the European Union back to its citizens.  The further development of the European Union will only be possible with the involvement and support of its citizens.  However, the signs are that more people increasingly regard the institutions of the European Union as remote and appearing to lack any relevance to the day to day problems they face. Concern about this problem which already existed was intensified by the significant &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes in the referendums in Ireland and Denmark on the Amsterdam Treaty.  There is significant evidence, supported not just by anecdotal experience but also opinion polls, that many of those who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum in this country did so, not because they opposed any specific item in the treaty, but because they did not understand it and were unsure of the likely impact of its ratification.  We clearly need to improve the flow of information to the public. This must be done, not just when they are asked to vote, but on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>We also not only need to improve the level of information but also the level of debate about European Union related issues.  This should be done by putting in place an effective role for national parliaments in the decision making process as well as formal consultation with non-governmental organisations and local authorities. The European Union is largely run by way of intergovernmental decision making, by the Commission initiating legislation and by the Parliament and the Council addressing those issues.  I am sure all national parliaments have European affairs committees.  By and large, these committees address issues related to the European Union after the fact rather than before legislation is dealt with.  We need to find a way to make what is happening in Europe relevant, not just to the governments of member states but to the parliaments. I would go further and suggest that there should be a way of involving the elected members' local authorities in a consultative process related to what is happening in Europe.  It is only through some such mechanism that we will have an engagement at a political level with what is happening in Europe.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem is self-inflicted.  Too often decisions made by the Commission or the Council of Ministers are seen to be inflexible or illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> The decision made in 1991 to abolish duty free is a classic example of a European Union own goal. Another potential one is the threat to anti-poverty community and development projects in Ireland and throughout the Union arising from the decision of the Commission earlier this month to freeze a series of budget lines.  The Commission made the decision to freeze budget funding of around £300 million following a judgment of the European Court of Justice that certain spending programmes had no legal basis.  This arose from a case taken by the UK and reflects the position before the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Commission was unnecessarily cautious in deciding to cut the funding and, if the decision is allowed to stand, it will not only cripple vital projects but will be enormously damaging to the standing of the European Union.  The ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty by all member states will allow funding of this nature to be put on a firm legal basis.  In the meantime, emergency provision should be made to allow all deserving projects to continue.  It is a pity the subject did not even merit a mention at the summit last weekend.</P>
    <P>The other key issues which must be decided in the coming months and which will have particular significance for Ireland are the Agenda 2000 proposals and the decisions relating to the next round of EU funding.  In this regard, the Government must take every step to ensure that proposals to reduce EU Structural and Cohesion Funds do not undermine the economic progress made by this country in recent years.  Proposals to reduce our share of EU funds were inevitable given the failure of the Union to increase its central budget.  Successive Irish Governments have not argued strongly enough for an increase in the central budget.  Even without enlargement, the current budget would not be sufficient to manage the degree of integration EMU will bring.  With ten prospective member states knocking on the door and with the proposed budget ceiling of 1.27 per cent of GDP, it is totally inadequate.  If the <i>status quo</i> is allowed to stand, it will be unsustainable and, unless there is change, we will be faced ten to 15 years down the road with a possible disintegration of the European Union.</P>
    <P>If we want to combat poverty and unemployment effectively, it is essential reductions in Structural Funds are kept to a minimum and that the process is managed effectively.  The Government should not seek to retain Objective I status for certain parts of the country.  It is far better the entire country be categorised the same way, thus allowing targeting of funds to tackle specific problems, such as poverty and unemployment which are found in both rural and urban Ireland, rather than putting everything in certain geographical areas.  There must be no question of throwing in the towel on Structural and Cohesion Funds to concentrate all efforts on trying to preserve Ireland's funding under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Notwithstanding the importance of agriculture to Ireland, it would not be in the national interest to trade Structural and Cohesion <Col N="1473" /> Funds for the retention of a discredited CAP system which adds significantly to the cost of food for consumers and which disproportionately benefits the largest and wealthiest farmers.</P>
    <P>It is clear we need to start making our own plans to deal with the new situation.  It is inevitable EMU will lead to new problems for this country with the threat of increased unemployment a concern.  We should follow the lead of the Finns who have established a buffer fund to deal with the potential problems of EMU.  Rather than providing tax give-aways for the rich, such as halving capital gains tax, the Government should commit available resources to such a buffer fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference by the Taoiseach to the conclusions of the Cardiff Summit which state that one of the important issues for the creation and maintenance of employment is the need for targeted investment in education and training so that we provide opportunities for those who are long-term unemployed or who experience disadvantage or marginalisation.  Will the Taoiseach impress that view on Deputy Harney so that we no longer have to listen to the nonsense she trotted out last week on unemployment?  She seems to think that threatening the unemployed with the loss of benefit will, in some miraculous way, make them employable.  In many cases they are unemployable because of their lack of skills and the long period they have been out of the work-force. The Taoiseach's views are contrary to those of Deputy Harney.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a Green group motion before the European Parliament last week, subsequent to the Cardiff Summit.  I urge Green Party Deputies to read the motion as it is in stark contrast to the position the Green Party takes in this House on EMU.  The first paragraph of the motion states:</P>
    <P>.rejects the attempts by President Chirac and Chancellor Kohl to misuse the concept of subsidiarity and decentralisation in order to weaken European institutions and to prevent, after the implementation of the euro, any serious European initiatives in the economic, social and environmental fields; supports the Commission in its efforts to develop the necessary common European policies; repeats its call for a clearer division of tasks between the EU and its member states and regions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Green Party will take those sentiments on board and end the nonsensical, chauvinistic line it has been peddling in and outside this House for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been noted that the European Council at Cardiff was a good illustration that the reality of European integration is a perpetual work in progress.  High on the agenda of the five summit meetings proposed for the next 12 months is: &ldquo;The stimulation of the attention and commitment of citizens who are widely perceived to be alienated from this emerging system of internationalised government.&rdquo; In this regard <Col N="1474" /> the Irish and the Danes can take a bow, primarily because we have given ourselves institutions which require major decisions relating to the EU to be taken by referendum rather than by cabinet.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, it must be noted that it was the intrepid vigilance of the late Ray Crotty and Patricia McKenna MEP which gave the Supreme Court the opportunity to instruct the Government as to its responsibilities on such decision making and as to the appropriate manner of its discharging those responsibilities.  In effect, successive Governments have had subsidiarity forced upon them by individual citizens who have shown tremendous courage and determination.  In his own words, Ray Crotty &ldquo;caught the Government with its hands in the till of the people's constitutional rights&rdquo; in his challenge to the Single European Act.  He seems to have played a major posthumous role in influencing the attitude of the Cardiff Summit.</P>
      <P>The emphasis on bringing the EU closer to its citizens and on focusing on issues which matter to them would have given Ray Crotty some wry satisfaction.  It is interesting that some of those who now express concern about the democratic deficit had no time for Ray Crotty and did not welcome the Supreme Court's decision.</P>
      <P>The second reason Irish voters can take pride in having influenced the Cardiff Summit derives from the strength and growth of the sceptical vote in the EU referenda.  This culminated in the Amsterdam referendum where almost 40 per cent of the electorate, following the lead of fewer than a handful of parliamentarians, gave clear expression to their views on the idea of a federal European superstate.  The summit confirms that our voice was, at least, heard.</P>
      <P>However, there are sharp encounters to come. A system of internationalised government which seeks to bring about a fortress European superstate, belching out its wastes and toxins and excreting its technologically armed, pharmaceutically enhanced and genetically modified product lines on an undernourished and war torn southern hemisphere, is a nightmare which true international Governments would seek to avoid. However, that is the reality which has been created by the political elite of the EU who met at Cardiff last week.</P>
      <P>President Mandela reminded the conference of this fact, emphasising the need for Europe to build a special relationship with Africa based on mutual confidence and co-operation rather than handouts.  There is a striking contrast in the welcome the Irish people gave to Nelson Mandela in 1990 and the current, somewhat hysterical, expressions of zero tolerance towards refugees and asylum seekers from Africa and elsewhere.  If the recent attacks on the offices of the Association of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Ireland indicates that we are moving towards some kind of European mainstream then there is little to celebrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cardiff showed that European leaders are unsure about the future direction of Europe and <Col N="1475" /> that they have become aware of the widespread dissatisfaction with the creation of a European superstate.  President Chirac and Chancellor Kohl had the audacity to write to Tony Blair on the eve of the summit stating that they did not want to see the creation of a Central European state. Chancellor Kohl has been the prime mover in creating a federal Europe and this statement was made for domestic political reasons.  He is donning Euro-sceptical clothes simply because of the forthcoming election.</P>
    <P>The recent referendum results show that there is growing disenchantment with the direction Europe is taking.  The centralisation of power will lead to a power vacuum, leading in turn to an emergence of right wing groups and greater political instability.  The democratic deficit has not been addressed and ordinary Europeans feel alienated from the decision making process. Many who voted for the EEC do not want a federal Europe.  Following the Amsterdam Treaty the Taoiseach stated that the Irish people do not want to see a federal superstate.  However, that is what we are getting.  The single European currency is a pillar of statehood.  So too are the creation of a European FBI &mdash; Europol &mdash; and the eventual creation of a European army, favoured by Chancellor Kohl.</P>
    <P>Cardiff failed to address the major issues facing Europe.  Deputy Gay Mitchell is correct to say that unemployment is not being properly addressed.  However, he is not correct to say that Ireland is perfectly placed to avail of EMU.  Most European and Irish economists will confirm that our economy is out of synchronisation with other European economies and the last thing we need is lower interest rates but that is what we will get. The housing market is out of control and the Bacon report is powerless to do anything about it.  It is clear that we are following a European model where house ownership will become the preserve of the wealthy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell is an ardent proponent of EMU and has highlighted the fact that economic union is not possible without fiscal union or transfers. In fact he contradicts himself.  On the one hand he says that it does not matter if we have an asymmetric shock.  On the other hand he gives the example of the US where there are fiscal transfers.</P>

      <P>We can check the record.  Hans Tietmeyer, President of the Bundesbank, stated that when it comes to asymmetric shocks one is on one's own.  Without fiscal transfers that is the situation.  I have no doubt that we will eventually see fiscal union and tax harmonisation and I await <Col N="1476" /> the reaction of the Irish people when they become aware of this fact.  The sad fact is that for many people and political parties, Europe is nothing more than a gravy train but the gravy is drying up.</P>

The recent report from the European Environment Agency shows that, despite many EU environmental directives, pollution problems and habitat destruction continues apace.</P>
      <P>If Deputy De Rossa believes in subsidiarity, I hope he accepts that the Green Party is entitled to its opinion.  We do not have to fall into the Stalinist line with Green parties elsewhere.  We have our own opinions.  It is interesting to note that the Green movement and Green parties in Europe were at one in rejecting the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>

      <P>As will be clear from the Taoiseach's statement earlier, the Cardiff European Council established the timetable for taking key decisions on the future of the European Union during the Austrian and German Presidencies.</P>
      <P>In keeping with their importance for the lives of our citizens, the Heads of State or Government attached high priority to economic issues and specifically to the key question of how to promote employment.  Recalling the recent decisions on the move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999, the Council recognised the progress made by all member states towards a high degree of convergence and reiterated that the introduction of the euro will help to ensure stable macroeconomic conditions.  As the Taoiseach reported, Cardiff endorsed a set of broad economic guidelines and reviewed progress in the implementation of the Employment Guidelines for 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to Agenda 2000, Deputies will have noted that, while the Taoiseach used this occasion to register some of Ireland's key concerns, Cardiff represented very much a stocktaking exercise and a package of fundamental decisions remains to be taken by the target date of March 1999.  In the first instance, discussions will resume in the Council of Ministers on the key issues.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his colleagues in the General Affairs Council will lay the ground for achieving as much progress as possible at the Vienna European Council in December, in line with the Cardiff conclusions.  There will be detailed input from the Agriculture and Finance Ministers in their areas of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions of fundamental importance to Ireland need to be resolved in the negotiations ahead.  In regard to the proposed reform <Col N="1477" /> of the Common Agricultural Policy, we will continue robustly to defend our interests and seek an equitable outcome which reflects the great importance to our farming economy, and our economy as a whole, of the beef and milk sectors. We will maintain our position that the proposals as they stand are not acceptable to us.  The most important aspect of the proposals on Structural Funds from our point of view is the transitional arrangements for regions, such as Ireland, which have ceased to meet the qualifying criterion for Objective I status.  The outcome of the negotiations in this area must address our continuing development needs, especially in the area of infrastructure.  It must also meet the needs of the less developed parts of the country.  We will continue to resist firmly any link between our EMU participation and our eligibility for Cohesion Fund assistance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of the value and significance of the European Council's conclusions to the British-Irish Agreement.  It will be important that, at the appropriate time, substance should be put on the undertaking of the Union to continue to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  The Cardiff European Council noted the Commission's commitment to finding new creative ways to support the fresh opportunities arising from the Agreement and invited the Commission to make proposals accordingly.  The continued support of our European partners, of the European Commission and of the European Parliament is deeply appreciated.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the substantial progress made since Luxembourg in preparing for enlargement.  The Union's priority is to maintain the enlargement process for the countries covered in the Luxembourg European Council Conclusions, a process within which these countries can actively pursue their candidatures and make progress towards taking on the obligations of membership.  The Conclusions state that each of these candidate countries will be judged on the basis of the same criteria and will proceed in its candidature at its own rate, depending on its degree of preparedness.  The Commission will submit its first regular reports on each candidate's progress towards accession at the end of this year.  In the case of Turkey, these reports will be based on Article 28 of the Association Agreement and the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke about the wide-ranging preliminary exchange of views among Heads of State or Government at Cardiff on the future development of the European Union and other speakers referred to this important discussion. This is to be carried forward at an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government, probably in October, in preparation for the Vienna European Council.  All member states, not least Ireland, have a particular interest in the subjects which arise in this context.</P>
    <P>While the main focus in Cardiff was on the <Col N="1478" /> need to advance discussion of internal issues, the Council also addressed a number of urgent foreign policy concerns.  The Taoiseach referred to the firm and unequivocal declaration adopted by the Council on the subject of Kosovo.  This was issued on Monday, 15 June, with the intention of influencing the outcome of President Milosevic's meeting in Moscow with President Yeltsin the following day.  The text reflects a lengthy and sombre discussion by Foreign Ministers in Cardiff during which my colleague Minister Andrews expressed his concern about the plight of the Kosovo Albanians.  I am sure Deputies on all sides will share the view that the crisis poses a serious threat to regional peace and security in the region.  The Council declaration strongly condemns the actions of President Milosevic who bears a heavy personal responsibility for the use of brutal military repression against the citizens of Kosovo.  That repression has driven many from their homes and created a significant displacement and refugee problem in Kosovo and neighbouring Albania.</P>
    <P>In Cardiff the European Union supplemented existing sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by imposing a ban on flights to member states by Yugoslav carriers.  The Declaration of the European Council addresses a number of demands to President Milosevic, including the withdrawal of security units used for civilian repression in Kosovo, unimpeded access for humanitarian and international monitoring agencies, facilitation of the return of refugees and rapid progress in the political dialogue with the Kosovo Albanian leadership.  Failure on the part of Belgrade to take these steps would result in a much stronger response, of a qualitatively different order, on the part of the international community, including measures which would require a resolution of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers returned to the subject of Kosovo on the second day of the Council, Tuesday 16 June, after receiving initial reports of the outcome of the meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Milosevic.  While some limited progress was made in Moscow, including agreement on international access and dialogue, there was no clear commitment by President Milosevic to the withdrawal of security units used for civilian repression.  Furthermore, while he has undertaken to resume dialogue with the Kosovo Albanian leadership, President Milosevic did not accede to the long standing demand of the European Union and Contact Group members for international mediation.  This is an ongoing concern. The European Council called on both sides to return to the negotiating table and on the Kosovo Albanian leadership to state clearly its rejection of violence and terrorism.</P>
    <P>President Milosevic has not yet responded adequately to the European Union's demands. Nevertheless, the measures he has agreed to take are being examined carefully.  In the light of this examination, the need for further action will be considered by the Union and the relevant international <Col N="1479" /> bodies.  The Council agreed that the European Union will play its part in an effective monitoring effort by increasing the number of its monitors in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The European Council also agreed to adopt a comprehensive approach to solving the refugee problem within the region based on the right of refugees to return to their homes in conditions of security.  As a first step, assistance will be provided from the European Community budget and member states.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Government took immediate action in respect of this commitment by allocating £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for Kosovo refugees in Albania.</P>
    <P>The European Council expressed its very grave concern at the continuing lack of progress in the Middle East peace process and the threat that this poses to the stability and security of the region. It stressed that the current opportunity for progress on the Palestinian track must not be lost.  It confirmed its strong support for the efforts which the US is making in this context.  The Council called on Israel to recognise the right of the Palestinians to exercise self-determination without excluding the option of a State.  The European Council also called upon the Palestinian people &ldquo;to reaffirm their commitment to the legitimate right of Israel to live within safe, recognised borders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The statement by the European Council was a balanced and well intentioned expression of our collective concern at the very serious stalemate in the process set out in the Oslo Accords.  The Israeli Government's subsequent rejection of the views expressed by the European Union in Cardiff is a matter of deep regret.  Indeed, the situation on the ground has been further exacerbated by the announcement by Prime Minister Netanyahu of a draft plan relating to Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>The European Council confirmed the Union's desire to do all in its power to support and strengthen the peace process and those striving to carry it forward.</P>
    <P>The recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have caused grave concern both in the region and the wider international community.  The European Council reiterated its concern over the situation in South Asia, whose stability has been damaged by the tests, and encouraged India and Pakistan to address constructively the issues which divide them.  It welcomed the establishment by a number of countries of a task force to promote non-proliferation in the region.  The Council reaffirmed the EU view that the Non-Proliferation Treaty constitutes the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and called on India, Pakistan and others who have not done so to accede to it.</P>
    <P>The Cardiff conclusions also recalled member states' commitment to the goal of global elimination of nuclear weapons enshrined in Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This month, as the House is aware, Ireland and Sweden, with a <Col N="1480" /> number of other countries, launched an important initiative on nuclear disarmament.  I am pleased to report that its significance was recognised by the European Council which &ldquo;took note of the recent initiative on this issue by several countries, including Ireland and Sweden&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Developments in Indonesia and their implications for East Timor were considered by the Council which encouraged President Habibie to implement his commitment to political and economic reform and the holding of early elections next year.  It is most important that these commitments are fulfilled for the welfare of the Indonesian people in the post Suharto era.  The Council expressed its support for the economic recovery of Indonesia and welcomed the humanitarian assistance being provided by the EU and its member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland pressed for a strong statement on East Timor from the European Council.  I am pleased to report that the Council reaffirmed the importance of a just, global and internationally acceptable solution.  The Council conclusions also called for the release of all political prisoners, including those from East Timor, and agreed to continue to press for the early release of Xanana Gusmao. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had earlier raised the question of Gusmao's release with his European colleagues as well as in his discussions with President Mandela.  The Government very much hopes that recent developments in Indonesia will help to advance efforts towards a settlement under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.  Ireland will continue to raise the question of justice for East Timor within the EU and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Council called for a ceasefire in the tragic dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea and condemned the bombings of each others territories and the needless loss of lives.  The Union will continue its support for the mediation efforts under way, including those of the US-Rwandan facilitation team, and has offered to provide material assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Treaty of Amsterdam will bring about certain changes in the organisation of the common foreign and security policy of the Union.  Specifically the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers will become high representative for the CFSP with the dual role of assisting the presidency in the representation of the Union and contributing to policy formulation.  To free him to take on this additional responsibility a post of deputy secretary general will be created.  The Treaty of Amsterdam also provides for the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit under the responsibility of the high representative to advise the Council in the CFSP area.  The conclusions of the European Council refer to both these innovations and commit the Heads of State or Government to make the necessary decisions in December next.  I expect the Vienna European Council will agree on the person to fill the post <Col N="1481" /> of high representative.  It is intended that the high representative will be an international figure of standing and established reputation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Andrews, raised his concern about the tragic situation in Sudan during the lunchtime discussion of Foreign Ministers at Cardiff.  In response, and at the Minister's request, the Presidency indicated its intention of providing for a substantial discussion of the issue during the forthcoming General Affairs Council on 29 June.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Authority shall require that all food containing genetically modified organisms which is imported or offered for sale in the State is clearly labelled to indicate the presence of such organisms which shall be detailed on the label.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The genetic engineering of food for human consumption is a major question confronting society at present and raises very broad environmental issues which, unfortunately, do not come under the scope of the Bill.  These include the effect which the genetic engineering of plants, crops, vegetables and so on could have on the ecosystem, the dangers posed to the integrity of ecosystems built up over thousands of years and the <Col N="1483" /> food emerging from them for animal or human consumption.  It would be far better if a holistic approach were taken to this issue; I regret there was not any comprehensive discussion on it in this House in the past 12 months but it is important that one takes place in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will confine my comments to the effects of genetic engineering as they relate to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill.  Genetically modified organisms in food raise very grave questions in regard to human health.  People have very real and well grounded fears about human allergies and illnesses caused by genetically engineered food.  Genetic engineering entails radical tampering with genes, one of the most fundamental blocks of plant, animal and human life.  For example, genes are taken from microbes, scorpions and fish and inserted into plants and vegetables. The soya bean has been one of the main targets of such genetic manipulation.  Genes are transposed from brazil nuts, for example, allegedly to enrich the nutrition content of the soya bean.  Soya is used in a vast array of foods, some of the most common being bread, margarine, cereals, flour, baby food and chocolate and nobody knows what the effects of this kind of genetic engineering and tampering will be on human health.</P>
    <P>In the case of genes being transposed from brazil nuts into soya beans, it has been documented and scientifically proven that this practice could have very serious effects on people who are allergic to nuts.  Scientists at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln found that tests proved that soya beans modified with genes from brazil nuts to produce nutritious proteins found in the nuts also produced proteins which set off strong and potentially deadly allergic reactions in people sensitive to brazil nuts.  The findings confirm early suspicions that transferring genes to food plants posed such risks.  Those findings are contained in an article by Warren E. Leary entitled Genetic Engineering of Food Can Spread Serious Allergies.  Dr. Rebecca J. Goldburg, senior scientist with the Environmental Defence Fund in the US, said the study published in the 14 March issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> confirmed scientific fears about genetically engineered crop plants causing allergic reactions.  Dr. Goldburg stated that since genetic engineers mix genes from a wide array of species, other genetically engineered foods may cause similar health problems.  People who are allergic to one type of food may suddenly discover they are allergic to many more because of the transposition of genes from the food to which they are allergic.  In an editorial in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, Dr. Marion Nestle of New York University said proof that allergens could be transferred from one food to another made it imperative the US Government considered regulating the industry. Food allergies have, she states, been confirmed in at least 2 per cent of the adult population and 8 per cent of children and there is evidence that <Col N="1484" /> the prevalence of food allergies and sensitivities is increasing as more proteins are added to commercial foods.  Therefore, it is beyond doubt that genetic engineering can cause potentially deadly health effects.</P>
    <P>Genetic engineering is proceeding at a frightening pace with genes from a variety of sources being introduced into an array of foods including animal foodstuffs such as maize.  What is true of the brazil nut and soya bean undoubtedly holds true for other instances in which genes are transposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say the current policy of substantial equivalence is sufficient to allow people to know whether foods are dangerous.  Substantial equivalence is described as the idea that existing organisms used as food or food sources can serve as a basis for comparison when assessing the safety of human consumption of a food or food component which is new or modified.  If a genetically engineered food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it may be treated in the same manner with respect to its safety.  This theory has also been discredited in scientific experiments. In the case of yeast, genetically engineered to produce high levels of enzymes which break down sugar, scientists were concerned with boosting enzyme activity on the different chemical pathways of the breakdown process.</P>
    <P>The research has found that concentrations of a toxic and mutagenic product, mg, was up to 30 times higher in the mixtures with a genetically engineered yeast compared to the original strains. The fact that boosting the concentration of an enzyme can affect build-up of products several metabolic steps further downstream has serious repercussions for the credibility of the concept of substantial equivalents.  On this basis alone, it is critical that any foods presented to our consumers, which are genetically engineered or contain genetically modified organisms of any kind, must be clearly labelled and contain on the label the exact contents of the so-called novel food. Every human being has a right to be absolutely clear about what they eat in that regard.</P>
    <P>We cannot trust the multinationals, which are pushing genetic engineering and are greatly involved in the food industry, with safeguarding the health of human beings.  Greed for profit dominates multinationals.  Some of them, such as Monsanto, have extremely unsavoury histories. Monsanto, which is one of the giants of genetic engineering, manufactured large quantities of agent orange.  That diabolic substance laid waste to millions of acres of foliage in Vietnam, caused horrific cancers and diseases in the Vietnamese population and in Vietnam veterans of the United States Army and mutations and diseases which persist to this day.  We cannot give multinationals any benefit of the doubt.  In some cases they have lied outright about the veracity of experiments and what they showed.</P>
    <P>This calls for the legal underpinning of the right of the consumer to be forewarned and to be <Col N="1485" /> informed of the exact contents of what they eat. It is a matter of life and death in some cases and a matter of the health and safety of our people. All foods, imported or sold here, must be clearly labelled, that must be underpinned in law and there must be substantial penalties for any person or agency which does not do that.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally sympathetic to Deputy Higgins's amendment.  It relates to labelling and the consumers' right to know the contents of what they purchase.  Deputy Higgins commenced a debate on genetic engineering <i>per se.</i> While it may be necessary at an early stage to have a debate on the wider aspects of genetic engineering, we are talking about the food safety authority, the protection of consumers and their right to know the contents of what they eat.</P>
      <P>Section 12 relates to the promotion of standards. Under that section we should define as clearly as possible the consumers' right to know what is being consumed.  There is an increasing awareness and fear of genetically engineered foodstuffs.  Part of that fear may be irrational because the debate on this matter has not concluded, but the public desire full information about the food chain and genetically engineered foodstuffs.  A commitment given on this issue has not been met by the Government.  Many of the claims and arguments put forward by those who are concerned and publicly protesting about genetic engineering could be addressed if the Government put in place what it promised last year in relation to genetic engineering.  While we continue to allow a void in this area, the public will continue to have fears about it.  If the food safety authority is to promote the highest standards and to ensure that, at all times, consumers know what is in the foodstuffs being consumed, it is important the food labelling system should clearly indicate genetically modified foods.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago there was a public debate on the question of the danger of various food additives.  Many of the difficulties presented were resolved when a labelling system that included additives was put in place and a reasonable number of people were reassured, but there is no such system in place for genetically modified foodstuffs.  When we are putting in place a new food safety authority, it would be helpful to the consumer and appropriate to address this issue by putting in place a transparent food labelling system that would include genetically modified foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>We must positively consider what the amendment states about labelling genetically modified foodstuffs and I hope the Minister will respond to it in a reasonable manner.  We are not dealing with the wider aspects of genetically engineered foodstuffs, although such a debate should take place at the earliest possible opportunity, but with letting the consumer know if a foodstuff has been derived from genetic engineering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to engage in a debate on genetic engineering.  This Bill is about the consumers' right to know what ingredients are in the foods they buy.  The area of genetic engineering of food is one of growing concern among the public and there is likely to be a greater use of genetically engineered ingredients in foods as developments, if they can be called that, come about in science.  At the very least we must bear in mind there is a potential danger to people's health in the use of genetically engineered foods.  That is a non-judgmental statement.</P>
      <P>Consumers have a right to know the ingredients in what they eat.  As Deputy Bradford said, we established that consumers have a right to know the various additives in foods.  There is widespread public concern, especially among those whose family members suffer from various allergies, that consumers do not know the contents of what they purchase.  For that reason it is essential we guarantee a person's right to know what is in the food purchased.  We should support this amendment on labelling.</P>
      <P>Agreeing to this amendment does not make a statement about genetic engineering, but it establishes that people have a right to know the contents of what they purchase and, consequently, a right to make a choice about the foodstuffs they buy.  That is the very minimum to which we should agree in relation to this very fast growing area, about which we and, I am sure many medical people, would admit we know very little. Because of that we must accept there are potential dangers and we should afford at least minimum protection by ensuring genetically modified foods are indicated on labels.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the only parties which have raised concerns about genetic engineering are the Green and the Socialist Parties. Deputy Naughten is smiling but he was quite critical of me, as was Deputy Upton, when this matter arose previously.  It is important to have a comprehensive debate on this issue.  There is widespread concern about the food we eat because it is so basic and intrinsic to how we live our lives.</P>
      <P>Countries such as Austria and Italy have succeeded in banning GMOs.  Ireland should follow suit and that was promised by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition.  The promise was opportunistically made before the election and was quickly abandoned afterwards.  Its excuse was summed up in the phrase &ldquo;that was then but this is now&rdquo;. People will be extremely cynical about such election ploys in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to outline the <Col N="1487" /> background of this matter.  Monsanto has huge influence so we must put down an amendment in this regard.  I hope all parties in the House will support it.</P>
      <P>There are what some geneticists and scientists call pleiotropic or unforeseen effects as a result of genetic engineering.  They have been seen in Scotland where genetically modified salmon turned green.  Usually I like to see things turn green but this was one instance where it was unacceptable.  There are problems with toxins and allergens and that is the worry.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not alarmist or scaremongering. It is a sensible approach which adopts a precautionary principle.  Consumers have a right to know.  Monsanto will claim to agree with the principle of labelling but I do not believe it is enthusiastic about it.  Consumers will not eat genetically modified food because they have concerns about it.  If consumers know what is in food they will be sensible about eating it.  The genetic engineering lobby does not want consumers to know what is in food.  Genetic engineers want gene transfer to take place.  They want products to be a big mish-mash so that consumers will not have a choice.  There are already moves in the United States to relax the regulations in relation to organic farming.</P>
      <P>Irish politicians have a duty to legislate for the health of individuals.  Science has often produced so-called fantastic developments in the past. Members might recall when DDT first came on the market and how it was celebrated as a fantastic scientific development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with labelling food and the Fine Gael Party will support the amendment.  It is vitally important that there is proper labelling of every food product, whether it is genetically modified or produced from other sources.  However, the amendment does not include genetically modified ingredients.  Aspartamine, for example, is produced by a genetically modifed organism but the product is not genetically modified.  Another example outside the food industry is insulin which is produced by a genetically modified organism but the product is the same as insulin produced by humans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there can be unforeseen effects as a result of genetically modifying organisms. However, there are unforeseen effects attached to everything.  If somebody leaves Leinster House this evening in a car, they do not know if they will arrive again in the morning or whether there <Col N="1488" /> will be a traffic accident.  There is no such thing as a 100 per cent guarantee of safety and no product is ever completely safe.  Eating chicken carries a risk of salmonella while there is a risk of BSE in beef.  The risks are small but they exist no matter what one eats or what one does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we had the opportunity to briefly discuss genetic engineering although, sadly, there has not been a full debate on the subject even though it is necessary.</P>
      <P>Labelling is important because it is important that consumers know exactly what they are getting in a product.  IBEC has drawn up a labelling system in consultation with the industry.  It is important that the industry is brought on side in this regard and that other groups who are concerned about genetic engineering are consulted. There must be a balanced debate on the subject and all views must be taken into account.  I hope the Government will accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley mentioned the events in Wexford at the weekend.  The vandalism that was carried out was a disgrace.  It is sad that such acts of vandalism can occur watched by Members.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputies' concern about genetically modified food.  It is a complex area so it is little wonder that the consumer is, at best, uncomfortable about the issue. However, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a framework in which an independent authority can function.  It is not about detailed operational matters even if they are concerned with important issues such as this.</P>
      <P>Genetically modified foods are the subject of specific legislation, the European Union regulation EC 258/97 which is included in the First Schedule of the Bill.  The interim food authority has already established a GMO group, which is a subcommittee of its scientific committee, and my Department has requested the authority to advise on the various issues touching upon this area.  The subcommittee on GMOs has already met various parties on both sides of the issue.  In addition, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is conducting a policy review on the wider aspects of genetic modification.</P>
      <P>The GMO issue is not confined to food safety. It is of wider environmental significance and there are ethical as well as scientific issues to be considered.  The situation is not being ignored but it is not appropriate to include this amendment in the Bill.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am surprised and disappointed at the attitude of the Government to my proposal.  As the Minister of State said, the issue of GMOs has wide environmental and ethical <Col N="1489" /> significance.  A holistic discussion is long overdue in this House.  It is unacceptable that this extremely sinister development is continuing apace without a proper discussion by the elected representatives of the people.  A fundamental debate is needed and it is incumbent on Deputies to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>This issue runs parallel to the generation of power by nuclear fission.  That is how important it is.  In the early days some sections thought this was the answer to so many problems of humanity but we now know how many problems it has imposed on the backs of humanity as the people of Chernobyl and many other areas know to their cost.  We will not make the same mistake by giving powerful vested interests who are in the field to make massive profits from genetic engineering the benefit of the doubt.  They are prepared to dice with the health of the people.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude of the Minister of State in view of the crystal clear position of Fianna Fáil as outlined in a press statement issued jointly on 26 April 1997 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am sure you are aware of this press statement, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are deeply concerned about the development and sale of genetically modified organisms whether they are used in agriculture, food or food processing.  It is our position that it is premature to release genetically modified organisms into the environment or to market foods which contain any genetically modified <Col N="1490" /> ingredient, or where genetically modified organisms have been used in the production of food.</P>
    <P>Current scientific knowledge is inadequate to protect the consumer and the environment from the unpredictable and potentially disastrous side effects which may appear immediately or at any time in the future.  [Can the urgency expressed in the statement be detected in what the Minister of State had to say or in current Government policy?] The principle of &ldquo;substantial equivalence&rdquo; governing the testing and labelling of genetically modified foods requires that only known potential hazards are tested.  Therefore unexpected toxins and allergens will be identified only when a unique health crisis occurs.  This will be too late for the victims.</P>
    <P>At almost the 12th hour will the Minister of State reconsider and accept this extremely reasonable amendment?  To respond to Deputy Bradford, my view on multinationals and what they represent is clear.  The amendment calls for labelling and information to protect the consumer.  If the Government will not accede to my request, I call on the Opposition to support me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are EU regulations in place. A subcommittee of the Food Safety Authority has been established to look at this issue.  The Deputy may quote statements in regard to allergens that may be associated with genetically modified foods but others will say the opposite. For example, lactobacillus which is being produced in Cork, has been shown to have immunological properties which may be of use in the future.  I am certain we will again look at this subject. Suffice it to say we are happy with what has been put forward.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are related and are to be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 2, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having consulted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority must not represent just the different interests which will want reassurances on food safety for the reasons alluded to in the debate.  The authority must also be reminded of its enormous responsibility. Amendment No. 19 refers to the need to insert &ldquo;including independent regulatory bodies and organisations representing farming, consumer, community, environmental and other interests&rdquo; after &ldquo;organisations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We were focusing on genetic engineering as a concern to citizens, and it is also a cause of concern to farmers.  It represents an increasing concentration of control over the production of food and is being allowed to take place even though before the last election Fianna Fáil called for a moratorium on the release of genetically modified organisms.  It is time Members stopped sleepwalking along the path built by multinational companies for their own ends.  Those companies control more and more of the food we grow, buy and eat.  This amendment spells out that the organisations which must be considered when it comes to food assurance schemes and the promotion of standards must include the farming interests.  They are under enormous pressure, particularly in the horticultural sector, in the face of large multinational retailers coming to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Consumer interests are often taken for granted when retailers talk of giving the consumer choice. The consumer wants quality; choice is not people's top demand.  Sometimes choice takes precedence over quality and the consumer must be able to voice an opinion on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to be oblivious to the fact that 42 per cent of the villages and towns in Britain do not have grocery retail shops, which have been forced to close by out of town shopping centres.  That is damaging to communities, because life deteriorates as a result.  Environmental concerns were debated in relation to the last amendment, but I do not mean what is usually thought of as the environment, the fields and trees outside.  I am referring to the human environment.  Human health is directly linked to wider environmental interest.  Scientific studies show that increasing reliance on food produced chemically is causing a serious and consistent decrease in sperm count <Col N="1493" /> world-wide.  This is also related to oestrogen in drinking water but is very closely linked to the production of food.  The people bucking that trend and who are not suffering a decreasing sperm count are those who work in the organic farming sector.</P>
    <P>Environmental interests have a legitimate right to be represented on account of that insight, if no other.  Monsanto has been mentioned in the debate on genetic engineering.  That company is in the business of ensuring that its own produce is more widely used because of the experiments it is doing with sugar beet at various locations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Public confidence must be restored because it has been severely dented by the Irish record on food safety.  I hope this amendment is accepted so that the public will be reassured to know we value the opinions of the different interest groups that should be represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill claims that the Food Safety Authority will consult organisations it considers appropriate.  I am sympathetic to Deputy Sargent's arguments, and I presume that organisations considered appropriate would include those bodies mentioned in his amendment.  It is important that farming, consumer, community, environmental and other groups are fully consulted before any proposed food safety assurance schemes are put in place.</P>
      <P>The Bill is intended primarily to protect consumers and to give consumers the rights they demand.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This Bill deals with some fundamental matters of democracy.  The two fundamental principles proposed in the legislation establish the rights of citizens, rights that are cultural rights, to be exercised in relation to the media.  On the one hand it argues that sporting activities, along with some other activities, are so essentially part of the culture and experience of every citizen that they should be enjoyed through the media in a way that is derived from rights and from a cultural space rather than the marketplace.  The second principle, which establishes the principle of there being a diversity of ownership is equally derived from cultural rights.  It argues that monopoly in the ownership of a form of the media, or forms of the media, limits the diversity to which citizens enjoying a vibrant culture are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked to think that all of these <Col N="1494" /> matters had been handled expeditiously and that my legislation would be unnecessary.  Sadly, that is not the case.  When I was Minister with responsibility for broadcasting I recall these issues being raised, correctly, with some energy by those then in Opposition.  They seemed to be convinced of the first principle that those who have been enjoying sport were entitled to continue to do so without any intrusion of a purchased right from the marketplace.  The difference however is that we were, at that stage, in preparation of a new <i>television sans frontie res</i>&mdash; television without boundaries &mdash; directive.  An article of that, later to become Article 3a, clearly established the principle of which I speak.  We were waiting to see if we could act in concert in Europe to vindicate this right which is a right not just of citizens within the jurisdiction but one that is also enjoyed by those who are outside the jurisdiction but who are interested in the events involved.  Put plainly, the Irish in Birmingham, in Coventry or elsewhere are as affected by an exclusive claim placed on sporting rights as some of the Irish at home.  Consequently, when the final text of the revised &ldquo;Television without Frontiers&rdquo; directive was passed in June l997 there then existed the capacity to take the action that I thought was agreed upon on all sides of this House in the past.</P>
    <P>It is important that I speak about something else in this context.  Perhaps this will explain as well the urgency that attaches to this legislation. Before the end of this year Sky Television will offer digitalised service and perhaps television boxes which will come pre-encoded.  It will be too late.  One will have missed the whole signing of contracts period.  This is not just a legal concern. We could put it more dramatically.  At the moment many people are watching the World Cup.  That is a separate argument but it is an example of the context with which I am dealing, and I will return to it later.  The Kirch Foundation in Germany has purchased the rights of the World Cup in 2002 and 2006, and if citizens in Europe are to see it without the inhibition of capacity to pay, the European Broadcasting Union will have to deal with that foundation and try to purchase the rights back and they in turn will be passed on to citizens.  I will leave that issue aside for the moment because it is not the essential one, but it is germane in the sense that we do not have the time to delay until the main broadcasting legislation is published at the end of the year.  When I was Minister I was pressed to bring in the legislation on this matter as a matter of urgency, even though I knew it could be best implemented on a Europe-wide basis.</P>
    <P>Article 3a of the revised directive, which was accepted in June l997, states:</P>
    <P>1.  Each member state may take measures in accordance with Community law to ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an exclusive basis events which are regarded by that member state as being of major importance for society in <Col N="1495" /> such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events via live coverage or deferred coverage on free television.  If it does so, the member state concerned shall draw up a list of designated events, national or non-national, which it considers to be of major importance for society.  It shall do so in a clear and transparent manner in due and effective time.  In so doing the member state concerned shall also determine whether these events should be available via whole or partial live coverage, or where necessary or appropriate for objective reasons in the public interest, whole or partial deferred coverage.</P>
    <P>2.  Member states shall immediately notify to the Commission any measures taken or to be taken pursuant to paragraph 1.  Within a period of three months from the notification, the Commission shall verify that such measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the other member states.  It shall seek the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a.  It shall forthwith publish the measures taken in the Official Journal of the European Communities and at least once a year the consolidated list of measures taken by member states.</P>
    <P>The force that the revised directive, and particularly Article 3a, was that the European states would act in concert against the forces of monopoly as it were robbing the citizens of Europe of the right to participate in the cultural events to which they had become used.  That was the reason, we having established our list, Britain had effectively gone ahead in the l996 Broadcasting Act and listed eight events.  The advantage of our doing the list after the directive was that we would be acting in concert.  We also would have been making something real out of the Ninth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty which spoke specifically about the importance of different states being able to help public service broadcasting widen its remit and secure investment and expand in entirely new and challenging conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give very many quotes, but one would be very relevant in relation to that first point I made about the right to view sport as a citizens' right rather than as a facility purchased in the marketplace.  Mr. Rupert Murdoch has said: &ldquo;Sport will be the battering ram for pay television&rdquo;. The context of the legislation I speak about this evening is one in which we have to make up our minds, late in this century now, whether we are going to vindicate citizens' rights in relation to the media and do it through directives that have been established in concert with our European partners, or simply drift or refuse to implement something that is clearly within our capacity to implement.  That would be quite monstrous. <Col N="1496" /> If we decide to abandon our responsibilities in this regard, the implications are clear.</P>
    <P>I wish to say some more about the issues that are at stake in regard to the first principle of the legislation.  On another occasion I will speak about how all of what I have described is made far more dangerous by the arrival of digitalisation, irrespective of the form by which digitalisation is introduced.  Effectively it will be argued, rather like the old argument that anyone passing the Shelbourne was free to go in, that people will have a choice of hundreds of television programmes and that they can become their own programmer as long as they pay for it. Indeed, the current operation of pay television in relation to sport is interesting because those who have secured that part of the market have split the sports channels they have had and doubled the imposition on those whom they were willing to rob of a citizenship right.</P>
    <P>Let us note the principle that is at stake here and why I say it is of the utmost democratic importance.  The principle is one of universal access.  It is rather like saying to people they have a choice to make.  One might say one had a right to health, irrespective of one's ability to pay the highest priced consultant.  One is arguing for the principle of universal access within citizenship and within a theory of active culture.  If, on the other hand, one says that a television programme is a commodity, like a tin of beans, and it is a matter of simply having the money to purchase it, one is arguing effectively against the democratic ethos of broadcasting, but the principle is one of universal access.</P>
    <P>The context in which this argument is being made is one in which there have been four major trends that I can discern in relation to broadcasting, not just in Europe but in the western world, one of which is convergence.  There is a consistent con job going on in that regard, the idea being that people should be mesmerised by the developments in technology.  Three kinds of convergence are clear.  A convergence of technology that will combine the computer, the television set, the telephone and whatever, but also the idea that we must invest in Europe at such a speed as to be able to be in competition with Japan or the United States, that everything to do with citizens' rights or the impact on the society is tedious. Thus there is regular tension at three levels of the Commission between the Commissioner responsible for the introduction of new market services, the Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market, Commissioner Monti, and Commissioner Marcelino Oreja who is responsible for cultural diversity.  Put bluntly, the cultural Commissioner and his arguments are always treated residually, hence the cultural expression is rather weak.  That is the technical convergence.</P>
    <P>Much more serious is the convergence of markets and, beyond that, a convergence of content. Left neatly aside is consideration of the second most important dimension in regard to what is happening in the media in general in terms of <Col N="1497" /> concentration of ownership.  The draft directive on concentration of ownership was promised more than two years ago.  It is still not in place and now it appears that when it does come, it will not be a directive enforceable by law but rather an expression of what should be a code of good practice by those who &ldquo;gobble up&rdquo; the ownership of the media internationally, we meanwhile having removed every inhibition to State regulation within the member countries of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Part of the great alienation in Europe by citizens is that they are saying, even on the doorsteps in the recent referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, they did not realise that is what they voted for &mdash; the destruction of every State regulation and provision and open season for oligopoly and monopoly internationally in ownership of the media.  That is why, for example, Time Warner, after its latest merger, becomes No. 47 in the list of the largest corporations in the world. The cross-links between Disney, for example, Turner, which is part of Time Warner, West-inghouse and General Electric are a map of a set of unaccountable conglomerates.  If a person goes out in the evening to see &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Full Monty&rdquo;, buys a magazine on the way home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and then watches a pay TV channel before going to bed, that person has been buying from Rupert Murdoch all day.  We are drifting into a totally unaccountable scenario where there are few attempts at dealing with this new important force on all of our lives.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, the late and distinguished Raymond Williams wrote in his book <i>Television &mdash; Society and Cultural Reform</i> of the need for a new approach internationally to protect the rights of the person who simply wanted to communicate.  We are dealing with an issue in a context that is extremely urgent.  This trend of convergence is not neutral and there are no neutral decisions in delivery systems in any form of the media.</P>
      <P>In regard to the concentration of ownership, I recall figures which showed that in the Sunday print media, one company has an ownership of approximately 90 per cent, approximately 66 per cent of the dailies and somewhere between 15 per cent and 18 per cent of the regionals.  They are all independent.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s I wrote about an uncontradicted article which appeared in <i>Forbes</i> magazine on 12 September 1983 concerning an interesting interview with the owner of the major newspaper involved and containing a most unusual quote. The interviewer was Rosemary Brady.  It stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Atlantic Resources Managing Director Donald Sheridan who was recruited from his post as chief geologist at Marathon Oil, had long suspected that oil lay in the rocks of Jurassic Age about 160 million years old, in the Celtic Sea.  Says O'Reilly: &ldquo;Don chose six blocks he believed in.  Since I own 35% of the newspapers in Ireland, I have contacts with the politicians. <Col N="1498" /> I got (licences for) the blocks he wanted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then O'Reilly went to talk to his neighbours down the street from H.J. Heinz in Pittsburgh, Gulf Oil Company.  The two U.S. companies agreed to pay 7.5 million dollars for their two-thirds stake in the project.</P>
    <P>I make reference to this because the perception of ownership in relation to what can be used is a matter of democratic interest and accountability.</P>
    <P>We are often told there must be reforms in relation to the law of libel because it is in the public interest.  Is it not in the public interest that there be some limits also in relation to ownership? The legislation I propose on behalf of the Labour Party is a moderate proposal.  It simply prevents a person, body or corporate entity having more than 25 per cent of any two media.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is that we are committed to the principles of diversity in terms of the media and that plurality of opinion is in the interests of the reader.  The reader is entitled to more than an assurance pompously given.  We all know that owners of the best calibre historically in the world never interfered with their editors, who never interfered with their journalists, who never interfered with those who worked in the office.  It is not good enough for citizens that such a mild assurance be offered.  We are entitled to accept that when a person reaches a ceiling of ownership, passing that ceiling is an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with an upper limit on ownership.  Lest anybody be tempted to suggest that those two points are not necessarily convergent with each other, I argue against that. That is a point to which I will be delighted to reply, if necessary, but I serve a warning for those going down that rhetorical blind avenue.  The famous principle in drafting legislation and jurisprudence, used by the late distinguished John Morris Kelly, <i>eiusdem generis,</i> dealt with a specific case, for example, where proposals were afoot that would have led to the destruction of most of St. Stephen's Green, planning permission would be required to change the door knockers but not to knock the building.  It would also be needed to build a replacement.  That vacuum in the law was addressed in the principle that the totality of effect had to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>If the right of citizens to the airwaves is to be vindicated we must deal with the ownership question. It makes no sense that the Commission would agree to a rhetorical proposal which would not achieve its full force unless all the lists are established by different member countries and at the same time abandon, as has been done, the concentration of ownership directive.</P>
    <P>In this context also is the principle of inclusion or divisiveness.  The suggestion that a person will have greater choice than ever before because they will dip into their pockets more often than ever before is not only a manifestation of fragmented <Col N="1499" /> television audiences, it is also profoundly divisive in society.  There are principles in broadcasting policy that have governed the best of broadcasting in Europe and elsewhere, principles such as universal access and social cohesion. These are important points in which society was entitled to its story in its diversity.  Minorities in society were entitled not only to be recognised as minorities but to have their moment in the public space.  That is the set of principles which is offended by Rupert Murdoch's idea that the battering ram of pay television will be sports.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that in this legislation I am not defending something old-fashioned. Those who vote against the legislation will be voting against principles of democratic universal access.  They will be leaving open time to the likes of Rupert Murdoch and News International to make even further gains between now and the end of the year.  One more round of contract documents will be signed in the autumn and more will have been lost.</P>
    <P>As somebody responsible for broadcasting from the Labour Party perspective, I wish to make it perfectly clear that diversity and inclusion, and the access to which I referred will come about accidentally from the marketplace. The hypothesis is that sooner or later everybody will have enough money to put together all the pay television channels they want, that a loose conjury of passive people will purchase entertainment, as is their right.  I am not interfering with that, but there are skill requirements of public service broadcasting, recognised here and in the European Union, waiting to be implemented in Article 3a and vindicated by one speaker after another in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>We are not being taken over or overtly threatened, but there is a tendency &mdash; this is one of the blackest times in my political life &mdash; to allow things to slip away from us.  We are allowing the notion of a citizenship theory with cultural rights and developing broadcasting to wither away while we have a straight run in the marketplace. There are people who are interested in sport and they are losing their rights.  It is offensive that people such as Rupert Murdoch can say they will watch sport only when a local pub has paid a subscription towards a pay television channel.  They are interested not only in home matches but also when Ireland plays abroad.  People such as, for example, Turks in Germany and Irish in England, have rights.</P>
    <P>The delay in implementing this directive has clear implications for the requirements under the British-Irish Agreement for broadcasting in Northern Ireland and Britain &mdash; if Scottish independence comes about there will be further implications. The future in broadcasting cannot be left to economic competition.  In terms of keeping public service broadcasting alive, if there was an open competition internationally for the coverage of sporting and other events, what licence fee would be needed to compete?  The fee required <Col N="1500" /> to cover the present World Cup is exactly twice that required for the previous World Cup.  It is unknown what it will be in 2002 and 2006.</P>
    <P>There are key elements to support my statements. Citizens are entitled to the provision of accurate and independent news, the expression of the full range of political views and cultural values, education and entertainment and universal access to programmes that are free at the point of use.  We were always at an advantage in terms of the quality of our broadcasting compared to that of the BBC, which has high standards. In that context there were principles of independence in Government, pluralism of information, cultural diversity, social cohesion, universal access and the protection of minors, competitiveness and jobs.  The public interest is best served by a public policy that is driven by values such as those I listed, values that are clearly enunciated and are the subject of public debate and accountability.  The public interest is seriously undermined by silent acquiescence in the power of unaccountable capital or by being transfixed by technology.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's publication, In From the Margins, which refers to the importance of all citizens of Europe having the right to express their creativity, makes sad reading.  The publication of the special UN commission on culture, Our Creative Diversity, published last year, referred to values such as those to which I referred.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that we are now at a transition point.  In the past, if one looked at the history of ownership and broadcasting legislation and countabilities of different kinds, one was able to achieve it because there were boundaries within which one could implement it but that has totally changed.  I am thinking of another quote which struck me when this issue was debated in the House of Lords.  Some would suggest it is an unusual place for me to find a reference but, in comparative terms, it is quite progressive in discussing broadcasting.  Last February Lord McNally said that if freedom of the press can be imperilled by restrictive laws, it can also be threatened by restrictive ownership.  It is not in the democratic interest to have such a degree of concentration in ownership in the print media.  It would be even more destructive of the public interest if measures as moderate as this legislation were voted down.  We would at least establish between forms of the media some kind of limits in relation to ownership across the principle of cross ownership.</P>
    <P>As well as that, there are interesting heartening tendencies and passing this legislation would be a very European act.  As I mentioned, the hinge to Article 3a of the directive, is each country establishing a list of what is important.  These lists will be taken together because we must remember that one is implementing the directive not for one's citizens at home but also in accordance with the principle of exterritoriality &mdash; that it will have force outside as well. <Col N="1501" /> Europe has badly damaged itself by stalling and losing its nerve in resolving the dispute between three Commissioners &mdash; the Commissioner with responsibility for the introduction of new services, the Internal Market Commissioner and the Commissioner with responsibility for cultural affairs.  Commissioner Monti who prepared a draft directive at one stage, which spoke about an upper limit of 10 per cent in the combined media and 30 per cent in any one media, has long abandoned that proposal after opposition by those who make the following argument.  Here we encounter the incredible naked force and ignorance of the marketplace. The suggestion by his two fellow Commissioners and by many in Europe that the issue was in putting together a conglomerate large enough to take on the Time Warners in the United States and international competition and that was the way to go.  It was a case of who would hold one back.  I heard that argument here &mdash; the idea being that our Irish or European conglomerates are important and that when they have reached a scale, they will then be able to deal with those who threaten and dominate.</P>
    <P>Information on how people dominate is very interesting.  Britain used to have, more or less, a £160 million favourable balance with the United State in relation to audio-visual product.  In 1995 there was a deficit of about £163 million.  Sky Britain pays £300 million for imported United States programmes.  We have probably lost something of the order of 250,000 jobs all over Europe by losing the possibility of developing the audio-visual sector.  In Germany, for example, there is a combination between Kirch and Bertelsman, the purpose of which is to put together a combination which will be strong enough to compete with the likes of the Time Warners.  That is totally destructive. It was purchased by getting a French channel to withdraw from Germany.</P>
    <P>Are we to say we are all helpless and that these people need not care what we, as parliamentarians, think?  The answer is they do not care. This issue is still important and there are Irish people who are very interested in the sheer decency of there being a variety of opinions and they believe one will get better practice and more accountability by having that diversity.  What I propose in the legislation is good for the public and journalists.  I have read material from places where journalist are prepared, trained and produced as graduates.  Anthony Smith writing in England or anyone writing in any of the great universities which have studied journalism will say a journalist professionally flourishes in a context in which there is plurality of opinion, where there is diversity of ownership and where there is no possibility of the abuse of a concentration of ownership.  It does matter that the public gets the same transparency they look for in politics or in any other decision taken on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear whether those who wish to speak against this legislation accept all these principles and their proposals to redress the <Col N="1502" /> present drift if they vote down our legislation.  I am not constructing a great black scenario.  I could list one country after another.  In Spain, Recoletos, a subsidiary of the UK media group Pearson which owns the <i>Financial Times</i>, has shares in broadcasters, including 17 per cent of BSkyB and 25 per cent of the new private channel, Channel 5, and has joined Telefonica to make a 10 per cent stake Antenna 3 TV controlled by a telecom company.  I am not arguing that one form of the media can never co-operate with another, although there cannot be joint investment decisions.  I am not against investment but against monopoly, oligopoly and a Commission which continually hectors and lectures about the reduction of every state inhibition, puts its face against forms of regulation, stays silent and abandons the concentration of ownership and publishes documents from the cultural Commissioner which are merely rhetorical if, at the end, they can never be implemented because there are no guarantees of a plurality and a diversity of stories, which is all the citizens of Europe want.  They want it from film and television and to see it in newspapers.  They want to know that even if they do not have much money or great resources, they count as a citizen.</P>
    <P>That is what the great literacy projects were all about.  It goes back to Tom Paine and the debates about the rights of man.  The literacy debate in Britain in its day was one example where it was said the working class would be fine if it confined itself to the Bible but it wanted to read Tom Paine's pamphlet on rights as well.  It is about access and the citizens taking these new developments in technology and using them as instruments for deeper, better and more humane communication with each other and for education and training leading it universally, for example, perhaps through the television set and later through the marketplace, which is real, purchasing new services for which they may wish to pay.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference between exercising a choice in the marketplace and being dominated and abused by the marketplace in which one is forced to exercise a choice.  In the first part of the Bill we talk about people being compelled to purchase in the marketplace as consumers that to which they are entitled, culturally and otherwise, as rights.  In the second part we ask that there be no amalgamation of ownership which will lead to the perception that there could be a breach of the principles of diversity of ownership and plurality of editorial opinion.</P>
    <P>I have not once in my contribution referred to any one particular instance because that is not what I am about.  I am simply attempting to set the media in such a way that it is democratic and accountable and also that it is socially cohesive and inclusive.  It is necessary to do it now because we are in conditions of rapid change.  If we neglect it in these circumstances, every neglect will be simply geometrically increased as we face into new and more complex divisions.  Cuireann sé áthas orm an Bille a mholadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill presented by Deputy Higgins gives us a timely opportunity to discuss important issues regarding access to television coverage of major events.  The possibility that many events, in particular major sporting events, will migrate to television services provided on a subscription or pay-per-view basis is one which has been a matter of concern at national and European level for some time.</P>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear there is no difference in principle between Government policy and the objectives of section 1 of the Deputy's Bill.  There is a clear commitment in the programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, that access to major events will be protected and I have gone on record repeatedly indicating that I propose to honour this commitment by giving effect in Irish law to Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers directive.  My proposals in this regard are quite advanced, and I hope to circulate a draft memorandum for other Ministers' observations shortly.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting and other Media (Public Right of Access and Diversity of Ownership) Bill, 1998, highlights two important elements of our heritage and our every day lives.  On the one hand sport has long been an important part of daily lives and offers different levels of participation. Those of us not lucky enough to be able to participate in sport at the highest levels have been able to participate through coverage on television. Thus major events become a shared experience at community, local and national level.  Success, or indeed simply a good performance, at a national or international level can be an important morale booster for a county or a country.  The prospect of Clare winning another All-Ireland will not immediately add to the general happiness of the people of Cork.  How many of the followers of hurling, not lucky enough to obtain a ticket for the Munster or All-Ireland Final, would feel deprived if they could not follow the action live on television unless they paid a significant subscription or pay per view fee to a commercial broadcaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the other important element raised by Deputy Higgins' Bill, the concept of broadcasting as a public service.  I, and I believe the House will, acknowledge that Deputy Higgins both in Government and before has long been a champion of this cause.  This Government believes that every person has a basic right to a reasonable level of communications.  Broadcasting in the classical European mode has set out to provide this right and that this concept which envisages a service provided on what is now generally referred to as &ldquo;free&rdquo; television or &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; television is still of vital importance.  If one looks to the vastly increased number of television services becoming available through digital broadcasting and to the emergence of the information society and the concerns which these phenomena raise about the creation of a divergence between the &ldquo;information rich&rdquo; and the <Col N="1504" />&ldquo;information poor&rdquo; within our society, it can be argued that the role of free to air broadcasters, particularly those with a public service remit to provide a universal service and to cater for a universal audience, is increasing in importance.</P>
    <P>Viewers in Ireland have traditionally enjoyed access to major events, sporting and otherwise, through the services of RTÉ.  A substantial proportion of the population has had access at relatively reasonable rates to the services of UK terrestrial broadcasters who have sought to cater for a wide audience taste.  In the past, given the demands on the radio frequency spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the number of broadcasters has been necessarily restricted.  In this scenario, coverage of sporting events was itself restricted in that broadcasters who were attempting to cater for a wide range of tastes with one or two channels could only cover a limited range of events.  However, in the last ten years the emergence of satellite delivered broadcasting services, operated on an almost entirely commercial basis, has changed the broadcasting map considerably. We have seen the emergence of channels dedicated only to sports events.  It is undeniable that these channels have provided increased choice to those fans who can afford the price of such services.</P>
    <P>The potential of digital broadcasting to vastly increase the capacity for the provision of broadcasting channels has already begun to cause revolutionary change.  Commercial services have discovered the importance of sport to their schedules.  The market for any kind of programming with popular appeal is becoming more and more intense leading in turn to increased costs in acquiring broadcast rights.  In addition some sporting organisers and clubs have begun to explore new ways of providing coverage of their events beyond the confines of the stadium where such an event might be played.  The relationship between the broadcaster who provided essential technical expertise and the organisers of these events who may be able to acquire such expertise more easily now than in the past is changing.  The area of broadcast rights is becoming increasingly complicated.  We have seen reports of disputes between BSKYB and the English Premier League about terrestrial rights versus satellite rights, digital as opposed to analogue, subscription as opposed to pay-per-view rights.</P>
    <P>In this fluid situation it is difficult to be confident about the precise shape of the broadcasting future.  At a technical level the future of broadcasting is largely uncharted.  We must therefore be clear about our objectives in bringing forward proposals of this nature.  The objective is to ensure that every person has, as far as is possible, a right to a certain level of participation in society through the provision of broadcasting services. What we are dealing with here are events that go beyond the interests of the committed fan and are events which undeniably have a special resonance with society as a whole or at least a substantial proportion of that society. <Col N="1505" /> RTÉ has provided us for many years with the opportunity to follow major sporting events on television.  Hopefully TV3 will add considerably to our range of choice.  However, through RTÉ we have all been able to participate in sport at a national and international level.  We have been able, through television, to participate in the efforts of our international soccer team, our athletes at the Olympic Games and other major occasions.  We have been able to share in their successes and to sympathise when success was not achieved.  We have shared this experience as a community, we have experienced together the disappointment of losing and the joy of winning or even a good performance.</P>
    <P>While individually we might experience these emotions at different levels of intensity there are few among us who do not go about our business with more spring in our step when our athletes do well at the Olympic Games, when our international soccer or rugby team wins an important match, or when our county players beat an old rival to win a championship.  This goes to the very heart of our society and of the way we want to live as a community.  It is right and proper for legislators to be concerned when the availability of participation is threatened.  No person should be excluded from participation of this nature simply because of economic circumstances.  The lack of money should not be a reason for alienation.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge the contribution to our society made by those involved in the administration of sport at all levels.  Many have given long years of service at times to their clubs and associations and through them to society at large, often with little reward.  Those in charge are custodians of a proud tradition and it would be wrong to give the message that we believe that they are about to exclude the general public from participation in the premier events of their respective sports.  Sport itself has undergone considerable change over the years.  The vast amounts of money which have become available to participants, organisers and clubs through sponsorship has had significant and not always positive effects on the way sport is organised.  The importance of television rights is increasing. Sports administrators have an increasingly complex task in balancing the interests of their sports, the participants and the public.  We owe a considerable debt to participants in sport at all levels for the efforts which they have put into achieving success at national and international level.  It is only fair that they should get the rewards for their dedication, skill and talent.  These efforts must be acknowledged and any legislative steps should be taken in a spirit of consultation and co-operation consistent with the public good.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in principle with the object of Deputy Higgins's Bill.  The mechanism which he chooses &mdash; legislating to introduce the provision of Article 3a of the television without frontiers directive &mdash; is the mechanism I indicated I would use myself.  However, it must be borne in mind that section 1 of Article 3a of the television <Col N="1506" /> without frontiers directive is not a mandatory provision.  The section provides that each member State may take measures to ensure broadcasters within its jurisdiction do not broadcast events regarded as being of major importance to society in a way which deprives a substantial proportion of the population in the State of the opportunity of following such events <i>via</i> live or deferred coverage on free television.  We are not required by virtue of our membership of the European Union to introduce such measures.  Accordingly, any measure which we take to give effect to section 1 of Article 3a of the directive will be our own substantive law.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the detailed provisions of the Bill.  In introducing such legislation, the objects must be clearly and expressly seen as being in the public interest.  I accept Deputy Higgins has provided for public consultation in drawing up a list of events.  However, in addition to public consultation, specific and express criteria for declaring certain events as being of major importance to society should be included in the legislation and these have to be carefully developed and teased out.  We are dealing with the private rights of the organisers of events which might be listed as being of major importance to society.  No criteria for the selection of such events are included in the Bill.  No protection of the event organisers is included.</P>
    <P>The objective of introducing legislation of this kind is to protect the access of viewers to events which can be clearly seen to be part of our broadcasting heritage.  The action is being taken in the interests of viewers &mdash; in the public interest.  It is necessary for such legislation to be clear in its intent and for it to be seen as proportionate.  I find the lack of specific express criteria a fundamental flaw in the Deputy's proposals.  The provisions in section 1 are too broad and all-embracing and do not sufficiently safeguard the proper rights of organisers.</P>
    <P>Neither am I convinced of the need to impose criminal sanctions in legislation of this nature.  I have a problem in principle in criminalising broadcasting activity, even when the broadcaster is seeking to maximise their audiences through any means at their disposal or to maximise the return from their audiences regardless of who can afford their services.  I am also far from convinced as to the practicability of criminal sanctions as any attempt to enforce them will of necessity take place after the event, will require very high levels of proof and, in terms of the sanctions proposed, would be of questionable deterrent value if we are dealing with major events.</P>
    <P>While I cannot be too forthcoming about the detail of my own proposals in advance of Government approval, I would prefer a system where, if it appears the legislation is to be breached in relation to a listed event, action can be taken before viewers are deprived of the opportunity of viewing the events on free to air television.  I would also like to see a system where, if breaches occur, broadcasters who provide a universally <Col N="1507" /> accessible service, or as near to that goal as is practically possible, who have not been allowed through the activities of another broadcaster to provide coverage of a listed event, have a right to seek substantial compensation from the broadcasters operating in breach of the provisions.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it would seem to me that it is better to explore the opportunities for civil remedies rather than criminal sanction.  There are other matters also which require further thought, in particular definitions of &ldquo;universal service&rdquo; and &ldquo;free television&rdquo;.  Accordingly, while I compliment Deputy Higgins on his Bill and assure him I am pursuing the same objectives, it is better to wait for the Government to bring forward proposals on this matter.  I assure him that he will have every opportunity to contribute to the debate when the Government's proposals are dealt with in the House.</P>
    <P>On the provision in section 2 relating to the prohibition on the concentration of media ownership, I do not have functional responsibility for the Competition Act, 1991, which the Deputy proposes to amend.  However, I share the Deputy's concerns in this matter.  Concentrations of media ownership was a topic examined by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which was established in 1995 and which reported in June 1996.  The commission, chaired by Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, was asked to examine all aspects of the newspaper industry and to make recommendations.  The commission considered that the media outside newspapers consisted of television, radio and magazines.  It felt that concentration of media ownership in these sectors and between these sectors and newspapers had the same potential for limiting or impeding diversity of views and opinions in a manner harmful to the democratic process as concentration of ownership in newspapers alone.</P>
    <P>The commission concluded that the extent of cross ownership between different sections of the media in Ireland is limited.  It mentioned the practice whereby the interests of local newspapers in local radio stations were confined to not more than 25 per cent and noted that no similar restriction applied to the ownership of local newspapers by local radio stations.  The commission pointed out that some sharing of ownership between local radio and newspapers could have an advantageous effect on the journalistic standards of both without significantly impairing diversity of views.</P>
    <P>The commission reported that while Irish newspapers have a minimal interest in other branches of the media in Ireland, a number of UK publishers have substantial interests in television stations which transmit to and are received in Ireland.  It went on to say that an extension of interest by Irish newspapers in television and radio might strengthen their competitive capacity and any such developments would be relevant to any intervention based on this type of media ownership.  The commission finally concluded <Col N="1508" /> that there were no grounds at present for intervention by the State on the basis of undue mediawide ownership in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the commission dealing with cross media ownership was:</P>
    <P>Any issue of concentration of ownership in the media should be considered on a mediawide as well as on a single media basis and in any such consideration effect should be given to the difference in consequences arising from such concentration in one branch of the media and concentration in different branches of the media.</P>
    <P>In October 1997 the Tánaiste referred this recommendation along with two others dealing with newspapers to the Competition and Mergers Review Group.  The group was established in September 1996 by the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment to review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation, the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations, cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Act and, in particular, section 4(2) of the Act, and appropriate structures for implementing the above legislation.</P>
    <P>The review group is chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC and is representative of IBEC, ICTU, ISME, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Law Society and the Bar Council.  It also includes representatives of the Attorney General's office the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and a specialist in competition economics from University College, Dublin.  The detailed work of the group has been proceeding but to date has concentrated on merger law and policy.  In the overall context of competition, including abuse of dominant position legislation and the Mergers and Take-overs Acts, the group is now addressing the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which Deputy Harney referred to it in October 1997.  The group is expected to present a comprehensive report to Deputy Harney for her consideration later this year.  Until such time as this report is received and considered, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to contemplate changes to the competition Acts.</P>
    <P>With regard to competition law and how it operates in the area of the media, the position is that under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979, a merger or take-over where at least one of the enterprises is a newspaper as defined in the order, is subject to the Act, notwithstanding the turnover or assets size of the enterprises involved.  Newspapers are defined as any periodical which consists substantially of news and comment on current affairs. This definition covers both newspapers and magazines.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, prohibits the abuse of a dominant position by one or more undertakings.  This section is analogous to <Col N="1509" /> Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  In this regard, Deputy Higgins' proposal seems to depart from national and EU legislation in that it seeks to make a dominant position, rather than the abuse of a dominant position, illegal.  Under the provisions of the Competitions (Amendment) Act, 1996, an aggrieved person or the Director of Competition Enforcement can take proceedings against an undertaking which they believe is abusing its dominant position.</P>
    <P>While the Commission on the Newspaper Industry examined cross media ownership in terms of newspapers, magazines, television and radio, because of its terms of reference it did not address other forms of media such as the Internet. The Deputy is correct in recognising that one of the issues to be faced in this area is the rapid growth in technology and the way that this will affect policy.  The traditional boundaries between broadcasting, information technology and telecommunications and between these sectors and newspapers and magazines are being blurred to some extent in the information age.  Careful analysis is needed in developing definitions of relevant markets.</P>
    <P>I understand that the review group is engaged in this exercise.  I support controls on cross media ownership and the principle as communicated in the Deputy's proposals.  However, I am advised that the proposal in the Bill is unlikely to be fully effective in this regard.  As I have already stated, Deputy Harney has asked the competition and mergers review group to look into this issue and it is not due to report for some time.  Clearly the issues involved are complex and we should have the best advice available before we address this issue in legislation.  Deputy Harney has undertaken to forward the Deputy's Bill to the review group for its information.  The provision as proposed by the Deputy seems to give the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands specific powers under competition legislation. While there is a broadcasting perspective to be brought to this issue, I am not convinced that such a proposal would be effective or appropriate.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for advancing the debate on these important issues by bringing forward his proposals.  My reason for opposing the Bill is not one of principle but that these matters are being addressed carefully and urgently by Government.  In relation to the protection of access to major events, my proposals are imminent. Accordingly, I am opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has two central components.  First, the transposition into Irish law of Article 3a of the European Union Broadcasting directive and, second, the defining of the limits of cross ownership of different media which are defined as: broadcasting, including terrestrial television, newspapers, magazines, satellite and digital television and other cable and MMDS services and Internet services.  Deputy <Col N="1510" /> Higgins is to be complimented for bringing forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response is typical of the Department's response during the past 12 months &mdash; everything is being considered carefully and studied at great length and a result always appears imminent.  The House is going into recess in early July and we will not see legislation such as the Broadcasting Bill before the end of the year.  The first section of the Bill is timely given that the World Cup is taking place at present and the <i>Tour de France</i> will come to Ireland in a few weeks.  Ireland is a very small player in the rapidly developing technology and interactive information age.  However, Irish people have the same rights as everyone else.  The diversity spoken of by Deputy Higgins is essential.</P>
      <P>Rupert Murdoch owns the film archives of a number of countries and companies.  Through Sky Sports he also owns the rights to premiership soccer, the US Open Championship and the Ryder Cup which will take place in Ireland in a few years.  Every major boxing match in the US in the past 15 years has been in the same position.  Not only does one have to subscribe to a satellite channel, one must also pay for the right to watch specific events.  I have an avid interest in a broad range of sports and I object to this position.  I can see why the commercial lust of people involved in this business is driven to these limits.</P>
      <P>Some US basketball players earn $80 million and $100 million per year.  Commercial advertising, sponsorship and sporting success generate mega bucks for top international sports men and women.  Television rights and the right to watch these people compete are central to this.  I would be the last to decry any person's achievements in terms of effort or talent, but no human performance is worth, in money terms, the phenomenal figures paid to international and world class sportspeople.  In that sense, the proposal to implement article 3a into Irish law is very welcome. In fairness, Deputy Higgins told the Minister that if her proposals are being carefully considered and a report is imminent, she should accept the Bill and introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  I am sure Deputy Higgins would welcome that.  That would be a legitimate and worthwhile response from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The public consultation process would give individuals, organisations and sporting groups an opportunity to tell the Minister why they consider their performances should be included in the list of sporting activities which would have a national or international significance or cultural importance. While we may talk about the Olympic Games, the Tour de France or the Ryder Cup in this context, people might want the bowling championships in Cork or currach racing in Connemara included in coverage.  The commission on newspapers did not examine cultural matters because it was not within its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good start and I accept the principle of the Bill.  People should not be pressurised into going to their local golf club, public house or centre, <Col N="1511" /> where the tab has been paid for Sky Sports, to watch sporting events, particularly since many households now own two or three television sets. They should be able to watch such events in their own homes in the company of their families.  The commercialisation of sports is having a detrimental effect on society.  The Minister stated that her proposals will shortly go before Government and that a report is imminent.  I would like to hear her views on the sporting events she believes should be included.</P>
    <P>Cross ownership of the media is a complex area and difficult to control.  When in Opposition, the British Prime Minister knew he could not win the election without the help of the newspapers and the printed media and set about a deliberate campaign of enhancing his position by wooing the newspapers to his side to achieve victory.  This demonstrates the importance of the printed media.  In its report the Competition Authority stated:</P>
    <P>The concentration of control of several papers under the proprietorship of a single individual could reduce the independence of the papers and could narrow the range of news and information which should be properly diversified. At the extreme, there might be the danger that undue political influence could be exercised or information suppressed or distorted.</P>
    <P>If one were malicious enough, one could say this element of Deputy Higgins's Bill is a pay back in that it could be viewed as a strike at Dr. O'Reilly of the Independent Group.</P>
    <P>As one who suffered the onslaught of the direction given by the <i>Irish Independent</i> prior to the last election to vote the then Government out of office, I feel somewhat aggrieved.  I am not suggesting that because <i>The Kerryman</i> is owned by the Independent Newspaper Group the editor might be influenced by the owner to the extent that he might write an editorial or an article that could influence political opinion in that part of the country.  If that is the factual position, subliminally at least, or by perception, that stream of thought could begin to emerge in time.  This Bill addresses that danger.</P>
    <P>The 25 per cent to which Deputy Higgins referred is a relatively small number given that it allows for practically full ownership of a different media.  It is fair to say that local newspapers are constrained by law in terms of the percentage of ownership of local radios they can hold, but the same does not apply in a reciprocal sense.  Some local newspapers have an investment or a percentage ownership in some local radio stations in excess of what the law states, but that is because of a requirement for further investment due to lack of resources and so on.</P>
    <P>Control of cross ownership is critical and very difficult to achieve.  In the extreme, dominance within cross ownership can lead to political influence. In its report, the Competition Authority states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> Competition helps disperse power and thus is beneficial to a democratic society.  The latter consideration is all the more important when one is dealing with arrangements which impact on the ownership and commercial control of newspapers which themselves play a vital role in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>The concentration of ownership and control of newspapers and other forms of news media is particularly undesirable in a democratic society.  Guarantees that editorial independence will be maintained are of limited usefulness where an individual or a single entity exercises some degree of commercial control over a number of competing newspapers.  Indeed, such guarantees are virtually worthless and the only way in which independence can effectively be maintained is through diversity of newspaper ownership.</P>
    <P>The competition authority, therefore, states that cross ownership of newspapers and other forms of news media is unhealthy in a democratic society.  This is a democratic Parliament and Members share these principles, asserted by the Minister and outlined by Deputy Higgins.  There is no reason, following the studies which have been undertaken to date, the Bill should not be taken on board by the Government, brought to Committee Stage and amended appropriately.</P>
    <P>Earlier I spoke of the huge commercial lust in international sport on the part of those who control it.  Ireland is a very sports conscious country and there is a genuinely strong reaction to being forced either to get a satellite dish or to go to a centre to watch a sporting occasion.  The Minister rightly refers to the emergence of channels dedicated to sports events.  In the past 12 months there was strong talk that Manchester United, for example, would have its own sports channel.  It is a matter of great concern when one considers that parents and those who follow the team, who already have to fork out for very expensive jerseys, boots, logos and other paraphernalia, might have to pay for the right to watch matches in which the team was playing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spoke of the Irish diaspora in Britain and the United States.  It would be difficult for Liam Mulvihill to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; if Sky Sports offered him £30 million up front for rights to all All-Ireland semi finals and finals in football and hurling for the next ten years.  Those who left and became navvies in the US and Britain or who are technologically minded geniuses, young entrepreneurs or financially driven people, with an allegiance to Clare, Galway, Cork, etc., want to watch their teams in action and the rights we have had and which are so much part of our culture and personality could be taken from us if such a transaction took place.  This is a matter of greater urgency than it is being credited with.</P>
    <P>Recently I listened to Norman Whiteside, the youngest player to play in a soccer World Cup. He spoke of one of his early matches for Manchester United where the fee for playing was £14 and the bonus for winning was £600.  When this is <Col N="1513" /> applied to our era, where top players in the British premier league can earn up to £40,000 per week in addition to endorsements, we can see how this roller coaster lends itself to clubs having their own television channels and making consumers, the bait in the business, pay for the right to watch matches.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would accept the Bill, the principles of which she has already endorsed, bring it to Committee Stage, amend it if she sees fit, and bring it into law.</P>
    <P>The commission which examined these issues said:</P>
    <P>Any issue of concentration of ownership in the media should be considered on a mediawide as well as on a single media basis and in any such consideration effect should be given to the difference in consequences arising from such concentration in one branch of the media and concentration in different branches of the media.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the report made solid recommendations rather than leaving it so vague as it creates a problem for the Minister and her officials in the context of what it means in a practical sense and how it is to be translated into controllable and effective law.  It is a timely recommendation as it is dangerous not to have diversity of ownership or the competitive element which now applies in all walks of life, and will apply more as time goes on, with semi-State bodies being sold, competition in an international and national sense being opened up and increased transparency.  Perhaps in replying to the debate the Minister will elaborate on her views and those of the Department and the report she is making to the Government in respect of this recommendation by the commission.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations do not have the reciprocal right to unlimited ownership of newspapers and periodicals, something referred to in the commission's report.  The dissemination of information, in a technological and printed sense, is moving so fast there is a blurring of the issue for ordinary citizens.  Recently at the Intel plant in Leixlip I spoke of an American investor who has been coming here for years.  He described his vision of the future as spooky.  He explained this by saying that the product being created by the 1,000 people dressed in moon suits with glass visors in a sterilised environment in the plant is half the size of a person's thumb nail and holds a billion pieces of information.  Ten years ago this concept was an impossible dream, similar to the suggestion 15 years ago that every premier soccer match on television would have to be paid for or subscribed to, a suggestion people would have dismissed as total nonsense and something which would never happen.  If things move as fast over the next ten years there will be an even greater revolution in global information.  In this sense it is time to put down a marker and say we have compiled a list of sporting events and occasions, following public consultation, which we believe <Col N="1514" /> are important to our society, culture and the personality of our people and which should be freely available to the people.  The cross-ownership levels referred to in the Bill should be enshrined in controllable and effective law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>While this legislation is properly geared towards the consumer, we must ensure producers and other interested parties such as community and environmental interests are consulted to the widest possible degree.  Amendment No. 19 relates to the food safety assurance schemes which the authority will be empowered to put in place.  When the authority is contemplating any such schemes, it must undertake the widest possible consultation.  It is appropriate that farming, consumer, community, environmental and other groups would be consulted.  I hope the Minister will seek to ensure that full consultation and dialogue will occur.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 13 is to promote partnership between the authority and the producers of food safety assurance schemes.  It is primarily producer-focused and follows on from section 12, ensuring that a food safety culture is established.  Section 12(4) already provides for consultation by the authority with a wide group of interests and the consultative council outlined in section 14 will be a key forum in which to engage these interests.  I do not feel it would be appropriate to amend section 13 and cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for his favourable comments on the amendments.  No damage would be done to the Bill through the acceptance of the amendments, nor is there any reason for them other than the provision of necessary public reassurance that all aspects of food safety will be taken into account in the food safety assurance schemes.  There does not seem to be any good reason for rejecting the amendments and I urge the Minister to go the extra mile on this issue.  The public has been taken for granted in the area of food safety in the past and is now extremely suspicious.  That is bad both for food safety and the wider economic interests of this country.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider accepting this amendment or one which he feels would be more in line with the requirements of the draftsmen.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 37, after &ldquo;representative&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include no fewer than eight representatives of consumer bodies and representation for the independent regulatory agencies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The broadly based representative nature of the proposed consultative council should make explicit reference to consumer bodies.  My amendment seeks that no fewer than eight representatives of consumer bodies be provided for on the council, together with representation for the independent regulatory agencies.</P>
      <P>Reference was previously made during this debate to consumer concerns in the area of genetically modified organisms.  One of my amendments was ruled out of order as it involved a charge on the State and I understand further amendments in regard to genetically engineered produce will also be ruled out of order on that basis.  Amendments are being sought on the grounds of the need for more representatives of consumer bodies and their concerns than are being allowed.  I urge the Minister to take that into account and to give careful consideration to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this issue in some detail on Committee Stage.  I also recall that at a briefing with the Minister of State prior to the publication of the Bill, he made great play of the fact that the consumer would be king as far as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was concerned. Yet, when an opportunity exists to give specific representation to consumer interests, it seems the Minister is not prepared to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 22 on Committee Stage and had no choice but to re-table it on Report Stage.  It is all very well to speak about giving primary consideration to consumers but I cannot understand why the Minister should refuse to accept an amendment which provides for statutory representation of consumer interests on the consultative council.  If consumers are to have a say in any forum, that should be provided for <Col N="1516" /> on the consultative council.  Of the proposed membership of the council, it is reasonable to expect that at least eight people would be directly representative of consumer interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments of the previous speakers.  I would like to see the Minister accepting amendment No. 23.  The proposals contained in these amendments should not be necessary as they should already be provided for.  The consultative council will have a key role in ensuring openness and transparency.  Consumer interest must remain of paramount importance. It would be quite bizarre if statutory representation were not provided for consumers on the consultative council.</P>
      <P>My amendment also makes reference to small and medium sized food enterprises.  I am concerned about the operators of such enterprises. We could argue strongly and with some passion about the need to ensure the maximum representation possible by the food industry on the council. I am concerned about the representation on it by those involved in small and medium sized businesses.  At a time when there is dramatic change in agriculture at European level and we envisage major cutbacks on CAP and agricultural spending in the next few years, we must accept there is a greater outlet for home grown organic produce.  There are a significant number entering that market.  We must encourage and support them.  Over the past two or three years many of those people have approached me and most other public representatives to express their concern about the regulations under which they work.  It is the small producers rather than the large ones who are most concerned about legislation on this area.  They need protection and support and to be actively involved when legislation on this area is being drafted.  That is why I would like those involved in small and medium sized businesses to be represented on the consultative council.  That would enable them have a direct input into matters which would be of great importance to their enterprises in the year ahead.  If small and medium sized enterprises in this area were protected and developed, they could represent the future for rural Ireland, but they need to be involved in the consultative process and should have full representation on the consultative council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the Deputies' concerns, but I am not prepared to accept these amendments as the issue with which they are concerned is addressed in amendment No. 24 which goes into this area in great detail.  We can discuss this matter further when we reach that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree wholeheartedly with the Minister of State on this.  Amendment No. 24 provides for various Ministers to nominate persons to the consultative council, but that is not what we are talking about.  We are not talking about <Col N="1517" /> political appointees, people who happen to support a particular party line or people who represent vested interests in the food business.  If the Minister of State is serious about the importance of the place of the consumer in all this, surely it is essential that consumers are included in the process and that at some level within the authority there is specific statutory provision for the representation of consumers.  Amendment No. 24 does not deal with consumer representation.  Will the Minister of State accept this amendment, if he is serious about ensuring consumers are properly represented and that we will not have only a collection of vested interests on this body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister of State say he presumed the next amendment would cover the concerns expressed by Deputies about the need for consumer participation. He knows consumers would not be happy to be viewed as synonymous with the appointees of various Ministers, particularly in light of the various media reports on political appointments. That is not something that would improve the objectivity and the heartfelt concerns of consumers.</P>
      <P>Consumers are the victims of intense advertising not because they are manipulated, but because advertisers present the interests of consumers for their own vested interests.  That will continue unless consumers are explicitly included in legislation and involved in the consultative process, in this case in the consultative role proposed. I ask the Minister of State to think very carefully before palming off and dismissing these amendments because they go to the heart of what the food safety authority is about, giving consumers the assurance and confidence that the food they eat is safe.  If we do not do that tonight, we will be wasting our time.  I will press this amendment.</P>

      <P>The person who will be most affected by the decisions that will be taken by the consultative council will be the consumer.  The advice that will be put forward by the consultative council to the board of the food safety authority will have a major bearing on every consumer.  It was the consumer who was most grievously concerned and affected two years ago during the BSE crisis and that will continue to be the case in every food crisis we face in the years ahead.  If we are to provide any degree of reassurance, we must be able to say to the consumer that any decision that will be taken by the food safety authority will be taken after a process in which the consumer will be fully involved.  If the consultative council is to mean anything and the food safety authority is to be in a position to provide reassurance to the consumer, which the Minister of State wishes it to do, he must ensure there is full provision for consumer participation and that there is a minimum number of consumers on the consultative council.  This proposal goes to the <Col N="1518" /> core of the consultative council and the Minister of State's earlier argument that we must ensure the maximum protection and involvement of the consumer.  The Minister of State should accept this modest amendment.  It should have been part of the original proposal and we should not try to push it through at the last minute.</P>

      <P>The Bill is consumer oriented and the board will be in a position to nominate members to the consultative council.  As that council will provide the authority with a key consultative forum, it must be as representative as possible.  Having considered the board's appointees and the nominations of other Ministers, the Minister will make his seven appointments to ensure a proper balance in representation. For that reason the section should not be as prescriptive as to state which groups should be covered by ministerial appointments.  There is room for adequate consumer representation among the 24 nominees.  The ethos of the Bill is to strengthen the hand of the consumer.  There should be no worries about that and Deputies will realise that as we proceed through the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to the thought that this amendment is prescriptive.  The Minister of State said the Bill is to primarily serve the needs and to address the concerns of consumers.</P>
      <P>Including a reference to consumers could hardly be called prescriptive and it should be seen as synonymous with a Minister's appointment.  We are trying to build confidence in food production and consumption and that can only be built if it is clearly stated, wherever the opportunity arises, that there should be consumer representation.  In this case it is vital we state there should be consumer representation on the consultative council and that it is clearly understood there is no question mark over the consumer having a role on it. It may be the Minister of State's understanding and that of the Departments concerned that the consumer has a role, but that message must be conveyed to the wider public.  Will the Minister make sure that is conveyed by one form of the amendments being taken together?  I urge him to avoid the need to press this amendment because we agree it is in the interest of the consumer and should not be one on which we should divide.</P>

      <P>The issue of nutritional advice was discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  The ultimate aim of food safety is to prevent illness in the community. However, even having a guaranteed safe food supply is not enough if the diet is not adequate.  The authority must, therefore, be given a role in advising on nutrition.  The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the importance of diet in illness prevention.  It is appropriate that the authority's role be advisory in this area as there are many disciplines throughout the health services which have a role in developing nutritional policy.  The authority will be in a position to produce such advice on its own initiative.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Authority shall include details of any gift which exceeds, in the opinion of the Board, the value of £500, or such other amount as may stand specified for the time being in Regulations made by the Minister, in the report under section 25(1) for the year in which the gift is accepted.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enhance transparency and accountability.  The threshold of £500 is being introduced to ensure the readability of the annual report is not lessened by the inclusion of long lists of relatively little public interest.  The section on gifts is intended as an enabling provision.  It is not the Government's intention that any income from this source be used as a substitute for Exchequer funding.  I, <Col N="1523" /> therefore, invite Deputy Sargent to withdraw amendment No. 32.</P>

      <P>I am glad amendment No. 31 has been introduced and I thank the Minister for considering the terms of the amendment I moved on Committee Stage.  I intend to withdraw amendment No. 32.</P>
      <P>However, the same claim was made regarding the national lottery when it was said that it would not be used as a substitute for Exchequer funding. With the benefit of hindsight, we know the inaccuracy of that statement.  I urge the Minister to ensure that we do not slip into the tempting situation where gifts are used to bolster the resources of the Food Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>I urge extreme caution in terms of avoiding compromise.  Irrespective of the Bill's provisions, there is a huge temptation for large food production companies to have an involvement with a food safety authority and try to get a good reputation as a part of the food industry which helps the authority.  This is dangerous territory and I urge the Minister to discourage any large-scale gifts irrespective of whether they will be declared. The declaration of such gifts gives publicity to the company.  It is a no win situation and we should steer away from the encouragement of gifts to a statutory body which must be independent, objective and authoritative.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  It is most important that Deputy Sargent's comments are taken into consideration.  There is always a risk that substantial donations from industrial sources may compromise the work of the Food Safety Authority.  Allegations have been made in other countries, including the United States of America, where such cases have arisen due to companies funding the authorities which regulate food safety or other areas.  It is crucial that the organisation which will be established to ensure the safety of the food we eat is not compromised by alleged funding from industrial sources.  I support the amendment.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give the public information about legislation referred to by the Food Safety Authority in its work.  It will ensure the public is <i>au fait</i> with the work of the authority.  The Minister may consider that people would not necessarily be interested in such detail. However, a sufficient number of people are concerned about the food they eat.  They may be employed in the food industry or parents who take a keen interest in the diet of their children. This information should be available and included in the annual report.</P>

It is reasonable, and the Minister supported the principle of what I suggested.</P>

We cannot allow any delay or lack of response from a Government Department or body when such a report is sought from the Authority. The Minister of State has responded in the negative and appears to believe there would not be an occasion on which a Government Department would not wish to respond fully and speedily to the Food Safety Authority.  We cannot be sure of that.  There have been occasions in the past when Government Departments have not been as fast as they might have been coming forward with information requested.

      <P>Deputy Shortall's amendment to subsection (7) is considered unnecessary.  Stated misbehaviour is already provided for and, therefore, the amendment is not being accepted.  It may be the case that a board member would need to be removed for health reasons and might not wish the reasons to become known.  If the amendment is accepted the Minister would not be able to comply with the board member's wishes in such circumstances.

To avoid that situation arising there should be an obligation on the Minister to state the reason for removal.  Presumably in the case of an illness, the reason stated could be personal reasons which would not be contested.

      <P>&ldquo;(d) analysis relating to the nutritional value and content of food, between mainstream production methods and those production methods utilised in the organic and biodynamic food producing sectors.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the interests of the objectives of food safety and of safer and more sustainable production of food, it should be taken into account that the Irish public has a very limited knowledge generally of food produced along organic and biodynamic lines.  The current dominant motivation behind food production is appearance.  That is evidenced again and again by marketing studies. The Minister of State said the objective of the Bill is to make the consumer king, but in the area of food, appearance is king and the cost of producing the food is queen.  We are talking about food safety but the current perception of the public is that once the appearance is reasonable and the cost is low, the food is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority has a considerable job on its hands.  We should equip it for that job <Col N="1530" /> so that other factors, which are not so easily assessed can be taken into account.  The Food Safety Authority, in its scientific work, should carry out an analysis of the nutritional value and content of food between mainstream production methods and those production methods utilised in the organic and biodynamic food producing sectors.  Clinical tests have shown that food produced organically results in a healthier product. Without the analysis, organic food has to labour under the dominant means of assessing its worth which is often price and appearance.  While organic produce can be equally as appealing to the eye and can be produced at an equal cost to that produced with chemical inputs, particularly if labour costs are addressed through reform of the taxation system, it continues to labour under this bizarre way of assessing food which is dominated by appearance and cost.  Will the Minister accept the amendment because this is an area on which the Food Safety Authority should focus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable because it is unnecessary.  Subsection (6)(c) already takes account of the type of analysis to which the Deputy refers.  In addition, subsection (1) is a general enabling provision which allows the board to refer matters to the scientific committee. If the authority is to be independent, the Bill should not be too prescriptive as to which matters the board should refer to the scientific committee.  In regard to organic food, its producers should not have anything to fear from the scientific committee if it is as healthy as the Deputy says.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister of State in this amendment.  The Bill already covers any eventuality where an issue that should be investigated is referred to the scientific committee.  We are talking about a proposal for a scientific project which will compare the nutritional value of mainstream foods to that of organic produce.  I do not disagree with Deputy Sargent in regard to the comparison between both products.  Without exception the organic product is often of better quality as it does not have the additional residues found in the mainstream product.  It is not appropriate to this Bill, however, which concerns food safety from the point of view of the consumer. The inclusion of such an amendment will restrict the scientific committee somewhat.  It can only do research in a number of areas and that limits the amount of time it has to carry out research into other issues.  The scientific committee should not be tied down.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I support Deputy Sargent's amendment.  I regret the Government's reluctance to take on board some of the ideas in regard to bucking the industry involved in mainstream food production and actively promoting the production of organic foods.  I am amazed that my amendment on a hazard committee in regard to genetically engineered foods was ruled <Col N="1531" /> out of order.  I am astounded that there were sufficient grounds for that because it was an innovative idea which will be seen in the future to have been of crucial relevance.  The Government should accept Deputy Sargent's amendment.  I hope the work of the scientific committee and of the Food Safety Authority, when it commences, will show the benefits of organic food as opposed to the type of mass production which severely diminished the quality, flavour and enjoyment of food.  Is it any wonder that battery hens, who are as happy as politicians whipped into voting lobbies against their will, produce a product with less flavour and nutritional value than the organic material?  The same applies to pigs which are held in disgracefully cruel and confined conditions.  I do not understand the reason the Minister of State will not support measures such as that being called for in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State give an assurance that the analysis relating to the nutritional value and content of health foods is brought to the attention of the consumer?  The growth in the health foods business is astronomical but there is a risk that many companies will promote the health food image while falling short in regard to its real health benefits.  It is important that consumers are made aware of the benefits of health foods.  Products are sold through packaging and TV advertising so we must ensure that we sell health foods that are of benefit to health.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that we are talking about food safety but he should consider the meaning of safety.  We are also talking about aspects of the whole health area with which he is familiar as a qualified physician, namely, allergies, the boosting of the immune system, etc. These are all matters of safety and health.  I would go so far as to say that the growing and consumption of organic food has been found to buck the trend world-wide in relation to the decreasing sperm count.  These may not be immediate matters of life and death to the individual, but they relate to health and the safety of the human race. The Minister should take a more broadly-based view of what the Food Safety Authority ought to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organic sector here is facing an uphill struggle in comparison to that in Denmark and other countries where 25 per cent of food is organically produced.  We ignore the enormous resources available to promote organic farming, <Col N="1532" /> which has health and economic benefits.  We also ignore the fact that that market cannot be satisfied. People want to eat healthy food, but very often they cannot get it.  The Food Safety Authority should embrace all aspects of food, particularly an area such as this which is disadvantaged compared to the mainstream food industry.  The authority should be an ally rather than an indifferent associate to the development of this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Davern, stressed the importance of developing the organic food industry. I urge the Minister, as somebody who may disseminate information to ensure that people understand the difference between various types of food, to accept the amendment, which would help redress the imbalance.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the broadly based Consultative Committee to be kept informed of the advice of the Scientific Committee.

He said it is important that all the arms of the new authority would interlock and that there would be free exchange of information between the board, the Consultative Committee and the Scientific Committee.

It is important that such an amendment is accepted.  It would encourage the Scientific <Col N="1533" /> Committee to distribute information to the public which it can understand.

On Second Stage the Minister stressed the importance of a sciencebased approach to food safety.  In that context it makes sense that reports drawn up by the Scientific Committee would be made available to the Consultative Committee, which is a broadly based group, so that it would be informed of the scientific information produced and that its deliberations and decisions would be better informed.

We are talking about laying down legislation which will last long into the future, regardless of the personnel in the authority.  In that respect it is important to set down in the legislation the relationships we would like to see develop between the various arms of the authority.  It is very well for the Minister to say there will be a free flow of information between the three bodies, but I am thinking of the future when the personnel involved may not adopt the open approach envisaged.

      <P>In page 29, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) any incorporated body which has been duly authorised by the relevant Government Department to carry out inspections relating to minimum standards in the area of food production e.g. The Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association Limited, The Irish Organic Trust Limited, Demeter Standards Ireland Limited etc.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed this issue previously on Committee Stage and believe there is a strong case to include this peculiar range of organisations which do not fit into a Department agency, a non-governmental organisation, a consumer interest body or <Col N="1535" /> the other agencies which we are discussing.  The Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, the Irish Organic Trust Limited and Demeter Standards Ireland Limited are the bodies which are required and, indeed, depended on to ensure organic standards are policed.</P>
    <P>If such organisations were not in existence, large companies would be able to claim whatever they wished in relation to the organically produced food they market.  Such companies would be free to make more money on top of the huge profits they already make without anybody being able to challenge the veracity of their claims.  The organisations referred to in my amendment are basically holding a thumb in the dam in relation to those marketing food primarily for profit and making unsubstantiated claims about quality.  We see the type of language used in packaging, for example, suggesting food is new, healthy and nutritionally improved.  The types of claims made should be challenged and policed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take on board the fact that section 48 on service contracts states that the authority may for the purposes of carrying out its functions enter into a contract.  This amendment does not impose an obligation and has nothing to do with being prescriptive.  Section 48(d) simply covers the unusual circumstances of the organisations which carry out an invaluable role.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment on that basis.</P>

Outside agencies could play a huge role in the implementation of the rules in relation to manufacture and retail, particularly the IQA, which independently evaluates firms, or ISO9000. They set a high standard of operation which in turn often determines quality and safety.  It would be worthwhile considering outside agencies, apart from those listed.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State seems to be under the impression that there is an official agency that would serve the need for a service contract in relation to organic produce.  I am trying to fill a gap.  The Department of Agriculture and Food might value organic produce and the Minister of State may present certificates at Dromcolliher and elsewhere to graduates in organic farming but, when all is said and done, it is these groups which set and police standards and to whom the Minister goes to talk about organic farming.  It seems these organisations are providing a necessary, unique and irreplaceable function. If the Minister is saying the Food Safety Authority is in the business of entering into service contracts with all groups that relate to food safety and does not mention the various organic organisations, he is leaving an enormous gap in the legislation.  I am exasperated by the lack of willingness to fill that gap by accepting this amendment.  I hope we can overcome that misunderstanding and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I disagree.  The Department of Agriculture and Food talks about organic farming more and more and yet it comes back to these agencies when it needs to organise inspections and consultations regarding the practices of organic farming.  It has limited experience through Teagasc and experimentation at Johnstown Castle but that is by way of supporting these organisations which have the ultimate experience and expertise to provide the service contracts.  If the Minister says the Food Safety Authority can enter into contracts with anybody it wishes, then it is putting these organisations on an equal footing with anybody who expresses an interest in food.  I am not sure whether the Minister seriously expects that to be a valid alternative to my amendment but it falls far short of meeting the need for proper organic expertise in the area of service contracts being available to the Food Safety Authority.  The Department of Agriculture and Food does not carry out all the functions required by the organic farmers and certainly could improve its act considerably.  In the meantime it relies on these organisations.  I hope the Minister appreciates that and will accept this or a similar amendment.</P>

      <P>Official agencies employ approximately 2,000 persons, in various Government Departments. In this section we are giving the authority power to displace, in certain cases, people working for a Government agency which is not carrying out the service contract as originally agreed.  Before the Minister and the authority would intervene in such a fashion and impact in such a way on an employee or employees, the staff associations or the trade union representatives of that agency should be consulted. We hope such a situation would not emerge but there are a number of official agencies involved.  Unfortunately, there may be a time when the authority may have to intervene in such a way.  In that event it would be proper that the appropriate staff representatives be consulted at such a delicate time.</P>

The staff, for as long as the service contract arrangement continues, will remain employees of the official agency, not of the authority.

The loss of a service contract to a particular agency, the Southern Health Board, the Western Health Board or particular veterinary departments, would have huge ramifications and a major effect on the staff.  If a service contract is to be withdrawn from a particular agency it would be appropriate that the organisation representing the employees would be consulted.  The service contract may be a minor contract for one small task but, equally, it could be for a major contract, involving a significant number of employees of the agency in question.  In a spirit of dialogue and consultation there should be provision for discussion with the various employee representatives on such an occasion.</P>

      <P>This is ground which has been ploughed and harrowed on Second and Committee Stages.  This amendment goes to the core of the legislation. The Food Safety Authority, as proposed by the Minister, is dependent for its operational effectiveness on service contracts.  At the core of the Government's and the Department's philosophy is the indication that, at a future date, service contracts will be terminated and employees of the various official agencies will become permanent employees of the Food Safety Authority.  Everyone accepts that cannot happen overnight and that lengthy discussions, dialogue and negotiations will have to be entered into by the authority, the various Departments and representatives of staff working with the various official agencies.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State and the Government are to live up to and fulfil their political commitment to have a fully independent, fully staffed and powerful Food Safety Authority, it is not good enough to say it will happen at some stage in the future.  I appreciate a three year service contract is perhaps the minimum time for such a contract to work effectively.  However, at some stage between now and the end of the first service contract, the Minister of State, his Department and the Government should state when the next stage will take place, which will be the direct employment of food safety inspectors by the authority as opposed to the various official agencies. That is the political commitment given by the Government and by the Minister of State and the Minister during the debates on Second and Committee Stages.  We need to know when this will be implemented so I would like to see a plan brought forward during the term of the first service contract indicating when the transfer of staff to the authority and their direct employment by it will occur.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. Approximately 2,000 people are involved in this procedure which will also involve many new and changing relationships.  The Minister of State said people would work on a contract basis initially and we would see how it would go from there. Some of us are concerned that we are talking of people's careers in terms of &ldquo;we will see how it goes&rdquo;.  If the initial contracts are for a three year period, we should be in a position after three <Col N="1540" /> years to know how things have gone, what difficulties have arisen and what new arrangements might need to be made.  To end any uncertainty surrounding people's jobs and the nature of their employment, it is fair and reasonable that the 2,000 people would be told at the end of the three year period the intentions of the Government and the authority regarding their long-term working conditions.</P>

      <P>This is an excellent amendment and it would be an excellent benchmark with which to assess the work of the authority after three years.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously examine it because, if it is the long-term intention for the authority to employ the number of staff in question, it is important to ensure that value for money was given within the initial three year period. If a commitment is given to accept the responsibility of permanently employing 2,000 people, an assessment should be made of how good a service was provided by all the statutory bodies under the remit of the Food Safety Authority. If this cannot be done within the three year period, there should be an independent means of assessing the effectiveness of each group under the remit of the authority.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  The purpose of the Bill, as opposed to the legislation of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan, is that the Food Safety Authority would, under contract, carry out work and assessments relating to food safety in various companies, organisations and so forth.  The basis of the Bill is that the authority would be independent. It is impossible for it to be truly independent if Department staff are employed by it because they would have a bias towards their Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The reason the Food Safety Authority is being established is to take responsibility for food safety from that Department.  For that reason, it is important that, after three years, the authority would directly employ its own staff who would be under its authority so that they would not have a bias towards other Departments, such as the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concerns of Deputies but Deputy Bradford's amendment is not acceptable.  The Bill already provides for the ongoing review of contracts under section 48(5). We have already discussed three year contracts and the annual review.  We cannot be tied down at this stage to a time limit because it is a new situation.  It would be unfair to have our hands tied.</P>

      <P>In his reply to the debate on Second Stage, the Minster of State said he would not be drawn on this issue.  That is an indication of the weakness of the political will to do what was originally promised.  It was the Minister of State's party and Government which promised to <Col N="1541" /> put in place a food safety authority which would be independent and autonomous and which would employ the entire inspectorate staff.  We could have a lengthy debate about the propriety of that proposal but it is the Minister of State's Department and the Government which has introduced the legislation.</P>
      <P>We need to be able to indicate clearly and quickly to the 2,000 staff working across various agencies when they will be employed by the Food Safety Authority.  It does not place an excessive demand on the authority, the Department, the Government or any agency to indicate after two, three or four years how the service contracts have worked, how long they will remain in place, what progress has been made in negotiations and discussions with the staff in the different official agencies and when movement will be made towards the stated goal of the Minister of State of having the authority employing the inspectorate staff.</P>
      <P>If the political will exists to do what was promised, it is not too much to expect that, within three years or more, an indication would be given when movement to the next stage would be made.  If we are unwilling to do that, it is an open admission that the service contracts will remain in place permanently and that the original political promise is already null and void.  That is why the Minister of State should be in a position to give some indication.  It is not a question of being drawn on it or of giving a specific date but rather if the Minister of State can state that it remains his intention and that of the Government that the Food Safety Authority will eventually employ the entire food safety inspectorate staffing.  Will the Minister of State at least answer the question and give a commitment on it?</P>

However, unless a time limit is imposed, that will not happen.  I could be here in 50 or 60 years' time in a zimmerframe, and the situation would still be the same unless a time limit is put in place now.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State to introduce a universal hepatitis B vaccination programme for all infants as a matter of urgency.  It is a disgrace that Ireland has not implemented the World Heath Organisation's recommendations to introduce such a programme. There is a policy of selective vaccination but most countries recognise that this policy has little effect in containing the spread of the infection.</P>
      <P>There are a few alarming facts about hepatitis B. The World Health Organisation estimates that it is responsible for more than 1,000,000 deaths per year and the best informed estimates say that the disease is one hundred times more contagious than HIV.  Between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of adults infected with hepatitis B will become carriers of the infection without knowing it.  Such a carrier, without showing symptoms of the disease, can pass it on to many more vulnerable individuals.</P>
      <P>Carriers will carry the disease in the blood for many years without feeling any adverse effects, yet infecting those with whom they come into contact.  They can also develop serious liver disease in later life from which they may die.</P>
      <P>Ireland is considered a low risk country as we have a relatively low incidence of the disease. However, we have become complacent.  There were 663 new cases between 1988 and 1993.  The cause of transmission in 34 per cent of cases was unknown; 8 per cent were caused by drug addiction or the sharing of needles; 15 per cent via sexually transmitted diseases and 5 per cent from mothers to new born babies.  Irish people travelling on holiday or to work abroad are generally not covered by any vaccination programme yet they are entering high risk areas such as southern and eastern Mediterranean countries.  The selective vaccination programme means that health care workers receive 85 per cent of the vaccine but account for only 5 per cent of the infections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health professionals in the US believe the true incidence of hepatitis B infections is dramatically <Col N="1543" /> underestimated because the disease is under reported, especially among ethnic groups.  It is also the case that many infants can have the disease in early stages but not show serious symptoms. In Ireland, health professionals believe that we also underestimate the true incidence of the virus and the carrier pool as we only screen high risk groups, thus missing infections and carriers in low risk groups.  Individuals in high risk groups can often be missed as they are likely to be aware of the risks and not present themselves for testing.</P>
    <P>Research in America has shown that infants infected with the disease are at a disproportionate risk of developing major complications, including chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis and liver failure. To reduce the risk of contracting the disease there are two choices.  First, one can avoid contact with high risk groups or people in close contact with such groups.  However, given the salient nature of the disease we cannot be confident of this approach.  The second choice is to eliminate the risk by introducing a vaccine into the existing vaccination programme.  This option would seem the most cost effective as the alternative is frightening &mdash; an already strained health system would have to cope with a huge increase in costs of treatments.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis B is a debilitating illness and removes victims from the workplace for a considerable period.  We could face a situation far more serious than the hepatitis C crisis as hepatitis B is more contagious.  In addition to the huge strain on the health care systems, the Minister could face a litigation problem as treatment costs are enormous. We are currently ignoring the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.  The disease is potentially fatal.  Although this disease is classified as low risk in Ireland, this implies some risk. The hepatitis B vaccine could be introduced at negligible cost into the existing vaccination system.</P>
    <P>Any person can be infected by the virus but no one has to be infected.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the immediate introduction of a universal hepatitis vaccination programme for all infants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  The incidence and prevalence rates of hepatitis B in Ireland are among the lowest in the world.  While the World Health Organisation has recommended the introduction of a hepatitis B vaccination, several low incidence countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, have instead initiated a selective approach which targets high risk groups.  It is considered that this represents a more effective approach in situations where the incidence of the disease is low and where cases occur in indefinable and specific population groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's policy is guided by the <Col N="1544" /> advice of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland whose guidelines recommend immunisation of individuals who are at an increased risk of contracting hepatitis B because of occupation, lifestyle or other factors such as close contact with a case or carrier.</P>
    <P>The committee is reviewing its guidelines on immunisation and future vaccination strategy for hepatitis B is among the issues which the chief medical officer has asked the committee to consider in the course of its review.  As regards workers in the health service, the Department wrote to all health boards and voluntary agencies in June 1997 stressing the importance of vaccination for at risk health care staff and clients. This was a reiteration of earlier advice.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1997 all new health service employees who will be involved in exposure prone procedures are routinely screened for hepatitis B. No applicant will be allowed to commence employment unless these procedures are followed.  All new employees in the category concerned must provide documentary evidence that they are not infectious carriers of the hepatitis B virus.  However, I will take on board the Deputy's points on the World Health Organisation and the increased risk to those travelling abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is widespread concern at the brutal and shocking murder of another young woman, Sinéad Kelly, in Dublin this week.  She was stabbed to death on the Grand Canal bank and was, apparently, raped and badly beaten in another attack in the same area two months ago. There are also reports of other attacks on women in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Are we doing enough to combat violence?  Far from zero tolerance of crime are we settling for some quasi-acceptable level of violence?  Have we created the circumstances in which women are more, not less, at risk?  There is a growing problem of young women being involved in prostitution in Dublin.  These attacks on this vulnerable group of women raise issues about organised crime, drugs and the increase in violence against women.  An article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states: &ldquo;The murder of a young prostitute working in the Grand Canal area was something which had been waiting to happen&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> refers to mean streets and the serious problems we are encountering.  One in five prostitutes interviewed in 1996 said they had been beaten up and 11 per cent said they had been raped.  I welcome the work being done by the Eastern Health Board and the Women's Health Project for these women.  It is extremely important that this work is properly funded and resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way since violent crimes against prostitutes would have resulted in little more than a &ldquo;well, what do they expect&rdquo; response.  Our historic moral indignation and <Col N="1545" /> rejection of the women, rather than their clients, has been replaced by more practical assessment of the issues involved, but there remains ambivalence as to what should be done about the matter. A certain ambivalence surrounds the three issues that are central to this debate, prostitution, drugs and violence.  We are not doing everything in our power to give women real choices in their lives so that they do not need to consider prostitution as a way of earning money.  Despite the increasing awareness and revulsion of violence against women, we are still not reaching or changing the attitudes of those men for whom such behaviour is the norm.</P>
    <P>We introduced legislation in the House in 1993 to update the law.  Many people expressed concern at that time that the legislation might increase the risks to women.  Has the legislation been reviewed?  I know the previous Minister for Justice met people working with these women and intended to review the legislation.  How many people have been charged with soliciting and how many prostitutes have been prosecuted under the legislation?</P>
    <P>The increasing number of young drug users who are turning to prostitution, often at a very young age, to finance their drugs habits raises serious questions about the availability of treatment for drug abuse.  These young women are vulnerable to violence and are running serious health risks.  Tensions are growing as the Garda also respond to demands by local residents who, understandably, want these women moved on. This is a complex area and the Garda are operating the provisions of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993.  Is the reported increased confrontational relationship between women and the Garda an accurate reflection of the position?  I accept, however, that the Garda are making every effort to deal with a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was introduced the Tánaiste expressed concern about certain sections.  A number of colleagues and I also expressed concern.  During that debate it was stated that women in prostitution needed help and encouragement and not a life going before the courts, going to jail and back on the streets.  It was predicted then that the legislation would give rise to blackmail and extortion and render prostitutes more vulnerable. Has this come to pass?  Is this what is happening on the streets?  The working party report on violence against women called for a comprehensive review of the legal framework relating to sexual and violent crimes against women.  These crimes are seriously under reported.  Women are not using the justice system for this purpose.  This raises issues for all women, but is a particularly serious issue for more vulnerable women, such as the young woman who lost her life this week.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment in the hope that we can find ways to make progress on what are complex and difficult issues.</P>

      <P>I am sure I speak for all sides when I say I am appalled by the vicious murder of a woman in Dublin yesterday.  It was a despicable act.  I understand from the Garda authorities that they are at the preliminary stages of a murder investigation.  It is important to note that, at this stage, they have not established a connection between this crime and any other crimes involving violence against women.  Any speculation to the contrary is unhelpful at best and likely to cause unnecessary concern or fear.</P>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that a family has been bereaved and they must be given time to grieve.  I extend my deepest sympathy to them. I know the House will join me in urging anyone who has information which could assist the Garda in solving this terrible crime to come forward and to help them with their investigation.  I am sure Members will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to have any further discussion in the House on this specific case which is being fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all alleged assaults on women working as prostitutes are investigated.  Prosecutions are initiated where evidence is available.  The Garda authorities state that there is no evidence available to them to support the suggestion that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993 has led to an increase in the number of assaults on prostitutes, or that it is encouraging &ldquo;pimping&rdquo;, as alleged in the media today.  While it may be comforting to know that overall crime levels generally are dropping, there is cause for concern that sexual offences against women are on the increase.  The number of rapes reported to the Garda increased from 143 in 1993 to 180 in 1996.  While official Garda statistics have not yet been published for 1997, I understand there has been a significant increase in the number of reported rapes as compared to 1996.  I am very concerned about this apparent trend.  However, there are a number of developments in this area which will be of particular interest to the House.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the Garda Commissioner directed the Garda research unit to conduct research into the incidence of rape from 1994 to 1997.  This research was published recently and the Department, as part of its research programme, recently invited tenders for further research into sexual offences.  An important research project is also being undertaken by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Trinity College Dublin under the EU Grotius Programme.  This project is reviewing the legal process and victims of rape in all EU member states.  Such an examination will allow us to identify and draw upon the best practice, as it is applied in the various jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The Government is very concerned about the issue of violence against women.  In December 1997, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women was established under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> Reform, Deputy Wallace.  The steering committee has a broad range of objectives which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established, developing a public awareness campaign and co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of resources among the eight health board regions.</P>
    <P>The regional committees were established in all health board areas in May.  They will draw together the services available to women in each of the regions to provide a sympathetic and consolidated approach to the treatment of violence. The steering committee is also developing a national awareness campaign which will aim to highlight a number of important issues.  For the perpetrator, it will highlight that violence is a crime and that it must stop, for the victim, it will highlight that help is available and, for society, it will highlight it should not further marginalise the victim by its actions.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I recently published a comprehensive Discussion Paper on the Law on Sexual Offences.  One chapter of the paper deals in some detail with the laws governing prostitution and related issues.  I am concerned that women working as prostitutes may be at more risk of violence than other women.  It is important that they have good liaison arrangements with the Garda.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a liaison officer attends the Eastern Health Board-Ruhama Drop-In Centre in Dublin on an ongoing basis and enjoys a good relationship with the women there.  The Ruhama Women's Health Project, which works with prostitutes, has been approved for £200,000 EU funding under the NOW strand of the employment initiative and will also receive funding of £50,000 from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the period 1998-9.</P>

      <P>There is great fear and anxiety among parents and pupils of the girls' primary school in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, regarding the possible withdrawal of a teacher in September 1998.  Enrolment on 30 September 1997 amounted to 178 pupils, eight short of the number which would allow it to maintain the existing number of teachers.  Enrolment on 30 September 1998 will definitely be over 186, giving the school more pupils than it had the previous September.</P>
      <P>Carrick-on-Shannon is the largest town in County Leitrim.  Over the past number of years, particularly the past two years, there has been a significant number of people settling in the town, with over 100 houses being built in the town area as a result of the Masonite factory just outside it. Masonite is one of the largest factories and employers in Europe.  In addition, many families are returning from abroad.  The indications seriously suggest a large influx of students to the girls' primary school in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> It is also necessary to take into consideration the ethnic minority in the school, with Chinese, Pakistani, Australian, Welsh and English children attending it.  This makes it more difficult for teachers due to the problems regarding language. The school also has children with special needs but there is no special class, necessitating smaller class sizes.  Reducing the teacher numbers by one will have the opposite effect.  A significant portion of children in the school require remedial teaching. Currently, the school shares a remedial teacher with a number of other schools in the area.</P>
    <P>Some years ago two local schools, namely, those in Jamestown, County Leitrim and Cortober in County Roscommon, were amalgamated with the girls' primary school in Carrick-on-Shannon which enlarged the number of pupils in the school.</P>
    <P>I understand the principal has to act as an administrator and full time teacher.  If the school loses a teacher she will have to take two classes. Otherwise, some teachers would have to teach up to 40 pupils, which is not acceptable.  I think the Minister agrees and departmental policy has stated that no class should have to up to 40 pupils.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at my request that no teacher is lost from the primary school in Carrick-on-Shannon because of the large influx of pupils to the school in September 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk to the House about this matter.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the manner in which the staffing allocation of primary schools is determined. The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Scoil Náisiúnta Maighdean Mhuire, Carrick-on-Shannon, on 30 September 1996 was 197 pupils.  This enrolment warranted a staffing level of a principal and six assistants for the l997-8 school year.  Additionally, the school has the services of a shared remedial teacher who is based in the school.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the enrolment of the school on 30 September l997 declined to 178 pupils.  This latter enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and five assistants for the 1998-9 school year.  The school would have needed an enrolment of 186 pupils on 30 September 1997 to retain its sixth assistant teacher.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the sixth assistant's post will be lost at the end of the current school year. The teacher in question has been offered panel rights which effectively guarantees the teacher another permanent post in a school within a 28 mile radius of Scoil Náisiúnta Maighdean Mhuire. This is in line with normal procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am bound by the terms of the <Col N="1549" /> agreement set out above and cannot sanction the retention of the sixth assistant in this instance.  In light of the comments made by the Deputy I will arrange for a local inspector to investigate the circumstances in the school but cannot hold out too much hope, given the agreements in place.  We will look at the situation pertaining to the issue raised by the Deputy in terms of projected enrolment and other needs the school may have.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to Coiste Méanscoil Átha Cliath Iar Thuaidh, led by Ray Ó Ceal-laigh and Áine Ní Aodhgán, which has done wonderful work to progress the cause of an all-Irish second level school in our area.  Tá meas oll-mhór agam ar an obair iontach tábhachtach atá déanta ag an choiste.</P>
      <P>Before the general election the Minister and his colleagues made a promise to the coiste that in Government they would very sympathetically examine the prospect of establishing a second level school for the north east and north central areas of Dublin.  Up to January of this year we felt there was every prospect for the school.  A meeting between the coiste and the Minister's officials was held in Tullamore at which it seemed clear the school would start this September. However, the coiste and the many hundreds of supportive parents in the north east of Dublin feel they have been cruelly deceived and let down by the Government.</P>
      <P>The coiste has done astonishing work on behalf of the Irish language and Irish language education over the past number of years.  For example, it worked very hard to negotiate with CDVEC and received a promise of support from it, its chief executive and its chairman, Senator Joe Costello.  The coiste located a site at Scoil Neasáin in Artane.  It has held detailed meetings with the Minister's Department, but we have reached a situation where it seems the hopes of the committee and its hard working supporters have been dashed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the huge upsurge in Irish language education and interest in it in the northside of Dublin over the past decade.  In my area we have the wonderful facility of Gaelscoil Míde in Kilbarrack, which has an enrolment of several hundred pupils, Scoil Neasáin, Scoil Cholm Cille, Scoil an tSeachtar Laoch and many others.  There clearly is a basic stream of pupils ready and available to take advantage of a new méanscoil.  Many parents feel that having had the facility of these primary schools, which they worked very hard to establish, the least they could be offered is a second level facility.  They are also concerned with the difficulty of children travelling many miles across northside Dublin to the centre of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt the Minister was looking at the project sympathetically and was prepared to examine and comment favourably on the preparatory work which has been done.  The parents had up to 40 <Col N="1550" /> children willing to become pupils of the school and the coiste has located a good site.  Yet nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of a number of other issues in the constituency.  For example, Scoil Eoin in Kilbarrack, which is in a very deprived area, should have disadvantaged status.  There are problems with school debts and fundraising and an urgent necessity for a home-school liaison officer at Chanel College in Coolock.  We are asking for an initiative in relation to third level education, namely, our northside partnership support programme for children and young people from deprived areas going to third level.  There is a range of issues on which we would like the Minister to take action.  Over the past number of months he should have been much more vigorous in addressing them.  Many of the earlier issues which arose were very favourably addressed by his predecessor, Niamh Bhreathnach.</P>
    <P>The failure to grant sanction this year for the establishment of the school is felt most bitterly in my constituency, the neighbouring Dublin North Central and parts of Dublin North West.  The preparatory work has been completed and the Minister indicated he was considering the issue sympathetically prior to the general election.  We would like him to deliver on his promise now.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an d'Teachta as ucht an ábhar seo a árdú. Tugann sé deis dom a chur i bhfios don Teach conas mar atá cúrsaí maidir le scoil nua lán-Ghaeilge dara leibhéal a bhunú in oir-thuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath.  I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go dtagann sé le polasaí mo Roinne soláthar a dhéanamh d'oideachas trí Ghaeilge nuair a bhíonn dóthain tacaíochta dó, go háirithe ó thaobh líon na mac léinn de.</P>
      <P>Is gnáthach go mbeadh tuismitheoirí a bhfuil a bpáistí ag freastal ar ghaelscoil ag iarraidh oideachais den tsórt chéanna a bheith ar fáil dóibh ag an dara leibhéal.  Deintear soláthar dóibh trí: scoil lán-Ghaeilge neamhspleách a bhunú, má bhítear sásta go bhfuil dóthain éilimh air; nó aonad lán-Ghaeilge a bhunú, a bheadh ina bhall de scoil, atá ag feidhmiú cheana féin, scoil faoi chúram Coiste Ghairmoideachais de ghnáth.  Cé go mbíonn an tAonad ina bhall den phríomh scoil, feidhmíonn sí faoi chúram múinteora i bhfeighil.  De ghnáth, cuirtear an tsórt seo soláthar ar fáil in áiteanna nach mbéadh an t-éileamh sách árd le h-aghaidh scoil neamhspleách a cheadú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom anois gearrchuntas a thabhairt ar chúlra an cháis seo.  Tá dhá mheánscoil ag freastal ar riachtanaisí thuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath le h-aghaidh oideachas dara leibhéal trí Ghaeilge faoi láthair.  Is iad an dá scoil sin ná Scoil Chaitríona, Bóthar Móibhí, Glasnaíon agus Coláiste Mhuire, Cearnóg Pharnell.  Scoileanna co-oidea-chasúla is iad an dá scoil seo.  Freastalaíonn siad ar dhaltaí a fhágann na gaelscoileanna ar an dtaobh ó thuaidh den Chathair, chomh maith le <Col N="1551" /> dream bheag páistí ó ghaelscoileanna ar an dteor-ann idir Chontae na Mí agus Chontae Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Fuarthas iarratas ó ghrúpa ó cheantar oir-thuaisceart na Cathrach, &ldquo;An Fochoiste Meánoideachais&rdquo; i dtaca le Coiste Ghairmoideachais Bhaile Átha Cliath ag iarraidh scoil dara leibhéal lán-Ghaeilge a bhunú chun freastal go háirithe ar Scoil an Duinnínigh, Scoil Neasáin, Gaelscoil Míde agus Gaelscoil Cholm Cille.  De thoradh an iarratais seo, tá athbhreithniú déanta ag an rannóg phleanála dem' Roinn ar riachtainisí thuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath le h-aghaidh oideachas dara leibhéal trí Ghaeilge.  Dealraíonn sé go mbeidh gá le soláthar breise den tsórt seo chun freastal ar an fás in uimhir na bpáistí a bheidh ag fágaint na ngaelscoileanna sa cheantar 'sna blianta romhainn.</P>
    <P>Is í an fhadhb is mó a bhaineann le soláthar breise a bhunú ná conas is fearr cóiríocht oiriúnach a chur ar fáil.  D'aimsigh an fochoiste suíomh taobh le Scoil Neasáin.  Tá mo Roinn den tuairim, áfach, nach mbeadh an suíomh seo oiriúnach ó thaobh fairsinge de le h-aghaidh scoil dara leibhéal sa ghearr-nó sa bhfadtéarma.  Chomh maith le sin, tá cóiríocht bhreise i scoileanna iarbhunoideachais eile i dtuaisceart chathair Bhaile <Col N="1552" /> Átha Cliath faoi láthair agus tá sé de dhualgas ar mo Roinn féachaint an bhféadfaí úsáid a bhaint as an gcóiríocht seo sar a dtugtar breith ar fhoirgneamh nua a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Bhuail oifigigh mo Roinne le baill an fochoiste agus Príomhoifigeach Feidhmiúcháin an Choiste Ghairmoideáchais ar an 3ú lá den mhí seo chun an cheist seo a phlé.  Míníodh don toscaireacht nach raibh deacracht i bprionsabal ag an Roinn maidir leis an moladh, ach go raibh deacrachtaí praiticiúla maidir le suíomh agus cóiríocht oiriúnach. Glacadh leis go leanfadh an fochoiste, an Coiste Gairmoideachais agus an Roinn lena n-iar-rachtaí na fadhbanna seo a shárú, ach nach bhféadfaí socruithe oiriúnacha a dhéanamh don scoilbhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go maith gur ábhar mór díomá é don bhfochoiste, do na gaelscoileanna agus tuismi-theoirí an cheantair nach mbeidh soláthar d'iarbhunoideachais in oir-thuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath don bhliain seo chugainn.  Dearbhaím áfach, go bhfuil sé mar rún daingean agam féachaint chuige go mbeidh réiteach sásúil ar an gceist seo roimh an scoilbhliain a thosnóidh i Meán Fómhair 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a child care assistant post has been requested in the case to which Deputy O'Keeffe refers.  My capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, my Department has a total of 275 child care posts in place in the special education system.  To date, the focus has been on addressing the needs of special schools and special classes and, in particular, the needs of children with severe <Col N="1554" /> or profound mental handicap.  However, I am aware of the growing demand for support for children with special needs attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    <P>Many schools throughout the country have secured the services of classroom assistants through participation in FÁS community employment schemes.  While such assistance is very much valued by the schools in question, it is the case that more needs to be done in terms of targeting the specific needs of some children with disabilities in ordinary school settings.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the needs of children with disabilities who are attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis.  As part of this process, my Department is in discussion with FÁS in an effort to develop a scheme which will make child care support available on a basis which specifically targets the needs of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that the needs of the child to whom he refers will be considered in the context of any additional allocations of child care assistants which may be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the length of time a school capital project takes is dependent on a number of factors including available funding and necessary planning procedures.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the level of funding for school capital projects has been very low in comparison with the level of demand.  I have already made significant advances in this area with increases versus the 1997 allocation of £12 million, or 42 per cent, in the primary sector and £12 million, or 29 per cent, for second level.  As a result, I have been able to progress a large number of projects which would have otherwise been delayed, including projects which were announced as being part of the capital programme in years where no funding was provided.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that minor projects should not be delayed unnecessarily and, to that end, have made devolved grants totalling £10.5 million available to primary schools this year.  In addition, my Department will shortly be piloting alternative procedures for carrying out professional tasks in the planning and design process with the aim of reducing costs and speeding up projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> In so far as major projects are concerned, a lengthy process of architectural planning is unavoidable.  Nevertheless, through the use of new technology and the streamlining of procedures, my Department has greatly improved the service to schools in recent times.  The introduction of the minor capital grants scheme primary level has also greatly simplified the process in respect of small building projects.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that available resources are targeted at schools most in need of accommodation, the Department at my request is undertaking a study on the development of a system of project prioritisation.</P>
    <P>This study will involve the identification of the criteria to be used in selecting school building projects for funding, taking account of the Department's policies and priorities in the area of planning and provision of school accommodation; a process of consultation with parents, management and teachers representatives in order to ascertain their views on the question of prioritisation and, in so far as is possible, to take account of those views in the development of the proposed system; the development of a system of prioritising school building projects based on the criteria identified and the consultations undertaken; and the development of an action plan for the implementation, monitoring and review of the system.</P>
    <P>My Department has written to the various bodies representing parents, school management, teachers and others seeking their views on prioritisation and requesting nominations for the consultation process.  The next step will be to arrange a series of meetings with the nominees and it is hoped to complete this part of the consultative process within the next few weeks.  At that stage a report will be presented to me for consideration.</P>

      <P>The report on the OECD International Adult Literacy Survey: Results for Ireland, prepared by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, for my Department in September 1997, indicated that, in general terms, there was a strong positive association between level of education and literacy level and that the level of education was one of the strongest correlates of literacy performance.  This report indicates that, in Ireland, over 80 per cent of university graduates were at level three or higher in terms of literacy and about 70 per cent of non-university <Col N="1556" /> graduates were at similar levels.  There is, however, a greater contrast between the pecentage of students in these two sectors who are at the lowest literacy level indicated in the survey.</P>
      <P>When these figures are a matter of some concern they are broadly comparable with those in the other participating countries in the survey. Since countries have different patterns of educational achievement, one would expect some differences between countries in the association between level of education and literacy performance.</P>
      <P>My Department has undertaken a number of measures tackling the broad area of disadvantage and associated learning difficulties in schools, including initiatives such as the allocation of additional concessionary teaching posts, home-school-community liaison programmes, the appointment of teacher-counsellors and the early start and breaking the cycle initiatives.</P>
      <P>A survey has just been conducted for English reading attainment at fifth class level in primary schools and the results are being processed at present.  My Department is consulting with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, regarding plans for national five year surveys in English reading for fifth class pupils and in mathematics from fourth class pupils.</P>
      <P>Ireland will also participate in an OECD survey on the achievement of 15 year old pupils in reading and mathematics in the year 2000.  This will be the first time a comparison can be made in key curricular areas at 15 years and will enable comparisons to be made with the outcomes of the junior certificate examinations.  It is my intention that national surveys should be more frequent and closely linked with international surveys, thereby providing more timely and meaningful comparison which will be a real benefit to all engaged in education.</P>
      <P>The new English programme at primary level, in the final stages of revision by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, has among its specific aims to enable children to develop a range of literacy, comprehension and expressive skills and to appreciate the power and beauty of language.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus to be introduced in 1999 has a particular emphasis on literacy and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus.  Greater attention is given to comprehension and composition, thereby enhancing the development of literacy skills directly related to the three areas covered in the IALS Study.  I am at present considering introducing an oral examination in English at second level and a paper is at present being prepared by officials within my Department on both the educational and assessment issues involved.  I will make a decision on this matter as soon as I receive this paper.</P>

      <P>Solicitors representing students who are studying for a nursing degree in NUI, Galway, have initiated legal proceedings regarding the non-inclusion of the one year add-on course leading to the award of a BSc.  nursing degree at NUI, Galway, in the free fees initiative.  As the matter will be before the courts, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The education and training of nurses is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  As Deputies are aware, a revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis and has since been extended to a large number of nursing schools in association with local higher education institutions. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.  The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children, at a cost of some £13 million in 1997, and, accordingly, the question of student fees for the diploma programme does not arise.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the continuing education of nurses is that the Department of Health and Children has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training. The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  These programmes are provided on a self-financing basis and the nurses involved can claim tax relief on their fees or can apply to their relevant health agency for assistance from the funding provided by the Department of Health and Children for the continuing education of registered nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A one year full-time degree course leading to a bachelor of nursing commenced in January last in the National University of Ireland, Galway. When the Higher Education Authority became aware of the proposal to introduce this course, it had discussions with the National University of Ireland, Galway, and asked the university to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.  The university advised the Higher <Col N="1558" /> Education Authority that it was porceeding with the course and I understand that 51 students enrolled on the course.  In view of these developments and the implications for nursing education generally, my Department is currently engaged in further discussions on the matter with the Department of Health and Children which is awaiting the final report of the Commission on Nursing which will address issues relating to both pre-registration nursing education and training.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 58, 105 and 350 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 third level student support schemes have recently been issued to local authorities and vocational education committees.  It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 <Col N="1559" /> was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were, therefore, increased by 3.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputies will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing needs generally in the education sector.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, I have identified the creation of additional third level places as my priority at third level.  To this end, I point out that I have already increased the number of places at third level by 8,000.  I have also given a commitment to introduce maintenance grants for post-leaving certificate students.  Details of this new scheme will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>The INTO has proposed that 800 students should be admitted to the colleges of education annually for the next number of years to increase the supply of trained teachers at primary level.  It is important to note that this figure includes teachers required to fill a range of new posts which the INTO wishes created.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of primary teacher supply is currently the subject of a review within my Department.  All matters pertaining to this issue, including the INTO estimates, are being examined as part of this review.  It is expected that the review will be concluded in the near future at which time I will announce my plans for increasing the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that over 600 newly qualified primary teachers will graduate this year. Over the following two years, a further 1,100 newly trained teachers are due to graduate, resulting in more than 1,700 newly trained teachers becoming available in the period from June 1998 to June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recent decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification will also contribute to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers, as will my recent announcement that graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have Irish as an academic <Col N="1560" /> subject as part of their teaching qualification, will be recognised as fully qualified to teach in primary schools in this State.</P>
    <P>My additional plans for increasing the supply of trained teachers are likely to include the provision of further post-graduate training courses and an increase in the number of students admitted to the colleges of education in the coming years.  Further linkages with St. Mary's College, Belfast, are also being pursued.</P>
    <P>I intend also to announce details of plans to increase the supply of trained substitute teachers. I am confident that these measures will be more than sufficient to eliminate the shortage of trained teachers.</P>

      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Teachta go dtagann sé le polasaí mo Roinne soláthar a dhéanamh d'oideachas trí Ghaeilge nuair a bhíonn dóthain éilimh air, go háirithe ó thaobh líon na mac léinn de.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 48 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The rules for the appointment of guidance counsellors are laid down in circular letters and deal with (a) criteria for allocation of guidance posts to schools, (b) qualifications for appointment of guidance counsellors and (c) the requirement in certain cases for guidance counsellors to engage in a certain amount of subject teaching. (a) The ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance to individual second level schools in a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September.  The allocation varies from 0.1 of a post to schools in the free education scheme with less than 100 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with 1,000 or more pupils.  These allocations are made in order to enhance the role of schools in provision of guidance for students.  The total allocation in respect of guidance in the current school year is approximately 567 wholetime teacher equivalents.  (b) In order to be appointed to an incremental post as a guidance counsellor, a teacher must be fully qualified to teach in the relevant sector, that is, secondary, vocational or community / comprehensive, and must have an additional qualification in guidance which is normally awarded at the end of a post-graduate course of at least a year's duration.  (c) In addition to their guidance qualification guidance counsellors need to be familiar with the education system and have experience of working with class-size groups of students.  For this reason, there is a requirement that guidance counsellors in posts outside the quota should engage each week in at least three hours' subject teaching.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that with the relatively recent increase in the number of training courses available for guidance counsellors from an original two courses to six courses, sufficient places can be made available to meet the need for guidance counsellors in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are in hand to review current provision.  The National Centre for Guidance in Education, which supports the development of guidance in schools, is preparing recommendations on the steps necessary for further improvements in guidance provision.  In particular, a detailed analysis is being carried out of the potential for a greater use of information communications technology to support guidance.  In addition, an evaluation of school provision of <Col N="1563" /> guidance will be developed, after consultation with the relevant parties, and this will commence early in 1999.  I will make decisions on the future development of school guidance provision on the basis of the outcomes of this review and having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools in the current school year is 21.7 to 1.</P>
      <P>There is considerable data published, including OECD material, which compares pupil-teacher ratios at an international level.</P>
      <P>By reference to OECD documentation, published in 1997 and relating to the 1995-96 school year, the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools in Ireland is fourth highest among OECD member states.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Government is committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools.  This commitment is consistent with An Action Programme for the Millennium which clearly prioritises primary education in allocating resources.  In this regard the pupil-teacher ratio is likely to fall to 21:1 this year.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has improved significantly in recent years due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools.</P>
      <P>The current standard pupil-teacher ratio at second level is 19:1.  However, when all pupils and teaching posts are taken into account, the actual pupil-techer ratio is currently of the order of 16:1. That said, the OECD report shows that, of 19 countries for which data were available, six countries had a higher pupil-teacher ratio at second level than that in this country.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to improve the pupil teacher ratio at second level as resources permit.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive survey of operation of the adult literacy and community education scheme was carried out in 1991.</P>
      <P>Statistics on participant numbers in the scheme have not since been collected directly by the Department.

      <P>An increase of £2 million has been provided in 1998 for the provision of adult literacy.  A key objective is to use this investment to support the strategic development of a national adult literacy strategy.  Accordingly proposals for funding have been invited which test models and innovatory approaches in regard to public awareness and outreach strategies, the establishment of referral networks on an area basis, and the provision of a range of flexible options to meet demands.  A key goal in this approach is to inform future practice, to identify and share the most successful strategies, and systematically enhance the capacity of the system to address literacy needs.  Standardised performance indicators and reporting arrangements are being developed as part of the strategy.</P>

      <P>The reasons for dropout are complex. There is no simple explanation.  Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved.  There must also, of course, be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available on the number of students who fail to complete third-level courses at the institutes of technology and universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent for those students entering in 1989-90.  This rate is a high completion rate by international standards. The Authority has recently commissioned the <Col N="1565" /> Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area In addition, the Commission on the Points System has engaged a team of researchers to undertake a feasibility study on the predictive validity of the points system in relation to the intake of students into higher education.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition-drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues.</P>
    <P>These are as follows:</P>
    <P>Approval has been given for the commencement of an action/research project including the appointment of a project officer to determine and measure student attrition and retention in the technological sector and to develop simultaneously an action programme based on the findings as they emerge.</P>
    <P>The institutes of technology have set up a group to provide solutions on a national basis to the varied and complex reasons for attrition in both the short and long-term.  The group is currently preparing a menu of initiatives which will be available to the institutes in the next academic year.  In this context each institute will examine and attempt to address its specific retentionattrition difficulties.</P>
    <P>A system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and is being applied on a pilot basis in some institutes.</P>
    <P>Other studies, in both individual institutes and in groups of institutes, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive study on the guidance services in institutes of technology was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education.</P>
    <P>A study of students attending four colleges who entered college for the first time in the 1996-97 session, is ongoing.  Data has been collected from three colleges and is currently being analysed.  It centres on comparisons of three student groups &mdash; those who progress to second year; those who drop out without completing examinations; those who fail examinations.  It is expected that the report will be finalised in September.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and <Col N="1566" /> my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

      <P>My Department has no proposals to breach the guidelines for remedial education.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's concern arises from references made by my Department to pupils being in need of remedial teaching if they are scoring at or below the ten percentile on standardised tests.</P>
      <P>The guidelines on remedial education referred to by the Deputy do not recommend that pupils scoring below a certain level on standardised tests should be automatically selected for remedial teaching.  Rather they state that a certain score on standardised tests be used as an initial screening device to identify pupils who may be in need of remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>Pupils performing below the level specified in the guidelines are considered to need further, more detailed, individual testing of a curriculum related type before determining whether they would benefit from remedial teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines recommend that final selection of pupils for remedial teaching should be as a result of testing, increased teacher vigilance, and informed consultation between the principal and staff as to which children might have greatest <Col N="1568" /> need of or get most benefit from remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>My Department's references to the ten percentile reflect the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, which recommended that remedial teaching be specifically targeted at pupils who function at or below the ten percentile on a standardised, norm-referenced attainment test in literacy, mathematics or both.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of primary teacher supply is currently the subject of a review within my Department.  All matters pertaining to this issue are being examined as part of this review.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the review will be concluded in the near future at which time I will announce my plans for increasing the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity to remind the Deputies that over 600 newly qualified primary teachers will graduate this year.  Over the following two years, a further 1,100 newly trained teachers are due to graduate, resulting in more than 1,700 newly trained teachers becoming available in the period from June 1998 to June 2000.</P>
      <P>My recent decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification will also contribute to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers, as will my recent announcement that graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have Irish as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification, will be recognised as fully qualified to teach in primary schools in this State.</P>
      <P>My additional plans for increasing the supply of trained teachers are likely to include the provision of further post-graduate training courses and an increase in the number of students admitted to the colleges of education in the coming years.  Further linkages with St. Mary's College, Belfast are also being pursued.</P>
      <P>Finally, I intend also to announce details of plans to increase specifically the supply of trained substitute teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will be <Col N="1569" /> more than sufficient to eliminate the shortage of trained teachers.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate, of course, makes <Col N="1570" /> some demands on the candidate's memory. However, the variety of assessment modes in use ensures that an apropriate range of skills is tested in line with the requirements of the syllabi.  While candidates may be required to produce factual information, particularly in written examinations, they are, as a rule, required to deploy a range of skills such as analysing, evaluating, comparing, and reaching conclusions.  Orals, aurals, practicals, and project work are used as part of the established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.  These modes of assessment require candidates to integrate different types of knowledge and use information productively.</P>
      <P>The link modules, which are examined in the leaving certificate vocational programme, involve self-directed learning, innovation and enterprise.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is examined in a way that de-emphasises memorisation, generally speaking, and promotes active learning methodologies across the curriculum.  The student tasks which are examined externally involve the application in a practical way of knowledge and skills acquired through different disciplines.</P>

      <P>It is an important objective of schools at all levels to develop in students a questioning attitude and the ability to think creatively and critically.  The accepted view among experts is that thinking can be taught but the challenge is not so much to teach students to think as to teach them to think effectively.</P>
      <P>There is evidence in this country from my Department's studies of pupils' achievements in English and mathematics, and from other international studies in which Irish students participated, that greater attention needs to be given to the development of higher-level thinking skills in our students.</P>
      <P>The development of problem-solving skills in mathematics and of inferential and evaluative comprehension skills in reading is not receiving increased emphasis in our schools.  Our approach seeks to make more effective thinking a self-conscious aim within the new curricula being made available at both first and second levels.  Teaching approaches that cultivate group work, collaborative work among students and active learning are being encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the curriculum at primary level that is almost complete and the extensive programme of curriculum reform at second level has as a central objective the development of a questioning attitude and creative and critical thinking <Col N="1571" /> skills among our students.  In the various curricular areas students are being given guidance in observing closely, questioning, hypothesizing, inferring and expressing themselves.  While all curricular areas are being used to develop these skills, they receive particular emphasis in mathematics, the sciences, languages and social studies.</P>

      <P>My Department does not utilise a space-per-pupil norm in primary schools.  Instead, it is the practice to provide classrooms of 70 sq. metres in new schools, and extensions to existing schools.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of the planning data which governs primary school facilities. Classroom size is a specific feature of the review and is being looked at in the context of curriculum developments and a reducing pupil teaching ratio.  I expect that this review will be completed soon and it will strongly influence facilities to be provided in future years.</P>
      <P>I am aware that individual school managements reorganise their classroom accommodation regularly to take account of departing classes, and new enrolments.  In the circumstances, it is not feasible for my Department to have detailed information on the accommodation usage in all schools.  However, where schools seek grant-aid from my Department for additional accommodation, the applications are considered on their merits in the context of available capital resources.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for improved monitoring of participation and retention rates among traveller children in the education system.</P>
      <P>Research conducted by the Task Force on the Travelling Community in 1995 indicated that, of an estimated 5,000 traveller children of primary school age, 4,200 were attending primary schools at that time.  This represents a participation rate of 84 per cent.</P>

A Co-ordinating Committee on Traveller Education, which is representative of all areas of my Department involved in the delivery of education services to the travelling community, was established in my Department in November, 1996.  This committee is responsible for drawing up and overseeing a comprehensive plan for the implementation of the task force recommendations which have implications for my Department.

      <P>I am aware that delays have been experienced in some areas in establishing special classes for children with specific speech and language disorder.  Such delays have largely arisen because of difficulties in securing the services of the necessary speech therapists.</P>
      <P>Special classes for children with specific speech and language disorders are established where a need has been identified and supported by up-to-date psychological and speech therapy reports in respect of the children in question.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to addressing this issue on a concentrated and co-ordinated basis.  I have already announced a major expansion in the Youthreach programme for tackling early school leavers among 15 to 18 year olds.  The number of places within FAS and the VEC sector, including Senior Traveller Training Centres, will expand from 4,525 in 1997 to 6,765 in 1998.  Youthreach was introduced to provide an integrated programme of education, vocational training and work experience in an out-of-school setting for those in the 15-18 age group who left school early with no qualifications. As such, the programme is targeted at preventing the drift into unemployment, rather than reducing the pool of those already unemployed.</P>
      <P>Of those who left Youthreach in 1997 70.6 per cent progressed to employment or further education and training.</P>
      <P>The other education interventions targeted at the unemployed are the vocational training opportunity scheme provided by my Department and the back to education allowance schemes implemented by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Both of these schemes enable adults over 21 who are at least six months unemployed to return to education while retaining allowances in lieu of social welfare entitlements. They therefore play an important role in addressing the structural problem in the labour market, where over 63 per cent of the unemployed have not completed upper secondary education. The 1997 Labour Force Survey indicates that unemployment levels have now fallen to 159,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of early school leaving, my Department has a range of strategies in place to address the problem in a concerted and co-ordinated way.  These include the development of Early Start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the Breaking the Cycle initiative; the home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for Junior and Senior Centres for Travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees for necessitous pupils, and second chance education under the VTOS and Youthreach programmes. In addition, £2.96 million is being provided over 1998 and 1999 for a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development <Col N="1577" /> of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged 8-15 at risk of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to publish a School Attendance (Amendment) Bill and attendant initiatives before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I am firmly commited to maximising the supports available to special needs children who are attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with this commitment, I have already indicated my intention to ensure that a <Col N="1578" /> remedial resource is available to every primary school in the country within the next two years.</P>
    <P>As a first step in this process, it is my intention to make an allocation of additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the precise number of posts and the recipient schools in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am also giving active consideration to the possibility of allocating additional resource teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year to support ordinary class teachers in catering for the special needs of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Under the IT 2000 initiative, I have established a special fund of £250,000 to meet the special equipment needs of individual children with disabilities, including those who are fully integrated into mainstream schools.  This special allocation is in addition to the significant funding being made available to schools generally under the initiative.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined will be of major assistance to special needs children in integrated settings.</P>

      <P>Examiners make a valuable contribution in the further development of the draft marking scheme both at the marking conference and also during the early stages of the marking process leading to the refinement, if any, of the marking scheme before its application to the work of all candidates.</P>
      <P>At the end of the marking process each examiner submits a comprehensive report on the answering of the candidates to the chief advising examiner who prepares a composite report for the chief examiner.  The chief examiners prepare an annual report for each of those subjects at both levels.  Appropriate comments in relation to the answering of questions, format, style and type of questions are given full attention by the chief examiners in the preparation of papers in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1997 junior certificate science examination the comments were broadly along these lines but also included suggestions on clarification of diagrams and improvement of layout. These have all been acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports also recommended that the applied science extension within the syllabus might be revised.  While the NCCA undertook a review of all the junior certificate syllabi, including science, in 1996-97, a further revision of the science syllabus <Col N="1579" /> is not expected until after the wider Junior Certificate Curriculum Review is completed in 1998.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  This cost the Exchequer some £77 million in 1997.  It was necessary to adopt this approach because the resources available to fund this measure are limited.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-96 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third-level.  Thus the extension of the free fees initiative would involve substantial additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to extend the free fees initiative to these students would have to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.  I would hope that, as resources become available, it will be possible to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>In their report, the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment. In this context, I would point out that tax relief is available, at the standard rate under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996 for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>

      <P>While detailed information in relation to class sizes in individual second level schools is not provided to my Department, the Deputy will be aware that significant improvements have occurred in the pupil teacher ratio in recent years and this has undoubtedly been a factor in diminishing average class sizes.  Despite this programme of sustained improvement, I have no doubt that some classes at second level are larger that we would wish.  This is one of the issues taken into account by my Department when considering appeals from individual school authorities for increased teacher allocations.</P>
      <P>In general terms, practical classes have a lower average class-size and effective teaching can take place through practical work being undertaken individually or in groups under the direction of the teacher.  The three senior cycle programmes, the transition year programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied, are given additional teacher and-or financial resources to enable more effective teaching and the development of self-directed learning to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice with effect from 1994-95 to allow expansion in general only to the extent that existing teacher numbers at local level allow.  Notwithstanding this, participation on the programme has rapidly increased in recent years as follows:- 1993-94, 17,677; 1994-95, 17,644; 1995-96, 17,985; 1996-97, 18,712 and 1997-98, 21,263.  22,727 places have been appproved on the programme in 1998-99, thereby providing for an increase of 4,015 places over the two school years since this Government took office, compared with an increase of 1,035 places in the preceding three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a significant expansion, and has been accompanied by investment of £20 million for PLCs and Apprentices under the Education Technology Fund, the introduction of maintenance grants with effect from September 1998, the provisions of £1.5 million to date for equipment in the centres approved for teleservices in 1997, <Col N="1583" /> and the establishment of a new student support scheme towards the cost of placing teleservices students abroad.</P>
    <P>The PLC sector has proved its capacity to respond rapidly to changing skill needs, and I have taken steps to ensure that increases in approval level in 1998-99 are being targeted at strategic areas such as the teleservices area.  In that context, the numbers on teleservices courses will increase from 435 in 1997-98 to 1,505 in 1998-99.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very satisfied with the development to date of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund.</P>
      <P>The fund is a clear statement of this Government's seriousness in addressing key educational issues which impact on our economic performance. I am fully conscious of the need to implement the various projects under the fund with maximum speed and am glad to report that very significant progress has been made to date. To facilitate the earliest commencement of projects I arranged that the first tranche of the fund's provision, i.e. £100 million, be included in my Department's Estimates for this year.  This provision is, of course, additional to the normal capital Estimates of my Department.</P>
      <P>Over the next two years a further £150 million will be added to the fund which represents the largest ever investment of its type and involves a concentrated scale of building activity never before undertaken in the education sector.  The sheer complexity of such an undertaking will, even with the best efforts of all concerned, require an appropriate lead-in time to ensure that we achieve maximum value for the investment.</P>
      <P>Already, for example, I have had the pleasant task of joining the authorities of Carlow Institute of Technology at a ceremony marking the signing of a major building contract for over £11 million approved by me under the fund.  Also, the Institute of Technology Tallaght, was given approval to proceed immediately with the construction of a major extension, estimated to cost around £12.5 million, and comprising laboratories, lecture theatres and other badly needed facilities. In addition I have given the go-ahead for an investment of £10 million for the upgrading of equipment in the higher education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that I have given approval for the allocation of £30 million towards the creation of a minimum of 3,500 additional undergraduate places in the university sector to meet the emerging skills needs in the <Col N="1584" /> high-technology sector.  The projects in question are at an advanced stage of planning and construction work is expected to start before the end of the year in most cases.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have approved an allocation of £15 million for expenditure on the Schools IT 2000 project in 1998.  This project will greatly develop the use of information and communication technologies in Irish first and second level classrooms between now and the end of 2001 by means of an integrated programme of technology, training and support provision.  I am using £14.1 million approximately of the £15 million investment to support schools in developing their ICT infrastructure and my Department has already issued almost £13 million in the form of grants to over 4,000 first and second level schools.  In distributing this grant aid, I have made particular provision for special schools and special classes which cater for children with special needs, including traveller children.  The remaining £900,000 approximately of the £15 million will be used to support the purchase of computer hardware and software resources for Education Centres, Schools-Colleges of Education and the Inspectorate of my Department.</P>
    <P>In the context of the second-level education system, skill enhancement leading to improved employment prospects is largely met by post-leaving certificate courses (PLC's).  A number of post-leaving certificate projects in locations throughout the country are being considered for funding.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental principle of the primary school curriculum that individual differences between children should be recognised and catered for in the school programme.  It posits that the curriculum should be sufficiently flexible to allow each child to progress at an appropriate pace and to achieve satisfaction and success at his or her own level.  The Report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum (1990) was supportive of the retention of this principle in any future curriculum review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum at present being completed by the NCCA also takes account of the need to cater for individual differences.  Its broad objectives are set down in a format which requires that due account should be taken of intrinsic abilities and varying circumstances among pupils.  The NCCA is at present preparing an issues booklet, entitled Differentiation, which will accompany and inform the main curriculum statements and teacher-guidelines in relation to pupils with varying needs.  The NCCA has also <Col N="1585" /> recently established a working group on pupils with special educational needs.</P>

      <P>To help encourage meetings outside school hours the Revised Teachers' PCW Proposals provide that in respect of one student review meeting with parents per term, post-primary schools may make provision to allocate from normal school time a period equivalent to the time given outside school time.

As part of the PCW implementation process a circular covering this matter is being finalised and will issue before September, 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sometimes stated that, in our second level education system, there is a narrow concentration on subject content (on what to learn) rather than on the generic, enabling, life-enhancing skill of knowing how to learn.  The question is closely related to the issue of whether the energy that is put into teaching syllabus-examination content is matched by the nurturing of effective learning strategies.</P>
      <P>These questions are being addressed in a number of ways.  The transition year programme, now taken by about 25,000 students in 510 schools, has as one of its major aims the student's taking responsibility for her or his own learning.  This includes negotiated learning, activity-based learning, project-work, research and team-teaching approaches.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme promotes a cross-curricular approach and emphasises the value of self-directed learning and active learning.  The modular format of the leaving certificate applied places a strong emphasis on activity-based learning, teamwork, integration of knowledge and problem solving.  Students learn to take on greater responsibility for their own work and they review and reflect on their progress as they complete their assignments and tasks.  These tasks help students develop an awareness of their own learning processes through engaging systematically in critical evaluation of their own work.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Points System has commissioned research involving a survey conducted by transition year students on the opinions of their peers in the leaving certificate class of 1998 on how they perceive the points system affecting their teaching and learning experience. The results of this research will inform the work of the commission.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he proposes to take to ensure that the targets are achieved in relation to access to universities in view of the finding that only 50 people from disadvantaged backgrounds gained reserved access to the seven universities in 1997, only one tenth of the target level.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership 2000 provides that priority will be given to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants, especially the disadvantaged, to participate in third level education.  The targets set for students in this regard refer to both the university and technological sectors.  The latest progress report on Partnership 2000 outlines some of the current developments in the university sector on access initiatives for disadvantaged students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the recent ESRI school leavers survey indicate that a person's socio-economic status continues to exert a strong influence on <Col N="1587" /> educational participation at third level.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the factors underlying this phenomenon go beyond our educational system. Nevertheless, my Department has a range of measures in place to further the promotion of equality of access to higher education.  The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established.  In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>In the university sector, following the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, the Higher Education Authority provided funding in 1996 and 1997 for initiatives in a number of universities specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  Funding will also be provided in 1998.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools and local communities.  For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programme is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting these targets and progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the figures in the progress report refer generally to those students who enter university through the special entry arrangements and do not include students who enter university through the CAO procedure.</P>
    <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the college is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city and there are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, a policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that the Government has given approval for an establishment board for a new third level institution in Blanchardstown to serve the west of Dublin.  The new institution, to be called the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, will meet two very important needs, namely; to increase participation in thrid level education in west Dublin, an area with one of the lowest participation rates in the country; and, to <Col N="1588" /> help meet the skills requirements of expanding industries.</P>
    <P>I introduced the new National Certificate in Technology course, which was developed by a joint education/industry task force and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, and which commenced in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology.  This initiative is in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to give priority to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants to participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical College Equality Network Project which arose out of the EU Programme New Opportunities for Women, is operational in six institutes of technology. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus at women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.  It is envisaged that there will be an expansion of the programmes under this project to include those colleges not already participating in the scheme.  In addition, Dublin Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology offer specific courses for second chance education for mature and disadvantaged women.</P>
    <P>There is also a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA Level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in the institute of technology, which is an imporant development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the multifaceted nature of the initiatives under way which are indicative of my commitment to tackle educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Three official circulars (i.e. Circulars 23/84, 7/87 and 38/91) have issued from my Department to school authorities concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools.  The circulars noted the Minister's concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.</P>
      <P>Private companies, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, are free to promote their business in accordance with accepted practices.  School authorities are required to ensure, as is outlined in the circulars to which I have already referred, that pressure is not placed on parents to purchase particular commercial products.  In this context, Circular 38/91 specifically requests school authorities, following consultation with staff, to formulate agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions.  Such policies can assist school authorities to act prudently in taking steps to ensure that commercial products are not promoted and marketed through their schools.</P>
      <P>In view of this, I am satisfied that due awareness and vigilance exists in relation to his matter.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, the provision of guidance, including the provision of information about careers and further education, has been part of the caring, pastoral overall educational role of the school.  The introduction of the specialist role of guidance counsellor has been in recognition of the increasing amount and complexity of vocational and educational information and of the increasing need and demand for personal counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction in schools of the role of guidance counsellor may have resulted, in some instances, in a tendency to view guidance provisions as the sole responsibility of the guidance counsellor.  However the role of the school as a <Col N="1593" /> whole in the provision of guidance has been confirmed and affirmed again, relatively recently, in the &ldquo;Guidelines for the Practice of Guidance and Counselling in Schools&rdquo; prepared by the National Centre for Guidance in Education, sent by the Department to all post-primary schools in 1996.</P>
    <P>The guidance counsellor, as well as having a specialist function, is a resource person for the school in fulfilling its overall guidance role.  Other teachers provide students with information and advce related to their subject disciplines and may also have a guidance function when they have responsibilities in management, pastoral care, home liaison or in other related areas.  I am satisifed that there are no particular legal difficulties arising, assuming that due and reasonable care is taken in ensuring the accuracy of any information provided.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to introduce a specific course in basic learning techniques as part of the leaving certificate programme. However, I can assure the Deputy that much has already been done to help pupils improve the ways in which they learn.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme enables each school to design its own programme within the guidelines set by my Department to meet the particular needs of its students.  It encourages research and activity based self-directed learning and equips pupils to become effective learners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme promotes a cross-curricular approach and emphasises <Col N="1595" /> the value of self-directed learning and active learning.  This involves a reflective approach to work which results in an increased understanding on the part of students of how they learn.</P>
    <P>All leaving certificate applied courses are organised in modules.  The modular approach allows the setting of short-term goals for students, provides a wide range of course materials and familiarises them with an approach to learning that will be of benefit in further study and in working life.  There is a strong emphasis on activity based learning, team work, integration of knowledge and problem solving.  Students learn to take on greater responsibility for their own work and to review and reflect on their progress as they complete key assignments.  The performance of student tasks, which are marked by an external examiner, helps students to develop an awareness of their own learning processes, through engaging systematically in critical evaluation of their work.</P>
    <P>The recently revised syllabi for the established leaving certificate provide many opportunities for students to become more autonomous in their approach to learning.  Students develop a wide range of intellectual and practical skills such as: analysing, evaluating, drawing conclusions and the integration of knowledge.</P>
    <P>Participation by teachers in the various new programmes at senior cycle has involved significant professional development for them which is having an important effect on learning methodologies throughout the second-level system generally.</P>

      <P>At the outset, it must be noted that science subjects at leaving certificte are a prerequisite in only a small number of third level courses in related areas.  Also, candidates have a wide range of subject choices within the leaving certificate and generally study four additional subjects from a range of 27 subjects in addition to English, Irish and mathematics.</P>
      <P>The percentage of the total leaving certificate cohort who are studying the physical sciences had increased until the mid-1980s but has decreased steadily since then.  The current figures (96/97) are 12.3 per cent for chemistry and 16.4 per cent for physics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has implemented a number of interventions to encourage greater take-up of the physical science subjects.  These have been particularly directed at increasing participation rates by girls who have been traditionally under-represented in this area of study.  The interventions which include the introduction of the physical <Col N="1599" /> sciences in girls' only schools and the preparation of gender suitable material for use by pupils have been successful in this regard.  However, I intend to take other initiatives, in the near future, to improve the take-up of the physical sciences to meet the increasing demands of the economy.</P>

      <P>The great majority of schools now administer standardised tests of literacy at each class level.  An increasing number of schools are using similar tests in mathematics.  The administration of these tests generally begins at first class level (6/7 year olds) and the results are used to inform teachers and parents of pupil progress in these core areas of curriculum.  In addition, at each class level these test results are used for identifying pupils in need of remedial teaching and for planning programmes of remediation for them.  Teachers also use these tests results to assist them in the organisation of their pupils for class and group teaching.  The results of these tests are also shared with parents.  It is felt that this practice of testing pupils, using standardised and informed tests by their class and remedial teachers, best meets the needs of the pupils and their parents.</P>
      <P>The inspectorate of my Department in association with the Educational Research Centre conduct regular surveys of literacy standards on pupils in 5th class in primary schools.  Similar surveys are planned for mathematics.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to support the establishment of all-Irish schools in areas outside the Gaeltacht, where sufficient demand for such facilities is demonstrated and where there exists no suitable alternative provision within a reasonable distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs is at present examining the most appropriate criteria for the recognition and resourcing of national schools, including all-Irish schools.  As part of its remit, the commission is carrying out a review of existing policies, structures and funding for this area in the course of preparing recommendations for submission to me.  Policy in <Col N="1600" /> relation to the development of all-Irish schools will be reviewed in the light of the commission's report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, makes specific reference to the establishment of a body to plan and co-ordinate the provision of Irish-medium textbooks and learning aids, advise the Minister on policy matters related to Irish-medium education, provide support services to schools through the medium of Irish and conduct research into any related matters.  As the Bill progresses through the legislative process, I will give consideration as to how this provision might best be implemented.</P>
    <P>A possible approach to addressing these issues might be to provide or designate an education centre with a specific focus on services to schools providing education through Irish.  I have asked my Department to examine this possibility.</P>

      <P>This question has been submitted to me in both written and oral form and to each other Minister in written form.  As one would expect the number of areas in the programme for the millennium for which my Department is specifically responsible is very limited. There are three commitments in the programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, which have been implemented in full: (i) a Cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate the drugs strategy in the context of social exclusion has been established; (ii) an all-party committee on the Constitution has been re-established; (iii) The committee <Col N="1601" /> system in the Oireachtas has been reformed to make the Oireachtas more relevant to citizens.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the following specific initiatives have been taken: (a) allocations of £10 million to support the work of local drugs task forces have been approved; (b) a £30 million young people's services and facilities fund has been established and detailed guidelines approved to support developments in areas particularly affected by the drugs problem; (c) a new programme of intensive family support services to meet the needs of children at risk has been introduced; (d) a pilot programme to improve the co-ordination of services in the most disadvantaged communities is under way and (e) a broad-ranging review of strategic issues relating to social inclusion and the national anti-poverty strategy is continuing.</P>
      <P>Two commitments in the programme for the millennium have been partially implemented.  A review group was established to look at the efficiency of the law offices of the State.  The Cabinet will be examining the report in due course with a view to publication.  Second, a comprehensive and independent study of a basic income policy is in progress.  Its results will be reflected in a Green Paper which, in line with the Government's programme, will be published by June 1999.  There are no other specific commitments in the programme that are the responsibility of my Department.</P>

The diary entries for the period from 24 November to end December 1988 have also been discovered in my Depart ment in the diary of Mr. Burke's immediate pre decessor.</P>

      <P>My Department has no outstanding responsibility in relation to the matters raised in the Deputy's question.  In recognition of the importance of the issue involved, however, and of my own commitment, and the Government's commitment to resolving this matter, I will endeavour to answer the Deputy as best I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State no longer has any legal obligations <Col N="1607" /> to the pensioners of the Irish Hospital Sweep stakes in respect of their redundancy.  It is recog nised, however, that this group of people has made an enormous contribution to the com munity over the years and that their efforts helped this country to develop a modern public hospital service.  The majority of the employees who were made redundant in 1987 are single women, many of whom are in straitened financial circumstances.  A representative of the former employees, Mr. John Slevin, has been in continu ing contact with my office in recent months and I have been fully briefed on the matters involved.</P>
    <P>In consultation with my Government col leagues, I am currently examining the situation of the former Sweepstakes employees bearing in mind the need to protect the interests of the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>In recent years, the environment has become a key issue, with wide-ranging implications, for business and indus try.  The concept of sustainable development is recognised as offering both challenges and oppor tunities to all sectors, including business and industry.  Progress has been achieved in the pro motion of sustainable development through a combination of regulatory and voluntary measures.  Of particular relevance is the inte grated pollution control &mdash; IPC &mdash; licensing sys tem operated by EPA, which has raised the environmental awareness of industry operating across a broad spectrum of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental management systems &mdash; EMS &mdash; are becoming increasingly popular with some firms opting to adopt certified systems such as the EU eco-management and audit scheme &mdash; EMAS &mdash; or the ISO 14001 standard.  In addition, many firms have developed their own &ldquo;informal&rdquo; environmental systems.  The National Accreditation Board &mdash; NAB &mdash; and the EPA have developed a joint auditing and reporting process to meet the requirements of both EMAS and the IPC system.  This initiative eliminates the requirement of a separate audit for each system and is, I understand, the first of its type in Europe.  In addition, the concepts of eco-labelling and product life cycle analysis are achieving greater acceptance in industry and they demon strate that firms can benefit from the adoption of formal environmental assessment mechanisms <Col N="1608" /> through cost savings and the exploitation of mar ket advantage in addition to the resulting environmental benefits.</P>

      <P>There are a var iety of initiatives and programmes in place relat ing to the promotion of cleaner production tech nologies in industry.  The integrated pollution control &mdash; IPC &mdash; licensing system, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; EPA &mdash; requires the use of best available technology not entailing excessive cost &mdash; BATNEEC &mdash; and thereby seeks to ensure that the methods of oper ation and production should adhere to the best environmental standards.</P>
      <P>The better environment awards for industry scheme, sponsored by Forbairt, encourages and gives recognition to the environmental achieve ment of Irish industry.  This scheme provides awards in a variety of categories, managing for sustainable development, cleaner technologies, eco-design, partnership for sustainable develop ment and recovery of waste.  In addition, Forbairt has supported the environmental initiative, which was established by the Clean Technology Centre, Cork Institute of Technology, and the cleaner production promotion unit &mdash; UCC &mdash; in associ ation with Dublin Institute of Technology and has the aim of advancing the competitiveness of Irish industry through environmental responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are several initiatives under the auspices of the EU LIFE initiative.  A pilot cleaner production and environmental manage ment system demonstration project was co-ordi nated by the Clean Technology Centre with the objectives of introducing cleaner project concepts to a number of SMEs, assisting and training com panies to carry out an environmental audit, and seeking opportunities for waste reduction and cleaner production.  In addition, IBEC operates an Environmental Training Programme for Irish Industry under the LIFE initiative, which has been developed in collaboration with the EPA, An Taisce and the Clean Technology Centre. This training programme provides a comprehen sive training package for companies who wish to <Col N="1609" /> develop or update in-house expertise on environ mental issues.</P>
    <P>A Cleaner Production Pilot Demonstration Programme, which is being managed by the EPA on behalf of the Department of the Envir onment and Local Government and the Euro pean Commission, seeks to promote environ mentally friendly production through the application of cleaner systems, techniques and-or technology.  The programme is aimed primar ily at small and medium sized enterprises &mdash; SMEs &mdash; to help them operate in a more environmentally friendly manner and 14 com panies were selected to participate in this scheme.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions recently adopted by the EU Council and European Parliament is likely to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities during July.  Member states, including Ireland, will be obliged to trans pose the provisions of the directive into their national laws within two years from that publi cation date.  The directive does not allow unlimi ted patentability of subject matter.  As in the case of inventions in other areas of technology, biotechnological inventions are patentable only if they are new and susceptible of industrial appli cation, and involve an inventive step.  Patents will not be granted in respect of biotechnological inventions, the exploitation of which would be contrary to moral or ethical standards.  The fol lowing are not patentable under the directive: (i) plant and animal varieties, and essentially biologi cal processes for the protection of plant and ani mals, (ii) the human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the <Col N="1610" /> sequence or partial sequence of a gene, (iii) pro cedures for reproductive cloning, (iv) processes for modifying the genetic identity of human beings, (v) uses of human embryos for industrial and commercial purposes, (vi) processes for mod ifying the genetic identity of animals, or animals resulting from such processes, which are likely to cause them suffering without substantial medical benefit to man or animals.</P>
    <P>The objective of the EU Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological inventions is to establish harmonised clear, and improved stan dards for the protection of biotechnological inventions with a view to furthering the innovat ing potential and competitivity of community sci ence and industry in this important area of mod ern technology.  The implications of the directive will be examined by my Department in the con text of its transposition into Irish law and any rep resentations regarding the implementation of this directive will be considered by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if changes will be made in the ability of the Lab our Court to examine dispute cases for those on occupational pensions in view of the passing of the employment equality legislation; her views on whether the provision could be deemed ageist; if the industrial relations legislation should be alt ered since senior Labour Court officials have access to arbitration for themselves under section 5 (4) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, but this does not extend to pensioners of other bod ies; and if she will make a statement on the mat ter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 13 May 1998 access to the services of the Lab our Court is determined by the definitions of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  On the basis of legal advice available to my Department, a pensioner is no longer a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Industrial Relations Acts and a dispute about pensions is not considered to be a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; after a person retires.  The Labour Court, accordingly, cannot deal with disputes about pensions in the case of retired people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Employment Equality Act, 1998, issues concerning pension rights are excluded from the scope of that Act.  Section 5(4) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, provides, in relation to a pension scheme for the chairman, deputy chairmen, and ordinary members of the Labour Court, that any dispute about the amount of pension, gratuity or allowance payable under that scheme shall be submitted to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who shall refer it to the Minister for Finance.  The decision <Col N="1611" /> of the Minister for Finance on a dispute is final. This is not third party arbitration as, in the first instance, the consent of the Minister for Finance for the establishment of such a scheme is required.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the earlier reply the Pen sions Act, 1990, as amended, contains provisions for the proper administration of occupational pension schemes and the protection of the rights of members of such schemes.  If a member of a scheme is concerned that the trustees of that scheme have not complied with a provision of the Pensions Act, he-she may complain to the Pen sions Board.  The board has extensive powers of investigation and other powers under the Act. The Act provides for penalties where a person is found not to have carried out his-her duties under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has asked the Pensions Board during their current term of office, to examine the issue of a pensions Ombudsman and the form that such an office might take.  The board is expected to report before the end of this year.  The matter will then be considered by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It is generally considered more appro priate that arrangements for adjudication in disputes about pension entitlements should be dealt with under pensions legislation other than industrial relations legislation.</P>

The programme will support investment in a number of new and modern second-hand vessels for the whitefish fleet.  In addition, there will be a targeted modernisation scheme and support scheme for essential safety equipment for vessels. The special tax reliefs which I secured in the Finance Act will complement the capital grant aid component of the programme by making the sector more attractive to investors and providers of capital.</P>

      <P>Global fish production and demand for fish and fish products continues to grow at an exponential rate, with aquaculture production worldwide providing an increasing proportion, now in excess of 25 per cent, of that global production. The depletion of stocks through overfishing worldwide is a worrying trend and Ireland, as a coastal State with particular concerns, continues to be at the forefront in seeking to ensure that EU international regulations optimise the conservation and sustainable development of the fisheries resource.  The ongoing growth in aquaculture production will continue to contribute to meeting the gap between supply and demand for fish products and should increasingly over time ease the pressure on stocks at risk from over fishing. The worldwide trend in fish production is mirrored in Ireland in that aquaculture production <Col N="1619" /> now amounts to some 10 per cent in volume terms and 30 per cent in value terms of total fish production.</P>

      <P>Data provided by the Central Statistics Office show that national average prices for whiting, cod and plaice increased by over 4 per cent, 14 per cent and 9 per cent between April 1997 and April 1998.  National average prices in the same period for meats increased by 9 per cent in the case of gigot lamb but remained static in the case of steaks and pork.  Despite the increase in national average fish prices over the past year fish still represents extremely good value compared to competitor meat products.  A price survey carried out by BIM on 19 June at certain north Dublin stores found that cod, whiting and smoked coley were cheaper than all meat alternatives except mince beef.  I have summarised the data for the Deputy in the table below.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133, 134, 135 and 136 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The APSO English language secondary teaching programme in Poland was initiated in 1994 in <Col N="1621" /> response to the fundamental political and economic change in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  The development of English language teaching was a priority for the Government of Poland and APSO agreed to supply a limited number of teachers up to 1998.  From an initial deployment of 17 teachers in 1994 the number in post in 1998 is eight.  APSO reviewed the programme in 1996 and it was found to be an effective and worthwhile intervention.  However, the programme was always intended to be of limited duration and APSO's involvement will cease in July of this year.</P>
    <P>APSO's programmes in the priority countries of Irish aid are not specifically aimed at the development of independent trade unions or the defence of trade union rights.  APSO involvements include action in support of education, infrastructure-rural development, health care and civil society generally through the support of independent local organisations and NGOs.  As with the Irish aid programme generally, the agency's programmes are developed on the basis of needs identified in conjunction with local partner organisations in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The decision by the board and management of APSO to pioneer social accounting as a means of improving both the accountability of the organisation and the quality of service provided was an innovative, courageous, challenging and very positive initiative.  The report identifies a range of stakeholder groups whose views were sought on the overall performance of the organisation.  One of the primary stakeholder groups consulted was APSO's overseas partner organisations in developing countries, which gave a very positive judgment on the quality of the relationship with APSO.  APSO works in association with organisations in developing countries, and the views of those organisations were sought in the Social Accounts exercise as representing the views of the communities concerned.</P>
    <P>In appointing the chairman and members of the board of APSO, the Minister for Foreign Affairs seeks a broad range of skills which will include, of course, people with significant experience in developing countries.  I am satisfied that the APSO has benefited greatly from the range of experience and skills which the current board has been able to bring to its work.  Board members who may lack direct field experience in developing countries have the opportunity of visiting APSO supported projects overseas.  The current chairman, Professor Anthony Clare, has visited APSO-supported projects in Africa and will shortly visit Central America.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the chief executive is essentially a matter for the board of APSO.  The current chief executive was appointed following a competitive interview and was deemed to be the best overall candidate.  I am aware that the board of APSO recently decided to offer the current chief executive a new fixed term contract for three years when his current contract expires at the end of July.  The board was fully within its <Col N="1622" /> rights in doing so.  The board and management of APSO have taken seriously the full range of comments expressed in the social accounts and are addressing these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a number of commitments in the areas of Northern Ireland and international and European affairs for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the area of Northern Ireland, the Government set itself the task of reviving the peace process through securing a restoration of the IRA ceasefire and the establishment of substantive negotiations towards a settlement, along with more general efforts to build a spirit of confidence and cooperation on all sides.  This objective was successfully realised with the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement on 10 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The agreement was based on, <i>inter alia</i>, the Mitchell principles, the Downing Street Declaration, the Joint Framework Document and the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It includes provisions for a devolved assembly and executive in Northern Ireland based on partnership between the two communities, effective North-South bodies, enhanced protection for human rights including in due course a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, and measures to bring about the normalisation of society in Northern Ireland, including a policing service fully representative of the community it serves.</P>
      <P>The Government remains intensively engaged in the follow-up and implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, which involves a number of Ministers and Departments.  An inter-departmental steering group chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs has been established to monitor and co-ordinate work.  There is regular contact with the British Government and the political parties in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the commitment to protect the interests of smaller member states in institutional reform, decisions on certain institutional issues in the perspective of future enlargement, including the size and composition of the European Commission and the weighting of members states' votes in Council, were left unresolved in negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam.  A protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of the European Union set out a work programme <Col N="1623" /> for considering such matters in the future.  The European Council in Cardiff made clear that the first priority must be the ratification of the Treaty and agreed that once the treaty is ratified, an early decision will be required on how and when to tackle the institutional issues left over from Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the protection of the interests of smaller member states, Ireland's insistence that the essential balances between member states within the European insitutions should not be altered to the detriment of smaller member states is well known to our EU partners and will be a fundamentally important principle underlying the approach to be taken by us in future discussion on further institutional reform.</P>
    <P>The commitment to ensure a smooth transition to the new Structural Funds regime which takes account of regional imbalances within Ireland is being put into effect on a continuing basis in conjunction with other Departments directly concerned.</P>
    <P>The detailed Commission proposals on Agenda 2000, which cover the future financial framework of the European Union, including the Structural and Cohesion Funds and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, were published on 18 March.  They have since been discussed at the Cardiff European Council, at the General Affairs Council, ECOFIN and the Agriculture Council, and have also been examined at official level. Negotiations on the package are likely to be lengthy and to last well into next year.</P>
    <P>The Cardiff European Council reviewed progress made to date in the negotiations.  It set March 1999 as a target for reaching political agreement on the Agenda 2000 package as a whole.</P>
    <P>While the Department of Finance is responsible in the first instance for the Structural Funds, the Department of Foreign Affairs has overall co-ordinating responsibility in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has participated constructively in the discussions, it has, like every other member state, vigorously defended its interests and will continue to do so.  With regard to the Structural Funds, the Government has firmly maintained our case for continuing substantial funding for Ireland over the next financial period at a level which will provide for adequate transition arrangements and meet the needs of the whole country, including its less developed parts.  We will continue to argue this case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the aim of modernising the UN Ireland and her EU partners have been to the fore in promoting reform of the United Nations. We have given our strong support to the current reform efforts of the UN Secretary-General, the full implementation of which are still under discussion. Ireland and its EU partners will continue to lobby for reform measures and modernisation across the UN system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> In the area of development co-operation, the programme for Government includes a commitment to increase official development assistance, ODA, from its 1997 level of £122 million, 0.31 per cent of GNP, to at least 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002.  In late 1997, the Government took a significant step towards the implementation of this commitment by approving Estimates of expenditure for 1998 consistent with an ODA outturn for the year of £137 million, 0.32 per cent of GNP. The full implementation of the commitment will obviously depend on the Estimates allocations for 1999 and subsequent years.  In addition to increasing the funding for ODA, I have also strengthened the procedures for planning and implementing the ODA programme with a view to enhancing the productivity and accountability of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>In terms of expansion of the Ireland House concept, there is now consolidated representation involving diplomatic missions and one or more agencies in 16 locations worldwide.  The latest Ireland House was opened in Madrid in October 1997, and it incorporates the embassy, An Bord Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, BIM, and An Bord Bia. The possibility of extending the Ireland House concept to other locations will be kept under review in liaison with the State agencies through the foreign earnings committee.  Any such arrangements must naturally be shown to be both cost effective and conducive to the more effective representation of Ireland's interests.</P>

      <Quest>the submission, if any, he has received from the Debt and Development Coalition on writing off debts of the most impoverished nations by the year 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is frequent contact between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Debt and Development Coalition, including regular meetings to discuss current issues regarding the debt situation of developing countries.  We have received submissions from them on the subject of the debt problem of the most impoverished countries and are aware of their concerns on this subject and their support for the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which advocates the cancellation of the unpayable debt of the poorest countries by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the debt problem of the poorest and most indebted countries and the serious constraint which unsustainable debt burdens impose on their economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has consistently used the relevant international fora to emphasise the need to find ways to address the debt problem of the poorest countries and to call for the consideration of all options. <Col N="1625" /> The HIPC Initiative, the debt initiative for highly indebted poor countries, represents a significant step forward on the part of the international community in seeking to address the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries.  It has the potential to make a significant contribution to the resolution of their debt problem.  However, there has been limited progress to date in implementing the HIPC Initiative and its implementation would need to be accelerated if it is to have an appreciable impact on the debt situation of the poorest and most indebted countries by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Ireland has called for the speedier implementation of the HIPC Initiative and for its application to as wide a range of heavily indebted poor countries as possible on the most flexible terms achieveable.  We will continue to advocate its speedy implementation and will seek to ensure that the most favourable decisions possible will be taken in the implementation phase for the benefit of the indebted countries.</P>
    <P>The Jubilee 2000 campaign for debt remission is primarily directed at the larger creditor countries and the multilateral financial agencies. Ireland, as a non-creditor country, is not directly party to the debt problem but we have urged maximum flexibility by creditor countries and institutions in addressing the problem of unsustainable debt levels.</P>
    <P>Ireland has recently made a bilateral commitment to donate $5 million towards debt alleviation in Mozambique, an Irish Aid priority country which is among the most heavily indebted of the least developed countries, and consideration is being given to our also contributing to debt alleviation in Tanzania.</P>
    <P>In addition to such practical bilateral initiatives on our part to address the debt problem, we will also continue to use or influence at the multilateral level to press for a just and comprehensive long-term solution to the debt problem of the poorest developing countries, in the interests of their economic and social development.</P>

      <P>The Government has no plans to open a consulate in Belfast.  There is already, as the Deputy is aware, a Joint Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast which was established under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In addition, the question of the location of the Joint Secretariats of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the North-South Council, which are to be established under the British-Irish Agreement, are matters <Col N="1626" /> for consideration in due course between the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of allegations of human rights abuses during the conflict between the Angolan armed forces and the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda, FLEC a secessionist movement seeking independence for the province of Cabinda.</P>
      <P>The establishment of respect for human rights as a fundamental tenet of Angolan institutions and society is an essential component of the process of peace building and national reconciliation in Angola, which is strongly supported by Ireland and our EU partners.</P>
      <P>In providing concrete support for the Angolan peace process, the international community has consistently attached priority to the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The UN Observer Mission in Angola, MONUA, incorporates a significant human rights component, which is active in the promotion and protection of human rights.  Its activities have included a public awareness campaign, support for the efforts of local human rights committees and assistance to newly installed administrators in ensuring respect for the law and for fundamental freedoms.  The UN Secretary-General has highlighted the issue of human rights, as well as those of governance, public accountability and capacity building in the field of law and order as deserving of increased attention in the peace process.  He has also expressed his appreciation of the provision of human rights experts by the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government will support continuing efforts to ensure respect for human rights by the Angolan administration.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-98, approved by the Government on 5 March 1996, provides for the creation of a revised orgnisational structure with a total manpower of 11,500 by the end of 1998.  There is no provision in the new organisation for the attachment of military personnel to the Ordnance Survey Office nor is there any requirement for these cartographers in the Defence Forces.  These military cartographers have been fully trained at public expense and Ordnance Survey Ireland is totally dependent on them to meet its work programmes. In the past, these personnel would, after a period of three to four years, have been offered the opportunity to compete in a confined competition organised by the Civil Service Commission to transfer to the Ordnance Survvey Office as civilians. However, no such competition has been held since 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this month the Department of Finance sanctioned the arranging of a confined competition for the transfer of military personnel to Ordnance Survey Ireland as civilian employees. The advantages of transferring military personnel to civilian employment in Ordnance Survey Ireland are substantial as the personnel involved will be available to work full time as cartographers rather than the present arrangement whereby they spend part of their time performing <Col N="1633" /> military duties, attending military courses and, in some cases, serving overseas.  It would also mean that Ordnance Survey Ireland will have complete control over the personnel involved, in contrast to the present cumbersome arrangement, thereby improving the general efficiency of the office.</P>
    <P>I understand that the confined competition is likely to take place in September 1998.</P>

      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution.  Ireland is the only member state operating the scheme.  Since 1988, EU legislation requires the EU Commission to review the scheme every two years. On foot of a review in late 1996, the European Commission, in its report to the Council proposed that the scheme should be extended for a further two years at an unchanged aid level. The Commission also recommended that the monthly entitlement be halved to reflect the general decline in per capita butter consumption in Ireland which has fallen from 2lbs per month to under 1lb.  The Agriculture Council agreed in December 1996 to continue the scheme for a further two years on the basis of the Commission proposal.</P>

No application to purchase this equipment was made under this plan or under any other scheme.  As the period of the farm plan has now expired an application cannot be considered.  All the other investments, including a slatted tank scheduled on the plan, have been grant-aided.</P>

      <P>I have made arrangements to ensure that where undue delays occur in processing applications for the farm retirement pension they do not result in the applicant being unfairly penalised.

      <P>The officer concerned is an agricultural science graduate from the National University of Ireland.  He is an experienced officer and has been engaged on duties related to livestock schemes, including breeding schemes, since 1992.</P>
      <P>This herdowner's 1997 suckler cow premium application was the subject of an appeal to the headage and premia appeals unit of my Department. The appeals unit examined all of the evidence in the case.  This included the letters from the two veterinary surgeons and the reports of three separate Department inspections.  The third Department inspection was carried out by the district livestock inspector.  The appeals unit found that the herdowner had made a false declaration through serious negligence and the appropriate penalty of exclusion from the suckler cow premium scheme for one year was applied.  The herdowner was notified of the finding in December 1997.</P>

    <P>The above table shows that in common with the rest of Europe, there has been a considerable decline in the acreage sown over the past 20 years.  However, higher yields have more than offset the decline in acreage.  The potato sector is subject to normal market forces which can lead to fluctuations in producer prices and in areas planted from year to year.</P>
    <P>Production and yield in any particular year can be influenced significantly by factors such as climatic and soil conditions and the assessment which producers make of likely market conditions. Prices are influenced by supply and demand and the level of exports and imports.</P>
    <P>In the spring of this year early potato crops were well advanced in growth as a result of the particularly favourable growing conditions up to the time of severe frost in April.  The foliage of such crops was particularly vulnerable and was damaged by the frost.  A setback of this nature to growth resulted in later harvesting of potato crops and resulted in a reduced supply accounting for the current retail prices.  Published CSO figures in respect of imports for 1997 show that 40,449 tonnes were imported compared with 10,633 tonnes exported.</P>
    <P>A number of support measures for the potato industry are operated by my Department.  Financial assistance is available for: the setting up and operation of approved potato producer groups, and investment in improving the storage, including refrigerated storage, and marketing infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Sums of £7 million and £4.05 million were allocated to the sector in the 1994-99 round of Structural Funding under, respectively, the Food Sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development and the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  Grant aided expenditure under these programmes has enabled producers to improve efficiency, and extend the marketing season for the potato crop up to June-July, without any deterioration in quality, thereby reducing seasonal <Col N="1645" /> dependence on imports and improving competitiveness of Irish producers.</P>
    <P>While there are no statistics yet available for this year's plantings indications are that the acreage is sufficient, and with reasonbable yields, there should be adequate supplies available to meet demand in 1999.</P>

The agreement followed a fundamental review of the grading and pay structures and pay relationships of general operatives and the agreement was in full and final settlement of all claims on behalf of general operatives employed in Government Departments.  The agreement set out the position regarding pension arrangements and noted that no change was being made to the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees.  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees.</P>

    <P>These rates of stamp duty apply to all second hand residential property, regardless of the status of the purchaser, i.e. first time buyer or second time buyer.</P>
    <P>There is a full exemption from stamp duty for transfers of new houses and apartments with a floor area of 125 square metres or less.  Transfers of new residential property with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the full house value.  This favourable stamp duty treatment of new residential property is available only to owner-occupiers.  If a new residential property is purchased by a non-owner-occupier, then stamp duty based on the rates set out above, at the appropriate rate, is levied on the total value of the transaction.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty proposals contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, are designed to restore a balance to the housing sector &mdash; a balance between supply and demand, between investors and owner occupiers and between tax concessions and removal of reliefs.</P>

      <Quest>the cost to the State in each of the past three years of the provision of a sheriff in each county area; the payments made to each individual officer in this position; the cost of his support staff; the number of these officers in full-time work; the total amount of tax forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners through their intervention; his views on the action of the support staff of these State officers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a total of 16 sheriffs, of whom four have general responsibility for the enforcement of court orders.  These are the sheriffs in Dublin city and county and in Cork city and county.  The other 12 sheriffs, known as &ldquo;revenue sheriffs&rdquo;, were appointed in 1986 and 1987 specifically to carry out the task of executing certificates issued by the Collector-General under section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, previously section 485 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Prior to the appointment of the revenue sheriffs, execution of Collector-General certificates was carried out by the county registrars outside of Dublin and Cork cities and counties.</P>
      <P>All sheriffs are appointed under the terms of the Appointment of Court Officers Act, 1945, and are officers of the court.  Their remuneration is set by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the remuneration of sheriffs is in four parts.  Each sheriff receives a retainer of £400 per annum from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The sheriff is also entitled to collect a fee, called &ldquo;poundage&rdquo;, in respect of moneys collected by him.  This poundage is computed at the rate of 5 per cent on the first £100, and 2.5 per cent on the balance.  The sheriff may recover out-of-pocket expenses necessarily incurred in certain activities, primarily the mounting and conduct of seizures.  The sheriff may retain bank interest earned on the money collected by him, during the period between collection and payover to Revenue.  The time allowed in this regard is set down in guidelines drawn up by Revenue.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation on sheriffs to report their total earnings, so the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>The number and cost of staff required for collection is entirely a matter for each sheriff.  There is no information available on the number or cost of such staff.  The actions of a sheriff and his staff are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1963.  Any person who is aggrieved by any action of a sheriff or a member of the staff of a sheriff has recourse to the courts to seek redress.</P>
      <P>The sheriffs are a vital part of the collection apparatus of Revenue.  The table below sets out the amounts collected in each of the last three years.  In each case, the amount paid by the sheriff is set against an estimate of the amount paid by taxpayers directly to Revenue as a result of sheriff action.  Even this picture underestimates the effectiveness of the sheriffs, because the existence of the sheriff system encourages taxpayers generally to pay on time, and demonstrates the ability of the collection system to penalise those who do not pay.</P>

    <P>An improved system of remuneration of sheriffs will shortly be introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and will be applied in conjunction with a new agreement between the sheriffs and Revenue dealing with the handling of Collector General certificates.</P>
    <P>The new system of remuneration will update the remuneration &mdash; the current levels were set in 1926 &mdash; and will eliminate the retention of interest as part of the remuneration package.  The new agreement between Revenue and the sheriffs will streamline the handling of certificates, and will provide for a standing committee, representing Revenue, the sheriffs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to resolve issues arising out of the enforcement of certificates.</P>
    <P>Details of the new remuneration package and the new arrangements with the sheriffs will be announced as soon as the Enforcement of Court <Col N="1653" /> Orders (Fees) Order now in preparation in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is completed.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has written to the taxpayer's agent and has telephoned the taxpayer to explain in detail the information which the taxpayer must provide to enable the inspector to process the application for a C2 certificate.  The legislation governing the issuing of C2 certificates requires the Revenue Commissioners to be satisfied that, among other things, the applicant is or is about to become, a subcontractor, engaged in the business of carrying out relevant contracts.  Neither the taxpayer nor his agent has furnished documentary evidence of a contract with Mayo County Council.  When the applicant and/or his agent furnish the information the inspector needs to issue a C2 certificate, the inspector will process the application without delay.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated annual cost if tax relief was given to fees for postgraduate degree courses; if tax relief will be allowed in view of the cost to the students involved and the qualifications gained which help the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood from the Department of Education and Science that there are about 9,100 postgraduate degree students in the university sector. Assuming an average fee of £2,000 per annum per student and that the relief is given at the standard rate of taxation, then the estimated cost of tax relief for postgraduate university degree students could be as high as £4.4 million.  However, this cost is overstated because some of these students would receive, for example, a higher education grant in respect of their fees and others could have their fees paid by their employers.  Estimates of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there would also be pressure to include non-degree postgraduate students, postgraduate students in the non-university sector and students studying, for example, for professional qualifications in the scope of any tax relief.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new tax reliefs or the extension of existing ones.  Tax reliefs by their very nature narrow the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.  The reductions I made in income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax were made possible, in part, by restricting certain existing reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following the introduction of free fees for undergraduate students in publicly funded third level colleges, it was decided in the 1995 Finance Act to provide tax relief on fees by undergraduate students attending approved courses in private third level colleges in the State.  The 1996 Finance Act introduced tax relief for part-time undergraduate <Col N="1657" /> students undertaking approved courses.  These measures were targeted at undergraduate students to facilitate greater first time access to third level education.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the introduction of these measures for undergraduate students has meant the commitment of large scale resources to third level education in addition to the significant resources already being made available to this sector.</P>

      <P>The pensions of civil servants who retired from grades covered by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector are increased, as appropriate, on the basis of parity.  As regards the wider public sector, the primary responsibility for pension increases rests with individual organisations but the general practice is that parity also applies, as appropriate.  My Department is, of course, available to advise such organisations on the application of parity where difficulties arise. In this regard my Department has dealt with a number of cases which have been referred to it over the years.</P>
      <P>Under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for civil servants the superannuation terms of established civil servants are not arbitrable and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate to provide such arrangements for pensioners.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy refers to Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 of May 1998 concerning the compulsory indication of the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC.  This regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 3 June 1998 and it enters into force in every member state 90 days after its publication, that is, on 29 July 1998.</P>
      <P>Regulation 1139/98 applies to the labelling of two genetically modified products and their derivatives, a genetically modified soya and a genetically modified maize, which were placed on the market in Europe before the coming into force of the novel foods regulation in May 1997, and which would have fallen within the scope of the novel foods regulation if it had been in force at the time.</P>
      <P>Regulation 1139/98 provides that the specified foodstuffs be labelled unless neither protein nor DNA resulting from genetic modification is present.  If a food contains a genetically modified organism, that food will have to fulfil the labelling requirements of the regulation as it contains genetically modified DNA.  Highly refined derivatives of genetically modified products may be exempt from the additional labelling requirements of the regulation if they contain neither DNA nor protein resulting from genetic modification. A list of exempted products is to be drawn up taking account of technical developments, the opinion of the scientific committee on food of the European Union and any other relevant scientific advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a European Union regulation is directly applicable to and binding on all members states.  It will, however, be necessary to make national provisions to give full effect to this regulation in Ireland by laying down enforcement powers for authorised officers and imposing penalties for non-observance.  I <Col N="1659" /> intend to proceed with the necessary arrangements for implementation of this regulation in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The incidence and prevalence rates of hepatitis B in Ireland are amongst the lowest in the world. While the WHO has recommended the introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, several low-incidence countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, have instead initiated a selective approach which targets high risk groups.  It has been considered that this represents a more effective approach in situations where the incidence of the disease is low and where cases occur in identifiable population groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's policy on this issue is guided by the advice of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of <Col N="1660" /> Ireland, whose guidelines recommend immunisation for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors such as close contact with a case or carrier.  The committee is currently reviewing its existing guidelines on immunisation, and future vaccination strategy for hepatitis B is among the issues which my Department's chief medical officer has asked the committee to consider in the course of its review.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools are still at the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  The primary concern however of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment for children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that the planning process <Col N="1661" /> for the establishment of a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools has now been initiated and that the planning group which is to make recommendations on the introduction and development of this service will be reporting to him in the very near future.  Thirteen of the 15 qualified psychologists, who are being employed on a contract basis for the duration of a three year project, have now taken up duty, with the remaining two coming into the services in the autumn. These psychologists will work in regional teams under the management of the psychological service in the Deparment of Education and Science.  It will clearly take time for the national educational psychological service to build up an increased level of service provision to children of school going age.  During this interim period it will be necessary for the developing educational psychological services to work with the health funded services to ensure that the available resources are applied as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>Cardiac surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres.  Adult cardiac surgery is performed at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  In 1997 the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital were funded to perform a total of 1,400 adult cardiac surgery procedures and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children was funded to perform 260 paediatric cardiac surgery procedures.</P>
      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis.  At the end of December 1997, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,371 patients awaiting cardiac surgery.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to questions in this House on 16 June 1998, my Department allocated a sum of £1.7 million in 1997 under the waiting list initiative with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children.  A combination of approaches was used by hospitals to achieve this objective.  As well as purchasing additional cardiac surgery procedures, patients were also reassessed with a view to using alternative therapies such as interventional cardiology or medical treatment, as clinically appropriate. I am pleased to say that this initiative was very successful in reducing the adult waiting list by 203 between September 1997 and December 1997.</P>
      <P>This year, a sum of £3 million is being made available specifically for cardiac surgery patients. As in 1997, the aim will be to reduce the overall numbers waiting for cardiac surgery and it is expected that the successful strategy applied in 1997 will be adopted again.  Final decisions on the allocation of the cardiac initiative funding will be announced shortly and I am confident that this will have a positive impact on both the overall numbers waiting and the average waiting times. However, I am not in a position to be definite about year end fugures, given the difficulty in predicting with accuracy how demand will evolve over the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the development of cardiovascular services generally, the Deputy will be aware that on 29 January 1998 I announced a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease, with a particular emphasis on premature mortality. Included in this was approval for the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, with the capacity to carry out an additional 750 cardiac surgery procedures per annum.  The development of these facilities over the next couple of years should result in a significant reduction in the numbers of patients waiting for cardiac surgery. More importantly, my aim is to ensure that over the next three or four years as a result of this substantial infrastructural development and cardiac <Col N="1663" /> surgery waiting list initiative funding the average waiting time for cardiac surgery will be reduced to six months.</P>
    <P>Finally, having approved these developments in surgical capacity, I propose to address the wider issues surrounding cardiovascular disease, prevention and treatment when I receive the report of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group which I established in March of this year. The group has been asked to report to me by the end of the summer of 1998.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card.  An exception to this is where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.  The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to all persons, parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are <Col N="1664" /> unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <P>National figures in relation to Down's syndrome are not available.  As part of the birth notification system, statistical information is collected on each birth and includes specification of congenital birth defects.  This data cannot, however, be used to provide national incidence figures for birth defects since the information is recorded shortly after the birth and many congenital anomalies, including Down's syndrome, may not be positively identified at this time.</P>
      <P>A European project on congenital defects, EUROCAT, has operated in Ireland since 1979. At present it covers the Eastern Health Board region and Galway county.  However, more comprehensive information should be available in the near future as a EUROCAT register has recently been set up in the Southern Health Board and a similar register is currently being developed in the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The table below sets out the number of Down's syndrome births and rates per 10,000 live and still births for each year from 1980 to 1996 in the Eastern Health Board region and Galway county. <Col N="1673" /><Col N="1674" /></P>

      <P>Information on hospitalisation for fractures is collected through the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system.  This system provides details for each hospital discharge from publicly-funded acute hospitals and in recent years has achieved close to 100 per cent coverage.  Activity in private hospitals is not included in the HIPE system.  In 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 the HIPE returns for the numbers of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis of fracture of the neck of the femur were, respectively, 3,600, 3,597, 3,738, and 3,689. Based on the 1995 figure, the age-standardised hospitalisation rate for this type of fracture is 88 per 100,000 population per year.  The rate for males is 55 per 100,000 population while the female rate is nearly double the male rate at 109 per 100,000 population.</P>

      <P>A direct measure of the incidence of irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, within the community is not available since this condition is not categorised either as a notifiable disease or as part of any formal registration system.  In addition, IBS can be difficult to diagnose with precision and symptoms can range from mild to severe.  To the extent that irritable bowel syndrome may require hospitalisation, information is available through the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system which collects statistics on all patients discharged from publicly-funded acute hospitals.  During the last four years HIPE has achieved close to 100 per cent coverage.  Figures for 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 show, respectively, 1,383, 1,503, 1,521 and 1,527 cases where a principal diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was recorded.</P>

      <P>All health boards recognise the role played by voluntary-private centres in the treatment of persons with alcohol and drug related problems and are continually considering ways in which the services provided by them might integrate with health board community based services in an effective and cost efficient manner.  The Aislinn Centre has been the subject of a number of representations this year and the three health boards, South-Eastern, Midland and Mid-Western, have been consulted regarding their need for in-patient facilities for adolescents with drugs and alcohol problems.</P>
      <P>Following these consultations, agreement has been reached between the South-Eastern Health Board and the trustees of the Aislinn Centre to establish a two year pilot project for a residential treatment centre for adolescents who substance abuse.  This will be included as part of the South-Eastern Health Board's service plan for 1999 and the Department will endeavour to make provision for this as part of the 1999 Estimates requirement.</P>
      <P>The question of capital funding for this project is currently under consideration in the Department and a decision on the matter will be communicated to Aislinn shortly.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 28 May, the provision of family planning services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Accordingly, the allocation of funds to this clinic is a matter for the Southern Health Board.  I have, however, verified with the board that the clinic received an allocation of £6,000 in 1996 and £3,000 in 1997.</P>

      <P>Local authorities carried out an assessment of housing needs and of homelessness at 29 March 1996.  Details of the number of households, including the elderly and the homeless, assessed to be in need of local authority housing and of the number of homeless people, for each local authority, were published in the 1996 Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The next assessment of housing needs and of homelessness will be carried out by local authorities in March 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259, 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the students' summer jobs scheme is to provide income support during the summer holiday period for the less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for participation on the scheme, students must first establish an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance.  To do so, they must be 18 years or older and satisfy a means test.  Accordingly, any student who will not reach the age of 18 years by 31 August this year cannot be admitted.</P>
      <P>The scheme has always been linked to the disqualification for unemployment assistance and this is a fundamental feature of it.  The age limit of 18 is a clearly stated condition of the scheme and students under that age do not generally apply.  To date only 17 applications have been made in respect of students under 18 and these have had to be disallowed.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say what the cost of removing the lower age limit would be.  Such a measure would however change the nature of the scheme and there are no plans for such a change in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at a weekly rate of £65.50 based on a means assessment <Col N="1690" /> of £2.00 per week made in 1983 derived from his intestacy share in the family holding.</P>
      <P>Following a recent review of his entitlement his means from farm income were assessed at £85.00 per week.  On the basis of this means assessment he was not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance and a deciding officer made a decision to that effect.  He appealed the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>The local social welfare inspector reviewed his report in the light of the stated grounds of appeal and reduced the amount of means assessed to £63.00 per week with effect from 11 March 1998 giving entitlement to payment of unemployment assistance of £4.00 per week.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer has decided that the revised assessment is fair and reasonable.  All allowable expenses have been taken into account in the means assessment.  The person's appeal against the reduced rate was disallowed and he is being notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266, 267, 268 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £27.10 on the basis of a means assessment of £47 derived from his spouse's earnings from employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment was terminated following a report by the special investigation unit of the Department <Col N="1691" /> which indicated that the person concerned was employed on the construction of a house and that he is self-employed as a plasterer with income from that source.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing of the person's appeal against the decision terminating his unemployment assistance was heard in Ballina on 14 May 1998.  The person concerned confirmed that he is a plasterer. On the basis of all the available evidence, including that referred to in the Deputy's question and that adduced at the oral hearing, the appeals officer did not consider that the explanations given by the person were credible and he decided that the person had not fully disclosed his means. The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    <P>If the person wishes access to personal information held on him he should contact the local office of the Department.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to deal with the anomaly whereby those people who were paying self-employed PRSI contributions for a period of less than ten years are ruled ineligible for contributory old age pensions with particular reference to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that there are up to 20,000 self-employed people who were over 56 years of age when PRSI was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who are registered for PRSI purposes.  As I indicated during the debate on this year's Social Welfare Bill and in recent replies to parliamentary questions, the net additional cost of paying a full rate old age contributory <Col N="1695" /> pension to all this group would be of the order of £50 million per annum, equivalent to a capitalised cost of some £475 million over the full period of the payments.</P>
      <P>The £50 million estimate is based on the payment of a full rate of pension, and qualified adult allowance where applicable, to this group and takes account of the value of the free schemes.  It is an estimated net cost as it assumes that about half of the group could already be in receipt of another social welfare payment, for example, a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>A <i>pro rata</i> factor has not been included in the £50 million cost estimate.  While such an approach would, of course, reduce the overall cost, it is clear that the cost is still significant and could only be considered in a budgetary context where the proposal would have to be assessed against other competing demands in the social welfare area.</P>
      <P>As I said on a number of occasions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.</P>
      <P>The condition that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age before he or she is eligible to qualify for the old age contributory pension has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of this condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during their careers.</P>
      <P>This ten year condition was supported by the National Pensions Board and it is considered to be a reasonable condition.  The amendment in the Social Welfare Act, 1997, regarding the payment of refund of contributions to this group effectively re-emphasised the position of the ten year test.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that any self-employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension receives a refund of the pension element &mdash; 53 per cent &mdash; of his-her PRSI contributions with interest, which is a fair arrangement.</P>
      <P>I have indicated before but it is important to repeat, a person may be entitled to a non-contributory pension, subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case to which the Deputy refers, the position is that the person's application for an old age contributory pension was refused as the person was over age 56 on entering PRSI. The person's claim for non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test, is currently being investigated.  If the person fails to qualify for a non-contributory pension he-she will be entitled to a refund of the pension portion of their contributions.</P>

      <P>A recent review of his entitlement to disability allowance revealed that his occupational pension had increased to the equivalent of £148 per week. His share of these means is £74.00 a week, which is above the statutory limit of £70.50 a week for receipt of disability allowance.  Payment of disability allowance was, accordingly, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In addition to satisfying a means test, the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance require that an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  Regulations were recently introduced to clarify the circumstances in which a person is, or is not, regarded as being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Comprehensive guidelines on the application of the conditions have issued to all social welfare local offices to assist deciding officers and ensure there is a consistent and uniform application of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The publication of the guidelines will also ensure that members of the public are aware of the steps which need to be taken in order to satisfy the qualifying conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>
      <P>Smallholders on unemployment assistance must fulfil the conditions of being available for and seeking work and are generally able to do so. There are currently some 7,750 smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance under these arrangements.  This number has reduced significantly in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in relation to unemployment payments is to ensure that unemployed people are encouraged to avail of any opportunities to get back to the active labour force.  In <Col N="1697" /> this regard unemployed people are expected to avail themselves of any suitable and reasonable offers of work, training, etc.  In the case of smallholders it is important that every opportunity is taken to maximise farm income and ultimately reduce the dependence on the unemployment assistance scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a variety of schemes of support for farming operated by different Departments and there is an ongoing need for co-ordination between the schemes concerned.  However, the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme continues to have an important role in meeting the basic income maintenance needs of this group and I will be seeking to ensure that it operates in a complementary way with the other supports which are available.</P>
    <P>In this connection I recently announced, with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, improvements in the method of assessing compensation payments under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS), designed to improve take-up under that scheme, especially by smallholders on social assistance payments.  Under the previous arrangements farmers claiming unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age (non-contributory) pension could have the first £2,000 of REPS payments disregarded for means test purposes.  Under the revised arrangements, the first £2,000 continues to be disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent, rather than on a full pound for pound basis as at present. This means, for example, that a farmer who receives a REPS payment of £4,000 will now be £1,000 better off.  This represents a significant improvement in income support for those involved.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep this scheme under review to ensure that it operates in an effective way in meeting the income support needs of this group.</P>

    <P>The new arrangements governing the award of the qualified adult allowance were confined initially to the short-term payments listed above on budgetary grounds.  Consideration will be given to extending the arrangements to cover long-term payments, including old age contributory pension, in the light of the resources availbale and in the light of other priorities.</P>
    <P>While precise statistics are not available on the numbers of recipients of old age contributory pension who would benefit from the extension of the new arrangements to them, the indications are that the costs involved would be relatively low.

      <P>The position in relation to solicitors' fees is that settlements have been agreed with the legal representatives of those married women who instituted legal proceedings. The Department will meet the plaintiffs' legal fees associated with these settlements as adjudicated by the Taxing Master under the normal procedure whereby a solicitor's bill is examined by the Taxing Master who may either allow or reduce the amount involved.  Bills for the legal fees are still awaited from some of the solicitors involved.  The Chief State Solicitor's office has <Col N="1699" /> advised that the costs which solicitors are entitled to recover from my Department are those costs which are known as party and party costs.  The question as to whether the married women concerned may be charged additional fees over and above those to be met by the State will be determined by the nature of whatever agreement they may have entered into with their solicitors. Women who approach my Department regarding such costs are being advised that they can seek to have those costs examined by the Taxing Master also.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from 21 November last, new <i>pro rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age (contributory) pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also requires a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many contributors who for various reasons took time out of the paid workforce.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) pension is that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, which has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  A person who enters social insurance for the first time after age 56 and therefore, cannot qualify for an old age (contributory) pension can get a refund of the pension portion of their contributions provided they do not qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension.  Refunds are not awarded in other circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1997 special provision was made for self employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988 but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee, to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self employed social insurance <Col N="1700" /> provided they do not qualify for an old age (contributory) or (non-contributory) pension. Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>Interest, linked to the consumer price index, is payable on refunds made on or after 1 November 1990.</P>
    <P>Retrospection in relation to homemaker disregards would have significant cost implications and would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>I also wish to point out that any person resident in the State may qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I will have this investigated if he supplies the details.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the person to whom the Deputy refers but it is long standing practice not to comment in detail on the case of an individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception to that practice in this instance.  I can, however, say that a prisoner who is admitted to hospital for an operation, or any other purpose, can only be returned to prison when discharged by the hospital.  Furthermore, there is no question but that any post-operative care, ongoing treatment, or further hospital visits for physiotherapy etc., required, are facilitated by the prison governor in conjunction with the prison doctor acting in consultation with the hospital consultant.  I am satisfied that the prisoner referred to by the Deputy was fully facilitated, by the prison authorities, in relation to the operation in question and that this level of facilitation will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the progress by my Department in implementing the commitments outlined in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium for which my Department has responsibility or is involved, is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Adopt a zero tolerance policy towards crime, including white collar crime</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which commenced Second Stage in the Dáil on 11 June 1998, contains a series of strong anti-crime measures.  The Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill, currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman, will significantly strengthen the law on white collar crime.  Other developments taking place will also contribute to this policy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Increase Garda Strength by 1,200 to reach the full complement of 12,000</i>
      </P>
      <P>The target is to have 12,000 gardaí by 2002; the current strength of the force is now at approximately 11,000.  Due to ongoing wastage, this will require the recruitment of an estimated 2,200 gardaí.  A programme of accelerated recruitment is under way with the aim of meeting this target.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Establish independent Prisons Authority</i>
      </P>
      <P>The General Scheme for a Prisons Service Bill is under preparation, for introduction in 1999.  Proposals are being developed on the role of an interim prisons board, which will be subject to Government approval.  Other essential preparatory work, relating to the human resource function and IT and financial management systems development, is under way to ensure the successful vesting of this body within the organisation change programme of the Department.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Establish independent Parole and Remission Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>Provision for the establishment of an independent parole and remission board will be contained within the Prisons Service Bill currently under preparation, for introduction in 1999.  Proposals for a non-statutory body are being developed, which will be subject to Government approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" />
      <i>Establish Prisons Inspectorate</i>
    </P>
    <P>As with the parole and remission board, provision for the establishment of an independent prisons inspectorate will be contained within the Prisons Service Bill currently under preparation, for introduction in 1999.  Proposals for a non-statutory inspectorate, which will be subject to Government approval are being developed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provide an extra 2,000 prison spaces (1,000 in first two years)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Phase 1: The commitment to provide 1,000 spaces in the first two years of the term of the Government is on course.</P>
    <P>Limerick Prison (60 spaces).  The new wing was brought into use in March 1998 and is fully operational.</P>
    <P>Castlerea (152 spaces).  The new prison became operational in May 1998, and the prisoner population is being built up to full capacity.</P>
    <P>Remand Prison at Cloverhill (400 spaces).  Construction of the prison is under way and is planned for completion in late 1998.</P>
    <P>Women's Prison beside Mountjoy (80 spaces). Construction of the prison is under way and planned for completion at end 1998.</P>
    <P>Portlaoise (400 spaces).  Construction is planned for completion by August 1999.</P>
    <P>On completion of the above building programme in August 1999, a total of 1,092 additional prison spaces will have been created.</P>
    <P>Phase 2: Target &mdash; to provide a further 1,000 prison spaces by mid-2002.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to undertake initial planning for the second-phase spaces in 1998-9.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Establish a custodial detention centre for convicted addicts and remand prisoners who are addicted, with all other prisons to be drug-free</i>
    </P>
    <P>Drug treatment issues are under discussion with the Department of Health and Children and the Eastern Health Board.  The operation of the Mountjoy drug treatment facility and the drug free unit in the training unit is currently under review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Establish independent Courts Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Courts Service Act, 1998, came into effect on 16 April 1998.  The transitional board, whose functions include making the necessary arrangements to establish the service and to appoint a chief executive designate, held its first meeting on 26 May 1998.  The Courts Service is expected to come into operation by December 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Introduce fast track trials for certain serious offences</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, now before the Dáil, abolishes preliminary hearings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" />
      <i>Introduce asset enquiries for certain offences at sentence stage</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, now before the Dáil, provides for automatic asset inquiries where persons are convicted on indictment of drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Put in place a witness protection programme and plea-bargaining</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new witness security programme introduced in late 1997 is designed to operate in cases of serious or organised crime, where a threat to the safety of the witness, his family members or associates is perceived to exist because of evidence that would be given in court.  Funding of £250,000 was provided in the 1998 Estimates for expenditure on the programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to plea bargaining, the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997 underpins the system of plea bargaining.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review right to silence</i>
    </P>
    <P>The right to silence is being reviewed by an expert group established to consider changes in the law recommended in the Garda SMI report.  The report is due by the end June 1998.  Proposals will be addressed in a new Criminal Justice Bill as early as possible in 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contribute to a Cabinet sub-committee co-ordinating a national drugs strategy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in ensuring that all institutions of State are working together in implementing an integrated approach to the drugs problem.  My Department contributes to the development of integrated policies to deal with the problem at national and local level by our representation on the structures which are in place, namely, the Cabinet Committee on Drugs and Social Inclusion, the National Drugs Strategy Policy Group of Assistant Secretaries, the National Drugs Strategy Team, and the local drugs task forces, gardaí and probation and welfare officers.</P>
    <P>Service development plans which give details of the specific projects being implemented by local drugs task forces have been evaluated and approved and £10 million has been allocated to support the implementation of these plans.</P>
    <P>Monitoring the success of the drugs strategy is ongoing.  External evaluators will be engaged shortly to review the effectiveness of the structural arrangements in place and the success or otherwise of initiatives being undertaken, following which recommendations will be made to Government on the future of the drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>Establishment of an advisory/research body to assist the Government in policy formulation is currently being considered.  My Department and the Department of Health and Children have agreed, in principle, a draft policy document on the management of substance misuse within the <Col N="1725" /> prison system.  An operational plan to give effect to the agreed policy is being developed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, £30 million for 1998-2000, an assessment committee under the auspices of the National Drugs Strategy Policy Group has been established to control the operation of the fund and evaluate proposed Integrated Plans.  A sum of £20 million will be allocated to the 13 local drugs task force areas, and £10 million will be allocated to target young people at risk in other areas.  The assessment committee has prepared guidelines to assist with the development of plans. Development groups are being established to prepare integrated plans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Implement zero tolerance towards drug dealers/pushers and ensure that Operation Dóchas is continued and expanded</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, contains strong measures against drug trafficking, including mandatory minimum ten year sentences for possession of drugs to supply with a value of £10,000 or more.  In addition the Bail Act, 1996, will be brought fully into force when the position in relation to prison accommodation allows.</P>
    <P>Considerable success has been achieved in various Garda operations:</P>
    <P>&mdash; Operation Dóchas street value of seizures from October-December 1997 being over £4.75 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Operation Main Street (on-going) seizures to date of £260,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Operation Clean Street commenced in December 1997 in four defined target areas, and 70 &ldquo;on street&rdquo; heroin dealers have been arrested and charged to date.</P>
    <P>In addition, there have been major successes in the seizure of large quantities of illegal drugs from January-mid March 1998, and seizures of cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines with a street value of about £12 million have been made.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, is also effectively targeting drug barons.  Major successes have already been achieved by the CAB in freezing suspect assets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Create Drug Court system to involve court supervised treatment programmes as an alternative to criminal prosecution</i>
    </P>
    <P>This issue has been examined by the working group on a courts commission.  The report will be brought to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provide regional Family Courts</i>
    </P>
    <P>The working group on a courts commission has been asked to examine the issue of Family Law Courts, and a report is expected later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" />
      <i>Introduce policies to address the effect of divorce</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1997, which was enacted on 9 December 1997, develops the law on guardianship, custody and access etc.  The Courts are required to take the child's wishes and interests into account in guardianship proceedings.  The Act provides emphasis on alternative dispute resolution procedures, mediation, counselling and legal agreements, to guardianship, custody and access proceedings and provides, in serious cases, for a system of guardian <i>ad litem</i> and representation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> in family law cases. Provisions in relation to mediation, counselling and guardian <i>ad litem</i> will be the subject of a commencement order as soon as the necessary arrangements which have financial and staffing implications are put in place.  Exchequer funding in 1998 has increased for family mediation from £300,000 to £900,000 and for marriage and child counselling from £900,000 to £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Implement Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Gender Equality Monitoring Committee was established to oversee implementation of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and actions under the platform for action agreed at the Fourth World Conference on Women.  The Committee will publish a third report on the implementation of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women later this year.  Individual Departments are responsible for the implementation of recommendations within their areas of responsibility. Some of the recommendations of the commission have been implemented and work is on-going in respect of others.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provide separate legal representation for victims of rape and sexual abuse</i>
    </P>
    <P>This issue is being addressed in the context of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences, which was published on 26 May, 1998. The closing date for receipt of submissions on the paper is 28 August 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provide treatment programmes for sexual offenders and expand therapeutic treatment programmes for juveniles</i>
    </P>
    <P>A treatment programme is well established in Arbour Hill.  Plans for the introduction of a similar programme at the Curragh Place of Detention are being advanced.  The Probation and Welfare Service has plans to establish a community based programme for convicted sex offenders, with input from other agencies.</P>

    <P>The Children Bill, 1996, is awaiting Committee Stage before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review Supreme Court decision on Employment Equality Bill as it affects people with disabilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 1998.  The work of the Interdepartmental Task Force on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which <i>inter alia</i> is examining the implications of the Supreme Court judgment, is nearing completion.  It will be finalising its report soon for submission to Government shortly thereafter. The task force report will take the form of a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Implement Refugee Act, 1996</i>
    </P>
    <P>An order has been made commencing sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Act, which contain the main administrative process of determination of refugee status, with effect from 29 August 1997. A significant backlog has arisen due to the large numbers of applications being made, and it is considered that the Act needs to be reviewed in the context of the increased number of applications. A comparative study has been commissioned between Irish and EU member states' refugee legislation.  This study should be completed by the end of 1998, and its conclusions will be an important component in the review of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been put in place to process applications.</P>
    <P>&mdash; New interim procedures for processing asylum applications.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Seventy-two extra staff have been assigned to asylum related work.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Three appeals authorities are being appointed to expedite the hearing of appeals.</P>
    <P>Since 5 May 1998, the interviewing of asylum applicants by fully trained staff began in earnest, and approximately 100 interviews are scheduled each week.</P>
    <P>Other developments taking place:</P>
    <P>&mdash; Tenders for the establishment of an independent Refugee Legal Service are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Premises will be ready for occupancy in October to accommodate a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; comprising the Asylum Division of the Department and other relevant agencies.</P>

      <i>Review services to protect children: Court system</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1997, which was enacted on 9 December 1997, provides emphasis on alternative dispute resolution procedures &mdash; mediation, counselling and legal agreements &mdash; to guardianship, custody and access proceedings; updates the law on the giving of evidence in certain civil proceedings by a child; and provides, in serious cases, for a system of guardian <i>ad litem</i> and representation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> in family law cases. The aforementioned provisions will be the subject of a commencement order as soon as the necessary arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, provides that, in cases involving sexual offences and offences involving violence or a threat of violence, witnesses under 17 years of age may give evidence and be cross-examined through a live television link.  The system is currently in operation in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, the Dublin Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court.  The question of the need to provide additional video-link facilities in Dublin and in provincial venues is being examined.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, provides for the admittance in evidence of out of court video recordings of statements by an alleged victim under 14 years of age of a sexual or violent offence.

    <P>
      <i>Implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>An interdepartmental task force was established to draft a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The action plan is expected to be completed shortly and will be submitted to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ensuring that people with disabilities have equal opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of society</i>
    </P>
    <P>In November 1997, the Government announced its intention to establish a national disability authority.  In November 1997, an establishment <Col N="1729" /> group was set up to work on detailed proposals for establishing this authority for submission to Government within six months.  The group has also been planning parameters for a disability support service and the transfer of certain departmental responsibilities for the training and employment of people with disabilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The group is expected to have its proposals ready within the next month.</P>
    <P>When the planned legislative, institutional and service provision improvements for people with disabilities are in place, it will be possible to consider the form which a Disabilities Bill might take and whether it will be necessary to bring forward proposals for a disability equality amendment to the Constitution in preparation for a Disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>Other measures which have been taken include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; establishment of four pilot community services projects funded by my Department</P>
    <P>&mdash; development of cross-departmental working mechanisms to facilitate the effective delivery of services.  The Government announced last October a package of measures with a funding of £4,325,000 to be allocated in 1997</P>
    <P>&mdash; funding by my Department to the Irish Council of People with Disabilities</P>
    <P>&mdash; provisions in the Children Act, 1997, in relation to the giving of evidence by a person with a mental disability.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government's Employment Action Plan which was published in April 1998 specifically targets people with disabilities, and £3.1 million is being made available in 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Creating a new deal for the Travelling Community</i>
    </P>
    <P>In March 1998, I decided to establish a monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community.  The committee will work towards &ldquo;creating a new deal for the traveller community&rdquo;.  The first meeting of the monitoring committee took place on 19 June 1998.  It is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of relevant Government Departments, each of the four pillars of Partnership 2000, traveller organisations and ministerial representatives.</P>
    <P>A progress report on the implementation of the task force report will be submitted to Government in 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The promotion of the status of women at work, on business and at home</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 1998.  The Bill extends the grounds on which discrimination in employment <Col N="1730" /> is outlawed and provides for the establishment of the new equality authority and the office of director of equality investigations.  When this infrastructure is in place, 1998 allocation of £2.1 million, the process of bringing the terms of the Bill into operation will commence.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court of June 1997 that certain sections of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, were repugnant to the Constitution, the advice of the Attorney General was sought as to how the Bill might be amended in such a way as to pass constitutional muster, while preserving its essential features.  The revised legislation will prohibit non-workplace discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. It will apply to non-employment areas such as education, provision of goods and services, and accommodation.  Services will be defined broadly to include facilities for refreshment and entertainment, credit facilities and transport.  It is intended to publish a revised measure later this year.</P>
    <P>On 3 June 1998, the Government approved the Parental Leave Bill, 1998.  The text of the Bill was published on 8 June 1998.  Consideration of the Bill by the Oireachtas commenced on 12 June 1998 and was passed by the Seanad on 16 June 1998.  The Bill is now before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity childcare programme, which was agreed by Government in February 1998, will build on a pilot childcare initiative initiated in 1994 as an equal opportunity measure in order to assist women and men in disadvantaged areas to avail of work, training, and education opportunities.  A sum of £2.6 million was provided in this year's budget for this purpose, which was a substantial increase on the £800,000 provided in previous years.  This programme was included in the National Employment Action Plan which Ireland submitted to the EU in April. Following the Luxembourg Employment Summit, member states undertook to take steps to increase the level of good quality childcare in order to support women's and men's entry and continued participation in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The expert working group on childcare, involving the relevant interests and chaired by my Department, was established in July 1997 to devise a national framework for the development of the childcare sector.  The expert group expects to produce a final report by the end of December 1998.  A first draft report will be developed for discussion by the group in June 1998.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives:</P>
    <P>&mdash; A review of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, intended to ensure that maternity protection measures fit the purposes for which they were designed, will get under way within the next few weeks.  It is intended to consult with Social Partners and other interest groups on the working of the legislation <Col N="1731" /> with a view to assessing its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A survey of equal opportunities in the public sector has been carried out, and it is expected that a report based on this survey will be ready for publication by early 1999.</P>
    <P>&mdash; My Department is developing a strategy to deal with the provision of EU Structural Funds for equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Work on a follow-up study to the ESRI report on male and female wage differentials will commence this month.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Institutional Reform</i>
    </P>
    <P>My Department has actively pursued implementation of the SMI reforms.  In particular it has: supported an unprecedented organisation change programme, spanning the entire Department, Justice system and equality agencies; published a statement of strategy for 1998-2000 and put in place supporting management processes; published a customer service plan setting out standards of service to be observed; and put in place a major development of IT based management systems.</P>

      <P>There are ten places on the Arbour Hill group treatment programme which takes ten to eleven months to complete.  I am keen to increase the number of group treatment places available for sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is actively examining the possibility of locating a further treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  However, as specialised skills and resources are necessary to set up and run such a programme, it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>
      <P>There are currently nine sex offenders participating in the group treatment programme in Arbour Hill.  This group is due to finish the programme in July next.  A further group, the fifth to date, will begin the programme in the autumn. The group treatment programme caters for sentenced sex offenders.  Information in relation to the demand for and participation in the group programme is set out in the following table.</P>

    <P>*to finish July 1998.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to give an accurate indication of the number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill who are awaiting treatment.  An initial application from an offender to participate in the programme tends to reflect a minimum level of interest in treatment with many offenders dropping out at the assessment stage.  Since the group treatment programme commenced in Arbour Hill about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of sex offenders throughout <Col N="1733" /> the entire prison system, 35 to 40 offenders, showed an interest in applying for a place on the programme each year.  Following assessment this number tended to reduce to 20 to 25 offenders. Where more than ten offenders are considered suitable for the programme priority is given to those nearest their release dates with the others being offered a place on subsequent programmes.</P>
    <P>Each year all sex offenders in custody are invited to apply for a place on the group treatment programme in Arbour Hill.  While all sex offenders are encouraged to avail of treatment they are neither compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.  The clinical psychology service and probation and welfare service actively encourage sex offenders to address their needs around their offending behaviour.  Important work in this regard is done in individual sessions by members of both services. An integral part of this work is preparing sex offenders for, and encouraging them to apply for, the sex offender programme at Arbour Hill.</P>
    <P>There are 94 sex offenders in the Curragh place of detention.  There are no therapeutic services available there, at present, but individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service and from the probation and welfare service will be provided at the earliest opportunity. In addition, any prisoner there may apply to participate in the dedicated treatment programme available in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the existence of any data in relation to recidivism among sex offenders in Ireland.  My Department has commissioned the Clinical Psychology Department at University College Dublin to conduct a detailed evaluation of the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill.  This will take a number of years to complete and should eventually provide empirical data that demonstrates the efficacy of treatment, as measured by reduced recidivism amongst treated offenders compared to an untreated control group.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to difficulties experienced by gardaí in Dublin in policing a three ton limit for heavy goods vehicles in residential areas in view of the requirement, in the event of the gardaí needing to verify the weight of these vehicles, to do so within five kilometres of where the vehicles have stopped and yet there are no suitable weighbridges outside the dock area of the city; the proposals, if any, he has to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, apart from the weighbridge situated in Alexandra Road, Irishtown in the Dublin Port Authority area, the following weighbridges are available and authorised for use by the Garda in the Dublin Area: Rathcoole, in the the South Dublin County Council area; Lissenhall, in Fingal County Council area; and Smithfield, in Dublin Corporation area.</P>
      <P>Access to these weighbridges means that gardaí can take prosecutions where offences are detected and evidence of weight is a requirement. Where offences in breach of the weight restrictions are detected appropriate action is taken by the gardaí.</P>

      <P>As a first step in this process, I intend to make an allocation of additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the precise number of posts involved in the near future.  The needs of the schools to which the Deputies refer will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which are undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335 and 337 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  Furthermore, I have already advised the House of my intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants, as soon as possible for students who are registered <Col N="1744" /> on PLC courses as of Steptember, 1998.  Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates. An information leaflet setting out guideline information about the introduction of PLC grants was distributed by my Department in early February.</P>
    <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the development of significant new administrative arrangements.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise, I assure the Deputies that they will be made and they will fully meet our commitments.  I expect to be in a position to announce further details on the administration of the scheme in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are four primary schools in the area of Kerry referred to by the Deputy.  It is accepted by my Department that, due to the poor state of repair of the all-boys school, it has become necessary to replace it.  The existing site is unsuitable for a new modern building because of its size, topography and poor drainage facilities.</P>
      <P>Strenuous efforts were made locally to acquire an alternative suitable site close to the existing school building, but this has not been possible. Twenty two different approaches were made before a site was finally identified.  However, this site is located appromately 1.5 miles distant from the existing boys school and quite close to another primary school in the parish.  The close proximity of the proposed site to the latter school is a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>Officials from the planning section of my Department met with the chairpersons and principals of the four schools on 11 June last to discuss the issues involved.  It was agreed that the boards of management and parents of the respective schools would be consulted locally on the possibility of providing one central school on the proposed new site.  The results of these consultations are awaited before proceeding any further in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A summary of the material requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Learning should be lifelong, and our educational system must respond accordingly.&rdquo;</i> The Department of Education and Science has in place a wide range of education initiatives ranging from pre-school to third level and adult education.  As regards adult education £2.7 million will be provided in 1998 and 1999 for childcare services for the youthreach and VTOS schemes; adult literacy provision has been raised by £2 million for 1998, bringing it to over £4 million; grants totalling £600,000 will be awarded to women's voluntary education groups in 1998 and 1999; annual grants &mdash; £309,000 in 1997, £500,000 in 1998 &mdash; are given to five adult education organisations to assist them in administering schemes, for example, <Col N="1747" /> literacy schemes; Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has established a committee to consider the establishment of an Adult Education Bank which will deal with lifelong learning-skill enhancement and a Green Paper on adult education is being prepared.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government will focus on people's needs and parental choice rather than on bureaucratic or administrative structures.&rdquo;</i> The Education (No. 2) Bill, which is currently being discussed in the Dáil, does not contain provision for an intermediate education structure in the form of education boards.  The priority is to channel such resources as are available for education directly into the schools and other education institutions. This will avoid the expenditure of up to £40 million on regional boards.  With regard to &ldquo;the provision of a specific budget for pre-school education&rdquo;, a consultative national forum on early childhood education was held in March 1998.  A report on the proceedings of the forum will be published shortly and a White Paper will be developed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;To give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources, including the provision of remedial teachers and resources for special learning difficulties; one teacher schools with ten pupils or over to receive a second teacher, and renewal of substandard accommodation.&rdquo;</i> The 1998 Estimates provide for a 9 per cent increase in resources for primary education and for a £5 increase in capitation payments.  This represents an increase of 11 per cent on the last Government's 1997 allocation.  All two-teacher schools which, as a result of falling enrolments, were due to lose a teacher and become one-teacher schools with effect from September 1997 &mdash; 24 schools &mdash; have been permitted to retain their second teacher.  The remaining schools will be addressed in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. In addition, a number of proposals are under consideration to alleviate the current problems of teacher shortages at primary level.</P>
    <P>I will shortly announce the allocation of additional remedial and resource teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To achieve computer literacy throughout the schools system.&rdquo; The Schools IT 2000 project involves a State investment of £40 million, as well as some industry investment.  The national centre for technology in education has been established to implement the various elements of IT 2000 and a national seminar has been held to inform the partners of progress in the area.  This programme is already having a major impact.  All schools will be on the Internet in September and 8,000 will receive IT training this year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognition of the role of parents as the first teachers of their children by ensuring their role <Col N="1748" /> at all levels of school management and also by the introduction of the parents as first teachers programme.  Under PAFT, first time parents from deprived areas are visited by a trained educator/health visitor from the pre-natal stage until the child is three year of age.&rdquo; The Education Bill strengthens the position of parents within the education system by, for example, providing a statutory basis for the role of parents on boards of management and by providing a channel for appeals by students and their parents.  It is hoped, resources permitting, to expand the home/school liaison scheme.  The PAFT proposal is being considered by the early education forum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Appointment of a high-powered group to examine the points system and provide a wider choice of curriculum for smaller schools.&rdquo; The work of the commission on the points system is well under way.  It is planned that the commission will publish a consultative document in early September 1998 and will hold public seminars later in the month.  The aim is for a final report in spring 1999.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;More resources to youthreach and a targeted programme developed to meet the needs of the 20,000 young people who do not complete the second level cycle.&rdquo; The following initiatives have been put in place.  At present there are 3,975 participant places on the youthreach programme in FÁS and VEC centres and 550 places in senior traveller training centres.  A further expansion of 2,240 places is under way which will bring the total to 6,765.  A wider range of curricula is provided at second level; it is projected that 40,000 students will take the leaving certificate vocational programme in 1999/2000, as compared with 23,000 at present and that 10,000 students will take the leaving certificated applied in 1999/2000, as compared with 7,000 at present.  A sum of £2.96 million has been provided over 1998 and 1999 for a new initiative which will target early school leavers, both potential and actual, aged between eight and 15 years.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To set up a national psychological service to address learning difficulties.&rdquo; A planning group was established in September 1997 to prepare proposals and make recommendations in this regard.  This group is finalising its report.  Fifteen psychologists have recently been appointed to assist primary schools.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Renewed respect for the principle of academic freedom and autonomy at third level.&rdquo; Legislation is currently in preparation for the third level technological sector which will allow some institutions to award their own qualifications within a national framework.  The principle has been observed on dealings with institutions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Equitable support of students attending PLC courses.&rdquo; PLC maintenance grants will be effective from September 1998.  In addition, PLC <Col N="1749" /> places have been expanded and the first capital budget for PLCs has been put in place.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increased support for post-graduate research.&rdquo; In the 1998 Estimates, the Government provided an additional £5 million for current spending on research and development.  Of the Scientific and Technology Education (Investment) Fund, approximately £15 million has been allocated for capital expenditure on research and development and £30 million to support a comprehensive programme of equipment renewal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are committed to the development of an STI infrastructure capable of supporting the researchers, technicians and innovators needed to underpin the competitiveness of Irish firms in the dynamic global environment of the new millennium.&rdquo; As mentioned above, in the 1998 Estimates, the Government provided an additional £5 milion for current spending on research and development.  Of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund approximately £15 million has been allocated for capital expenditure on research and development and £30 million to support a programme of equipment renewal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increase the throughput of computer and electronic graduates through our colleges and universities to keep pace with demand and ensure that Ireland will continue to be attractive as a base for such industries.&rdquo; The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund has been provided for in legislation.  The legislation provides that £100 million will be paid into the fund in 1998 with further sums totalling £150 million to be paid in 1999 and 2000.  The funding is in addition to annual capital allocations and does not replace or reduce existing investment.  The new mechanisms announced by the Government in November 1997 are now in place and the partnership forum, chaired by the Minister for Education and Science and by the Tánaiste, met on 18 June 1998.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Establish immediately a national committee to undertake a complete study on Irish language teaching methods.&rdquo; A committee is included in the Education Bill currently before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Modify school curriculum to emphasise cultural and artistic activities.&rdquo; The new primary curriculum will emphasise cultural and artistic activities. This principle is also embodied in the new senior cycle English programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 348 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of children awaiting placement across the special schools system and the waiting periods involved are not readily available to my Department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that placement difficulties do arise from time to time in relation to special needs children. In such cases, my Department makes every effort to arrange a suitable placement as speedily as possible.  In most cases, this can be achieved through the establishment of additional special classes dedicated to the particular special need involved.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared on an ongoing basis to facilitate the expansion of provision within the special school system or by way of special classes attached to ordinary primary schools, in any situation where suitable assessment reports confirm the need for such provision. In such situations, my Department works with the boards of management of the schools in question to put the necessary services in place.</P>
      <P>Of the six schools mentioned in Parliamentary Question No. 119 of 25 March, 1998 only one school currently has a waiting list of children seeking placement in the school.  In that particular case, my Department is currently involved in planning for an extension to the school to accommodate additional children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this academic year.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, examinations and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures. Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution would provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards examinations-registration and towards student services on an annual basis. <Col N="1753" /> I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.  I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>My Department recently issued Circular 19/98 which details the new arrangements concerning the employment of teachers in special schools and special classes attached to ordinary national schools.  Under these new provisions, teachers who have trained outside the State and who wish to teach in the following categories of school will no longer be required to possess an Irish language qualification and will be granted restricted recognition: schools and classes for pupils with a severe and profound mental handicap; schools and classes for pupils with a mild mental handicap; schools and classes for pupils with a moderate mental handicap; schools and classes for pupils with a hearing impairment; schools and classes for pupils with an emotional or severe emotional disturbance; schools and classes for pupils with multiple disability; classes for children with specific speech and language disorders.</P>
      <P>Such teachers must have a general primary teacher qualification recognised by my Department and must also possess (a) a recognised post-graduate qualification in a particular aspect of special education relevant to the particular type of special school or special class; or (b) completed a basic primary teaching training course which incorporated substantial modules on special education and supervised teaching practice in special schools or classes; or (c) a minimum of three years' satisfactory teaching experience in special schools or classes.</P>
      <P>Teachers with restricted recognition who teach in special schools or in special classes in ordinary schools as specified above in either a temporary or permanent capacity will be admitted to the superannuation scheme and will be paid salary by reference to the incremental salary scale.  This new category of teachers with restricted recognition will apply retrospectively from 1 September 1997.  All individuals wishing to avail of special recognition should make their request in writing to the primary administration section of my Department in Athlone.</P>
      <P>My Department has not to date received a written request for restricted recognition from the person to whom the Deputy refers.  On receipt of such a request my Department will process the matter promptly.</P>

The overall level of resources made available for the provision of youth work services in 1998 is £13,567,000 which represents an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision for 1997.  Unfortunately, due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible in the current year to provide for increases in the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives. However, additional funding for 1998 is being sought and in the event of such funding becoming available the level of funding support to youth organisations generally will be reviewed.</P>
