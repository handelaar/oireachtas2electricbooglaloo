      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Expressions of sympathy on the death of Mr. Frank Taylor shall be taken now and the Order of Business proposals shall be taken after the completion of the expressions of sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to start by saying publicly in the House to the Taylor family that we share their deep sense of loss.  No one will feel this loss more deeply than his widow, Ann Rita, and his daughters Madeleine, Ann, Rosemary and Deirdre, his sons-in-law and grandchildren.</P>
      <P>Frank Taylor was a man for all the people.  He made no distinction between people on the basis of party affiliation or status.  He helped everyone he could help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frank Taylor was also a very modern politician. Modern politics requires, above all, the skill of conciliation.  Frank was a politician whose conciliatory skills were immense.  He was a man who sought peace and consensus in all the fora in which he served.  He even sought to bring consensus and power-sharing to Clare County Council, <Col N="2" /> a place where party passions sometimes run high and where power-sharing is not the norm.</P>
    <P>I remember when Frank Taylor and I were first elected to the Dáil in 1969.  There were many arguments within the Fine Gael Party at that time and contrary positions were frequently advocated at our meetings.  Frank always sought to find agreement and consensus within the party.</P>
    <P>Frank Taylor was a very loyal man.  He defended the decisions of his party, even where he might personally have not agreed with every detail.  Above all, Frank was a patriotic Irishman. His patriotism is best exemplified in his service in the FCA.  He joined it when it was known as the LDF in 1940.  While most people who joined the LDF at that time gave up their membership at the end of the war, Frank Taylor continued in the FCA, rising to the rank of commandant, until 1969.  As somebody who also served in the FCA, I remember talking to him about this shortly after he was elected to the Dáil.  One of the hardest things for Frank Taylor about being elected to the Dáil was that it required him to give up his membership of the FCA.  Frank had a deep respect for the nation's armed services, the Army, the FCA, the Naval service and the Air Corps. He recognised them as the final defence of our <Col N="3" /> democracy.  The tricolour and his military cap and gloves on his coffin at the funeral in Kilkee exemplified the patriotism of Frank Taylor.  So also did the exemplary presence there of a colour party from the FCA.</P>
    <P>Frank Taylor was proud of his native county of Clare and proud of his roots in the soil.  He wore the Clare jersey with pride as a minor footballer. He became the first chairman of Macra na Feirme in Clare.  He was a founder member of Macra na Feirme nationally.  We should not forget what we owe to him and all the other people who founded Macra na Feirme in the dark days for farming in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, for it was from Macra na Feirme that so much else grew &mdash; the IFA, the ICMSA, FBD, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, are all entities that came into being directly as a result of the foresight of the founders of Macra na Feirme like Frank Taylor.</P>
    <P>Frank first stood for elective office in 1950 as a Clann na Talúin candidate for Clare County Council.  He was narrowly defeated.  He returned to the fray in 1955 and was elected to Clare County Council as a Fine Gael member and held his seat there until he retired.  He was elected to the Dáil in 1969.  All of us who served in the Dáil with Frank will have different memories and stories about him.  My abiding memory of Frank is of his sense of humour of the leg-pulling variety. No matter how serious or difficult the circumstances, Frank Taylor cheered people up.  He had a twinkle in his eye and a natural charm that overcame many difficult political challenges and awkward personal situations.</P>
    <P>Although he enjoyed the hard and demanding work that is part of politics, Frank Taylor's priority was always his family.  He believed in the maxim that politics is not just about how much you know, it is much more about how much you care.  He was very proud of the fact that his daughters all followed him into professions that involved caring for people, Madeleine in particular, who went into politics, and they carry his values forward today in their lives.  All express in different ways the value of care for others that epitomised the life of the late Frank Taylor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the expression of sympathy on the death of Mr. Frank Taylor, a former distinguished Member of this House.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      <P>Frank Taylor was in the Dáil when I was first elected and I remember him well for the reasons Deputy John Bruton has mentioned.  He was a character who would always exchange banter in a friendly way.  On my way to my office we would exchange light hearted comments about whatever was going on in the House.  He never took matters to heart and at the end of the Order of Business or Question Time he would have a few jokes about what had happened.  I met him on a number of occasions when he visited the House after his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He gave excellent service in the Dáil for the Clare constituency from 1969 until his retirement in 1981.  He was succeeded in the Dáil by his <Col N="4" /> daughter, Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn, who continues to serve in the Oireachtas.  During his career he made a valuable contribution on farming issues.  His membership of the IFA, the ICMSA and being a founder member of Macra an Feirme were testament to his lasting commitment to the agricultural community.  He was a farmer by profession.</P>
    <P>He served in the FCA for a long period.  He had a great attachment to that organisation and I recall that he regularly spoke in the House on defence issues.  He loved sport and, unusually for his time, played Gaelic football and rugby with his home clubs.  I am not sure how he managed that in those days but he got around the ban somehow.  He served his constituents well at national and local level, serving on Clare County Council for several decades, where his focus was on agriculture, tourism, schools and the general development of the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>Those who remember Frank Taylor will remember him above all as a gentleman and an astute politician who exerted a calming and conciliatory influence on those with whom he had dealings.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil party I offer my deepest condolences to his widow Anne Rita and his daughters, Senator Madeleine, whom we all know and respect, Anne, Rosemary and Deirdre, to his extended family and his colleagues in the Fine Gael party.  Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I express my condolences to the Taylor family on the death of Frank Taylor and to Fine Gael, which has lost a person who made a major contribution to the work of that party over many years, a contribution which is being continued by his daughter Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn.</P>
      <P>The contribution that Frank Taylor made to civic society over many years in so many organisations is a reminder of a generation of people which saw that their contribution to life was as much about making a contribution to the consolidation of civic society as looking after their immediate family interests.  Deputies are aware of the difficulty parties have in convincing people to make a contribution to civic society, in whatever form they chose to make it.  There is a lesson to be learned.  It will be noted from reports of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development or from the Taoiseach's report on the ASEM meeting that many of the problems which other societies face in coming to terms with the modernisation of the global economy relate to the fact that too few people are prepared to give their time to civic society in the many organisations that comprise a modern democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without organisations such as Macra na Feirme, trade unions, credit unions or residents' associations and without the people who make such organisations work our type of society would not work.  We pay tribute to the memory and contribution of Frank Taylor and in doing so we salute a kind of service which we cannot presume will continue into the future with the same degree of dedication and lack of self interest which <Col N="5" /> characterised him and his generation.  I extend sympathy to his family.</P>

      <P>Thar ceann mo pháirtí ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a chur in iúl do chlann Phroinsias Uí Tháiliúir as ucht an chailliúint mhóir an tseachtain seo.  Bhí aithne agam ar Frank nuair a bhí sé ina Bhall den Teach seo.  Fear an-lách, anchineálta, stuama a bhí ann agus a thug sársheirbhís do mhuintir na hÉireann, go háitiúil ar an chomhairle chontae agus go háirithe sa Teach seo, áit ina raibh sé mar Bhall de Dháilcheantar Chontae an Chláir ar feadh cuid mhaith blianta. I knew Frank Taylor for many years and shared a great passionate interest with him in a number of matters, particularly the development of the FCA, an organisation to which he gave loyal service having joined it in 1940.  It awarded him its highest rank &mdash; commandant &mdash; which was a source of great pride to him.  He was a man rooted in the soil who had great wisdom.  He did not participate in conflict politics but was always willing to see the other point of view and act as mediator.</P>
      <P>I remember many happy days with Frank and I extend my sympathy to his family, particularly Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join in expressing sympathy on the death of Frank Taylor.  I did not know him personally but before I become active in politics I had heard of him and I knew of the high regard in which he was held in County Clare.  Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh lena chlann, go háirithe len ár gcomhleacaí, an Seanadóir Madeleine Taylor-Quinn agus le Fine Gael.</P>

I have the honour to know his daughter Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn but I did not know Frank Taylor.  I am impressed greatly by the tributes paid to him by those who knew him and I am sorry I did not know him.  I applaud his sense of public service and his commitment to County Clare over many years.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the report will be presented to the Minister at the weekend, Saturday is the latest date I have heard.  The Government will have an opportunity to have an initial look at the report at our meeting next week.  We may make a decision at that stage.  I am not against holding a debate on the matter, but I would like to see the report before making a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked that the Bill be speeded up.  I understand it was not supposed to be ready until some time next year.  I have asked that the date be brought forward because, as I said prior to Easter, it is an important issue.  I hope the date for its publication can be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation received the report of the inquiry into the incidence of sex abuse in swimming?  If so, will he publish the report in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Murphy has asked for a further two weeks to complete the report.  I understand he wishes to deal with matters of legal clarification.  I understand the report has been completed and it will take him two weeks to get that legal clarification.  He will present the report to the Minister in about two weeks' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government intends to publish the Bacon report on housing today and to announce what it proposes to do regarding the crisis in house prices.  When will Members be supplied with copies of the report <Col N="7" /> and the Government's announcement?  At the very least, will Opposition spokespersons be provided with the information before it is circulated to the media so we they can make an informed comment when it is released?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a press conference has been arranged for 11.30 a.m., which is 35 minutes from now.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House if legislative or statutory instrument changes need to be carried out by the Government? The Government made the decisions on Monday or Tuesday and it would be courteous to inform the House on the matter before the media is informed in 35 minutes' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister of the Environment and Local Government that the report will be in the pigeon holes in about half an hour's time.  The proposals will require legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of important principle. If there are to be legislative announcements or changes in legislation by way of statutory instrument, will the Taoiseach inform the House now rather than inform journalists outside the house in a half an hour?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are precedents for the Taoiseach being coy in his answers about the Bacon report, but the Minister for Finance has announced outside the House that stamp duty for first time buyers is to be abolished, as Fine Gael has been advocating.  It does not make much sense that the Taoiseach cannot say this in the House and is clothing himself in procedural discretion.  It makes the place look a little silly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the second Asia Europe summit which took place in London from 2 &mdash; 4 April and was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, who has responsibility for international trade.  The summit came at a significant time for Asia and Asian-European relations.  While it was a planned part of the ASEM process begun in Bangkok in 1996, its occurrence at this time when many of the Asian participant countries are in deep financial and economic crisis, served to heighten its importance and focus its deliberations.  Of course, it also took place at a significant time for Anglo-lrish relations and provided opportunities to progress some of the outstanding issues which led to the final Agreement with regard to Northern Ireland. The financial crisis in south east Asia, its impact on the economies of the region and on the global economy and prospects for growth, dominated the discussions of the Heads of State and Government. This was true of the formal closed sessions, bilateral meetings and informal discussions which took place.</P>
      <P>However, it was not just economics that leaders focused on, but the impact on people.  Issues, such as employment and migrant workers and access to education and health care were also considered. The chairman sought to ensure the three pillars of the ASEM process, economic, political and other areas, were each dealt with appropriately. I have been seriously concerned at the effects of the financial crisis in Asia, especially on those who are poor, and we are determined to assist in so far as we can to help restore economic stability throughout the region.</P>
      <P>One of the three plenary sessions was devoted to discussion of regional political issues: two Asian, the Korean peninsula and Cambodia, and two European, Bosnia/Kosovo and EU enlargement. Over dinner the Foreign Ministers discussed Cambodia, European security architecture, EU-ASEAN relations and Burma &mdash; Myanmar.  I welcome the notable progress which has been made in the two years since the Bangkok summit in discussions on regional and international political and security issues of common concern.</P>
      <P>The political dialogue is guided by principles included in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the Bangkok chairman's statement.  These include the promotion of human rights and commitment to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the fiftieth anniversary of which we celebrate this year. In the drafting of the chairman's statement for this meeting, Ireland insisted on maintaining the reference to these paragraphs.  Overall, the ASEM discussions are well reflected in each of the statements, the statement on the financial and economic situation in Asia and the chairman's statement, which were agreed by the leaders. Both documents have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> Perhaps one of the most important facts about the recovery measures put in place to assist Asian countries is that 29 per cent of the overall funding for such measures is provided by the European Commission and its member states.  This very significant practical assistance needs to be highlighted for two reasons.  First, to make it clear that the EU is concerned at the impact of the crisis at both a regional and global level, and that Europe is responding generously.  The decision to issue a stand alone financial statement, distinct from the chairman's statement, rightly signals the seriousness with which the Asian crisis is viewed by European leaders.  Second, the statement reinforces the role of the IMF at the centre of the global response to the crisis.  The EU is confident that recovery can be achieved in the short to medium term, in many circumstances.  It is critical that the resources made available to the worst affected countries are used to support appropriate economic restructuring.</P>
    <P>Already a number of the Asian countries have adopted measures which have restored some level of confidence in their economies.  In contrast, those countries who have delayed taking corrective action have failed to halt the downwards spiral of their economies.  It was essential that ASEM leaders and, in particular, the European members, were seen to be fully supportive of the restructuring programmes advocated by the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</P>
    <P>At a practical level, the ASEM leaders welcomed the creation of the ASEM Trust Fund, at the World Bank, and the Financial Crisis Expertise Network &mdash; both of these initiatives will enable the provision of economic and financial advisers and experts to the relevant Asian Governments.  Such practical assistance, combined with a positive approach by international banks in the restructuring of the debt and the provision of trade credit, will help restore the conditions necessary for resumed and accelerated economic growth.  Only an integrated package of national action, intergovernmental assistance and private sector co-operation will be effective in stabilising and restoring the damaged economies.</P>
    <P>Early recovery is possible given the sound fundamentals of many of the economies concerned. While confident of recovery, EU leaders do not seek to minimise the hard domestic choices which Asian governments will face.  Strong government leadership in the adoption of reform measures, with international assistance, will help to restore the essential climate of investor confidence. Clearly, ensuring accountability and transparency in financial markets represents a difficult but vital condition of recovery and investor confidence. There was a frank recognition, both among the individual leaders to whom I spoke and in the context of the formal closed sessions, of the poor regulatory systems, bad investment analysis and, in some instances, corruption, which had contributed to the crisis.  Equally, there was much resentment at the role played by international currency <Col N="14" /> traders and speculators and a call, especially from some of the Asian leaders, for improved regulation of such activity.  From an Irish standpoint, I was pleased that the need to resist protectionist measures was recognised and that a positive attitude was adopted towards future WTO negotiations.</P>
    <P>The adoption by ASEM leaders of action plans on trade facilitation and on investment promotion served to underline the ongoing commitment of ASEM participant countries to further open up trading and investment opportunities. The Business Forum which took place in tandem with the Summit provided a useful impetus to the development of inter-regional trade.  There was agreement between the leaders that high-level business missions would examine opportunities in Asian economies for European investment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the forward looking approach of the chairman's statement.  It confirms that the next meeting will take place in Seoul, in the Republic of Korea, in the year 2000 and records the mechanisms put in place by the leaders in preparation for same and for the development and deepening of Asia-Europe relations in the interim.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the ASEM Trust Fund, the Expertise Network and the trade and investment action plans, but a much wider range of issues was examined by the leaders.  Many of these topics are of interest to Ireland and have been raised with me by Deputies.  These include international arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The important issues of child welfare and the fight against the commercial and sexual exploitation of children were raised, together with the combating of international crime in areas such as drug trafficking and money laundering.  All these are areas where international co-operation can have a significant beneficial impact.</P>
    <P>The wide area of social and cultural co-operation discussed by leaders included also the promotion of co-operation on information and communications technology.  This is of particular interest to Ireland and to myself, given my responsibility for the Information Society Commission. I believe there are many areas of opportunity for co-operative and complementary relations to develop between Irish and Asian companies, exploiting differing time zones, skills and market expertise &mdash; and this was a theme of many of the discussions which I had with individual Asian leaders.</P>
    <P>The diverse range of financial, economic, political, technological, social, educational and cultural relationships which link Europe and Asia in the ASEM process will be progressed in the context of the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework which the leaders endorsed.  The framework which sets out agreed short-term priorities will allow for the development of the initiatives I have outlined and others mentioned in the chairman's statement.  As for the longer term, the vision group which was formally launched by the leaders will chart the future development of the ASEM <Col N="15" /> process itself.  There are so many areas of potential mutual benefit that it is necessary for a structured approach to be adopted to the development of the process.  Deputy Albert Reynolds represents Ireland on the vision group and I am confident that the group will develop the requisite strategic plan to guide ASEM in the early years of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In the context of longer-term consideration and in the context of discussions on political dialogue generally, it is worth noting that the EU enlargement process which is now firmly under way was of particular interest to Asian leaders.  Clearly, the issue of ASEM membership arises on both the European and Asian sides, because, as both EU and ASEAN membership grows over the coming years, there are obvious implications for ASEM.  Asian concerns over membership reflected deeper concerns that EU enlargement, completion of the Single Market and the introduction of the Euro would promote a more introverted European Union.  With my European counterparts, I indicated clearly my belief that the reverse would be the case.  A strong and stable Union with a stable currency would be seeking to open further Asia-Europe opportunities for trade and investment.</P>
    <P>While I believe there will be little progress on the ASEM enlargement issue in advance of the Seoul Summit in the year 2000, a generally balanced and inclusive approach should be adopted. There was little discussion at the meeting which decided that consideration should continue on the timing and modality of membership.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with all the Asian leaders at ASEM.  I also had a number of very worthwhile formal bilateral meetings in London, in addition to those with Prime Minister Blair which related to Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, deputising for Minister Andrews, also met the Thai and Indonesian Foreign Ministers. Details of these meetings will be addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity to seek the support of individual ASEM leaders for Ireland's candidature for one of the non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council in the elections in the year 2000.  I also raised this issue with each of the leaders with whom I had formal bilateral meetings.</P>
    <P>I had bilateral meetings with the Chinese, Malaysian and Singaporean leaders.  I thanked Premier Zhu Ronji of China for the early opportunity to meet him so soon after his recent appointment.  I indicated my appreciation of the major economic and social reform programme which he has set out.  Premier Zhu expressed his satisfaction with improving Sino-lrish relations and noted the recent successful visits by Foreign Minister Andrews and Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to China.  I accepted Premier Zhu's invitation to visit China and invited him to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> I indicated Ireland's desire to improve trade relations and suggested there was substantial experience of industry restructuring to be found among major Irish companies, especially in the agri-food sector and, given the restructuring and privatisation of State companies planned in China, that Irish public and private sector companies might have a useful contribution to make.</P>
    <P>I noted the planned visit by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, to China in September and the improving openness in China in this regard.  Deputies will wish to know that the first EU-China Summit took place in London immediately prior to ASEM.  It included substantial discussions on human rights.</P>
    <P>Discussions with Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia centred on the financial crisis in Asia and the impact on Malaysia and neighbouring states, especially Indonesia.  I indicated support for the financial statement agreed by ASEM leaders and the specific measures it contained to assist the worst affected countries.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Mahathir outlined the difficulties which devaluation of the currency had produced in terms of Malaysia's ability to import or secure credit.  The cumulative effect of these problems would slow recovery and the rate at which Malaysia would approach Western standards of living.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Mahathir raised the issue of speculators and the need to regulate their activities, especially to protect developing economies. The Prime Minister also highlighted the issue of Indonesian refugees and the problems they presented for Malaysia.</P>
    <P>Another specific problem which Prime Minister Mahathir raised was that of overseas students and in this regard he thanked me for the efforts of the Irish universities who were seeking to alleviate the problems for the 700 approximately, mostly medical, students, from Malaysia who are studying in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to the financial crisis, I discussed with Prime Minister Goh of Singapore the future of ASEM and the question of enlargement to include both European and Asian members.</P>
    <P>I also raised the issue of bilateral trade relations and suggested information and communications technology and financial services as areas where time zone differences could allow for investment, joint venture and other co-operative activities.</P>
    <P>Singapore has a large volume of overseas investment and I highlighted Ireland's excellent reputation as an investment location, especially, regarding software and total US investment into Europe.</P>
    <P>In my meeting with Prime Minister Dehaene of Belgium and Prime Minister Guterres of Portugal, I raised the general issue of Agenda 2000 and the recent, 18 March, proposals published by the Commission.  I indicated the need for appropriate transitional arrangements for Ireland in relation to Structural Funds, the importance of continuing <Col N="17" /> eligibility for Ireland for Cohesion Funds and the particularly unacceptable nature of the Commission's proposals for CAP reform.  I stressed that any changes must not impact disproportionately on any member states, and that was the case with the draft agriculture regulations of 18 March.</P>
    <P>We noted that negotiations on the next round would be likely to continue for a year at least before any deal would emerge.  Both leaders accepted the case for a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; for Ireland and other regions set to lose Objective I status and noted that Ireland had made good use of EU funding.</P>
    <P>I also briefed both Prime Ministers on the Northern Ireland peace process indicating the substantial progress that was being made by both Governments at that time.  In relation to East Timor, I raised with Prime Minister Guterres Ireland's concerns and indicated that these had been conveyed directly to the Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.</P>
    <P>I thanked Prime Minister Blair for his skilful chairmanship of a successful summit in tandem with intensive negotiations on Northern Ireland. Overwhelming goodwill was conveyed to me by all the ASEM leaders in relation to the Northern Ireland peace process.  I am confident that the good trade and cultural relations with Asian countries which Ireland enjoys can be further improved on foot of the useful meetings and contacts I had in London.  Ireland will play its part in developing the many initiatives adopted in London and in this way and through participation in the vision group, assist in the preparation for the Seoul summit in 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of attending the first ASEM summit in Bangkok.  I imagine the atmosphere at the summit attended by the Taoiseach was very different.  At the time I attended the summit in Bangkok, there was a sense of economic invincibility in East Asia.  Everything seemed to be going very well and the participants were talking about major infrastructural projects &mdash; an information superhighway in Malaysia and Singapore and a rail and transport network in that area.  The European participants in the talks were vying to get the contracts.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the atmosphere at the London summit was very different because things have changed in East Asia.  It is worth reflecting on why this happened and whether there are any lessons which Ireland can learn from the truly disastrous situation which is now unfolding in East Asia.  I use the words &ldquo;truly disastrous&rdquo; in a serious way and in real terms because we are talking about human tragedy.  Virtually every business in Indonesia is technically, though not legally, bankrupt.  There is no legal system of bankruptcy in these countries so there is no way of handling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bankruptcy has enormous human consequences. The problem involves the private, not <Col N="18" /> sovereign, debt of individual companies who borrowed large amounts of foreign currency which has now increased hugely in value in comparison to their own currencies which have fallen through the floor.  The entire business infrastructure of some of these countries is bankrupt.</P>
    <P>This happened because they pegged their currencies to the dollar.  For purely domestic reasons, the US federal reserve kept the dollar interest rate low.  A huge amount of money was sloshing around in the dollar financial system which was pressed into the hands of foolish South East Asian investors who could see no risk involved because their currency was pegged to the dollar.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when there was an initial loss of confidence, the truth underlying the situation was exposed.  The stocks and properties in most of these South East Asian economies were grossly overvalued relative to their earning capacity.  The price-earnings ratios on the Japanese and other East Asian stockmarkets were completely wrong and had been for years.  The price-earnings ratios were driven further out of line with reality by the freely available dollars which were pushed into their hands to put up prices even further.  When things first went wrong in Thailand, there was a loss of confidence in other countries and people started examining the unsustainable price-earnings ratios.  The result was collapse and disaster, which could have serious political consequences for peace in East Asia.</P>
    <P>What are the lessons for Ireland in this?  The lesson is that if a country pegs it economy to a currency, it must also peg its economic and social policy to that of the people managing the currency. The Asian countries pegged their economic and social policy and currency to the US. However, the US had different needs and was at a different stage of development from the Asian countries.  The US is a mature economy, they were emerging economies.  The financial policy of the federal reserve was inappropriate to the needs of developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  It does not have a legal infrastructure to underpin it.  Banks, as they always do, continued lending money and took no responsibility for whether the loans were sustainable in real terms.  As long as they appeared to be sustainable in currency terms, banks continued lending money.  The bank that did not lend it was criticised by its shareholders because it was not performing well in comparison with others. We must be sure that the currency policy pursued in EMU suits Ireland.  At least we will have a say through the European system of central banks. The Asians had no say in the policy of the federal reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot escape from the reality of price-earnings ratios.  One cannot go on investing because property values are going up and one assumes they will always go up.  Therefore, if one <Col N="19" /> buys now, no matter how unreal the purchase is in terms of what one can earn in income, one buys it on the basis that in six months' time it can be sold for a higher price.  That is a madness which, to their cost, infatuated most of the business people in East Asia.</P>
    <P>This has serious consequences for peace because of its effect in Indonesia, which has a huge Chinese minority.  Whenever things go badly, the Chinese are killed because they are rich and the scapegoats.  There is a worry that there will be anti-Chinese feeling in South East Asia and that the Chinese diaspora there will become scapegoats for the frustrations felt by others.  China is a big power and will not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>I note the ASEM did not discuss the big arms race in East Asia.  An enormous amount of money is spent on arms and I would have thought that any realistic discussion at ASEM would have encompassed the arms race.  Why are they buying these arms?  There must be a sense of insecurity.</P>

East Asia is a potential powder keg, for economic reasons, because of the tensions <i>vis-a -vis</i> the Chinese diaspora but also because there is a huge amount of unresolved territorial issues in East Asia, particularly affecting the continental shelf between Vietnam and China, and Indonesia and Malaysia. Those issues were not discussed because it would not be polite.  Politeness is given a high value in East Asia.  However, politeness can also have a price.</P>
      <P>It seems United Nations reform was not discussed at the ASEM Summit.  I regret this.  The Taoiseach pressed Ireland's case for a place on the Security Council.  With all due respect to everybody, that is not the main issue.  Whether we have a place on the Security Council is a minor issue.  The big problem is that Japan and Germany do not have a place on the Security Council.  This means the Security Council is not realistic.  The idea that France would have a place and not Germany is nonsense.  The idea that China would have a place and not Japan is nonsense. Unless there is a realistic distribution of power in the Security Council, we will not have an effective United Nations.  That issue has been dodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem.  America is not paying its dues to the United Nations.  Neither is Russia but it cannot afford to.  America can but it is not paying up.  Every time we flatter American statesmen around the world &mdash; they are susceptible to flattery &mdash; and fail to mention that the United States is not paying its debts to the United Nations we are being a tiny bit hypocritical.  It is a disgrace that the United States Congress will not pay its debts to the United Nations.  If people <Col N="20" /> did not pay their debts to US businesses, we would hear all about it.  If people abused American copyright and intellectual property rights, we would hear all about it through the World Trade Organisation and the Americans would demand enforcement mechanisms.  In this instance, the American Government is not paying its debts to the United Nations.  Great peacemakers who make foreign policy in the United States Congress have insisted but the US Congress will not allow the US Administration pay its debts.  President Clinton and his Secretary of State Mrs. Albright want to pay America's debts.  The ASEM Summit was the ideal place to bring that up because virtually all the great powers who pay their debts to the United Nations were present. The European and Asian countries are up to date.  This was the ideal place to discuss United Nations reform but it was not discussed.  That is regrettable.  To a degree at least, the main issues were dodged.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach raised human rights issues but this time Europe is not raising the issue of human rights in China at the human rights meeting in Geneva.  It was raised previously.  I know from my meeting with Premier Zhu's predecessor, Li Peng, that he was very upset when Europe raised the issue of human rights in China.  We need to be realistic.  Is there progression in the direction of better human rights in China?  There probably is and we should allow it to continue without too much finger-wagging.  China is almost another world.  I am not sure however that the human rights records in some of the other countries represented at the ASEM Summit are brilliant.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the consistent approach of China to the isolation of Taiwan.  This matter was not raised by the Taoiseach.  We talk about self-determination in this part of the world.  It could be said that the people of Taiwan have rights to some form of self-determination.  I am not sure this has been conceded by China.</P>
    <P>Another issue brought up at our meeting in Bangkok &mdash; it seems it was not raised in London &mdash; was third level education co-operation between Asia and Europe.  There is a large number of Asian students attending universities in Europe, there are virtually no European students attending universities in East Asia.  The result is that they know all about us but we know little or nothing about them.  If we want to do business with East Asia, we need people who understand East Asia.  Probably the best way to understand East Asia is to live there for a while, particularly when one is a student.  There were suggestions by a number of people in East Asia that they would welcome Europeans attending their universities. It seems this matter was not raised at the meeting the Taoiseach attended in London.  I wonder why. It was a lost opportunity.  It should be addressed. I hope Ireland will pioneer some form of co-operation with East Asian universities with a view to greater co-operation in both directions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds now represents Ireland on the Vision Group which deals with <Col N="21" /> East Asian affairs.  This is a good thing.  Before the election, the Taoiseach was going to send Deputy Reynolds north but he has sent him east instead.  It was a mistake.  Deputy Reynolds was told before the election that he would go north, but the Taoiseach meant to say he would go east.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The globalisation of the world's economy will probably accelerate over the next ten to 15 years.  The consequence is that no corner of the world can isolate itself from events elsewhere. The fear and trepidation that affected the financial markets in Europe and North America following the collapse of some of the Asian economies as a result of the Asian financial crisis is an indication of this.  Fortunately so far, the fears expressed at the time have not manifested themselves in a worldwide financial recession which would, in turn, lead to an economic recession.  We do not yet know if the restructuring of the various Asian economies will work.  This is a theme we cannot ignore because it appears they have been stabilised for the time being.</P>
      <P>There is a wider and deeper issue from our point of view.  The European Union is the world's largest consumer market.  The deepening of the European Union over the next five to ten years, through enlargement and the introduction of the euro and its emergence as an international reserve currency, will make it a very important place and the European currency a very important currency for the rest of the world.  We are committed to globalisation and open competition on a global scale but I doubt whether this is a two way commitment in other parts of the world.  These are issues which need to be raised at various international fora, of which ASEM is clearly the most important.</P>
      <P>Following the collapse of command economies and the disappearance of the Berlin Wall the final inevitable truth emerged &mdash; one cannot run a market economy without a free society.  This was not confined to dictatorships on the left; the dictatorships in Argentina, Franco's Spain and Salazar's Portugal as well as the colonels in Greece all fell for precisely the same reason, that one cannot run a complex, modern market society without total freedom.  The command economy in the Soviet empire lasted longer because of its geopolitical history rather than the internal contradiction of trying to run a sophisticated economy without liberalisation.  If there was a party which came to that realisation it was the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party during the Kádár years when they had a liberal economy in relative terms but could not function without going the whole way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different kinds of global market economies.  There is the social market model in Europe and the well regulated model in North <Col N="22" /> America to which no one would assign the adjective &ldquo;social&rdquo;.  You have what the Economist magazine would describe as robber capitalism in the former Soviet Union, now known as Russia and the CIS or Commonwealth of Independent States.  You have what the magazine has uniquely and minutely described as crony capitalism in south east Asia.</P>
    <P>While I accept the observations made by Deputy Bruton, it is essential to realise there will not be a full recovery in those economies unless there is a consolidation of what might be described as civic society and the introduction of full freedoms and proper regulation.</P>
    <P>It is in Europe's interest to articulate the case that one cannot have a properly functioning world market economy unless the laws of contract can be enforced and people can trade freely, in market terms, within the economy.  In that context, the right to form trade unions and to bargain as trade unionists, must be seen as an economic right and not as a human right.  If Europe does not make that point to all countries that continue to deny workers the right to get the best price for their labour, then one will not have a truly functioning market economy.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a legal infrastructure of enforcement and regulation through a courts system that is independent of the executive and a written constitution to underpin all that.  The mistake that many people have made in Europe and elsewhere is to equate the right to trade union organisation as a human right when, logically, it is a market right and must be seen in the context of market reform.</P>
    <P>If all those countries are moving towards market economies it will be necessary to have the components that underpin such economies.  These include legal regulation of the market, the right to enforce such regulation independently of the executive, and the right of participants in that market to bid for and obtain the best price for whatever commodity they are selling.</P>
    <P>So far, too many people have tiptoed around the issue of trade union rights as being human rights.  The Indonesians and others have rightly told us that we should not try to impose high, expensive and perhaps unproductive standards from mature economies like North America and Europe into Indonesia and other south east Asian countries.</P>
    <P>Coming from that point of view, with trade union rights and organisations being represented as human rights, they can argue their case with some degree of conviction.  It is not for us to decide what the rate of pay should be in any part of the suburbs of Jakarta or Bangkok.  It is the right of workers in those areas, however, to be able to organise themselves to get the best possible price.  We have the common sense of trade union organisations, whether in North America, China, Japan or elsewhere, who will trade off the benefits of maintaining employment or increasing wages to a point where job losses might occur.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that in the follow up <Col N="23" /> meetings that take place, we should try to obtain a common European position on this matter. Otherwise, we will see a continuous exodus from continental Europe of employment and jobs which will transfer to other parts of the world because we are uncompetitive, largely because labour costs are artificially depressed in those parts of the world.  They are being protected on the basis that this is not an exportation of European human rights, this is part of the Asian culture which says &ldquo;Leave us alone, we have to find our own way into the next millennium&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They cannot, however, cherrypick market economies.  They cannot have the kind of crony capitalism version or the Korean directed one, which was a version of what the Indonesians or the Chinese are doing.  If we want to have a truly global market economy then the underpinning components of that &mdash; regulation and the right to organise trade unions &mdash; must be seen as part and parcel of the integral components of a market economy.</P>
    <P>I want to follow up Deputy Bruton's point on the exchange of understanding and education.  I welcome the fact that we have 700 Malaysian students here, most of whom are studying medicine. I understand they have experienced considerable economic difficulties because of the dramatic drop in the value of their domestic currency <i>vis-a -vis</i> the cost of working here.  This country should enter into medium term arrangements with Malaysia to consolidate and develop some system that will underpin the transitional difficulties they will undoubtedly experience for some years, to maintain the line of communication between ourselves and Malaysia for a variety of self-interested reasons.</P>
    <P>The Malaysians need to have access to medical assistance and education here and we need to develop links with Malaysia so that we can better understand that part of the world which, while culturally very different from us, is rapidly moving towards a certain homogenisation in terms of world trade.</P>
    <P>The Government should extend, through HEADCO and our various other third level institutions, the promotion of Ireland as a place for education, particularly for learning English as a foreign language.  There is an Asian perception that the only English-speaking country in Europe is the United Kingdom, but that is not the case. The reason such a large number of Malaysian people are here is accidental and historic.  It is, in part, related to missionary activity.  There is no such connection with Japan.</P>
    <P>The point was made that European students should study in Asia and I suggest the European Union should develop an Asian version of the Erasmus programme.  There should be some facility across Europe for an Erasmus type programme. I suppose Marco Polo would be the proper <Col N="24" /> title to give to it if we are talking about an Asian dimension.</P>

      <P>Some European explorer or adventurer should give his or her name to a programme that would facilitate European students to study areas and topics of interest for a period in Asian universities of their choice.  This should happen for the very reason Deputy Bruton pointed out &mdash; knowing the enemy, whether in commerce or war, is an important condition for successful trading. Knowing what your competitors are doing and how they think is critical to maximising one's opportunities in relation to any kind of contest or conflict.  We simply do not know, to the extent that we should, the nature of these societies which are immensely complex by our standards. Anybody who has had the opportunity and privilege to visit countries like Japan and Indonesia will be aware of the complexities involved.</P>
      <P>The European Union has an obligation in terms of transferring the European social model. We either choose to go down the Anglo-American road which says the European social model is far too expensive and uncompetitive and that, therefore, we have to strip away layers of support and solidarity because globally it is no longer competitive.  I do not share that point of view but I recognise its intellectual legitimacy.  If the rest of the world continues to have different standards in relations to social solidarity then the cost of maintaining the European model in a globally competitive way will become extremely heavy.</P>
      <P>The path of immigrants trying to get into Europe is an indication of how much individual citizens would like to live in a European social model of society.  It is an indication of what the ordinary individual would like for him or herself or for their families.  In terms of developing an understanding of what Europe is about, the Irish social partnership model is a good example because it indicates that one can combine social solidarity with economic growth and competitiveness all at once as we have seen.  Europe should look at ways in which it can communicate, convince and convey these sort of values and understandings.</P>
      <P>There is a need for this country to develop an institution like the National Democratic Institute or the Republican Institute in North America, to try to engage in educational programmes in countries that have not yet become full democracies, such as Korea, but which are slowly going in that direction.  There is a need to engage in programmes of civic society construction which are absolutely essential to underpin the kind of activity I have already referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, I referred to the death of Mr. Frank Taylor.  How many people are there, like him, in the new emerging democracies, who selflessly serve and give of their time without any expectation of material gain?  We know from what we have read and experienced that that is not the <Col N="25" /> case in the emerging democracies in central and eastern Europe and in parts of Asia.</P>
    <P>If we want to maintain support for underpinning the European social model into the next century, we must explain to people how such a model comes into existence and how such a form of social organisation stays in existence and maintains its competitive economic position.  There is a great deal of work to be done in this area and I commend the Taoiseach for reporting to the House.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs could look at this issue.  These issues will confront us at a much faster rate than many of us realised on previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was inevitable and understandable that the intensive series of meetings between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in London in the early days of April diverted attention from the important ASEM summit.  I welcome the opportunity to consider and discuss the summit.  While the ASEM summit received little public or media attention, it was, nonetheless, an important summit taking place against the background of the continuing economic crisis in Asia and the ongoing concerns about human rights abuses in many Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Asia contains some of the most populous countries in the world which have great contrasts of wealth and poverty.  North Korea, for example, faces a potentially devastating famine while other countries have huge social problems, such as child labour, exploitation and the drugs trade.  There are countries where the citizens do not enjoy an acceptable level of human rights.  Many Asian economies have made enormous progress over the past two decades.  However, there is a lesson to be learned from what has happened in Asia in terms of how quickly a tiger economy can turn out to be a dead horse with terrible consequences for its people, particularly those at the lower end of the ladder.</P>
      <P>I welcome the development of formal relations between the European Union and the Asian countries.  This is only the second summit so the relationship is still at an early stage.  While all 15 members of the European Union are involved, I note that just ten Asian countries were represented at the summit.  I hope steps will be taken to expand the process to include all the Asian countries.</P>
      <P>There is clearly potential for closer relations in terms of political dialogue and economic co-operation as well as in the social and cultural fields. I suppose it is inevitable that the main focus of attention will be on economic issues, given the extent of the economic crisis in Asia, the consequences for its people and, as we have already seen, its potential for knock-on damage in other parts of the world, including Europe.  A number of companies in Ireland, for example, have already suffered as a result of the Asian crisis with consequences for earnings and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the steps being taken by the European <Col N="26" /> Union to assist the Asian countries in overcoming current difficulties and resuming economic growth.  However, it is important that the first priority should be to assist those in Asia who are suffering increased poverty as a result of the crisis rather than bailing out institutional investors, especially the European private banks which are particularly exposed in the region but many of whom contributed to the problems by reckless investment policies.  Whatever about the implications of the crisis for the European banks, we must not lose sight of the human dimension for hundreds of millions of Asian people who already exist on incomes barely above subsistence level. During the South American debt crisis in the 1980s, the IMF insisted that international investors had to be paid back in full, a policy which condemned many countries in that region to further years of economic and social decline.</P>
    <P>Indonesia has more than 20 million people or 10 per cent of its population living on less than $1 a day.  Tens of millions of families in rural areas depend for survival on money sent back from those working in industries or construction sites in the cities.  More than 150,000 construction workers in Java have lost their jobs.  Approximately 400,000 Indonesian workers have been repatriated from Malaysia and in Thailand unemployment is projected to increase by more than 90,000 during this year.  One million people are expected to lose their jobs in South Korea.</P>
    <P>There are continuing reports of human rights abuses in many Asian countries.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is a Reuters report of an Amnesty International statement yesterday which accused the South Asian Governments of ignoring a litany of abuse against children, ranging from bonded labour to selling them into prostitution. Some of the abuses it lists are as follows:</P>
    <P>In India a High Court committee found children detained by police were subject to &ldquo;shockingly savage and barbarous treatment&rdquo; including electric shocks and piercing of private parts with sticks covered with chilli-powder and petrol. In Sri Lanka a boy of 12 was stripped by police and beaten repeatedly ...  More than 9,000 girls were sold each year from Nepal and Bangladesh &mdash; destined for a life of sexual slavery in India and Pakistan.</P>
    <P>We have seen television reports of the abuse of child labour and the exposure of the relationship between some retail outlets in this country and child labour in Asian countries.  We must put respect for human rights and workers' rights at the centre of the approach we take to the Asian economic crisis.</P>
    <P>Some of the so-called remedial steps demanded by the IMF, a doubling of real interests in some countries and major cutbacks in public spending in others, can only worsen the position of the poor and unemployed in those countries.  I hope the Government will continue to press through the European Union for a more humane and balanced approach to the crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> A related area of concern against the background of the Asian economic crisis is the multilateral agreement on investment, which is due to be completed by May and which will have major consequences for poorer countries.  The OECD countries, including Ireland, are rapidly moving towards conclusion of a new agreement which aims to liberalise investment while, at the same time, reducing the controls on the activities of multinational corporations.  Poorer countries will be under enormous pressure to sign up to the MAI, but it fails to strike the right balance between the granting of investor rights and responsibilities to respect human rights and protect the national resource base of poor countries and communities.  A conclusion of the MAI along the lines proposed will only exacerbate the problems of poorer Asian countries.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach report that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, had raised with his Indonesian counterpart the question of East Timor which is receiving considerable public attention in this country as a result of the outstanding work done by the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  I hope our Government will continue to express the strong views of the people on this matter, to seek to bring an end to the brutality in East Timor and to encourage others in the international community to stop turning a blind eye to the problem there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments by the two previous speakers that in the globalised economy in which we live the difficulties of the Asian economy will increasingly be a matter to which we will have to give attention.  We must not do that in a way which is selfish from the point of view of our economic interests but in a way which takes account of the rights of the people who live in Asia.  It is not acceptable to those of us who believe in a civilised approach to living that those who live in the better off part of the world can benefit from the exploitation and degradation of people in poorer parts, which is what is happening in parts of Asia.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret to me that I was unable to be present in London for the ASEM II summit on 2 to 4 April.  The House will understand I felt obliged to remain at the multi-party peace talks which were taking place in Belfast at that time. However, my place at the summit was very ably filled by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, and I express my sincere gratitude to him for undertaking that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As previous speakers said, Asia is a vast continent with enormous physical and human resources.  It is an area of the world with which Ireland has not traditionally had deep-rooted connections.  It is only in recent decades that we have reached out through trade and diplomatic <Col N="28" /> links to many of the countries with whom we are now involved in the ASEM process.  Therefore, we greatly welcomed the opportunity provided by the summit to deepen our relationship with these Asian countries and to make and renew contacts with them at the highest level.  Deputies will be aware that much of East and South-East Asia has been confronting over the past year or so the effects of the Asian financial crisis which has had such a devastating impact on the economies of several countries in the region.  It was not surprising accordingly that the financial crisis dominated the summit and that much of its proceedings were devoted to discussing how the current difficulties could be overcome and how similar problems could be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out in his contribution, leaders at the summit meeting on 4 April adopted, by consensus, two important statements which spell out the core values and the aspirations of the ASEM process.  One of those statements was on the financial and economic situation in Asia.  The chairman's statement was a more general document which covered all aspects of the ASEM mandate.  Both are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The financial crisis in Asia was a major topic of discussion at ASEM II and our Asian partners were pleased that an important statement on the matter was issued.  The financial response of Europe to the crisis has been substantial and the summit provided a useful opportunity to highlight the manner in which it has been managed, chiefly through the IMF and the World Bank.  The decisions taken at the summit to create an ASEM Trust Fund and a Financial Crisis Expertise Network will restore the conditions necessary for economic growth.  Overall, the summit allowed for a joint message of confidence that the measures being implemented by the Asian Governments, combined with the international financial institutions, will lead to a full recovery.</P>
    <P>ASEM II provided an opportunity to further improve Ireland's bilateral trade and inward investment opportunities with several ASEM partners, mainly by creating a climate in which business contacts can be further facilitated.  The Asia Europe Business Forum, which was held in the margins of the summit, was attended by several business representatives from Ireland.  The business forum considered practical means of co-operation between private sectors and their meeting fed into discussions at the summit.</P>
    <P>Two important initiatives, the trade facilitation action plan and the investment protection action plan, were finalised at the summit.  I am convinced that the implementation of these initiatives will generate improvements in the business environment for traders and investors operating in Asia and in Europe.  The investment protection action plan marks an important step forward in the work of increasing two-way investment flows between Europe and Asia and provides a framework for future work in this field.</P>
    <P>One of the many decisions taken at the summit <Col N="29" /> relates to the Asia-Europe Environmental Technology Centre.  I feel that improving co-operation in the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries is an important way of promoting sustainable development and I am sure that the establishment of this centre will provide a sound basis for this.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the ASEM process is based on three pillars, economic, political and social-cultural issues, also known as people-to-people issues.  While it is true that the Asian financial crisis did dominate much of the discussion among leaders earlier this month, the European side made it clear at all times that political issues must maintain an equal status in the process. While, in principle, any relevant political issue can be raised by any of the participants, it was agreed in advance that the main emphasis on this occasion should be given to the situations in the Korean peninsula, Cambodia and Kosovo and to the question of EU enlargement.  In discussing these topics, the European side made a point of raising the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms at every suitable opportunity.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned the question of Indonesia and East Timor.  I assure him and other Members that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, raised that matter with the Indonesian Foreign Minister during the summit.</P>
    <P>In relation to social and cultural issues, the summit participants welcomed the establishment of the Asia-Europe Foundation and commended its work in promoting people-to-people contacts and enhanced intellectual and cultural exchanges between the two regions.  They reaffirmed their support for the foundation and recommended to their national institutions, foundations, corporations and other relevant non-government organisations that they co-operate with the foundation. Other projects which were endorsed at the London summit included the holding of further Asia-Europe Young Leaders Symposia and the establishment of the Asia-Europe Centre at the University of Malaysia.</P>
    <P>In addition, ongoing efforts were endorsed to promote the welfare of children, to co-operate in combating illicit drugs, to expand and enhance educational links, to strengthen co-operation on environmental issues and to take forward work in co-operation on environmental disaster preparedness. Several other activities and projects are to be encouraged and developed further within the context of the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework. For example, the summit noted a report on the trans-Asian railway network project coordinated by Malaysia.</P>
    <P>ASEM Foreign Ministers held a preparatory meeting on 2 April, the day before the first plenary session of ASEM II was held.  That evening a wide-ranging discussion on international political issues was held over dinner at Lancaster House. As I mentioned earlier, I was very ably represented on that occasion by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  Among the issues discussed over dinner were Cambodia, European <Col N="30" /> security architecture, EU-ASEAN relations and Burma/Myanmar.  I understand the discussion on Burma was particularly interesting.  The ASEAN countries argued that Burma be admitted as a full member of the EU-ASEAN relationship, while the European side made it clear it fully supported regional co-operation and integration but that basic standards must be respected.  European Ministers called on the ASEAN countries to put pressure on Burma in relation to its human rights record and also enunciated their serious concerns with regard to the question of the large quantities of narcotic drugs originating in Burma.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, undertook two bilateral meetings on my behalf with the Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia and Surin Pitsuwan, the Foreign Minister of Thailand. In the meeting with Mr. Alatas, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, availed of the opportunity to put across a strong expression of the Irish people's deep concerns regarding the question of East Timor and our distress at the apparent failure of the Indonesian authorities to make any concessions in relation to the human rights of the East Timorese people.  He made a strong plea for progress to be made in the dialogue taking place between Indonesia and Portugal on East Timor under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. Ireland offered to assist in helping to resolve the situation in any way possible, including hosting a meeting of the intra-Timorese dialogue, if that was considered helpful by all sides.  My colleague had a most useful discussion with the Thai Foreign Minister covering many issues, including Thailand's current financial crisis and difficulties and the human rights situation in Burma/ Myanmar.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Taoiseach mentioned the holding of the first EU-China summit in London on 2 April.  This centred on the further development of EU-China relations in a broad number of areas, including progress in the EU-China human rights dialogue.  Both sides agreed on the importance of achieving further progress through a continued EU-China dialogue covering all aspects of human rights.  EU concerns on human rights were mentioned, including Tibet, and reference was made to the impending EU Troika Ambassadors' visit there.  The Chinese Premier stated China's intention to sign the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and this was welcomed by the EU.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the good work that has been taking place within the ASEM framework since the first summit meeting held in Bangkok two years ago.  The London summit underlined the many important initiatives which are now well under way.  Although it may be difficult to point to concrete decisions or spectacular achievements which resulted from ASEM II, the most important achievement was that the summit took place at all and that a spirit of harmony and mutual understanding pervaded its proceedings. When one thinks of the diverse nature of the countries involved in the process and the difficulties <Col N="31" /> which have existed between many of them in the past, this was achievement in itself.  When the political atmosphere is right between countries, all sorts of previously impractical dreams can become reality.  That to my mind is the main purpose of ASEM.</P>
    <P>It is in the same spirit that I look forward to the report of the ASEM Vision Group, which held its first formal meeting this month.  The purpose of that group is to chart a way forward for the ASEM process in the coming years.  We are very fortunate to have a former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, as Ireland's representative on this group.  I have no doubt he can bring to this task the same inspiration and ingenuity he applied as Taoiseach to the peace process on this island, in devising structures for a new relationship between Asia and Europe.

    <Title>Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the part of the Bill which deals with persons found guilty of any offences for which he or she would be liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for a term of six months or both, and on conviction and indictment to a fine of £5,000 or imprisonment for two to three years or both.  It is not intended that these penalties will relate to basic offences in relation to candidates as sanctions in this area already exists.  That is a step which, unfortunately, was forced upon the system, and the Minister was correct to include that in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the various headings with which I was dealing in relation to teachers, the teaching profession has done an enormous amount of good in the fields of education and developing local communities. We cannot overlook the fact that teachers must continue in the educational process. Because the educational system is becoming more exposed to information technology and technology in general, the teacher training centres are essential to this part of their development. As a result, they can pass on to the pupils a greater degree of information and education with regard to the use of technology in life after school and in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was brought to the fore in Kilkenny city recently which was runner-up in the Telecom Éireann technology town competition.  Without the help of teachers the £1 million which the city received could not have been spent in communities. When all the programmes were rolled out, it was clearly underlined that teaching the community was an essential part of the process of spending that money.  Therefore, I suggest that the further investment announced by Telecom Éireann of £10 million in the educational system <Col N="32" /> generally and the £240 million announced by the Minister must go towards the education of teachers and putting in place a mechanism which will, in turn, educate young people in technology.</P>
    <P>Most of the issues I dealt with to date relate to mainstream education.  In this regard, I compliment the Minister on the vision, dynamism and leadership which he has brought to the Department since his appointment.</P>
    <P>Education is an escape route from poverty and we should do everything possible to ensure that children are given equal rights and opportunities within the system.  Furthermore, we should introduce skills based instruction at a very early age in an attempt to maintain interest and encourage involvement in areas where this is perceived necessary.  However it is done, education is the foundation from which we can build a better society: it is also a ladder to a better life which should be available to all.  The cost of not providing a comprehensive educational programme will be far greater than the cost of ensuring that the best we can provide is available to all.</P>
    <P>The measures will affect only those in mainstream education and that is a comment on the administration of education in the State.  We must now examine the quiet revolution which is taking place in education at community level.  I instance, for example, the Fr. McGrath Centre in Kilkenny city, which has made a submission to the Department for funding to education in its community. I encourage the Minister to take a detailed look at that submission because it is the blueprint for educational needs in any community.  It is a model for educating the community which can be used as part of a support mechanism for mainstream education.</P>
    <P>The organisation in Kilkenny offers a net to young people before they fall out of the system. Community leaders, themselves only educated in the university of life, are now turning their skills to help young people stay within the mainstream educational system, and they are encouraging them through homework clubs and other mechanisms. These clubs break down the barriers between a young person who is embarrassed about admitting his or her inability to cope with homework and they offer a softer approach to mainstream education.</P>
    <P>Access to technological education and technology has been provided by this centre.  Through technology, marginalised adult groups, particularly parents who have never experienced employment, are now in a position to return to a more friendly environment with their peers to experience technology, to improve their selfesteem and their chances of future employment. It breaks the cycle for young people and their parents.  It offers them a way out of the poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
    <P>Centres such as the Fr. McGrath Centre should be encouraged by the Department.  The centre should be examined as a model, as I said, it should be encouraged by the Department by way <Col N="33" /> of proper funding and inclusive mechanisms which would make it part of the existing system.</P>
    <P>As an extension of what is happening at community level, I suggest another method which is being undertaken by young Irish filmmakers in Kilkenny.  Again, this is a group which was brought together by local initiative.  It is administered by a returned exile from Australia, who is giving his vast experience to the young people of the city.  Again, it is a poorly funded organisation. When one examines the workload and success rate of the group, it is clearly a model which the Department of Education should examine.</P>
    <P>It offers young people the opportunity to shoot film by themselves.  The group has already received great credit for itself and the city by filming &ldquo;Under the Hawthorn Tree&rdquo;, which was picked up by Channel Four.  The young people shoot films, act in them and put them together. This exposes them to a technology which will benefit them in later life.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the technology used by these young people is of the same standard as that which one would find in any Spielberg production, yet this group is motivated by a self-help ethos in the city.  It is not recognised sufficiently by the various Departments or mainstream education, yet it is contributing in a positive way to the development of young people's creativity.  It offers them an exciting new departure in employment when they complete their education.  I encourage the Minister to examine this particular aspect of education.</P>
    <P>As an extension of that, there is a third level facility in Kilkenny.  Local politicians have been criticised for many years for not providing a third level facility.  Again, the self-help ethos and encouragement by the local community and business people to get out there and do it for themselves has led to a link by way of the Outreach centre with NUI Maynooth and the Carlow Regional Technical College.  I encourage the Minister to explore this whole area of Outreach centres.  I offer the Kilkenny experience as a pilot project where the Minister, instead of being fearful of the funding required to keep such a development going, should see it as a positive move in the development of our educational infrastructure.  It is positive in the sense that it offers local people an extension of education from second to third level.  It offers people who are marginalised the opportunity to get out of their present situation and come back into education.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny offers the ambience of a university city and infrastructure which the Department could match with funding and encourage that project to go ahead.  I appreciate that the officials are frowning on the development of Outreach centres, but it is the new way of education and does quite a lot for the local community.  It not only helps to develop the local community but, by the involvement of people in third level facilities and outreach centres, students in those centres will encourage others to go from second <Col N="34" /> to third level education.  It keeps young people at home and helps to develop local industry.  It is an attraction for outside investors and raises the esteem of the local people.</P>
    <P>This is a self-help project funded locally.  As a local group we have not ignored the possibility of funding people who cannot fund themselves.  It is a project that has reached out to the marginalised, but it has yet to be properly recognised by the Department.  I suggest the Minister use the project in Kilkenny as a pilot project and fund it properly.  Through the information age link with Telecom, technology has been introduced in that centre.  By imposing technology on an outreach centre, the Minister would have first hand experience of the extent to which the service is taken up by the local community and local groups.  We have reached out to places such as the NUI in Maynooth and Carlow Regional Technical College, into which heavy State investment has been made.  As well as benefiting those areas, the outreach mechanism will bring great benefits to Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>There is great potential, through Cork and Queens University, to expand the courses available. By way of fibre-optic cable and other technological advances, it is possible to reach out to America and beyond.  Courses could be introduced in places such as Kilkenny and a proper third level structure could be developed which would be beneficial to the local community.  That would be sound investment by the Department. Rather than frown on such an initiative, the Department should take it on board and make it part of the development process in education for the future.</P>
    <P>On the infrastructure available in Kilkenny through education, I compliment the Minister on investing £2.5 million in infrastructure through St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny.  The go-ahead for the gaelscoil in Kilkenny will benefit the region greatly.  I draw to the Minister's attention the neglect of the infrastructure in County Kilkenny in the past 20 years.  Schools such as Grennan College, the vocational school in Kilkenny and the Loretto school are overcrowded and need to expand.  There are sensible projects before the Department and I encourage the Minister to consider each of them because the buildings have been neglected.  Ormond College in Kilkenny is a listed building.  The roof is leaking and the building needs immediate attention, yet there has not been any response from the Department.  That is unacceptable given that there has been a 20 year span of neglect in this area.  I encourage the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>In a city the size of Kilkenny which is expanding rapidly and has much going for it in terms of economic development, the Loretto school will have to be extended.  The school which houses 730 pupils was built for about 400.  We are thankful for the investment made by the Minister since coming to office, but considerably more investment is required.</P>
    <P>A link-up with the Department of Social, Community <Col N="35" /> and Family Affairs is required in terms of the development of the county.  Family resource centres are funded by the Department.  There was a promise of funding of £120,000 over a three year period for Clogh resource centre.  The Department of Education and Science should link up with such centres in terms of technology and the provision of courses because they could be operated as an educational base.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste yesterday met a group from Castlecomer.  I encourage the Tánaiste and the Department of Education and Science to establish an education and skills centre in Castlecomer to assist in solving the unemployment problems there.  It would also strengthen the infrastructural needs of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Education Bill.  Our aim must be to make sure the best possible standard of education is available to every pupil regardless of ability, disability, social background, locality or any other factor.  Every child should be given the opportunity to develop his or her natural talents and ability to the maximum.  Legislation on education and the education system in general must be geared towards this objective.  Towards this end, proper school buildings at every level of education is important, but none more so than at primary level.  While progress has been made in recent years, three schools I have visited, the Model School in Bailieboro, St. Enda's in Scotshouse and St. Michael's in Corcaghan, are in desperate need of new schools or massive repairs. My colleague on the Government side said that some of the schools in his area have leaking roofs. In St. Enda's school in Scotshouse the water is leaking through the roof and doors.  I am aware the Department is working on this matter, but the urgency of a final decision cannot be overemphasised.</P>
      <P>The schools in Deravoy and Knockconon in Truagh parish are joined with schools across the Border in a major cross-Border project funded by the EU under the peace initiative, yet those buildings are no longer fit for use.  If they were in any other use such as for commercial purposes they would be closed long ago by the authorities. It is very difficult for teachers and pupils in those schools to compete with their comrades from Aughnacloy and elsewhere.  I refer to the need to improve those schools because legislation without financial backing will not solve the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the computer programme announced recently by the Minister, Deputy Martin, in conjunction with Telecom.  This is a major step forward. We must ensure pupils in rural areas, where there is great need, have the opportunity for proper <Col N="36" /> training.  I ask the Minister to ensure small rural schools which do not have access to computers will be the first to be considered.  Many better-off schools do not have the same immediate need.</P>
    <P>Remedial and resource teachers must be provided as a priority.  Progress was made by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, particularly in her first couple of years in office, but a problem arose with disputes about whether teachers would be taken from schools that had fewer numbers and progress did not continue.  There is an urgent need in this area.  There is no remedial teacher in Rockcorry, Enniskeen, Aghabog and Scotshouse. In many other areas there is a skeleton service. Children in those areas have the same rights as children in Dublin and Cork and should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan parents of the hearing impaired have a problem in regard to the second level school for their children.  The parents have requested a permanent teacher for a special class in Our Lady's secondary school in Castleblayney. I spoke to the Minister about this matter, as did some of my colleagues.  If this urgent problem is not solved it will be the cause of serious hardship, disappointment and cost to the children, parents and the Department.  If the school is not maintained in Castleblayney the children concerned will have to be catered for in Dublin, entailing extra transport costs and overnight costs.  As well as that the children would be separated from their families, which would be unacceptable.  The Minister should make an urgent decision on this issue.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to the views of parents' groups of this sort and parent involvement on school boards and in general consultations must be encouraged.  It is not good enough to use parents to run fundraising functions to raise money for building and general maintenance. They must be given the opportunity to become members of school boards to put their views forward.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the inspectorate, etc., and refers to support, advice and evaluation. When I attended school, teachers and pupils looked forward with trepidation to the inspector's visit.  However, the greatest problem faced by schools today is the lack of psychologists to advise parents and teachers.  In a recent case in my area a parent was obliged to wait approximately 18 months to have her child assessed.  The assessment would not have taken place if pressure had not been exerted.  I understand the difficulties in this area because many psychologists are deeply involved in dealing with cases of sexual abuse, etc.  However, other children's needs are not being catered for in the best way possible.  I urge the Minister to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>Urgent consideration must also be given to disadvantaged status which is referred to in the Bill. The fact that Clones junior primary school has not been granted such status &mdash; it was given to the senior primary school in the same town &mdash; cannot be explained.  Clones town and district suffered <Col N="37" /> more than any other area as a result of the Troubles.  Border roads were closed and there was an influx of refugees from Northern Ireland. This issue was considered by a committee established by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, but its proposal did not allow schools with five or more teachers to be reclassified and no recognition was given to special needs.  With the hardships suffered by many of those involved, there is a case for such recognition to be given.</P>
    <P>A commitment was made to the chairman and committee of Largy College, when that committee was formed, to service the amalgamated VEC and diocesan school and provide a new green field school and sports hall.  Five years later, the matter is still being discussed.  I am not suggesting this is the fault of the Minister, responsibility lies with successive Administrations.  The committee of the college, parents and pupils demand &mdash; and deserve &mdash; action.  The amalgamation has worked extremely well and there is no doubt it could be used as an example for towns similar to Clones to bring about other amalgamations and provide better services and education to rural communities. However, if the promises made to those involved are not honoured, it will be difficult to encourage other towns to proceed with similar amalgamations.  There is an urgent need to resolve this matter, not only for the sake of Cavan-Monaghan but also that of other rural areas.  This type of partnership must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to leave vocational education committees, more or less, in their current form, particularly that of Cavan-Monaghan which is dealt with on a county by county basis.  However, I accept there is justification for amalgamations in areas which are served by two vocational education committees. Provision was made for this in the previous legislation and I encourage the Minister to reconsider the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that work has commenced on the much needed and overdue extension to Ard Scoil Lorgan, Castleblayney.  However, every effort must be made to include Inver College, Carrickmacross, in this year's capital programme because the current standard of accommodation there is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Many improvements have already been made to Ballybay VEC which is situated in the town where I live.  However, as the only secondary school in the area, it deserves to be provided with additional accommodation for both work and play.  Good work also continues in secondary schools in Castleblayney but the provision of proper accommodation for sports activities is long overdue at St. Macartan's College in Monaghan town.  To this end the authorities at the college have raised a great deal of money &mdash; approximately £300,000 &mdash; but sanction is urgently required from the Department of Education and Science to allow construction to proceed.</P>
    <P>Sport is important.  In that context, and in light of the, hopefully, permanent peace initiative <Col N="38" /> recently put in place, St. Macartan's College is involved in sporting activities with schools situated in Bangor and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  If children from these schools visit the college, the only place for them to engage in sporting activities &mdash; often on wet days &mdash; is outside because the old gymnasium can no longer be used.  A proper sports hall must be provided in the near future.  The recent grant provided to the collegiate school in the town was much appreciated. However, a new extension programme is necessary and sanction for it is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these issues to highlight a number of success stories in secondary schools in the Cavan-Monaghan area and to illustrate some of the outstanding problems.  For example, there is no VEC or third level institution of any kind in Kingscourt, a sizeable town on the Cavan-Monaghan border.  According to independent statistics, the real problem in Cavan-Monaghan is that the number of students pursuing third level education is almost the lowest in the country.  The situation will deteriorate further after September 1998 when many of our students attending colleges in Northern Ireland and the UK will be obliged to pay college fees.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned by the Minister's decision to increase capitation grants from £150 to £250.  This increase has been introduced through the back door.  When car tax was abolished, we were informed that the £5 levy introduced as a registration fee would be just that. However, car tax remains in place today.  On the other hand, I welcome the aid given to students attending other colleges.</P>
    <P>The Mifet PLC in Monaghan town is the only institution in the area which provides third level and further education.  It has submitted a proposal to sanction its purchase of the premises it currently occupies.  This institution must be given proper funding because it is involved in joint projects with colleges and universities in Northern Ireland.  Tanagh Outdoor Centre has also been under discussion for many years and recognition must be given to it.  Several groups in Monaghan are using the Internet and other mediums for educational purposes at present.  The national certificate from Queen's University is being dealt with by the Farney group in conjunction with the VEC.</P>
    <P>Above all, however, there is a group of people who must be catered for and given proper funding, namely, those involved in the furniture, engineering and food industries.  The latter is the most prominent industry in County Monaghan. These people should not be obliged to travel to Dundalk, Waterford or Kerry.  They should be able to attend day and evening classes in their area.  Computer education is important and I recognise the fact that the VEC is doing great work through the community groups' mobile training unit to provide part-time students and housewives with the opportunity to pursue courses in this area.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees and teachers <Col N="39" /> play a major role in education.  However, I am concerned about the mechanisms used in the past to appoint teachers and others to vocational education committees.  Other Members may not agree, but I believe independent bodies, free of political influence, should be established to make such appointments.  Our children should be above politics.</P>
    <P>Teachers play a major role in community work. Members of this House are often accused of working a short number of days.  The same accusation is made against teachers but they do a great deal of work after school hours for the general good of the community.</P>
    <P>There is a need for major long-term financial commitment to education.  The Celtic tiger economy has been sustained by the fact that we have an educated workforce.  People who come to this country are prepared to accept that we may not have the cheapest labour but we have the best educated workforce.  In order to feed the Celtic tiger, we must ensure that education is properly financed.</P>
    <P>I will conclude shortly as I want to give some time to my colleague.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has responsibility for school transport.  I am aware he is examining this question but some of the school buses being used are unfit for that purpose.  These buses are not in use for many weeks during the year and on school days they are only used for perhaps an hour in the morning and evening.  The whole question must be examined.  Privately owned minibuses and other forms of transport could be used also for school transport.</P>
    <P>As another speaker said in the debate last night, the school transport areas should be restructured.  Just because a bus travelled down a particular road ten years ago does not mean it should continue to go down the same road today. Buses may have to travel additional miles in a particular area to accommodate more pupils because roads are so dangerous.  Pressure is put on couples to have two cars in country areas where it should not be necessary.  Privately owned buses could be used to great effect at night which might help to reduce the number of accidents caused by drink driving.</P>
    <P>There has been a major improvement in support for disabled persons but the position in rural areas is different from that in cities.  Children living close to the various support centres in Dublin can travel without much cost but the opposite is the case in Cavan-Monaghan and other areas where parents often have to drive their children to these centres at great cost to themselves.  If they do not have a medical card this travelling can be a major drain on their resources.  This area has to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this Bill is only a means to an end.  We will all have to work together to ensure education is moved into the next century in the best possible way, and that must be through partnership.</P>
    <Col N="40" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an emasculated version of the original Bill.  I pay tribute to the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, for making the decision to abolish fees for third level students.  That had a significant impact on many middle class families in particular who were burdened with those costs.  It is unfortunate that the electorate did not recognise the great achievement in that area.</P>
      <P>I raised on the Adjournment last night the question of providing a remedial teacher for three schools in County Limerick and the Minister responded accordingly.  In regard to remedial teaching, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on information technology.  I do not object to funding being provided for this area but we may be losing out in regard to other basic needs. For example, if 74 per cent of pupils who attend primary schools nationally have the benefit of either a shared or full-time remedial teacher, the other 26 per cent do not have that facility. Approximately 14 or 15 per cent of the cohort of pupils attending these schools may need the benefit of a remedial teacher.  If they do not get that service they will go on to second level at an educational disadvantage.  The drop out rate from second level education is high and that creates inherent social problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the provision of a remedial teacher for all schools at national level is a priority.  If we have 3,227 schools nationally and 2,459 have remedial teachers, that means 768 schools do not have that facility.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is making this a priority.</P>
      <P>I come from an area where there are special schools in different locations because we have a large number of travellers living in the area. Many of those travellers, some of whom are third generation, have successfully integrated into the community and even resent being called travellers. That is a tribute to them.  Many communities continue to experience problems because some travellers do not accept the norms of the settled population.  The education process can help to achieve compatibility between the settled and the traveller communities.</P>
      <P>I have read many reports on travellers but I would like the Minister or his officials to find out the number of travellers attending special schools who go on to sit the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  What happens to the travellers who do not sit these examinations?  In many cases they drop out of school.  That is a major problem particularly among teenagers in the travelling community.  Dropping out of school can lead to other social difficulties.  The question of education for travellers must be fully examined.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger was mentioned by an earlier speaker but we are experiencing skills shortages in certain areas.  Some have been identified in the tourism area where special skills are required, particularly in the crafts trade.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill.  There is much talk about the Celtic tiger but second level education was one of the milestones in the birth of the Celtic tiger.  In Kanturk, Boherbue or any other part of north Cork, almost 80 per cent of the pupils who complete their leaving certificate go on to third level education.  They in turn become the young, well educated workforce that is currently fuelling the Celtic tiger.  We owe a great debt to the late Donogh O'Malley and the Department for introducing free education.  After 30 years of it the country is doing well.</P>
      <P>Education forms the basis of our society, but there are problems with the system, particularly in the primary sector.  While third and second level education seem to be well funded, many schools in the primary sector are in a deplorable condition.  I call on the Minister to address that.  I know he is looking at schools in my constituency with a view to improving conditions there.  It is no longer acceptable that young people should be educated in substandard accommodation.  We have to put funds into primary level education.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on providing computers in schools.  Up to a year or two ago I was almost computer illiterate and the average seven to ten year old could teach me how to use a computer. That was one of the benefits of providing computers for schools, and it is an indication of the direction our education system is taking.</P>
      <P>As in every other sector, there are always people who are unable to keep up with the standard. There is a great need for the Youthreach projects, and there has been tremendous growth in them.  Having a sister who taught on a Youthreach project for five or six years in Mallow, I understand that it was of tremendous benefit particularly to people who dropped out of school at the age of 13 or 14 and who as a result faced marginalisation and other difficulties. Under the Youthreach projects such people can be brought back into the system and educated for different types of work.  This area has to be expanded and properly funded and prioritised because people who drop out of the education system early face great difficulty in life.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill for regional education boards, in accordance with the preelection commitment.  That has meant tremendous savings, and the money that was to be spent on bureaucracy can be better spent in the classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of school transport, no other Department has to negotiate such a minefield of rules and regulations.  To answer even the smallest query on school transport one would need to consult a senior counsel.  It has been said that the <Col N="42" /> only transport service in rural Ireland is the school bus which is in operation for one and a half to two hours morning and evening and is idle for the rest of the day.  Such buses, which belong to the State or to a semi-State body, could be used at other times to provide a service.  Such a project has been operating in County Clare and it is working quite well.  This idea should be explored further.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the question of the teaching of civics not only in second level schools but in national schools.  During the last presidential election a mock election was conducted in a school in north Cork among a group of 13 and 14 year olds.  It transpired that 33 per cent of them did not know a presidential election was taking place.  The political parties do not seem to have got the message across.  That is worrying.  It is true that 13 and 14 year olds think politics is boring, that it is not cool.  A few years ago politics was topical in schools but recently it has been neglected.  I would encourage the Minister to do anything he can to ensure that schoolgoing children are taught about the whole range of things that are happening outside the school gate.  We are supposed to be educating people for life.  It is great that they are computer literate and get five or six As in the leaving certificate examination, but they also need to be educated on the workings of the various systems in the country.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the provision of classroom assistants.  It is necessary to have a more integrated education system.  It is no longer acceptable that children with special needs should have to go to special schools.  They should not be singled out or made to feel inferior.  They should be integrated into the mainstream education system so that they can mingle and make friends with people in their own locality.  It is an area that needs more funding.  The Minister should encourage the integration into mainstream schools of more and more children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on inviting tenders for St. Mary's Secondary School in Charleville.  It is a great boost to the area.</P>

    <P>Deputy Crawford mentioned that teachers, like politicians, are often vilified for not working long hours or because they work only a certain number of days a year.  Teachers give a great amount of time and work voluntarily, particularly at second level, in organising sports and other activities. We do not give them sufficient praise for their work and commitment.  We should be grateful <Col N="43" /> for it.  Teaching means much more than the work done during school hours.  My former secondary school won the all-Ireland football championship recently and the matches were played at weekends.  Great efforts were made on the part of the teachers to bring about the success.  Such efforts are made in every school at primary and secondary level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the revisions contained in the Bill.  The Bill will bring about a great amount of change in the education system.  Education is the foundation for the economic and social development we have experienced.  The founding fathers of the State put a lot of time, effort and funding into education. Despite the horrors that occurred in some of the educational institutions, overall education in Ireland has stood the test of time.  We must try to improve it at every level.</P>
      <P>It is important to apply as much funding as possible to education.  Although great progress has been made, there is still much work to do. There are many schools which require remedial teachers and many primary schools are structurally underdeveloped.  I know the Minister is giving priority to such issues.  As much funding as possible must be provided because without a proper education system we will not be able to advance society.  Society faces difficulties from drugs and other problems and the only way to solve them is through education.  People must be given the opportunity to be educated and to advance themselves, particularly those who are born into disadvantage.  In an ideal world we would apply all available resources to that end.</P>
      <P>I support any legislative changes which will help as many people as possible to receive a proper and just education.  We must improve educational facilities.  It will not be possible to do everything in a short space of time but a planned process supported by funds will provide the necessary range of services and facilities over a relatively short period.  Education matters because it is the bedrock of our State.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the inspectorate on a statutory basis.  However, the Minister will need to strengthen that section of the Bill. Each school which receives State funds ought to have its teachers inspected in the classroom. There are about 40,000 teachers in Ireland and if only 1 per cent of them are not doing their job properly that is 400 teachers, which is a significant figure and puts many students at a disadvantage. If the State is funding a school the inspectorate should have a right to inspect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there was a to-do in the newspapers last week when the TUI indicated that it would not accept the whole school evaluation programme.  The ASTI indicated that it had no difficulty with it but it does not allow its members to be inspected, only the school management. This matter must be addressed.  Students are put under so much pressure to get points for college <Col N="44" /> that if one teacher is not doing his or her job properly the inspectorate should be able to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter and I will return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor proposed a regional structure which I thought was ludicrous.  To put a regional structure on top of the VEC structure would have been overly and unnecessarily bureaucratic.  If a regional structure were to be introduced the VEC structure would have be removed.  As a member of a VEC, I accept there are difficulties in the system and I am glad the previous Minister addressed some of them, particularly the political problems that arose when vocational education committees interviewed for teaching positions.  She introduced a different interviewing system which is welcome. Overall the vocational education committees have done a good job and at a local level they provide a better form of administration than a regional structure.  I welcome the Minister's decision to stick with the VEC structure.  The Bill does not refer to the importance of the 1930 Act which provided for the establishment of boards of management for community and secondary schools.  Neither does it refer to the Act which gave VEC committees a similar management role for vocational schools.  This matter must be teased out on Committee Stage.  Under the Minister's proposals the body corporate of boards of management can be sued.  Under the Bill a board of management could be set up in a VEC school where a VEC committee already acts as a board of management.  If a board of management has responsibility for the teachers and finance of a vocational school and a VEC committee has similar responsibilities, who would be sued?</P>

      <P>I welcome the role given to parents' associations in the Bill.  It is important that parents play an active part in the educational process.  Free education is a misnomer because parents' groups are busy trying to raise funds for extra curricular activities to assist the educational process.  While that is welcome, additional State funding could be provided, particularly for the remedial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the question of school transport was not covered.  While I do not know how the matter can be addressed, something must be done.  I welcome the report on school transport. Although it would not be a good statement to make outside churches during an election campaign, I believe the day of free school transport has long passed.  Most families should be able to contribute towards the school transport system.  It is frustrating to be told the school bus route cannot be extended because a national school was in a particular location in, say, 1940.  It is very difficult to tell one's constituents that their children cannot avail of the school transport service because of that.  Many of those people would willingly <Col N="45" /> pay for a bus service to take their children to the school they wish to attend.  School transport is an extremely important part of the educational process and should have been dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tenor of the Bill.  Education is the foundation of the State and I look forward to debating a number of issues on Committee Stage. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Kenny.</P>

      <P>I have not had an opportunity in recent months to tell the Minister that I know he has an enormous responsibility in the Department of Education and Science.  As a junior Minister to the then Minister for Education, Paddy Cooney, I had some experience of Marlborough street in 1986.  I had responsibility for school transport and primary and secondary school buildings throughout the country with the exception of County Longford, and we did a reasonably good job at the time.</P>
      <P>When speaking in the national Parliament &mdash; and the glamour of a Ministry is promoted in the best way possible &mdash; one tends to lose sight of the fact that the Minister for Education and Science is the political guardian of the future of this country. The children who are now having their lunch breaks in primary schools throughout the country will grow up in the age of a technological revolution. While there have been rapid changes in the past ten years, the changes in the next ten will be equally important.  When the children currently attending primary school reach their teenage years, they will be able to download their favourite music from their personal computers in their homes.  They will not have to bother with music shops.  In terms of technology, research and innovation the Minister, Deputy Martin, has an enormous political responsibility.  A former Minister once used the phrase &ldquo;going through the Department like a dose of salts&rdquo;.  It is not as easy as that.</P>
      <P>In a document produced on 1 April, the Small Firms Association stated that 72 per cent of small firms are experiencing recruitment difficulties while the prospective employees of 45 per cent of companies seek to be paid off the books.  Is this the type of world for which the Minister, as the political master, is educating our children?  The document also states that it is incomprehensible to have 240,000 people receiving social welfare payments while 72 per cent of small firms currently engaged in recruitment are experiencing difficulties filling vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The historic Agreement reached with the British Government in terms of the future of the island and its people contains a section dealing with the Irish language as a minority language in a European context and refers to its promotion by the British Government and the new council in the North where possible.  One of the core values of Fianna Fáil, as espoused by a former Minister Mr. Flynn, was the restoration of the <Col N="46" /> Irish language.  While a large number of man hours are spent teaching Irish in schools on a weekly basis, many children cannot speak Irish competently when they finish secondary school. Children attending international schools have no difficulty taking on four or five languages.  A message appears to be going through the system, even from some high authorities, telling children to forget about Irish and take up French, Spanish or Italian because Irish will not be of any great value to them.  It is only when the tap is turned off that one realises the value of water.</P>
    <P>I am a passionate believer, without ramming it down people's throats, of the value of the Irish language.  It gives us a unique personality and makes its mark in political, social and economic negotiations and in trade and business on the international front.  I was surprised the Irish National Teachers' Organisation wants the Minister to recruit teachers from Northern Ireland who are not proficient in Irish.  If that happens, it will be necessary to recruit other teachers to teach Irish classes in those schools?  I do not know whether the age old resolution by all Governments to do what we can to have all people speaking the Irish language has been watered down.</P>
    <P>One teacher schools are a sore point for those involved.  I acknowledge the Minister does not have a magic wand in Marlborough Street and cannot sort it out overnight.  However, in respect of the commitment he has given, he should set in train a programme and timetable to deal with it. These teachers are in breach of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1996.  Section 12(1) states:</P>
    <P>An employer shall not require an employee to work for a period of more than four hours and 30 minutes without allowing him or her a break of at least 15 minutes.</P>
    <P>There is no collective agreement among teachers that they should be exempted, similar to the garda or members of the Defence Forces, and that needs attention.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for a trained teacher to spread himself or herself over eight or nine classes encompassing different age groups, standards and levels of competence and to bring the children to a point where they can enter the second level system in as agreeable and competent a fashion as they should.  More ominously, I hope an individual will not make a false sexual abuse allegation against a teacher in a one teacher school because there will be no one else in the school to deal with this.  For example, people involved with GAA juvenile teams drop children off from training at different houses.  They must be careful because of the way the pendulum has swung.  If a child gets sick in school, a teacher normally brings three children with him or her to the child's home in case abuse allegations are made.  In the case of one teacher schools the teacher has full responsibility <Col N="47" /> for all the children.  I hope the Minister will look at this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The education system has operated and developed in a mainly <i>ad hoc</i> way since its inception.  It has lacked focus and direction and the absence of a statutory basis for it is one of the main reasons for this.  Therefore, in principle, I welcome the publication of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Few Bills introduced in this House have had a more extensive period of gestation than this one. It is a process which my party and, in particular, my party colleague, former Minister, Ms Bhreathnach, were centrally involved.  The Labour Party was first to take effective action to establish a statutory basis for our education system, and without our initiative in this matter I very much doubt if legislation of this nature would ever have been produced.</P>
      <P>In its preparations to introduce major legislation the Labour Party realised broad and extensive consultation with the partners in education was necessary.  The Bill derives from that process, which began with the Green Paper in 1992, was followed by the White Paper on Education, the Education Convention in Dublin Castle and the publication of the first Education Bill by the previous Government.  The Minister has had a wealth of research and opinion to draw upon, the envy of any legislator, in producing his Bill.  However, it is up to him to pull these various advices together in a coherent and innovative way.  He and the Government have failed to do this and have produced anodyne legislation that does not serve the best interests of education.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have commented on the value of education, particularly as it relates to our economic performance and I concur fully with these sentiments.  As a deputy who represents the northside of Dublin I am acutely aware of the difference education can make in the lives of our youth.  Our level of education is one of the driving forces in our current economic success.  It has provided companies with a multi-skilled and talented workforce that is the envy of many countries across the globe.</P>
      <P>Despite this, it must also be recognised that our education system has failed some children.  It has failed to be responsive and imaginative and these failings, which are felt most by children from disadvantaged areas and children with special needs, should have been tackled.  The system has refused to recognise for too many years that these children have a right to an education and that the State has a duty to uphold that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have comforted ourselves for too long with the mantra that our education system is among <Col N="48" /> the best in the world.  However, it rings hollow for the parents of children with disabilities or serious behavioural problems.  Our education system, primarily due to its centralised nature, has not treated such children equally.  Their educational needs have too often been pushed to the sidelines, off centre stage.  The Bill should have addressed these failings.  The Minister has failed to do this and the Bill is a wasted opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill is rooted in conservatism.  It seeks to enshrine the system as it has evolved since the establishment of the Department in 1924 and it firmly places control of that system in the Minister's office in Marlborough Street.  It ignores to a large extent the philosophy and language that had come to characterise the debate about education in recent years.  Since the publication of the Green Paper the debate about the future of education has revolved around the concepts of transparency, accountability and partnership. However, the Bill pays lip service to these concepts.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the proposed regional education boards will prove to be one of the most regressive steps in education and public administration that we have encountered in decades. The philosophy behind the education boards was to devolve real power to a transparent and accountable regional structure.  It would have had real power over the delivery of educational services in its area and would have broken the stifling stranglehold the Department has over every decision made in the education system.  It would have represented a new departure for education.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to turn his back on these progressive proposals and keep control of our children's education firmly within a centralised, bureaucratic and, at times, unresponsive Department.  Accountability for the delivery of education can come about only through devolution. Regional education boards as outlined in the previous Bill sought to establish this devolution. I refer to one example, that of producing an education plan for a regional board.  Under the original Bill directors of education were charged with producing an education plan as soon as they were appointed and at such intervals as may be specified by the Minister.  The plan would set out the objectives of the education board for the upcoming three year period, the priorities accorded to these objectives and the means by which they would be met by the board.</P>
    <P>The original Bill also provided for extensive negotiation on the plan with the partners in education before it would be adopted by the board. It was then the responsibility of the education board to provide the public, parents, teachers and other partners in the education system with as wide as possible access to the agreed document. The director of education was also obliged to present an annual report on the implementation of the education plan.  This would have led to real devolution in our education system and would have allowed for accountability.  However, the Bill turns its back on those principles and pays lip <Col N="49" /> service to the notion of devolution and accountability. It is a retrograde step that does not serve our system well.  It fails students and parents in many other ways.</P>
    <P>That the Bill does not impose a statutory duty on all schools to establish boards of management is an absolute disgrace.  It is obvious the Minister is not prepared to tackle all the vested interests. The exclusion of parents and staff from the management of schools is an intolerable situation.  It goes against the spirit of partnership in education and, as with so many other aspects of the Bill, enshrines in law the <i>status quo</i> when it should introduce a new dynamism and openness in the education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill retreats significantly from the original Bill in its proposals regarding support services. The range of services which the Minister is expected to deliver to students and schools has been severely cut back.  It is clear this administration does not believe that schools are in need of management, industrial relations, legal, library and media services.</P>
    <P>How any Minister for Education can absolve himself of responsibilities to support library services in schools beggars belief.  Even worse than the slashing of support services that the Minister is expected to provide is the other change introduced in section 7 of the Bill.  In the original Bill, the Minister for Education was obliged to provide all the support services outlined.  In this Bill not only is the number of support services slashed, there is no obligation on the Minister to ensure the remaining services are provided.  Under the terms of this Bill the Minister is expected to provide &ldquo;any or all of the following&rdquo;.  This is a significant dilution of the Bill and renders the provision of support services an afterthought rather than an integral part of our developing education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to address the serious failings of the education system.  There are many areas where our education system fails children, parents and the community at large.  Given the buoyancy of our Exchequer revenues, we have never been in a better position to tackle the structural problems that have plagued our education system and failed many children.  For the first time in the history of the State we have the resources available to make inroads to the failings of the education system, if the political will to invest this money exists.  What we need, and what the Bill should have sought to establish, are coherent and workable structures through which those resources can best be channelled so that they make a real difference to people's lives.  The Bill fails to do this.</P>
    <P>The problem of disruptive children who are either expelled or suspended from a school is one the Bill seems to ignore.  The issue was raised recently at the teacher conferences and by my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea, who has pressed the Minister on this matter and it is apparent there are no concrete proposals within the Department to address this issue.  The Department cannot even provide us with information to <Col N="50" /> judge the true extent of the problem.  It must be widely accepted that the process of expulsion is the worst imaginable way to deal with disruptive children.  This short-sighted policy often leads to a young person turning his or her back not only on education but on society in general and beginning a descent into crime and drug abuse.  For that reason I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify the position in relation to the legality of expulsions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come across a number of cases in my constituency and in the Dublin area generally where a student has been involved in misbehaviour of varying degrees of seriousness and the school decides to suspend and expel that student.  It is virtually impossible for that student to secure a place in another school after expulsion. An extremely tragic case was highlighted in the media in recent days, from which many questions arise.  There are many other cases where children drop out and it is impossible to get a place in an alternative school.  Are expulsions legal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clarified all those points in response to questions tabled by Deputy O'Shea on the legal situation pertaining to suspensions and expulsions.  For example, a child under 15 years of age cannot be expelled from school without the school management first ensuring there is alternative provision for that child.  That is the legal position and I have made it clear in replies. There is no mystery about the existing regulations or guidelines concerning the matter.</P>

      <P>That is helpful.  There is an obvious gap in the system in relation to this issue. There is no alternative option available to many school principals who take the decision to remove a child.  I have come across many cases where that decision has been taken and I have some sympathy with schools, especially in difficult areas, which are struggling to maintain standards, their <Col N="51" /> good name and numbers.  I have a certain sympathy with principals.  My experience is that where children have been expelled from a school, parents visit all the schools in the area but it is virtually impossible to have them placed elsewhere. I would like to go back on a number of the cases I have dealt with in recent years, in light of the Minister's clarification on that point.  Has that clarification been communicated to schools because the theory and the practice do not seem to concur?</P>
      <P>We can no longer tolerate a system whereby disruptive children are essentially placed on the scrapheap and condemned as failures at a young age.  We need to establish early intervention systems where teachers can identify children who are disruptive and, in consultation with the parents of that child, a temporary alternative to the main stream school system should be available. This alternative should have as its goal the early reintegration of the child in the mainstream school.  Unless this issue is tackled with the necessary resources and imaginative proposals the problems of teenage delinquency, early school dropouts and juvenile crime will continue to increase.  We must tackle these problems at the roots by means of early intervention.  It is one of the major challenges facing our education system and, regrettably, one the Minister has chosen to ignore in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to three areas in which the Bill is lacking.  A great deal of lip service is being paid to the rights of children with disabilities.  Those rights would seem to be contingent on resources being made available.  That stipulation is mentioned on a number of occasions throughout the Bill.  That is not good enough.  The Bill purports to make education a right but that right is subject to resources, practicability, ministerial discretion and availability.  No other right is subject to such restrictions.  There is a view that this Bill could be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I hope those who work with people with disabilities pursue that aspect of the Bill.  It is a disgrace that parents will have to seek redress in the courts in relation to their educational rights.  The Bill is seriously lacking in that regard.</P>
      <P>As a former teacher of the deaf, I am concerned about the lack of recognition of sign language in the Bill.  Those who do not work with the deaf or do not have deaf children or any contact with the deaf community sometimes find it hard to appreciate the importance of sign language. The thinking about this has changed enormously in the past few years.  I remember when children were slapped if they used sign language. However, it is not good enough to leave the use of sign language to the discretion of individual teachers or school management.  Sign language is an absolute right for deaf people and that right should be enshrined in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to consult with the Irish Deaf Society and other interested groups with a view to amending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> As someone who represents a consitutency which has 10 per cent of all disadvantaged schools &mdash; which is a good yardstick of the profile of Dublin north-west &mdash; I am disappointed at the lack of progress in extending the Breaking the Cycle scheme and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>There are still major problems as regards disadvantage and education is one of the key areas in tackling it.  This needs to be done in a targeted way, which is not happening at the moment. Despite the progress in third level spending and the IT initiative, children still come to school hungry, to overcrowded classrooms.  They do not have parental support and are slipping out of our system at an early stage.  I ask the Minister to get serious about tackling that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the contributions made on this Bill and that most people think they are experts in some area of education.  As Deputy Kenny said, the Minister for Education and Science is the political guardian of the future of our children and therefore our nation.  This is a huge responsibility which demands a great commitment. There needs to be an integration of services in the Department of Education and Science because of the different levels of education, the rural-urban divide and the advantaged-disadvantaged divide referred to by Deputy Shortall.</P>
      <P>I support the various demands for an increase in the budget allocated by the Department of Finance. There should also be greater integration in community grants to disadvantaged areas, through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  These grants are relevant to education, both at early and adult level.  Budgetary support should be given to an integrated programme for this continuous learning cycle.</P>
      <P>We cannot overemphasise the importance of pre-school education.  Our school starting age of four years is early when compared with other European countries.  There is a huge gap between the early stimulation given to children in advantaged and disadvantaged areas.  We must act affirmatively at that level.  Some children are on an uneven playing field when compared with those whose parents can afford to send them to Montessori schools and stimulating cre ches and playschools.</P>
      <P>It is now understood that the first five years of a child's life is absolutely crucial, both educationally and psychologically.  I have heard the startling statistic that we learn two thirds of what we know between zero and five years of age, and perhaps pre-birth.  This should galvanise us into making it a priority that all children get the opportunity to build on their spongelike ability to learn.  All children should be treated equally and this should continue throughout their schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Commission on the Status of Women report was published in 1973.  This made an enlightened recommendation which was never followed through by any Government.  It suggested that developers of housing estates of <Col N="53" /> above 48 or 50 houses &mdash; whether private or local authority &mdash; should not be granted planning permission unless they provided a building for use by the community or the Department of Education. This recommendation had a great deal going for it, although it is probably the responsibility of the Department of Environment and Local Government.  The cost of such a centre could be spread across a number of community groups and parents at home and those working part-time could help to run it, while continuing their education.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the issue of classrooms which are available because of the fall in the birth rate?  There are many community groups in areas such as Kilbarrack and Coolock who have utilised empty classrooms to set up adult education classes along with cre ches.  This has been hugely successful.  One cre che is run by trained staff and trainees.  Some people have done their leaving certificate and others have gone on to third level.  A study was done of the Kilbarrack project which highlighted how successful such a scheme can be.  It is a matter of integrating facilities which already exist.</P>
    <P>Valuable classroom space is also lost after school hours.  No one expects teachers who have run the gamut for hours to continue working. However, in Italy, classrooms remain open and other staff supervise study by children who might normally be wandering the streets, at home alone or who may be unable to study at home.  One of the problems is that in cramped conditions with background noise from a television or video, children find it difficult to study.  This places them at a huge disadvantage.  In Italy supervised study time forms part of teacher training to give trainee teachers hands-on experience of dealing with children while still in training college prior to their entry into the classroom.  This allows children to study in a structured way and to enter the examination room with confidence.</P>
    <P>When I explored this issue previously I was informed that there would be problems with insurance.  In this context a State insurance policy could be considered.  We are all aware of the demands on the Minister and the Education budget.  This debate presents an opportunity for lateral thinking to ensure the available facilities are used to best advantage.</P>
    <P>The findings of research into the development of rural areas commissioned by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights with particular reference to the effects of isolation indicate the need for an integrated transport system.  It has been suggested that school buses should also be used to transport the elderly in rural areas to the post office or library.  This is a wonderful idea. Although there may be problems with insurance, it would help older people to stay in touch.  This recommendation is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the disabled and children with emotional and behavioural problems. The Minister has initiated a pilot programme under which special care assistants will <Col N="54" /> be appointed to support teachers in bringing children with special needs into mainstream education. This is a wonderful initiative.  The policy now is to treat all children equally.  This places special demands on teaching staff.  The capitation grant payable in respect of pupils in special schools is much higher than that payable in respect of pupils in normal primary schools.  This runs counter to the policy of integration.  Will the Minister look at this issue?</P>
    <P>Consequent on the Anglo-Irish Agreement the Minister should consider making available special grants or investing in teacher training courses on conflict resolution.  On leaving college newly qualified teachers are expected without the necessary skills to cope with aggressive behaviour in difficult circumstances.  This places extraordinary demands on them.  With the appropriate skills they can be extraordinarily effective, particularly in group sessions, and thus help prevent bullying and expulsions and preserve and protect the authority of the teacher in the classroom.</P>
    <P>In the context of the forthcoming referenda, a civics course should be provided at primary level to give pupils an appreciation of how politics works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed so constructively to the debate on this important Bill.  I congratulate in particular Deputy Barnes who in a constructive contribution expressed some bright ideas on issues about which I am sympathetic, particularly early education.  About three weeks ago there was a major forum on early education at which for the first time every provider was brought together under the one roof.  It was a remarkable week during which there was intensive research, a presentation of papers and an exchange of views between the different groups involved.  It was chaired by Professor Houlihan who will produce a report, I hope, within six weeks which will provide a road map for the future.  I also hope to produce a White Paper on early education by the end of the year.  I agree with the Deputy that we learn more in the first three years of life than in the rest of our lives. Positive stimulation of children in the early years is critical to their subsequent performance.</P>
      <P>The basic legal structure which provides for our schools raises many fundamental issues about the education system.  What is it that gives the system its inequalities?  In the face of many changes, how can we protect its core strengths?  We need to recognise and tackle the many challenges which face us now and in the future.</P>
      <P>This Bill was produced following a process of consultation, the most intensive ever undertaken by the Department.  This is reflected by the fact that it has received a welcome from most groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have addressed a wide range of issues.  In the time available, I am not in a position to deal with most of the detailed points.  I look forward to discussing them fully on Committee Stage.  I will respond to a number of the key <Col N="55" /> themes running through the contributions of Deputies, particularly Opposition Deputies. These include the basic role which should be played by the legislation and the issues of bureaucracy and State control.</P>
    <P>We should be clear on the purpose of the Bill, what it will do and, almost as important, what it will not do.  Like similar legislation, the Bill will provide a framework for the continued development of the education system.  It will provide a structure within which the most successful elements of the system will be captured and within which the system can continue to develop successfully.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation.  It will enable us to develop the education system for the continuing benefit of all the people.  The other side of this is that it is simply absurd to expect legislation to define executional minutiae.  The idea that we should give direct and explicit statutory recognition, powers and resources to every element of the system is not credible.  This would make the system almost unworkable in practice and would directly undermine the flexibility which has enabled so many innovations in the past.  As I have demonstrated by, for example, including the National Curriculum and Assessment Council and examinations in this Bill, I have no problem with making statutory provision for the key pillars of Irish education, but this must be done within reason.</P>
    <P>I repeat the point I made at the start of this debate that legislation cannot solve all our problems. Resources are, and will continue to be, central to resolving many of the key education issues.  The distinction between the proper roles of legislation and other public policy initiatives is crucial, and I hope that Deputies will pay particular attention to this as we embark on more detailed discussions of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>Without a sound statutory basis, we will continue to experience a lack of clarity of roles in the education system, transparency and accountability will be ever more difficult to assure and the system, which has stood us in good stead in the past, will risk foundering in the future in the context of the increasingly complex circumstances in which it will operate.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise again what I hope will be gained from this Bill.  The Bill will give statutory backing to the education system and will provide an enabling framework on which the system can organically build while protecting key strengths. By subjecting the system to scrutiny by the Oireachtas, it will make it transparent and accountable.  The Bill will ensure that all the partners in education will know clearly their respective rights, roles and responsibilities and those of the other partners.  It will make the rules governing our system accessible and intelligible to all and it will give the system legal certainty and administrative clarity.</P>
    <P>While many Deputies approached the Bill in a <Col N="56" /> constructive manner, this was, unfortunately, not the case with some contributors, in particular Deputies O'Shea, Broughan and Shortall.  They accused me of taking a minimalist approach, underpinned by cuteness as distinct from the flair, incisiveness and decisiveness which they ascribed to the defeated proposals of their own party. Much of their approach revolved around the idea that the abandoned and discredited regional education boards would have provided for some major advance in education.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile to examine these claims properly.  The proposed boards were, as I said at the start of this debate, fundamentally flawed, both educationally and financially.  I still find it curious that a model based on countries with many times our population should have been proposed. It was claimed that I have moved to strengthen the existing model of control, described by Deputy Broughan as the centralised monster of Marlborough Street.  In making these statements the Deputies chose to ignore the fact that this Bill specifically creates a more transparent and inclusive system, without requiring a massive bureaucratic imposition.  The proposals which they are still wedded to would have actually extended and deepened ministerial control in all elements of the education system.  In this, it would have pursued a discredited agenda being steadily rejected throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The great myth of these regional boards is that they involved some sort of decentralising of power.  Even a cursory glance at the proposal shows how they would have provided the mechanism for strengthening central control.  The composition of each board would have been decided by the Minister; the policies followed by each board would have been decided by the Minister; the resources allocated to each board would have been decided by the Minister; and decisions made by each board could have been appealed to the Minister.  In turn, the boards were to have extended control over schools and the power to oblige them to undertake a range of administrative procedures, the execution of which, while helpful in theory, would have imposed a significant burden on individual schools.</P>
    <P>In attacking my proposals and my approach to legislation, the Labour Party has variously lauded its proposals as establishing real partnership, expanding choice, promoting decentralisation and supporting diversity.  It would also solve all problems in the areas of school accommodation, special needs, attendance and disadvantage.  In all, its proposals were to be an incomparable panacea.  I suggest that they actually represented a patent elixir of the type which used to be hawked around the American South.  In each of the areas for which it lauds its proposals, the substance of the proposals is fatally compromised.</P>
    <P>There is more than a little hint of Alice in Wonderland in the claims made on behalf of the regional boards.  Their promoters have, in the face of overwhelming arguments, stuck to <Col N="57" /> Humpty Dumpty's approach when he said, &ldquo;Words mean exactly what I choose them to mean, no more and no less&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable claims is the idea that they would have promoted partnership.  This simply cannot be reconciled with a proposal founded on extending ministerial powers.  Even today I have been attacked for failing to introduce ministerial compulsion in the area of boards of management.  I point out to the House again that I successfully concluded an agreement between all the partners in education for the establishment and election of inclusive boards of management at primary level.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this approach will lead to the same result at second level.  However, I cannot understand how compulsion in this area, or the aggressive policy advocated during this debate by some contributors, can be reconciled with partnership.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we believe in the concept of partnership then there can be no imposition of a uniform conformist model.</P>
    <P>This form of compulsion is an enemy of the diversity which some Deputies have been paying lip service to and would, in all likelihood, have failed a constitutional challenge.  In fairness to Deputy McGrath, he made a telling contribution yesterday when he supported the dropping of that section which would have involved compulsion in relation to school boards of management.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Labour Party is still wedded to a failed model rejected overwhelmingly by the partners in education and that it has failed to develop its thinking in the same sort of way that, as Deputy Bruton rightly pointed out, the British Labour Party has.  Its agenda, which may be flawed in certain executional ways, is to move towards a model closer to ours.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Deputies is a very conformist one which seems to be advocating change as an end in itself rather than as a means to an end.  This is in many ways reminiscent of the old politician's syllogism, &ldquo;Something must be done; this is something, therefore, we must do this&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that real radicalism is to have the confidence to get involved in constructive partnership.  On the issue of diversity in school choice, I would suggest to Deputies in the Labour Party that they ask the multi-denominational schools movement for their opinion of the radicalism of the last ten months versus that of the previous four and a half years in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>Some people like to adopt the policy that if you keep repeating something often enough people might start to believe you.  This is the case in relation to the inflated claims made for the regional education boards in the areas of special needs and helping the disadvantaged.  The boards would have made no substantive contribution on either issue.  The allocation of up to £40 million to the administrative cost of establishing these boards would have undermined the ability of the system to provide the resources so badly needed <Col N="58" /> in these areas.  The bottom line in terms of disability and disadvantage is resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate a couple of points on special needs education arising from comments made during the debate.  Nothing in this Bill seeks to, or could even attempt to seek to, undermine constitutional rights in relation to access to education. It has been suggested that the inclusion of specific references to resources undermines this position.  This is absolutely not the case.  These references are typical to all types of legislation and the exact same phrases in relation to resources were in the Education (No. 1) Bill advanced by my predecessor, Niamh Bhreathnach. The proposals of Opposition Deputies conformed completely to this approach.  The constitutional right is sacrosanct and is a given in terms of the formulation and presentation of legislation to the House.  In no way can this legislation undermine the fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution of access to education for all.</P>
    <P>Deputies Broughan and Shortall said that I have undertaken no initiative in the area of disadvantage. To that I would say that both Deputies simply have not been paying attention.  One of my first actions last summer was to provide an extra 1,000 places for some of the most disadvantaged through the Youthreach programme and traveller training schemes.  I have abolished examination fees for medical card holders.  I have extended maintenance grants to post leaving certificate students as and from next September.  I have secured tax relief for donations to disadvantaged schools and I have doubled the funding for adult literacy programmes from £2 million to £4 million.  I have significantly increased funding for primary books schemes and I have launched a scheme directed at 8-15 year olds in danger of leaving school early.</P>
    <P>The new institute of technology at Blanchardstown will have the unique mission of reaching out to one of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.  I have also outlined policy priorities in driving forward educational opportunity at all levels of the system.  These are concrete actions which will make a more significant contribution than the creation of a series of £40 million ministerial quangos.</P>
    <P>My intention and that of the Government is to focus on people's needs and parental choice rather than on bureaucratic or administrative structures.  I intend to channel such resources as are available for education directly into schools and other education institutions.  In the debate, many speakers pointed out how sorely these funds are needed in the classroom.  That is where I intend to see them applied.</P>
    <P>I aim to encourage the growth of local partnerships and co-operation in education, which already exist, and to enable them to develop in an organic way as the needs of communities require.  This does not need prescriptive statutory provisions which could in practice restrict development or involve the expenditure of scarce resources on bureaucratic talking shops.  Instead, <Col N="59" /> these local partnerships will allow for communities to have a say in how the local education system will be run.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few comments concerning the position of parents in the Bill's provisions. I must do this in view of the unwarranted comments that the Bill does not recognise sufficiently the rights of parents.  Parents play a uniquely important role in the education system, both at national and individual school level.  The vitally important role of parents is fully recognised in the Bill, which contains a number of specific provisions to protect and promote parents' rights in the education system and to ensure their continued participation in their children's education.</P>
    <P>Parental choice in education is an important issue.  One of the express objects of the Bill is the promotion of the right of parents to send their children to a school of their choice, having regard to patrons' rights and the effective and efficient use of resources.  At national level, the national parents' councils will be given statutory recognition and a statutory role.  Together with the other education partners, the councils will be consulted on matters of national education policy.  At individual school level, the Bill gives parents a statutory right to establish parents' associations in schools.  Boards of management must actively promote the formation of parents' associations and the inspectorate will have a statutory duty to advise parents' associations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that parents will have the right of access to records relating to their children's educational progress, that they must be consulted when the school is drawing up the school plan and that a copy of the plan must be made available to all parents.  Schools must establish mechanisms to inform parents of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school.  Parents may appeal to the Minister against decisions of teachers and boards of management which relate to a number of serious matters, particularly expulsions, suspensions and refusals to enrol, other than for reasons of lack of accommodation in schools.</P>
    <P>The involvement of parents is an important element of the partnership approach to education which I fully endorse.  This Bill reflects the important role of parents in education and gives statutory recognition to that role.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned that the Bill does not contain provisions on further education. That is not the case.  One of the objects of the Bill is to ensure that, having regard to available resources, all people should have available a level and quality of education appropriate to their needs.  This includes those who wish to take part in further education.  Furthermore, the definition of centres for education includes institutions which provide further education.  One of the Minister's specific functions under the Bill is to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education in centres for education and to provide funding to these centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Pressure of time means I cannot discuss all the details and issues raised during this debate.  We are concerned about increasing resources for children with special needs and, more importantly, to help to integrate them into mainstream education. That is and will be a significant demand on resources in the future, but it is something we must facilitate.  I have had consultations with many of the groups representing people with disabilities prior to and since the publication of this Bill with a view to tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  We will table amendments on Committee Stage dealing with the disability area and the other areas highlighted during this debate and by the various groups and partners who have consulted us since the publication of the Bill.  These amendments will help to fine tune and strengthen it from their perspectives.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to the continuation of the debate in a constructive and comprehensive way on Committee Stage.  I hope to be able to respond to the various amendments and issues the Deputies will raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the current Operational Programme <Col N="61" /> for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry some £100 million was made available for the control of farmyard pollution.  Due to the high level of demand relative to the funding provided it was necessary to suspend the acceptance of new applications on 27 April 1995.  In the context of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds in which the European Commission was involved, additional funding of £20 million was made available to the scheme in July 1997.  A further £9.5 million was allocated from Exchequer funds in the 1997 Supplementary Estimate. Therefore, considerable funding has been made available for this measure under the current programme and a large number of farmers have availed of the scheme.  Additionally, the capital allowance for necessary pollution control works was increased from £20,000 to £30,000 in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available at present under the Structural Funds programme to facilitate the reintroduction of the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  I am monitoring the situation and in the event that additional funds become available as a result of decommitments on projects in the Community Support Framework, I will press that the scheme is given priority in the disbursement of such funds.  There are currently no plans to provide Exchequer finance for a new scheme.</P>

      <P>That is all bad news.  We all recognise that scheme was useful.  However, between 25,000 and 30,000 farmers would apply to join a new scheme if one were introduced.  That is because they are dairy farmers with livestock and have a pollution problem on their farms. Given that and that many of them are pulling back from signing up for the REPS, the position will become worse.  The Department must be monitoring the number of farmers it considers would join a new scheme and I ask the Minister to elaborate on that.  Does he agree that as many as 30,000 farmers might join a new scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a beneficial scheme, but it was costly and there was a degree of front-loading in relation to it.  Initially £100 million was made available under the scheme and that was supplemented by an additional £20 million under the mid-term review which became available last July.  A further £9.5 million was made available to meet the requirements of those schemes in the <Col N="62" /> pipeline.  Capital allowances were increased from £20,000 to £30,000 which will be of considerable benefit to those who can avail of them.  I reiterate I am keeping a close eye on this matter and, if additional funds become available because of under utilised funds under headings under any of the operational programme schemes, I will seek those funds for this scheme.  In the annual Estimates, which will be prepared next autumn, I will seek, as I did last year, an increase in capital allowances to assist farmers as much as possible under this heading.</P>

      <P>Approximately 18,500 farmers have availed of the scheme since 1994 and farmers are still being paid under it.  For example, in 1997 £47 million was paid out to farmers under it and to date this year £8.5 million has been paid out under it.  Farmers are continuing to avail of capital allowances under the Finance Acts.  I am not in a position to say how many farmers would avail of a new scheme if one was introduced, but I am conscious of the importance of this scheme.  I realise the good work it has done and if further moneys are freed up under any other operational programmes this scheme is earmarked for them.  In the context of this year's annual Estimates, I will fight for additional resources for that scheme.</P>

      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were published on 18 March 1998.  A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was convened on 31 March to enable Ministers to put forward their initial responses to the proposals. At that meeting, I informed the Commissioner <Col N="63" /> and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests which would be affected by the proposals.  I told them that the proposals were seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy, and that, consequently, Ireland emphatically rejected them in their present form.</P>
      <P>During Commissioner Fischler's visit to Dublin on 25-26 March 1998, I conveyed a similar message to him about the adverse implications of the proposals for Ireland, but in greater detail.  Commissioner Fischler accepted that the proposals created difficulties for Ireland and indicated his willingness to consider alternative proposals.</P>
      <P>During the coming months of negotiations, I will put Ireland's case forcefully to my ministerial colleagues and the Commissioner both in the Council and bilaterally.  It is my objective to secure a final agreement which not only will not disadvantage Ireland but will provide a favourable framework within which the Irish agriculture and food industries can continue to develop for the benefit of those who work in those industries and for the economy as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's comments. He stated his position on his objection to Agenda 2000.  He knows from all our meetings with the farming organisations that the Oireachtas has responded jointly to this.</P>
      <P>In view of the comments of Commissioner Fischler when he came to Ireland, that there was room for negotiation in this package, and the Minister's stated intention to negotiate, has the Minister made proposals in any area for instance, to have the specialised heifer beef sector included?  Has he made proposals along those lines or is he just preparing his case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as Deputy Ferris outlined.  The precise words which Commissioner Fischler used in Dublin were that these proposals were not cut in stone and, therefore, there was room for negotiation.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the negotiations will take place throughout this calendar year.  I have established consultative groups of the main farming organisations, the participants in consensus 2000, and people from Teagasc and the universities, to go through in detail the beef, dairy, cereals and other sectors affected by the proposals and present to me in good time detailed position papers on the matters to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is uniquely important to Ireland. The beef and dairy sectors make up a considerable portion of the overall industry, and then there are sectors of the industry, such as sheep and pigs, which are left out of the proposals altogether. I want to make sure that the model of negotiations which we put forward will have the best possible result for Ireland and ensure the most equitable distribution of the support for agriculture for the next five or six years.</P>

      <P>Does that mean, in the consultations the Minister is having with the farming organisations that specific sectors will be prioritised and that we cannot concede these proposals, which the Minister said would be detrimental to the overall economic development of the industry?  Whereas there must be give and take in various sectors, in some areas that is not acceptable to the Minister, representing the Government or the farming organisations.  I ask the Minister to at least prioritise some areas which are not open to negotiation so that matters will improve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Deputy Ferris that assurance. For example, the beef sector is obviously critically important to the agricultural economy. One proposal is that intervention be abolished, which is clearly unacceptable.  There are other elements, such as the ceiling for special beef premia and the critical difficulty with extensification.</P>
      <P>With regard to milk, for example, a 2 per cent increase is proposed.  Some 1 per cent of it is available throughout the Community but the other 1 per cent is not available to Ireland.  That is clearly unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There are specific matters which are unacceptable, but right across the board the consultative groups are evaluating the pluses and minuses and the gains and losses so that we can make the best possible proposal.  As a result, we will end up with the best possible deal in the best interests of Ireland and with the most equitable distribution of the supports available.</P>

      <P>The closing date for applications under the 1998 area aid scheme is 15 May next. While some completed applications have already been received, the vast bulk are unlikely to be submitted until in or around the closing date.  I cannot, therefore, estimate the number of this year's applications which will contain errors. Moreover, I have made arrangements to put an improved processing procedure in place for the examination of applications as they are received. Any obvious errors in the application will be identified and an acknowledgement letter will issue to all applicants giving details of those errors.  This will enable the applicants concerned to rectify the situation quickly, thereby avoiding a delay in payments under the various area aid related schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also made arrangements for the area aid unit to prioritise the processing of the remaining 19,700 outstanding 1997 application forms.  Those involving outstanding payments will be dealt with first.  These mainly represent the balance of the special beef premium payments.  I am making arrangements, which will be announced within the next few days, for the area aid unit to ensure that all the outstanding cases are examined within the next three to four weeks to facilitate clearing of all cases for payment within that time.  Where a specific difficulty cannot be resolved within the unit, the applicant will be contacted directly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Area aid is probably the greatest disaster to hit the agriculture sector for many years, and I am glad the Minister is trying to do something about it.</P>
      <P>In reply to the last question I tabled on the matter, the Minister stated that there were 15,000 cases outstanding.  I am amazed today to find there are still 19,700 cases outstanding in area aid.</P>
      <P>I have two questions for the Minister.  First, there is an area aid telephone line for the general public.  One can ring it, but will never hear from the area aid unit again.  What will the Minister do about that?  The same is true of telephone lines to Deputies.</P>
      <P>Second, what will the Minister do about the mistakes of the area aid unit?  I know of a particular case where two plots of land owned by two brothers were registered in each other's names. They thought it had been rectified, but it was sent out from the area aid unit again this year in the same way.</P>
      <P>What will the Minister do about these people's payments?  Will he pay them interest because if the farmer makes a mistake he is penalised? What will the Minister do for the farmers who have waited over 12 months for their money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is as Deputy Ring outlined, that the processing of area aid payments in that section has operated unsatisfactorily.  It <Col N="66" /> has been frustrating both for farmers and public representatives making cases on their behalf.</P>
      <P>This year we have put a considerable amount of work, with additional staff, overnight work and work at weekends, into clearing up a backlog of unfinished cases.  I am not making any excuses, but the digitisation and the technical problem which had to be dealt with in a relatively short time was very time consuming.</P>
      <P>There are 19,700 cases awaiting clearance.  I have given a commitment to the House and to farming representatives that they will be cleared for payment within the next three weeks or, at the absolute maximum, four weeks so that, unless there are intractable problems, we will have a completely clean sheet at the end of that time.  I expect that 99.9 per cent of cases will be cleared so that there will be no backlog when the 1998 applications come in, the closing date for which is 15 May.  To facilitate that and to be helpful to farmers, senior staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food have had discussions with area officers to the effect that it would be much more convenient for people to go to their local office.</P>
      <P>There is a later question on this matter when I will go into greater detail.  I am making no excuses about the matter.  It has been difficult and frustrating.  Like many other Deputies, I have had to deal with problems in this regard.  Farmers, in some instances at least, seem to be harshly penalised whereas mistakes are made on both sides.</P>
      <P>An appeals system was established by my predecessor and a number of cases have been resolved satisfactorily by the appeals unit.  Applicants should, however, be as careful as possible in filling out application forms.  Together with farming representatives, we examined how the forms could be further simplified to make matters easier for applicants.  We enlisted correspondents in farming newspapers to highlight the six or seven most prevalent mistakes made in an effort to ensure the operation is run as smoothly as possible.</P>
      <P>We are talking about substantial payments from the EU and there is no gain to the national Exchequer or the Department.  The more quickly and efficiently claims are processed the better. About 47 per cent &mdash; in some cases much more &mdash; of farmers' incomes is made up of payments to which they are duly entitled and it is my objective to get the payments system running smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a scheme whereby a penalty is imposed on health boards and Government agencies if small businesses with which they are dealing are not paid promptly.  Will the Minister consider such a system in this area?  It is unfair that farmers are penalised when they make a mistake. I welcome the change in regard to inspectors. I dealt with a problem relating to area aid and it took 11 months for an inspector to call.  As Deputy Connaughton said, it would be easier for farmers to go to Castlebar or Ballina rather than wait for an inspector.  Will there be staff to man <Col N="67" /> the helpline?  The system that operated for years was scandalous in that people who did not receive payments had to contact their local councillor or TD who had to deal with the problem.  I am glad the Minister will rectify that position.  If there is a problem people should be notified immediately so that it can be corrected.</P>
      <P>I put down a question in regard to the appeals unit.  It takes about five to six months for an appeal to be heard.  Are the three Ministers doing anything in the Department?  The whole system has collapsed since they came to office.</P>

There are commitments under the charter relating to the balancing payments under the special beef premium. It states that most payments will be completed by the end of March and the remainder by 30 June in line with EU requirements.  I can give an absolute guarantee that all payments will be made long before that time.  While the position is unsatisfactory, compared with other EU countries, standards laid down in the charter and EU requirements, deadlines are more than adequately met.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on the EU Commission proposals for reform in the milk sector have only begun and are likely to take some time. I have already made clear my position in regard to certain aspects of the proposals both to Commissioner Fischler and to my colleagues at the Council of Ministers, in particular as regards the allocation of additional quota between member states and the inadequate level of compensation for the proposed price cuts.  I have highlighted the economic importance of the milk sector to this country as well as the role of milk production in protecting viability at farm level.  During the course of the negotiations, which are not expected to be finalised for some time, I will <Col N="68" /> place very strong emphasis on protecting the interests of all Irish milk producers, including small-scale producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is a precedent at Council of Ministers level in so far as the importance of the dairy sector to the Irish economy was recognised when quotas were introduced? Ireland received an increased quota over and above that of other member states.  The negotiations took place in 1983 and we were allowed 4.3 per cent on top of that year's production.  In that context will the Minister reactivate the commitments given at that time that in the event of the national quota being increased the importance of the dairy sector to the agricultural economy would justify an increase in quota over an above the European average?</P>
      <P>Will he accept that the proposal from Commissioner Fischler is a betrayal of the commitments given in so far as a 1 per cent increase is unacceptable?  Thousands of young farmers are being forced out of dairy production because they cannot get additional quotas.  Will the Minister consider this issue as a core principle?  The European Commission should be told that we will not accept a gallon less than any other country in the context of additional quotas.  The Austrians will receive an increase of 7 per cent and Finland 8 per cent.  This country deserves increases of that order on foot of the commitments given and recognition of the importance of dairying to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983 when my predecessor, Deputy Deasy, was Minister responsible, a relatively good deal was done for Ireland.  The volume of milk was calculated in line with production in the previous three years and we received an increase in excess of 4 per cent, which was a good deal.  The difficulty is that we started from a low base.  Many improvements have taken place in technology, yields and production since then.  It is unacceptable that some European countries get considerable increases while we are excluded.  The Deputy is correct in stating that Finland, Austria and Spain received increases of 8.4 per cent, 6.8 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. Under the additional 1 per cent, Ireland will not receive an increase.  That is clearly unacceptable, particularly in light of the addendum written into the Council regulation in 1983 which specifically stated Ireland would be given priority in the event of additional quotas being made available.  I made that clear in my submission to the Council of Ministers and in bilateral negotiations with Commissioner Fischler in Dublin.  There are no circumstances under which the current proposals are acceptable.  At the very minimum, there must be equity among member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further anomaly which is detrimental to Ireland involves butter fat.  Members will be aware that many farmers face penalisation this year in respect of butter fat whereas they have <Col N="69" /> been able to utilise a number of disciplines to remain within the parameters regarding volume. The butter fat level for Ireland was set at 3.58 per cent.  I understand the level for this year will pan out at 3.6 per cent.  Nonetheless, this will incur a quite substantial penalty.  The average level for the European Union is 4.1 per cent.  Therefore, other member states can produce butter fat at this level and incur no penalties while Ireland, with its 3.6 per cent level, incurs penalties.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to make progress in respect of both constituents and volume, particularly in light of the written declaration appended to the 1983 arrangement.  We are entitled to any increases on offer.  As the Deputy pointed out, there are thousands of young farmers, new entrants and existing quota holders who could benefit from the provision of additional quotas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for indicating that not a gallon less than the increases given to other countries will be acceptable to Ireland. With regard to milk quotas and the Fischler proposals, a central plank of the compensation packages that have been published involves the payment of premia in respect of dairy cows.  There is a proposal which is gaining considerable momentum, that the dairy cow premium should be targeted at smaller producers.  A further proposal from certain members of the IFA suggests that the premium should not be made available to anyone with a herd of more than 30 dairy cows. Would the Minister favour that proposal in an effort to maintain the economic viability of as many small dairy producers as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on a number of occasions in respect of the Santer proposals that I am extremely conscious of the degree of equity and support for the Irish industry.  Supports for the different sectors should be granted at the level to which we are entitled and they should also be distributed fairly and equitably.  In the context of the advice I will receive, particularly from the consultative groups which have been established, I will consider the different models suggested in terms of my negotiating position.  I will be obliged to choose the model which best suits Ireland, from which we can obtain the best deal and which will benefit the greatest number of farmers.  We are not yet in a position to consider this matter in the global context but we will seek the best deal for Ireland and the greatest degree of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe equity should be applied to all producers equally or should it involve front-loading compensation premiums for smaller producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering our experience to date in respect of a number of European schemes, there is no doubt that 80 per cent of the supports on offer were initially given to 20 per cent of farmers.  Over the years that ratio levelled out somewhat to 70:30.  It is desirable to encourage <Col N="70" /> more equitable distribution.  A number of the proposed measures will provide an opportunity to include a greater degree of equity in the final outcome.  However, that outcome will be based on what is best for the country and will contain a degree of fairness and equity.</P>

      <P>In the context of the case the Minister intends to make in respect of milk quotas, I assume he will strongly highlight the fact that the only hope young Irish people have of taking up farming as a profession lies in the provision of reasonable milk quotas.  Will it be possible for the Minister, outside the realm of the negotiations on the Santer proposals, to make a case for farmers who marginally exceed the butter fat limit?  Will the Minister be able to put such a case to the European Union in the next few weeks?</P>

      <P>At the next meeting of the Council of Ministers there will be an opportunity, in the context of this year's price proposals, to raise the last matter to which the Deputy referred.  I take the Deputy's point and I assure him I will make the case.</P>
      <P>With regard to the milk industry, many Members have had cases brought to their attention, particularly in the context of the farm retirement scheme, where families who have owned farms for generations are finding it extremely difficult to encourage their sons or daughters to assume responsibility for those farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worrying aspect of current social change and we will do everything possible to redress the problem.  However, that is easier said than done because young people have become more mobile as a result of our excellent education system and they are now in a position to take advantage of better opportunities at home and abroad.  It is becoming extremely difficult to encourage people to remain in farming.  If their parents cannot convince them, it will be difficult for us to do so.  However, if we can make their choice more attractive by virtue of the policies upon which we embark, we will do so.</P>

Will the Minister lend his support to that initiative, in respect of which there has been <Col N="71" /> strong lobbying and which is being favourably received?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the benchmark of 3.58 per cent in respect of butter fat is extremely low in modern farming terms given the progress made in improving the production of this substance through better management and breeding standards applied to our dairy herds? Will he make a case to the Council of Minister's to have the level increased substantially and backdated for one to two years to assist the many progressive farmers who have suffered greatly? These individuals have complied with their quotas to the exact gallonage but they are incurring severe penalties because of the low benchmark set in respect of butter fat.</P>

The timing is appropriate in the context of the peace agreement in that this would be a dividend arising out of that settlement.  I redoubled my efforts and got the process moving again.

      <P>I am pleased to confirm that agreement was reached last weekend between exporters and Gaelic Ferries, operators of the Cork-Cherbourg ferry service, on the next phase of the operation of the service which was started last October with Government support and which proved highly successful in facilitating our live export trade.  This agreement, a key element of which is an equity investment by the EU Livestock Exporters Co-operative, assures the continuation of the service in the medium term, using a new vessel, the <i>MV Francoise</i>, and secures the direct involvement of livestock and other exporters in its operation.</P>
      <P>Over the coming weeks Gaelic Ferries, with the active involvement of exporter representatives, will be evaluating a number of options aimed at securing the long-term future of the operation.  I urge all exporters, most particularly those involved in the livestock and agri-food areas, to make full use of the service and thereby enhance its long-term viability.</P>
      <P>On the live cattle trade to third countries, Egypt and Libya are the main traditional markets remaining closed to live cattle from Ireland.  Following my visit to Cairo last September, I forwarded a detailed proposal in November to the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture for a trial shipment of live cattle to Egypt. The proposal was discussed with the Egyptian authorities during a visit of a technical delegation from the Department of Agriculture and Food to Cairo in February.  While the proposal remains under consideration, and considerable technical information has been provided, the Egyptian authorities have not made a final positive decision.  In the meantime, imports of Irish beef to the Egyptian market have increased significantly. Contact will be maintained with Egypt and every possible effort is being made through unilateral contact and technical discussion to secure a re-opening of the trade.</P>
      <P>As regards Libya, efforts are also continuing to have the ban on live cattle imports from Ireland removed.  A response to an invitation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to senior Libyan officials to visit Ireland for discussions on a range of matters of mutual interest and concern is awaited.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the new French ship will sail with live cattle.  I thank the Minister and the Government &mdash; I have said this publicly &mdash; for their investment in the <i>Purbeck</i> but I am concerned about the current stop-go approach.  Last week, many of the exporters and transporters did not know there would be a vessel available to export animals in a few days.  I do <Col N="73" /> not have to tell the Minister that causes enormous problems for the people buying the product at the other end, having regard to continuity of supply. I am further told by people involved in the trade that this process is on trial for a month and that a new financial arrangement will have to be put in place to ensure its continuity.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that his heart is not in the live export trade.  Four or five months ago, the Minister was told in Cairo there would be a trial shipment of cattle, yet a single animal has not left our shores for Egypt.  What sort of trial shipment was the Minister talking about?  Will he acknowledge that for an agricultural country like Ireland, which exports eight out of every ten animals, a live cattle export trade is vital for competition?</P>
      <P>The Government is not taking this issue seriously.  Thankfully, most sectors are doing well but not the agricultural sector.  Confidence would be restored to that sector if it were known that later this summer the ship would sail with live cattle, but I do not believe the Minister's heart is in this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of elements to the Deputy's question.  In relation to the <i>Purbeck</i>, we did not have a ferry service last October.  The <i>Purbeck</i> was put on the high seas to provide a service and Exchequer funding was allocated. That worked relatively well and it was reflected in better prices, especially for weanlings and younger cattle over the winter.  An excellent service was provided but, nonetheless, after six months the operators of the <i>Purbeck</i> said the ferry was losing money.  We did not get the support we would have liked from the industry, the co-operatives or the producers.  There were vacant spaces on the ship most weeks, both for dry goods and cattle, and the arrangement was about to collapse until the farming organisations, the exporters and the Department of Agriculture and Food came together a week ago to further support the service.  I confirm that support will be for one month to allow some breathing space to put together a more substantial package.</P>
      <P>I must pay tribute to Tom Parlon, the President of the IFA, the exporters' association, the port of Cork and Gaelic Ferries.  The port of Cork has been exceptionally helpful in the whole matter.  I hope and expect that the new arrangement will not only be put in place but will remain in place because for a country like Ireland, which depends on exports, we need access to the markets by way of a ferry.</P>
      <P>In relation to live exports generally, the last time I left office in excess of 400,000 live cattle were shipped from Ireland.  It was a different story when I returned to office last summer; the trade had totally collapsed.  I do not blame anybody for that because BSE was the main cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for a live trade because we need access to all markets and we want to have a degree of competition within the country.  It has been proven over and over again that the live trade, more than anything else, is reflected in the marts.  I and my predecessors made every effort to retain access to all markets as far as was possible and to ensure that markets in Egypt and Libya, the two countries which represented the best uptake of live cattle from Ireland in recent years, are reopened as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Connaughton's comments on the fringe connection.  The difficulty about the stop-go approach is that nobody seems to be sure what is happening, particularly the producers.</P>
      <P>On live exports to Libya and the Egyptian trade, at every meeting I attended in the months running up to the election, at which the Minister of State was also present, our party and the Tánaiste at the time were treated as a whipping boy, not alone by every farming organisation but by every Fianna Fáil politician because of all the things they could and should do but were not doing.  When we produced evidence of the work we were doing we got no thanks and no credit. Nothing has changed in these two markets since then.  The IFA has made some progress in Libya, but animals have not left here to go there and live trade has not been reopened with the Egyptians in spite of all our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Government was supposed to have political influence with the Libyans and promised that trade with them would be opened once it was in office, but I have been extremely disappointed. The live trade is a fundamental part of the cattle industry.  Unless we have that outlet, the trade will be dominated by the factories, and we know what the cost of that will be to farmers.  We are with the Minister in what he wants to do, but we <Col N="75" /> do not think he is doing enough.  He should show more initiative, use the diplomacy that is available to him and which he asked us to use.  Now that it is available to him he should use it and we might get some cattle to Libya, Egypt, Iran and other places where we have all been trying for the past two years to open markets.  Now that the Minister is in power, and all the ambassadors and foreign ministers are available to him, he should do what he said he would do and he will have the support of every one of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  My predecessor visited Tripoli in July 1996.  He also visited Cairo. We heard the announcement on the day of the election.  Above and beyond the call of duty visitations were made and technical delegations were sent.  Similarly on this occasion, I have been to Cairo and I have been in contact with the Libyan authorities.  My Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, went to Rome and met the Libyan Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, made direct contact with his counterpart in Tripoli and invited a technical delegate to Ireland.  Our chief veterinary officer and our top technical people have gone to those countries.  Our ambassadors are in constant touch there and we have provided them with any assurances they requested.  When I was in Cairo the case was made to me that Egypt took about 25,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1996.  Last year they took almost double that. They make the point that the increase in the amount of beef more than compensates for the number of live cattle.  I made the point that live cattle were a critical element as far as we were concerned, that we need the live trade.  To that end, not alone did we send technical delegations at veterinary level but we also sent engineers to make sure that one of their plants was dedicated and revamped to slaughter Irish live cattle, because they were concerned about the removal of risk material following the BSE problem, which we agreed to sort out for them.  That was done and all assurances were given.  Nevertheless, when it comes to doing a deal and making arrangements, it takes two to do it.  We want to sell cattle.  The Egyptians and the Libyans can buy them, but until they make a decision to buy, we can only continue to exert as much political, diplomatic and technical pressure as we possibly can, and we are doing that.</P>

It has come to my notice that, through an <Col N="76" /> exporter, a trade mission from Bosnia sought to be met here in Dublin on this issue and up to last week nobody invited them for a meeting or acknowledged their request.  If that happened, it is evidence of the malaise that exists in that we are ignoring potential markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm or deny that the Egyptians are looking for financial assistance or personnel from the Irish Government to deal with specified risk material in Egypt if the live export trade is to be reopened?  Is there also a question of funding a permanent delegation from the Egyptian veterinary authorities in Dublin before any progress can be made on reopening markets?  If that is the case, is the Government prepared to meet those demands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>When the current Minister was in power previously he closed the port of Greenore.  That proves his lack of commitment. His junior minister reopened it.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he said that the only reason these markets were not being opened was that the Taoiseach of the day and, above all, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day did not go out to those countries.  Is the Government committed to reopening those markets?  The Minister is obviously making some effort, but there does not seem to be any commitment from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Some members of the Minister's party went to Iran and claimed responsibility in Opposition for opening the market there.  The Minister is now in Government and farmers are looking for a commitment and delivery of those markets that the three Ministers sitting opposite said could be easily opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of the matter relating to Bosnia but if Deputy Connaughton gives me the details I will follow it up.  Regarding Deputy Creed's question on Egypt, to my knowledge there has been no request for additional personnel or financial support in relation to any aspect of the reopening of the market there.  The point the Egyptians made over and over again is that they are pleased with the quality of Irish beef and want to continue to import it.  Already this year they have imported 10,000 tonnes of Irish beef which is the equivalent of 30,000 head of cattle.  The reason they are doing that is that they are assured the beef they receive is the same as that available domestically and throughout the European Union.  They are happy that any risk material is removed from it.  We want the live trade opened in parallel and we continue to make every effort to achieve that.  All assurances have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greenore was closed for some time to ensure that standards were met.  There are rigorous standards for animal welfare on which I will insist. In exporting live cattle layerage, ventilation, feed, <Col N="77" /> water and a total absence of cruelty are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will insist on such standards without apology.  We have not had difficulties with standards in recent years.  We surpass the highest EU standards.  If there is any diminution of standards there will be difficulties for those responsible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the live trade, the Government is making every possible effort.  In the case of Egypt it was unprecedented for an Irish Minister to visit there when they had an acute difficulty with violence.  The Minister, Deputy McDaid, visited Egypt and supported the tourism industry there.  That was done in the interests of goodwill and in supporting our case to have the live cattle trade reopened.  At prime ministerial level Irish agriculture is always a priority in bilateral meetings.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of research, training and advisory services for the agri-food industry has been assigned to Teagasc by statute.  Questions about the extent of training given to Teagasc advisers are, therefore, a matter for Teagasc.  During the five year period 1993-7 finance of almost £66,000 has been provided to the three private inspection bodies approved by my Department for carrying out inspections on organic production of agricultural crop products.  In addition, during the same period about £41,000 was paid to the inspection bodies for approved marketing and promotional projects and for updating facilities under the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-1999.  My Department also provided a grant-in-aid allocation of over £37,000 to one of the approved inspection bodies during the start-up and implementation phase of the organic regime under EU Regulation 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural crop products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that matters relating to Teagasc are its business.  Will the Government follow the example of other EU member states by setting targets for organic farming?  Sweden <Col N="78" /> aims to have 10 per cent of its farming organic by 2000, while Austria already has 10 per cent and in some regions, Salzburg for example, it is as high as 50 per cent.  Has the Government a target to back up Teagasc, which I understand is embarking on training?</P>
      <P>With regard to the finance mentioned, was the expenditure from EU or Exchequer funds?  Will the Minister of State give an indication of the Government's commitment over and above EU funding to organic farming which may allow us to match the seriousness with which other EU countries treat organic farming?</P>
      <P>There are farmers who do not have farms which qualify under the REP scheme but who are interested in converting to organic farming.  Are there any means other than the REP scheme by which they can do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Teagasc is running an organic farm at Johnstown Castle and I had discussions with officials there this week.  They have put proposals to me which are being considered.  There is not a target percentage.  The organic market in Ireland is about 2 per cent and we have not yet fulfilled that market, although it is growing.  With the proposed changes to agriculture over the next few years there will be a greater amount of more environmentally friendly farming, although not strictly organic.  There is a potential for export above the 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The funds are 75 per cent EU funds and 25 per cent Exchequer funds.  It is the Department's intention to encourage more farmers to get involved in organic farming.  However, it is an essential part of organic farming that the REP scheme payment is made to people who can then qualify.  It is a help in production.  In the last couple of days the price for organically produced cattle, for which there is no regulation in the EU at present although the matter is under discussion, is £1.30 per pound.  It would seem an attractive area from that perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister of State mention the organic livestock sector. As he pointed out, the inspection of organic livestock farms does not qualify for funding.  Is that a matter for interpretation at governmental level? I have heard it said that other countries manage to include livestock farming in the funding for inspections.  Is anything being done nationally to ensure that livestock farms will be funded?  At present the organic organisations make up for the shortfall by sharing the cost between the other sectors to level out the charges.  Will that matter be resolved soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>At present individual livestock farmers pay for the inspections.  There is no regulation in the EU at present with regard to livestock and hopefully that will be remedied shortly when agreement is reached.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a difficulty in agreeing what is and what is not organic.  There are people selling <Col N="79" /> produce which is not organic as organic.  I am aware of a market in my area where people who have a different lifestyle from normal are prepared to offer non-organic produce as organic. People believe them and it is the perception that is important.  There is a difficulty in agreeing a standard for organic livestock.  At present, individual farmers pay for the inspections themselves but they are in receipt of substantial REP scheme payments.</P>

      <P>I have had occasion, like other Deputies, to bring people to Hume House who were experiencing problems with their maps. This should not be necessary.  Trained staff should be recruited in local offices to examine maps.  It is ridiculous that people from Ballinasloe and elsewhere have to take a bus to Dublin to argue their case in Hume House.  Because of the intricacies of maps, these difficulties cannot be resolved over the telephone or by letter.  Trained staff in local offices, who would have a direct link to Hume House, could assist people with their problems.  This would alleviate much of the frustration in a week or two.  The Minister should adopt a similar strategy to that which he has adopted for the 1998 area aid applications forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the important matter of school caretakers' pay.  It is particularly important in my constituency which embraces two satellite towns in west Dublin where there are large primary and post-primary schools.  The caretaking of them is a matter of great importance.  It is an anomaly that a primary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils should be treated differently from a post-primary school with a similar enrolment in terms of caretaking.  I hope the Minister of State clarifies and gives a positive response to the request that the caretaking of large primary schools be treated similarly to post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>In primary schools, caretakers are not recognised by the Department and community minded people working in them do not benefit like their equivalents in post-primary schools.  They do not have pension rights or receive incremental adjustments under pay agreements.  It is unfair that those who take on the responsibility of caretaking in primary schools should be treated differently. The issue has been raised by a number of boards of management and is a source of continual problems.</P>
      <P>The availability of finance for caretakers in primary schools takes a different form from post-primary schools.  The Department should provide the same financial support to both types of school and, for example, a minimum enrolment number of 500 could be set which would not cost the Exchequer a substantial sum as it is not desirable that it would.  The Department indirectly pays a higher price because of vandalism which could be prevented if caretaking was put on a proper footing for primary schools.  Is it the Department's intention to do so, including a minimum enrolment figure?  The primary sector continually complains it is the Cinderella of the education system and this anomaly in regard to ancillary staff reinforces that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary and second level schools <Col N="84" /> under a number of different schemes, which I will outline in detail.  At primary level, the Department funds caretaking services under two separate schemes.  One scheme was initiated in 1979 under which the Department meets the full cost of the caretaker's salary and employer's PRSI. However, it has been phased out since September 1992 as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The second scheme involves the provision by our Department of additional capitation grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP.  It was introduced on a phased basis, commencing in September 1992.  Initially the scheme catered for schools with an enrolment of 500 or more pupils, but the qualifying figure has been reduced in stages and stands at 195 pupils.  Ultimately, all schools with enrolments of 100 or more pupils will benefit from this scheme.  All schools in the scheme receive grants of £15 per pupil, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 per annum.  The arrangement is that the caretaker is employed by the individual school and the Department does not have any role in determining the pay or conditions under which they are engaged.</P>
      <P>We are committed to seeking improvements in the rate of the grant, and securing an increase in the maximum grant payable to schools under this scheme as resources allow.  At second level, the position is that separate schemes operate in the three different sectors.  Caretakers in secondary schools are employed by individual schools and the Department has no role in their appointment. Their conditions of service and pay rates are agreed between the caretaker and the employing school.  Issues relating to the payment of national pay increases etc., are for negotiation and agreement, between the employing school, which is a private institution and the employee.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the Department has given financial assistance towards the provision of caretaking services in secondary schools.  All such schools with enrolments of 200 or more recognised pupils receive an additional capitation grant of £25 per pupil per annum, subject to a maximum of £8,750 per annum.  As with primary schools, we are looking at ways of improving the situation of secondary schools, which receive assistance under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Caretakers in schools controlled by vocational education committees are employed by the various committees concerned.  Caretakers are employed directly by community and comprehensive schools.  In both cases, however, pay and conditions of employment are negotiated centrally, between the Department and the unions, and the Department provides funding for caretaker pay costs, through direct grants paid to the vocational education committees and the schools, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> I appreciate that, where there are a number of different schemes in operation, it is almost inevitable that anomalies will arise.  However, the differing schemes are not directly comparable in that some of them provide for the direct employment of caretakers whereas the 1992 PESP scheme provides additional capitation grants to <Col N="86" /> schools.  As indicated earlier, however, we will continue to seek improvements in the level of assistance available under the 1992 PESP scheme.</P>

      <P>Official statistics relating to exports of live animals are maintained by the Central Statistics Office, and the last complete year for such data is 1996.  These show that the following live animals were exported from Ireland in 1996: bovines, 191,296; pigs, 259,300; sheep, 130,176; horses, 2,097; poultry, 1,330,945; and other, 179. It should be noted, however, that the Central Statistics Office has indicated that data relating to trade statistics on live animals from 1 January 1993 may be incomplete as Customs border checks on intra-Community trade, following the introduction of the Single European Market, were in many instances eliminated.  This had a direct impact on the timeliness and accuracy of data previously supplied to the CSO by Revenue. Figures maintained by my Department, for internal purposes, on exports of cattle, are broadly in line with the figures provided by the CSO.</P>

      <P>One of the key priorities in An Action Programme for the Millennium is &ldquo;To recognise the role of women in agriculture by setting up a special advisory committee to advise on and monitor progress, with policy initiatives to support women in agriculture.  This will include setting up a network of women in farming, and addressing the specific training requirements of women in agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in an earlier reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy McManus my Department will soon consult relevant organisations and agencies on the establishment of the committee to advise on and monitor the role of women in agriculture.  I am anxious however that the proposed committee should build as far as possible on the excellent work already being done by existing groups and agencies and by my Department.  In this context I will mention what is already being done in the normal course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development, OPARDF, made important commitments on equal opportunities for women.  An evaluation of progress made on these commitments has been undertaken on behalf of the OPARDF monitoring committee. All of my Department's schemes are open equally to men and women, but there may be reasons women are not always in a position to avail fully of all the opportunities offered.  Teagasc has consulted women's groups on their training <Col N="89" /> needs and has taken several initiatives aimed at increasing female participation in training courses and these activities are also reported to the OPARDF monitoring committee.  A major strategic planning initiative entitled &lsquo;Teagasc 2000&rsquo; currently being finalised, will further address the training requirements of women in agriculture.</P>
    <P>In common with Deputies, I am also conscious of the progress reports of the monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and, in particular, the recommendations of the commission in relation to rural women.  Provision has also been made for participation by the ICA and the National Women's Council in the recently formed experts group to advise on rural development issues in Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>A very considerable amount of preparatory work has been finalised in regard to the national beef assurance scheme.  The introduction of a comprehensive animal identification and tracing system is one of the major elements of the scheme.  The other main element is the establishment of integrated protocols of standards from production to processing to be enforced through a system of registration and approval for participants.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be implemented later this year.  Discussions are taking place with all interested parties in the industry regarding the details of the protocols and the practical implementation of standards and it is hoped that these discussions will be completed shortly.  The process of registering and approving participants will then follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many elements of an animal identification and tracing system are already operational, including bovine tagging, cattle passports, calf birth registration and a computerised animal location file. The final element of animal traceability will come into operation later this year with the introduction of the computerised cattle movement monitoring system.  This system involves the collection of animal movement data electronically from marts, meat plants and live export points and the use of a paper notification system to record other movements.  It is a massive task which entails recording the many millions of movements of cattle each year and the use of this data to validate <Col N="90" /> the life history of cattle before they enter the food chain.  The detailed arrangements such as development of computer programme, installation of computer equipment and training are already well advanced and will be completed over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the national beef assurance scheme will provide important guarantees regarding food safety to all consumers of Irish beef at home and abroad and it is important that it is introduced as quickly as possible.  I believe that this is acknowledged by all elements of the industry and with the commitment and co-operation of the different interests the objective of the scheme can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 26 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were published on 18 March 1998.  A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was convened on 31 March 1998 to enable Ministers to put forward their initial responses to the proposals.  At that meeting, I informed the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests that would be affected by the proposals and told them that the proposals were seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and that, consequently, Ireland emphatically rejected them in their present form.</P>
      <P>During Commissioner Fischler's visit to Dublin on 25-26 March 1998, I conveyed a similar message to him about the adverse implications of the proposals for Ireland but in greater detail.  Commissioner Fischler accepted that the proposals created difficulties for Ireland and indicated his willingness to consider alternative proposals.</P>
      <P>During the coming months of negotiations, I will put Ireland's case forcefully to my ministerial colleagues and to the Commissioner both in the Council and bilaterally.  It is my objective to secure a final agreement which not only will not disadvantage Ireland but will provide a favourable framework within which the Irish agriculture and food industries can continue to develop for the benefit of those who work in those industries and the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to livestock headage and premia application forms is that box reference numbers are necessary for computer purposes only and are not critical to a farmer when completing his/her form.  All information required is requested by question or box heading and it is a matter for the applicant to respond to the questions asked by inserting information in these reference boxes but he-she does not need to take cognisance of the reference number on each of these boxes.  The information sought in all cases is specific information about the applicant's own animals or land and should be readily available.</P>
      <P>My main aim is to ensure that forms are as user friendly as possible whilst ensuring that all necessary data is captured on the forms.  It is a matter of having the balance right so that obvious errors are eliminated and applications are processed in as efficient a manner as possible.  While the present forms are recognised as being user friendly, the matter is being kept under review and any helpful suggestions will be considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 11 of 26 February 1998 genetically engineered crops have considerable potential for the production of safer and cheaper food.  Genetically modified organisms have been used extensively in the production of food and food ingredients in some countries.</P>
      <P>Product development research is ongoing worldwide, including limited field trials of genetically modified sugar beet plants in this country. Pending the outcome of the development research stage on new products, it would be inappropriate to come to any conclusions on their possible future use for food or feed purposes.  I am conscious of public concern regarding genetically modified products, and I believe their development and use should proceed on a precautionary basis in the best interests of both consumers and the environment.</P>
      <P>European Union legislation concerning the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment for development research purposes and, in appropriate cases, the subsequent placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients is implemented at national level by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Children respectively.</P>

      <P>The vast bulk of BSE payments outstanding at this stage are top-up payments to those farmers who had more animals qualifying for suckler cow and special beef premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.  The position is that the EU regulations governing payment of BSE top-ups, which were paid in October 1996, provided for top-up payments in respect of animals qualifying for the 1995 suckler cow premium and special beef premium.  The EU insisted that the top-up payments should be based on the 1995 schemes in order that the payments could be made as early as possible and certainly before the EU financial year deadline of 15 October 1996.  The regulations also provided for appropriate adjustments later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for the suckler cow and special beef premium in 1996.  Money was to be recouped from those farmers who were overpaid compensation on the grounds that they had fewer animals qualifying for the premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.  Money so recouped was to form a pool of money from which further top-up payments are to be made to those farmers who had more animals qualifying for premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this pool of money is to <Col N="97" /> be used to make the outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  Obviously, it is important that as much money as possible can be recovered before striking a rate for payment of additional top-ups.  It is expected that payments of the outstanding amounts due will be made in June 1998.</P>
    <P>Additionally, a small number of beef producers are due BSE compensation payments arising from the package of measures worth some £30.54 million to beef producers and which was to be paid by the EU deadline of 15 October 1997.  By that deadline a small number of producers had failed to establish eligibility and the majority have since been paid from Exchequer funds.  At this stage only residual cases with queries outstanding remain to be paid.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to confirm that agreement was reached last week between exporters and Gaelic Ferries, operators of the Cork-Cherbourg ferry service, on the next phase of the operation of the service, which was started last October with Government support and which proved highly successful in facilitating the export trade. This agreement, a key element of which is an equity investment by the EU Livestock Exporters Co-operative, assures the continuation of the service in the medium term, using a new vessel, the mv <i>Francoise,</i> and secures the direct involvement of livestock and other exporters in its operation.</P>
      <P>Over the coming weeks Gaelic Ferries, with the active involvement of exporter representatives, will be evaluating a number of options aimed at securing the long-term future of the operation.</P>
      <P>I would urge all exporters, most particularly those involved in the livestock and agri-food areas, to make full use of the service and thereby enhance its long-term viability.</P>

      <P>A number of measures have been taken to address the situation referred to by the Deputy.  A report is currently being prepared for Forfás as part of the <Col N="100" /> EMU business awareness campaign which Forfás is managing on behalf of the Government.  The purpose of the report is to identify actions that companies can take themselves to counter possible adverse variations in the sterling/euro rate after EMU.</P>
      <P>This report will be completed within a few weeks at which time its recommendations will be fully considered.  The findings of the report will also have a wide distribution amongst businesses as they will be included as part of the information pack of the EMU business awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above there are other measures that are being taken to safeguard the interests of Irish businesses, including the following: in anticipation of EMU, ABT has been given a specific target to lessen our dependence on the UK market and to increase the proportion of our indigenous exports going to continental EU markets by 2 per cent per annum up to 1999; ABT has also published an EMU guide for exporters which deals specifically with the marketing challenges and opportunities presented by EMU; the Forfás business awareness campaign is itself primarily aimed at SMEs and is designed to ensure that Irish business is fully prepared to meet the practical challenges of EMU.</P>
      <P>Some of the foregoing initiatives are predicated on the possibility of a significant and sudden decline in the value of sterling.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are far from such a situation at the moment and the possibility of a significant competitive challenge arising from a steep decline in sterling's value must be considered doubtful, at least in the short term.</P>

Both bilaterally and together with our European Union partners, the Government has availed of every appropriate opportunity to convey its concerns about an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.  These concerns have been conveyed both directly to the Nigerian authorities and at the UN and other appropriate fora.  Along with our European Union partners, we have also repeatedly expressed our willingness to engage in a dialogue with the Nigerian Government on these matters.  However, there has been no response to date to such offers, in terms of a concrete dialogue.  In the absence of such a framework for dialogue, the Government will continue to support strongly concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democratic government and full observance of human rights in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>Most recently, the Government supported the Resolution on Nigeria which was adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on 21 April 1998. This Resolution expresses deep concern at continuing grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Nigeria and calls upon the Government of Nigeria to ensure urgently the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including by respecting the right to life, by releasing all political prisoners, by guaranteeing freedom of the press, freedom of opinion and association and by respecting the rights of individuals, including persons belonging to minorities.</P>

      <P>I have made arrangements for the area aid unit to prioritise the processing of the remaining <Col N="104" /> 19,700 outstanding 1997 application forms. Those involving outstanding payments will be dealt with first.  These mainly represent the balance of the special beef premium payments.  I am making arrangements, which will be announced within the next few days, for the area aid unit to ensure that all of the outstanding cases are examined within the coming three to four weeks to facilitate clearing of all cases for payment.  Where a specific difficulty cannot be resolved within the unit, the applicant will be contacted directly.</P>

      <P>My Department has been in correspondence with the person named in connection with an invalid tag number listed on his 1997 cattle headage application form.  In a letter from the person named, received in the local office of my Department on 17 April 1998, he stated that the animal, which was appearing as an invalid tag number, was now retagged and he submitted the new tag number.  Following further office checks it could not be established that any animal had been retagged in the herd of the person named. He is now being informed of this position and that the original animal applied on will be rejected.  Payment will be made, with the consequent reduction penalty, on the remaining eligible animals within the next two weeks.  My Department has no record of an application from the person named under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is directly responsible only for Civil Service pensioners.  In the case of those pensioners, because of the complexities of the various restructuring deals, it is necessary to examine most pensioner files manually, in consultation with other Departments, in order to determine what increase is due.  In many cases, manual examination of files is also necessary to determine which restructuring deal is applicable to the individual pensioner.  The number of pensioner files involving manual examination is over 9,000.  The work in my Department has been ongoing on the implementation of this decision since its announcement last November and the full amounts due have been paid in some cases.  I would add that some pensioners are not yet in a position to benefit because restructuring deals have not yet been concluded for their serving counterparts.  An advance payment was made to a substantial proportion of pensioners before Christmas.</P>
      <P>As regards other areas of the public service, my Department issued instructions last November on the implementation of the Government decision along with a request to make the relevant payments as quickly as possible.  I understand that the payment of arrears has been completed in many cases.</P>

      <P>It should also be noted that services at the hospital are being developed on an ongoing basis. This year's financial allocation makes provision for the development of endocrinology and speech and language services.  Other developments in rheumatology, orthopaedic, radiology and occupational therapy services have been implemented.  There has also been significant investment in improving the range and type of medical equipment available at the hospital.</P>

      <P>I recently approved a package of enhanced financial supports for student nurses participating in the nursing registration diploma programmes, including a 20 per cent increase in their annual maintenance grant.  The total cost of these improved supports in 1998 alone is in the region of £1 million.  Student nurses participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students.  Each student nurse receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  This grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is £1,624 per annum.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf.  The average annual fee is about £1,300.  A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 are also provided for each student nurse commencing the diploma programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.  In addition, a new allowance of £20 per week was recently introduced to assist students undertaking external clinical placements.  This is payable where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement. Students undertaking such placements who do not require accommodation receive a free weekly travel pass.  The average annual total value of these supports is some £6,000 per student nurse, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of the value of any capital or investments, together with any cash income that the person has.</P>
      <P>Over the years, different methods of assessing capital and income have applied in the case of the various social assistance schemes.  Some of these differences are designed to achieve specific policy objectives.  For instance, in recognition of the special contribution which carers make to our society, the carer's allowance scheme provides for a substantial disregard of £150 a week in the amount of income which the spouse of a recipient may have, without affecting the carer's entitlement. However, it is recognised that there is a need to standardise many of the different methods of calculating means to achieve greater equity within the system.  In this regard considerable progress has already been made in the area of the standardising the assessment of capital. The question of standardising the various earnings disregards, including the REPS payment disregards, which are currently confined to unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age non-contributory pension, is being examined by my Department.  However, any extension of current disregards to new categories of recipients would have financial implications and would, therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of the previous Dáil was engaged in a broad review of the licensing laws and that work is now continuing under a subcommittee of the new Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.  I have already indicated, in the debate in the House on 31 March 1998, that the recommendations which emerge from that work of the subcommittee will be given detailed consideration by my Department, with a view to any amending legislation that may be necessary.  My Department's examination of the question of legislative proposals, taking into account the work of the subcommittee, will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisions to prohibit the parking of heavy vehicles in residential areas are contained in Article 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 182 of 1997).  These regulations were made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and came into force on 1 October 1997.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended, the local authority has power to put in place the restrictions referred to by the Deputy, subject only to a requirement that it consults the Commissioner in advance of providing the necessary regulatory traffic signs.</P>
      <P>As the responsibility for placing the signs in question rests with the local authority, and I am given to understand that no such signs have yet been erected within the Dublin metropolitan area, the Garda are not in a position to enforce the relevant regulation banning the parking of large vehicles in residential areas.</P>
