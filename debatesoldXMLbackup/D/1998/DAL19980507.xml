      <P>It is proposed to take No. 3, Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Bill, 1998 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 4, Local Government Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. by one question which will be put by the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Defence.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 36, Sexual Offenders Registration Bill, 1998 &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).  It shall be taken directly after the Order of Business.  The proceedings on Second Stage thereof, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Sexual Offenders Registration Bill, 1998:  Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Neville on bringing forward this Private Members' Bill. While I agree with much of its content, I question its timing and I will be opposing the Bill.  This matter is the subject of deliberation by a commission and it is appropriate to await its outcome. We should not blindly follow British Government policy or practice as a matter of routine.  In this instance we should copy the actions of that parliament in introducing a similar Bill, but we should first await the outcome of the commission.</P>
      <P>Before introducing similar legislation in Britain, the Government there awaited the recommendations of the Home Office consultative paper which sought comments from the public on the issue of sex offenders.  That was a sensible and wise practice.  The Government did not attempt to pre-empt the outcome of the Home Office paper, and I ask Deputy Neville to adopt a similar policy.  It is vitally important that we debate the scope of the proposed Bill, which is intended to register all those convicted of crimes against children and other sex offences.  We must carefully examine all the options available within the terms of the Bill before the Government brings forward its Bill.</P>
      <P>Much play is made of the prospect of repeat offences.  Research carried out abroad does not support the figures quoted.  According to the results of the research, certain sex offenders do not reoffend.  The repeat pattern of the average non-sex offender is much higher.  This issue and many more need to be debated in great depth. There should at least be an indication of the time limits for registration of offenders.  This is dealt with clearly in the United Kingdom 1997 Act. Registration requirements should be set down in our Bill.  It should not be left to the discretion of the courts.  We are all aware of the variation of courts in the criteria used for determining sentences. We do not want any section of the Bill to be open to challenge.</P>
      <P>The method of reporting to the authorities is not defined clearly enough.  There is ambiguity as to whether an offender should physically report his or her presence to a local Garda station or whether it should be notified in writing only.  This needs to be clarified.  The penalties for non-notification need to be investigated.  They appear to be penal in Deputy Neville's Bill.  The inclusion of prison governors among those who are subject to those penalties is off the wall.  The requirements for a Garda inspector to get High Court permission for the disclosure of information from the register would be unworkable, totally counter-productive and time consuming and would clog up the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those with sex offence records in all countries with registration systems should come within the terms of this Bill.  There are many aspects of the Sexual Offenders Registration Bill which would benefit from deeper analysis and subsequent amendment when the Minister brings forward his Bill.  I hope the Minister considers this Bill and includes some of the fine proposals put forward <Col N="1107" /> by Deputy Neville.  I see no benefit in rushing a Bill through this House which may prove unworkable or unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill should be to register all sex offenders.  There is a basic need for this, and the introduction of a register would be a major step in preventing repeat sexual offences.  Public knowledge of criminal sexual offence records and those who perpetrate such crime would be a major deterrent in committing sexual offences. To be forewarned is to be forearmed.  Some of the more tragic sex-related offences in the recent past could have been averted if there had been public knowledge of the character of the offender who committed a series of heinous crimes against young people in another European country.  The man involved was a known sex offender who committed many crimes with seeming impunity. If the public had access to a register which showed his name as a recurring sex offender he would not have continued on his evil ways.</P>
    <P>I abhor the existence of so-called tolerance which prevails in some countries.  There is an acceptance of low standards and I hope we will not allow those standards to prevail here.  It speaks volumes of the changes in society that such standards creep in unobserved.  We must safeguard the lifestyle and values we have traditionally enjoyed.  We must address issues such as this Bill in a serious and rational fashion.  The Government will not shirk its responsibilities in presenting its Bill.</P>
    <P>There are people whose sole interest in life is making films based on sexual intercourse in normal and perverse fashion.  Many of them say that their films are artistic, but many who have seen them would describe them as dirty.  The makers of this pornography must share the guilt of those who perform criminal sexual acts following the inspiration they receive from viewing those filthy films.  In a related sphere, there is widespread misuse of computer technology to broadcast pornographic material.  The computer provides easy access to those who wish to infiltrate the privacy of our homes.  They cause offence to the nation at large by the uncensored display of explicit sexual material.  This type of viewing must be doing untold damage to the minds of young people. These computer artists fall into the same category as the makers of porno movies and they carry a heavy burden of responsibility for the minds they influence and distort.  They should be included in the ambit of the Bill to be introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is critically important to address the problem of abusers.  The resources needed for such a service must be made available. The actions and motivations of offenders must be professionally studied and analysed.  We cannot successfully address the problem of sex offences unless we gain an in-depth knowledge of the minds of those who commit such offences.  We must learn what drives them to commit these horrible acts and we must ascertain if it is possible to <Col N="1108" /> reverse their patterns of behaviour.  The results of a serious study would be of enormous value in safeguarding the potential victims of sex attacks.</P>
    <P>I received documentation from a group in the west which is involved in general professional counselling for individuals requiring help with psychological problems and those who have been sexually abused.  The management board consists of people with educational, psychological, medical, legal and pastoral qualifications and its submission &ldquo;Pro-Consult&rdquo;, which is modelled on a system used in Canada to treat sexual offenders, has been sent to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister will enjoy the full support of the House when he introduces his Bill.  We will then have an opportunity to include the commission's input and discuss the relevant points which the Minister will bring forward and those already raised by Deputy Neville.  I appeal to the Deputy to withdraw his Bill and wait for the results of the commission's report and the introduction of the new legislation, which, I am sure, will receive Members' full support.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Neville on bringing forward this Bill.  The Minister made it clear that he is not opposed to its import, but there appears to be a number of deficiencies in it.  That is not of major importance and I suggest that Deputy Neville's Bill and its explanatory memorandum will form an important part of a submission on the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences to which the Minister referred yesterday.  The Minister also referred to that paper in reply to a matter I raised on the Adjournment in respect of separate legal representation for victims of rape.  The Bill, its explanatory memorandum and its intent will form an important basis for the discussion paper.  I ask Deputy Neville to await the discussion paper and withdraw his Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Government is committed to putting in place a register of sexual offenders and there is support for this on all sides of the House.  To deal with the issue of sexual abuse and not the specific aspects of the Bill &mdash; second to the death of a child the mere thought of one's children being sexually abused is one of the most horrific things normal and sane parents can contemplate.  I say &ldquo;normal and sane&rdquo; because abuse of this nature often occurs in families. As a public representative, the first occasion on which I encountered sexual abuse against children was within a family situation.  Dealing with that for the first time raised many issues which I had not previously contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that I discussed sexual abuse with my children.  If it does not enter into one's consciousness as a parent, in the context of people's sexuality or sexual orientation, that sexual abuse can happen, it is difficult to broach this matter with children whereas it is easy to discuss normal matters of sexuality.  Sexual abuse probably falls outside the scope of parents who are trying to protect their children and provide them with a <Col N="1109" /> good grounding in relationships and sex education and it is difficult for them to deal with this area.</P>
    <P>We must consider this issue from a number of aspects.  I wish to deal with it specifically in terms of victims within the family home and those who are the subject of abuse from someone outside the home.  I pay tribute to organisations such as the ISPCC, the Rape Crisis Centre and other voluntary groups which do a great deal of work in trying to assist victims and their families who have suffered the trauma of sexual abuse.  I also pay tribute to health workers who attempt to pick up the pieces after instances of sexual abuse. Having said that, cases coming to our notice now involve children who were placed in care for specific reasons, including their own safety, and found themselves the victims of sexual abuse.  That has had an effect on health care providers and those who provide care for young children.</P>
    <P>To return to the issue of parents not raising the dangers of sexual abuse with their children, the stay safe programme and other programmes have a great deal to offer.  I urge parents who are reluctant to have their children take part in these programmes to reconsider the matter.  In my constituency, a group of nuns working in the community operate an after school homework club for young children.  They provide a safe atmosphere and there is an adult available whom children feel they can talk with on a confidential basis.  This is vital in terms of both intervention and ensuring that those responsible for sexual abuse are removed from society.  Barnados are also involved in doing work of this kind. However, this service should be introduced to the school system not only to support the Stay Safe programme but also because children should be able to identify people with whom they can talk.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly heard of cases where sexual offenders informed their victims that they will not be believed and that they have done something wrong.  In recent days, an abuser sent his victim to confession to inform the priest that he or she had sinned.  This is contradictory and confusing for young children who experience sexual abuse.  Everyone hopes that children can discuss such matters with their parents but that might not always be possible.  Therefore, there is a need to appoint normal and responsible adults in our schools whom children can trust and approach.</P>
    <P>The treatment of offenders has received much coverage and attention in the past 24 hours.  On reading the headlines about a traveller who was accused and found guilty of raping a prisoner with whom he shared a cell, one's initial reaction was that this was horrific until one discovered the more horrific background with which that prisoner had to contend in his earlier life.  This case highlights the lack of treatment places available for those who have committed sexual offences. We must consider this issue from both sides, particularly that of the victim, in terms of the need for counselling and support, which is a priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> If we are to try to achieve the objective of Deputy Neville's Bill, which is to reduce the rate of repeat offences, ensure that those convicted do not reoffend and advise society that these people are at liberty in the community, there must be a major increase in the number of places available to cater for those who have committed crimes.  I am first to admit that there are not enough places available. However, a large number of those who commit sexual offences do not want to avail of treatment programmes.  One of my constituents asked me to visit her husband who was accused of raping an adult.  He categorically stated that he was not guilty and had not perpetrated the offence.  I was approached afterward by one of the prison staff who asked if I was aware of the situation.  I informed him that the prisoner's wife had asked me to visit him.  The member of staff then asked if the prisoner had indicated that he had not perpetrated the offence and I informed him that was the case.  He asked me if I realised that was what I would be told by 80 per cent, if not more, of those found guilty of such an offence.</P>
    <P>I know that in the treatment of sex offenders a major hurdle facing them is admitting they have committed an offence.  In some of the recent high profile cases, it was obvious the perpetrators felt no remorse about their crimes.</P>
    <P>When this register is introduced we will have to address a number of issues, one of which was recently highlighted in Britain when local people put a police station under siege because a released sex offender was staying there.  This is not an easy area to address.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Neville and ask him to use his Bill as part of a contribution to the discussion paper the Minister referred to yesterday evening.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Neville for introducing this Private Members' Bill.  Last night, the Minister criticised, with some justification, parts of the Bill but it should be seen in the context of a shortcoming in this House that a dedicated Deputy like Deputy Neville, who is very concerned about this whole area, is not in a position to avail of the expert parliamentary draftsmanship required to deal with all the shortcomings the Minister outlined.  This is a problem relating to all parties in Opposition and needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the idea of a register.  I accept there are many aspects to providing a register but, in itself, it is a relatively simple thing to do.  People were concerned when four convicted paedophiles from Derry moved to the Republic deliberately to avoid the registration system in the North. Sometimes people are unnecessarily frightened when one considers that last year a notorious <Col N="1111" /> British paedophile arrived here for the same reason and had to leave extremely quickly because of the prompt action of the Garda.</P>
    <P>This whole issue may be considered at some time in the future by the British-Irish Council. We will have areas of common agreement and concern and it may be possible to deal with it to better effect through the council.</P>
    <P>The extent of child abuse is extremely serious. Thousands of cases are coming to the attention of the health boards every year.  As other speakers have done, I want to raise the question of treatment and rehabilitation in the prisons.  Yesterday's case clearly highlighted the fact that there is not sufficient treatment available for those who require it.  Ten places are available in Arbour Hill but only to those serving the last year of their sentence.  Clearly that number of places is not enough.  I understand there are also prisoners in the Curragh and I would be grateful if the Minister will clarify the position in that regard because my understanding is that not all prisoners who are sex offenders can avail of such a service should they so choose.  Nobody underestimates the difficulty in providing treatment for sex offenders but it is not impossible and it should be availed of.</P>
    <P>Currently there is a landslide in relation to the number of cases coming forward.  We should not overestimate the extent of the problem in the sense that there is a backlog.  Many of the cases coming before the courts go back a long time but I am concerned about whether we even know the current trend, leaving aside the backlog.  We must carefully assess the current extent of sexual abuse because last year's figures for crimes against women show an increase at a time when figures for all other crimes were decreasing.  That should be a signal that something is happening which we need to understand.</P>
    <P>The fact that no research of any adequate proportion has been carried out in the area of child abuse and sexual offenders means there is an onus on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, now that it has obtained money for this purpose, to deal with this aspect and determine if the current trend is on the increase.  If it is on the increase, is it because there is more reporting of these crimes or is there an underlying growth in the problem?  If that is the case, what are the influences?</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable debate, for example, on the film &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo;.  People thought there was a possibility that this film might encourage paedophilia.  I do not believe in censorship <i>per se</i> but I do not underestimate the power of the modern media to influence people's habits and the way they comport themselves.</P>
    <P>We must examine the influences affecting human behaviour and determine whether they are beneficial.  Many of the worst offences have occurred within families and by people who were trusted by families.  I endorse the establishment <Col N="1112" /> of the stay safe programme which is an important protection for children.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that he lives up to his words.  He made the point that this is a more extensive area than simply the provision of a register.  That is true.  There are many elements to it but resources are required to deal with accommodation and support issues for the victims of abuse and the Minister has not yet delivered on that.  I will hold the Minister to the points he made last night to ensure he delivers on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies on all sides of the House, I commend Deputy Neville for introducing the Bill which deals with one part of the dreadful problem of child sexual abuse.  I commend him also for his interest and commitment in this area which gives all of us an opportunity to express what every decent human being, particularly parents and people in authority, feels about this issue.  As legislators we must move urgently to put in place the structures and, more importantly, the resources to deal with an extraordinarily complex problem.</P>
      <P>Part of our difficulty is that we are only coming to terms with the horror and extent of this problem. Deputy McManus is right to question whether child sexual abuse is increasing.  More research must be done to determine if pornography on the Internet is facilitating the establishment of paedophile rings across boundaries, thereby increasing the problem, or if it is a hidden problem because of the countless numbers of victims who, for decades, did not have an opportunity to speak out.</P>
      <P>I know that every Member, particularly Deputy Neville, understands that this Bill is only one aspect of the whole question of treating the perpetrators of these crimes as well as the victims. Support programmes must be put in place to warn children about the dangers of being exploited and abused in this way.  When courageous people come forward years later, usually as very damaged adults, and give witness to what has happened to them, we all share a horror and sadness at the extraordinary manipulation of their minds and emotions by their abusers in persuading them that what was happening was normal or that if it was abnormal they carried a huge amount of the responsibility for it.  We have to worry about the extent to which any child coming through such an experience can become a whole, sane and balanced person.  Such things were allowed to happen through our not knowing, but if we do not now act on the knowledge and information we have, we will be held responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about changes in the Constitution in the area of children's rights.  We should look at the judicial systems in other countries, for example, France, and study how convicted sexual offenders are treated.  In other countries people who are a danger to young people and to other people in society, and also to themselves in so far as they evidently cannot control their urges, are not given an arbitrary sentence that allows them, <Col N="1113" /> having served that sentence, to go back into the community to continue to commit this type of crime.  We are very aware of the figures relating to this type of crime.  One offender can affect the lives of as many as two or three hundred victims, so there is a ripple effect.  However, even when it is known that a person is a risk to society, we are helpless to do anything other than allow them back into the community.  In other jurisdictions, convicted abusers are constantly monitored by a panel of experts, because they are seen as a danger to the community.  Having served a certain number of years, they are not automatically released from prison.  If they fail to take up rehabilitation programmes or treatment that is offered to them, they will not be released.  Given the very high number of convicted sex abusers we have, it is appalling that there are only ten places in Arbour Hill for rehabilitation and treatment and that abusers either do not wish to receive treatment or, if they do, that we have not got the resources to enable them to do so.  Such resources are available in other jurisdictions, and if convicted sex abusers do not take up the offer of treatment, they are not allowed to be free.  Having availed of treatment and rehabilitation within the prison system, monitoring and treatment continues in a supportive way once they are in the community.</P>
    <P>If we set up a register of sex offenders with a view to monitoring them, and conceal from the communities they are living in that they have been guilty of such dreadful acts, if we do that in isolation, we will merely isolate them and make them more dangerous, and we will not contribute to solving the ongoing problem.  Setting up of a register must be done in tandem with increased provision of treatment.  I do not know how we can constitutionally ensure that convicted sex offenders cannot leave prison without undergoing treatment and rehabilitation and subsequently staying in touch with such resources when they are back in the community.  However, unless we can do this, all we are doing is containing the problem, isolating it, but never reaching the stage of not having within our community people who do not have access to the treatment and psychological supports needed to render them safe without scapegoating them or having people in the community into which they have been released living in fear.</P>
    <P>In this context it is above all necessary &mdash; and the Minister for Education and Science and the Government have the right &mdash; to ensure that in schools where the majority of parents wish their children to take part in stay safe programmes, the management or teachers cannot arbitrarily decide not to put the programme into practice.  That would be an abdication of their responsibility and a denial of the rights of children to have a stay safe programme from a very young age.  If we need reminding of how early we have to instil in our children some sense of awareness of the danger they may be in, we have only to think of the recent horrific rape of an eight year old girl <Col N="1114" /> in Cork.  Work in this area must go hand in hand with work on the Sexual Offenders Registration Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I join in the general compliments to Deputy Neville on this Bill.  I know from observation the amount of dedicated work he put into crafting this legislation.  He has done a tremendous public service by bringing it before the House.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that, apart from the conciliatory comments yesterday evening, the Minister does not seem to fully appreciate what Deputy Neville is doing here.  This Bill is no different from any other Bill in that it is open to amendment and can be amended.  Government legislation often has to be amended by the Government.  I recall vividly, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, bringing forward up to 200 amendments to the Stock Exchange Bill in order to ensure that it would be as watertight and as perfect as possible. Unfortunately, magnanimity is not part of the nature of this Minister.  The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform has proved to be the Achilles heel of this Government.  Time and time again issues which should have been routine for a well managed Department with a competent Minister in command of his brief have been mishandled. Last week the Garda pay issue, which was fertilised by him in Opposition but allowed to fester since he became Minister, grabbed the headlines almost all of last week when we should have been concentrating on the Amsterdam Treaty and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at the Minister's refusal to embrace this Bill as a worthwhile measure for the protection of children.  The Minister told this House on 28 January that there were 292 sex offenders in custody.  On 12 May he told the House that the only dedicated sex offenders' programme was at Arbour Hill and that it caters for a mere ten sex offenders at a time.  The result is that sex offenders are being released weekly, and only a tiny fraction of them have undergone therapy or treatment.  It is acknowledged that sex offenders have the highest recidivism rate in the entire prison population.  If they are being released untreated, a register is an absolute imperative.  People and communities should be aware of the release of the paedophile into their midst.  There should be advance notification, advance preparation, and a sensitive awareness. This is precisely the purpose of this Bill.  It is clear, prescriptive and workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the Bill would establish a register of offenders, a notification procedure and a definite public safety process.  I was appalled by the Minister's dismissal of the Bill as &ldquo;somewhat minimalist&rdquo;.  The Minister gave a clear commitment during his heady days in Opposition that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would establish a register of sex offenders.  There were no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybes&rdquo;.  The Minister has been in office for nine months and we have seen a combination of <Col N="1115" /> crisis management and a basking in the glow of welcome Garda successes across a range of criminal justice areas based on the solid programme of legislation introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Owen.  From his own wish list, zero tolerance has been debunked; there is still no sign of the promised missing persons unit; the attachment of earnings legislation has been consigned to the back burner; Mountjoy jail is overcrowded and in chaos; refugee legislation lies dormant and the Garda pay issue is in crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the setting up of the register of sex offenders was being &ldquo;studied&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;for some time now, my Department has been carrying out a detailed study of issues which arise from a system of registration of offenders&rdquo;.  Every week new offenders crowd into prisons and untreated paedophiles are released back into the community without any therapy or treatment.  All that is happening is that the good people in the offices in 72-76 St. Stephen's Green are studying whether there are particular characteristics which make Irish paedophiles unique from their counterparts in other countries.  The situation is nonsensical.  There is a vast bulk of expert opinion in this area available from research in Britain, the United States, France and elsewhere. There are certain fundamentals common to the problem throughout the world.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a register of offenders is an absolute necessity as a public safety measure. Yet, all that is being carried out is a study.  What will happen when the study is completed?  The Minister said a discussion paper will be produced. We will have discussion, debate, deliberations and delay while at the same time paedophiles are released untreated, unregistered and unknown back into the community.  Does the Minister realise the hysteria, panic and fear caused by the sudden awareness of the presence of a released paedophile in a community?  Does he realise that paedophiles are now as reviled as murderers?  Is he aware that in my county, for example, there was a barbaric torching of a home of a released paedophile last Christmas?</P>
    <P>By not registering paedophiles and not treating them the State could be leaving itself open to a spate of compensation claims from the victims of untreated released paedophile offenders. Treatment should no longer be optional but obligatory.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the Bill.  It is obvious from his nit-picking exercise yesterday, further indulged in by Deputy O'Flynn today, that there is no problem with the essence of the Bill.  It is sound and all reservations could be catered for and dealt with on Committee Stage.  If the Minister set aside his blinkered approach the Bill could be law within three weeks and for the first time a much needed and long overdue register of offenders could be in place within a matter of weeks.  Unfortunately, this is not the nature of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by Deputy Neville's Bill of discussing the issue of sexual offences.  Sexual abuse of men, women and children is unacceptable at any level in society.  Over recent years we have seen an avalanche of cases coming before the courts.  All of us have been deeply shocked by this experience. We hope the recent culture of openness will continue and encourage further victims of these cruel crimes to come forward and report them.</P>
      <P>As a society, and especially as legislators, we must address the many questions surrounding sexual abuse, namely, why people engage in these crimes; how society can best be protected; how people can be prepared to combat these crimes; how detection rates can be improved and what to do with people who abuse.  It is this final issue which I wish to speak about.</P>
      <P>It seems the Minister's policy to date has simply been to lock up abusers and forget about them.  In general terms, the &ldquo;lock them up&rdquo; approach seems to be the Minister's guiding principle in relation to all crime and hence his fixation with building more prison spaces.  This is a self-fulfilling policy because if the Minister's only approach is to lock up prisoners, there will be an unending demand for prison places as crime will never be effectively tackled.  The Minister has opted for simplistic solutions which can be described in catchy sound bites.  Effectively tackling crime is, of course, a much more complex issue and requires examination of the root causes of crime, efficient policing and possible interventions by the State to break the vicious cycle of crime.</P>
      <P>Time and time again sexual abuse cases have been shown to be part of a vicious cycle, the offender being abused and going on to abuse others in turn.  Prison sentences alone make little difference to this pattern of behaviour.  Prisons which allow sexual abuse to continue within their walls do nothing to change it.  We know that in most cases offenders are likely to reoffend again and again unless action is taken to break that pattern.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that if we were serious about protecting society and reducing recidivism we would make a serious attempt to rehabilitate prisoners convicted of sexual offences.  Currently there are almost 300 sexual offenders in prison while there are a mere ten rehabilitation places available.  This is a shameful situation and a gross indictment of a Minister who purports to be tackling crime.  It seems the courts will have to instruct the Minister to do his job properly if progress is to be made.  In this context I welcome the indication yesterday from one judge that he intends shortly to take this action against the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we heard promises about what the Minister was going to do.  I remind the House that on 13 August 1997 the media reported that the Minister was preparing a Green Paper on sexual offending.  A spokesperson for the Minister said it would be ready in the autumn.  However, autumn, <Col N="1117" /> winter and spring came and went.  We are now at the start of summer and there is still no sign of the Green Paper.  Clearly, the Minister is all talk and no action.  People are quickly realising that he cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an equally pathetic record in relation to drug addicted prisoners, with little or no treatment facilities available to them.  Our prisons continue to be full of drugs and brutal and abusive places which release prisoners back into society often in a more anti-social and dangerous state than when they first entered.  For all the Minister's tough talk, he still seems incapable of grasping this fact.</P>
    <P>The intentions behind the Bill are admirable. When sexual offenders leave prison, nobody knows where they go or what they do unless they again come to the attention of the authorities. There is an urgent need for ongoing monitoring of sexual offenders when they leave prison. However, I would prefer to see this as part of a properly structured post-release programme. There are potential problems with the register, such as the possibility of encouraging vigilantism, the illusion of safety that may be created in the community and the likelihood of driving offenders underground with the possibility of them becoming more dangerous.  These issues must be properly addressed.</P>
    <P>Some form of registration and monitoring is necessary.  This is merely one aspect of a much wider strategy which is required if we are to do what we all believe is necessary, namely, to protect society by reducing recidivism.  I call on the Minister to start treating this matter seriously.  He has had time for talking, what we need is action.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Neville on bringing the Bill before the House; it has generated discussion on a very serious issue. However, the Bill is somewhat premature because, as the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already initiated a detailed study of the issue of sexual offences and a discussion paper on the matter will be brought before the House in the near future. If we are to ensure the matter is dealt with properly, we must hear the views of the professionals and all interested parties.  The Government is opposing the Bill while recognising that the underlying objective is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the management of the risk to children of sexual abuse.  A sexual offender who committed crimes against a large number of people in my constituency did not receive treatment in prison but was allowed back to live in the community, causing great distress to the victims.  We are opposing the Bill because it is badly thought out and does not address many <Col N="1118" /> of the serious issues.  For example, whose names will be on the register?  For how long will the names remain on it?  How can people's names be removed from the register and who will have access to it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read it.  The Government gave a commitment in its programme for Government and, by initiating a detailed study of this area, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has shown he intends to deal with the matter in a proper manner.  That is why we believe the timing of Deputy Neville's Bill is premature.</P>
      <P>The Deputy modelled the Bill on the UK Sex Offenders Act, 1997.  That Act was preceded by a consultation paper inviting comments from members of the public.  We intend to do likewise by introducing a proper discussion paper and inviting comments from all members of the public. There has not been an informed debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Bill is confusing.  Deputy Neville probably intended to limit it to persons convicted of sex crimes against children, or so-called paedophiles.  The Bill as drafted would cover all sex offenders.  The discussion paper the Minister will introduce shortly will deal with the scope of a register.  I have spoken to members of committees who visited jails where sex offenders are held and I am concerned that there are no treatment programmes for sex offenders.  It is pointless setting up a register without addressing the question of treatment in prison.  I was particularly alarmed when members of the visiting committees informed me that while in prison sex offenders discuss how they can carry out similar offences again without being caught.  The question of chemical castration must be given serious consideration.  It is outrageous that a sexual offender can be released from prison without treatment and, as happened in my constituency, return to live among his victims.  I am not prepared to allow this to continue.  I know the Minister has strong feelings on this matter and that is why he intends to introduce a comprehensive Bill on sex offenders in due course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville stated that section 3 would require the Minister to make regulations or secondary legislation setting out guidelines for a court to follow in determining how long a person would be subject to registration requirements. This could be an unlawful delegation of legislative power.  It would be more transparent to include this in primary legislation and give an indication of the time limits and the criteria applicable.  I do not know why Deputy Neville decided to dodge this issue when drafting his Bill, given that he copied the UK Act virtually word for word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned that the offence of carnal knowledge of under age girls is not included in <Col N="1119" /> the Bill.  Many paedophiles are guilty of crimes against under age girls.  Why was that issue not dealt with in the Bill?  The Deputy mentioned incest by males, but made no reference to incest by females.  Why was that not included?  Under section 8 a penalty of up to three years imprisonment can be imposed for breach of the notification requirements.  That is excessive.  The Deputy is making prison governors subject to the same sanctions for failing to comply with the requirement to notify the Garda Commissioner. That is a drastic measure.</P>
    <P>While the Deputy's motives are good and we all recognise the necessity for a register of sex offenders, we want it set up in a proper manner to deal with a problem that has given rise to a great deal of debate in recent times.  I recently met a member of the FBI who in the past few days brought a case in the US in connection with pornography on the Internet.  People were luring young children across the States to commit crimes of a sexual nature against them.  The Garda Síochána and society in general must be aware of the way the Internet can be abused and the horrific content of some of its information.  It is difficult in the US to bring a successful prosecution for such crimes and we must be conscious of this for the future.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the Bill, not because we do not believe a register of sex offenders is a good idea, but because we do not believe Deputy Neville's Bill is comprehensive enough.  I hope he will withdraw the Bill and allow an informed debate on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Neville on introducing the Bill.  We share the same views on many aspects of life in general.  However, I am as impatient as he for a change in the law regarding paedophiles.  Sex offences against children are unforgivable.  It takes away their innocence and destroys their lives.  Sadly, many paedophiles have also been abused as children.</P>
      <P>I would throw away the key on paedophiles. The number of them who do not reoffend is very small.  I would have to be very sure a paedophile would not reoffend before allowing him back into the community.  If they reoffend, there should be some type of sanction against the people who ordered their release in the belief that they would not reoffend.  These people are very clever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall speaking to an Eastern Health Board psychiatrist some years ago, one of whose patients had informed him he was a paedophile and was worried he might kill a child.  Given the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship, the psychiatrist was placed in a very awkward position. However, he approached a senior judge with whom he was acquainted and asked him what he could do.  The judge advised him to bring the matter to the attention of the Garda.  The doctor visited the Garda superintendent and informed him of his fears that his patient might kill a child. However, he was told that nothing could be done <Col N="1120" /> until such time as the man committed an offence, in spite of the fact that he was a time bomb waiting to explode.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to see people taking the law into their own hands in regard to these matters.  We can observe what is happening in the UK with the release of a monster into the community.  If people do not see justice being done, they will take matters into their own hands.</P>
    <P>A day does not pass when some child sexual offence is not reported in the newspapers; it is one of the horrible aspects of life as we know it. When the Minister introduces his discussion paper on this issue, I would ask him to apply a maximum time limit of five or six months for receipt of submissions, after which time legislation will be introduced.  I do not want to wait a further two or three years to see something being done about this crime which we all find deeply offensive.</P>
    <P>Although I support the Bill, I am obliged to wait until the Government introduces its own Bill, which I hope will happen in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill introduced by Deputy Neville and I compliment him on it.  When in Opposition, Deputy O'Donoghue and I introduced a number of Private Members' Bills and I am aware of the amount of work involved when one does not have the necessary resources and backup.  One is forced to rely on one's colleagues and party supporters to give generously of their time to ensure Bills are properly drafted.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue and I introduced two Bills in this area, one of which was the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill which prevents people going abroad to commit these kinds of offences.  People who do so can be charged in this jurisdiction for offences committed there.</P>
      <P>There is a huge sex tourism market in many east Asian and African countries.  Unfortunately, that very regrettable part of the tourism industry is a very lucrative one for many people.  The industry preys on people in dire economic straits, abuses their economic position and children are frightfully abused as a result.  I am sure we have all seen documentaries on the issue.</P>
      <P>We also introduced a Child Pornography Bill, a simple Bill which I believed should have been supported.  Although the Government of which Deputy Neville's party was a member supported the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, it opposed the Child Pornography Bill.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy Shortall used her time to attack the Minister and I remind her that some of the issues she raised could easily have been dealt with when her party was in Government less than a year ago.  I do not wish to be political about this serious issue.  The fact that people commit heinous crimes against children is the issue we should address rather than attempting to embarrass the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, the Minister has introduced a Bill on pornography which is far more <Col N="1121" /> extensive than the one we introduced when in Opposition.  He did not have the back-up or resources then which he now has in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and which have allowed him to be very active on the legislative front.</P>
    <P>I attended a very interesting conference on this matter in Sweden some years ago and learned a great deal about its extent.  The lengths to which some offenders will go to gain access to children and pornographic material are quite extraordinary. Legislation is being introduced to deal with this issue in many countries and hopefully all Governments will come together to attempt to limit the amount of information available on the Internet which is a huge information source for offenders.  It is not possible to merely type in 'child pornography'; people must know key words in order to allow them to follow trails.  As Interpol was aware of the methods used to gain access to this information at the time the conference was held, paedophiles almost certainly have new words to access this information now. Child sex offenders reoffend at a very high rate.</P>
    <P>I agree in many ways with the main thrust of the Bill introduced by Deputy Neville.  We must all take an interest in this matter as it is essential that we protect our children.  However, I have not seen much evidence that the measures proposed in the Bill have been effective in other jurisdictions. In some parts of America, the effectiveness of measures to identify sex offenders, such as a register of sex offenders or the placement of signs outside offenders' homes, is being questioned. I support the Minister's attitude to this matter which requires a great deal of thought and on which a discussion document must be produced. Such a document would serve to open up a great deal of debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a time limit will be imposed for the receipt of submissions and that the Government will be required to introduce legislation on the matter.  I commend the Deputy for raising this issue and I welcome the fact that it is being debated in the House.  This is a very difficult subject which, if not handled properly, could result in matters becoming worse than they currently are.  I ask the Deputy to listen to the Minister.  He is bringing forward a discussion paper.  There is a time limit for receipt of views. Many people will submit their views to the Department.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw his Bill and to await the discussion paper.  I congratulate him on the work he has done but I suggest we all move together on it as opposed to rushing legislation through.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa fáiltiú roimh an Bille freisin.  Tugann sé deis dúinn labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo agus ba chóir dúinn gach deis a ghlacadh mar beidh an fhadhb linn i gconaí de dheasca an dul chun cinn atá ar siúl sa teicneo-laíocht agus san Internet.  Ba chóir dúinn tabhairt faoin bhfadhb mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Muna ndéanaimid <Col N="1122" /> é sin anois is ar éigin go mbeimid in ann tabhairt faoi ins an todhchaí.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville's Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss an ongoing problem which is a threat to society.  I note the words &ldquo;sex offenders&rdquo; in the Bill while the thrust of it deals with children.  Sex offences are largely offences against women and children.  A sexual offence is the most heinous of all crimes because it is power against weakness, strength against the vulnerable.  It is a worldwide problem.  We are dealing with many aspects &mdash; pornography, prostitution, trafficking and even slavery, which we thought had been removed a couple of hundred years ago.  All this is happening extensively in Asia where prostitution, particularly child prostitution, is more lucrative than drug trafficking, which is a major international business.</P>
      <P>Any form of pornography or prostitution is sex abuse and child abuse and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels but it can only be tackled at national and international levels.</P>
      <P>Let us focus on women who are the victims of sex offenders, while not necessarily coming within the thrust of this Bill.  We should always concentrate our efforts on removing domestic violence, harassment, violence against women on the streets and, as we saw last week, in night clubs. There should also be separate representation for rape victims, etc.  During my term in this House we have already tackled the Child Pornography Bill and an international commission, of which the Government is a part, is working on the whole issue of pornography on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Sex offenders are an ongoing danger to society. Society has a duty to protect itself.  The least protection to which society is entitled is to monitor the whereabouts of known past sex offenders.  I agree with the principle of this Bill on the need for a register of sex offenders.  However, a number of questions need to be asked.  What constitutes the sex offender?  Who will go on this register? Will it be paedophiles, sex abusers, sex offenders against women, all of whom are different categories of offenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the debate focused a great deal on the fear of strangers in our midst, strangers on the street, particularly in light of what happened in Cork and how parents are afraid to allow their children out on the streets.  This is an awful situation that has developed in our society.  Statistics show that children are most at risk within the four walls of their own homes.  They are at risk from people whom they know and from family members.  In a register such as this do we list people who have been ignored by their neighbours for a long time?  The press, neighbours and society will talk about the stranger in our midst but for too long we have turned a blind eye to what happens next door and within the four walls of another family home because we say it is not our responsibility.  For too long mothers have sought not to protect their children but to protect the family as a unit and have refused to give information against their husbands.  They need to <Col N="1123" /> be encouraged.  If that person is living among a family or his own family or with his own children they are the people who are most at risk.</P>
    <P>Should offences be categorised?  There are a number of sex offences and sex offenders.  Should they be categorised on the register?  What about those who have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15 or under the age of 17 which, even in the courts, merit two different types of sentence?  Should rape, incest, pornography and prostitution be listed separately and categorised in the register?  How long should a person remain on the list?  Should it be for the whole of their lives, bearing in mind the distinction between child abusers and paedophiles?  Child abusers will respond to counselling, education and behavioural reorientation.  Paedophiles will never respond.  They are more highly structured and have the extraordinary belief that a child consents to the activity.  Very little treatment works with paedophiles and they are likely to reoffend. If a person who has been released from prison is undergoing treatment and is found, because he is an abuser as opposed to a paedophile, to respond to that treatment should that person remain on the register for the rest of their lives?</P>
    <P>Who should have access to the register?  I understand the Bill proposes that a garda at inspector level would have access to the register. Surely health boards, child care workers, the Department of Education and Science have an interest and anybody who will be employed in a position of authority dealing with children. People who will be employed in community employment schemes in schools need to have access to this information.  While this matter is addressed in the Bill further debate is needed. For example, the Rape Crisis Centre has views on this matter.</P>
    <P>How does the Freedom of Information Act affect this Bill?  While welcoming the thrust of the Bill we need to protect our children and women. This must be done in co-operation with Europol, Interpol and all the international organisations. Following a discussion paper involving all the relevant organisations in Ireland it is a matter we will be dealing with at a national level here.</P>

      <P>I join others who have complimented Deputy Neville in bringing forward the Sexual Offenders Registration Bill.  It is an important Bill and deserves the support of the House.  I am confident Deputy Neville will be magnanimous and generous enough, in the event of the Bill receiving the approval of the House, to go forward to Committee Stage.  I have no doubt Deputy Neville would be agreeable to co-operate in every respect with all parties to produce an Act which would have widespread support here and <Col N="1124" /> throughout the country.  It is an important Bill and one to which in general I subscribe.  I would like the opportunity to discuss this matter further on Committee and Report Stages.  I wish to make a point which has not been addressed in the Bill or in the debate but it is essential that it be considered by the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children.  It is an area relevant to both Departments and it requires urgent attention.  It relates not only to sexual offenders but to other offenders.  The problem of psychiatric treatment for people of all age groups but particularly for young people must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I and the Minister of State are aware of many young people who have no criminal records but who are in urgent need of psychiatric care for nervous disorders, psychiatric problems and problems with sexuality.  At present such people have limited access to proper medical treatment.  I can offer a simple example.  A number of people voluntarily admit themselves to homes or hospitals throughout the country for psychiatric treatment.  Usually they are put on tablets which are administered under supervision in the hospital.  The patients, for as long as they are taking such medicines under supervision, usually become well again quite quickly and are allowed to return to their homes.</P>
      <P>However, on returning home many such patients do not continue their treatment.  At that stage their problems are reactivated.  As they fail to continue their treatment their nervous disorder continues and, on occasion, deteriorates.  Drink, drugs and the other problems involved in growing up intermingle and serve to aggravate the disorder. A situation which could have been curtailed at an early stage, therefore, continues to deteriorate.</P>
      <P>These people are usually young males, aged between 17 and 35 years.  When they fail to continue their treatment they become a danger to themselves and to society, particularly to young girls and young men.  In essence they are good people but, because of their health problem, they become dangerous.  If this problem was addressed at an early stage the need for legislation such as the Bill before the House might be reduced.  I hope the Minister of State and the Government will examine this problem.  I am available to meet the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children at any time to discuss it and I am glad I had the opportunity of raising it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited most prisons in Ireland.  I dread visiting Mountjoy Prison because it is an horrific experience.  Yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a report on a prisoner, Anthony Cawley, who apologised in court to a man he raped in Mountjoy Prison.  The report pointed out that this was the first case of prison rape to be successfully prosecuted in Irish courts.  The Minister of State is aware, as am I, that it was not the first such offence.  Regrettably, young men have been raped in Mountjoy Prison on previous <Col N="1125" /> occasions and a considerable number of sexual assaults have taken place there.  I do not know how this behaviour is to be curtailed but it must be done.</P>
    <P>People are committed to Mountjoy Prison for various crimes and I can give the Minister of State information on a number of instances where such assaults took place.  The problem must be addressed.  A prisoner might go into Mountjoy Prison having been a serious problem for society but he or she can come out a much more dangerous person.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is passed and I congratulate Deputy Neville on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who participated in this debate.  The Bill endeavours to introduce a means of tracking fiends who sexually abuse children.  We want the Garda Síochána to be aware of their presence in the community and to provide that a community can be made aware of the presence of such convicted people in their midst at the discretion of the Garda.</P>
      <P>As a result of the greater awareness of and huge emphasis on child sexual offending and the social revulsion at such abuse, the Minister did not oppose the Bill outright.  He said he accepted the desirability of establishing a sex offenders register.  He was, therefore, reduced to nit-picking by outlining drafting weaknesses in the Bill in order to oppose it.  He was reduced to employing his Department's officials to trawl through the Bill for drafting problems.  This is the easy option when the Minister cannot oppose the principle or objectives of a Bill.</P>
      <P>The issues highlighted by the Minister could be overcome by the introduction of amendments on Committee Stage.  However, the Minister has decided not to take this option but to reject the Bill on Second Stage.  He is aware of the limitations under which Members must work when drawing up a Private Members' Bill.  They do not have the support of a team of legislative draftsmen. Even when there is such support, it is rare that a Bill is not in need of amendment.  Amendments could have been made to this Bill but the Minister has chosen not to make them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He prefers to have paedophiles who are released from prison free to move around the country and to inflict their vicious, vile acts on children, thereby robbing them of their innocence and condemning them to a childhood, adolescence and, in most cases, an adulthood of no self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness and isolation and difficulties with relationships.  According to a report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> a man was sentenced to 14 years in prison for raping his daughter who is now 26 years of age.  The judge noted that the victim was on constant medication for depression, had attempted suicide several times and was classified a suicide risk.  She was unable to form relationships and that condition was considered permanent.  That is the effect of child sex abuse on one victim.  The defendant in this case had been convicted in the <Col N="1126" /> early 1980s for indecently assaulting his oldest daughter and had received a six month suspended sentence.  That man's name should have been included on a register.</P>
    <P>By not supporting the Bill, the Minister will ensure that this State remains a safe haven for child sex abusers from Northern Ireland and the UK and facilitates their use of the State to continue their vile activities.  The Minister's first criticism of the Bill is that the word &ldquo;children&rdquo; appears in the long title but is not mentioned in the short title.  Time and again this has been referred to as a deficiency in the Bill.  I accept that it is a problem but it could be addressed by amending the Title.  The simple amendment could read: &ldquo;In the short title, place &ldquo;child&rdquo; before &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;.  Yet the Minister and other Deputies consider this a key issue in their rejection of the Bill.  There are other similar criticisms but all of them could be addressed in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>I accept there are drafting flaws but they could have been overcome on Committee Stage. However, the Minister will not take that option. Instead, he will continue to permit people who are released from prison to commit what I believe are the most vile acts against human nature by destroying the childhood and innocence of children. He will continue to permit them to reside in communities without their presence being made known to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a discussion paper on the law on sexual offences will be published within the next two weeks.  That is the third time he made that announcement since last December.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 2 January 1998 carried a report on statements made by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe who has made numerous statements on this issue and has called for a register of paedophiles. However, he is conspicuous by his absence from this debate.</P>
    <P>The article states:</P>
    <P>Minister for Justice John O'Donoghue is to introduce a register of paedophiles early in the New Year, according to Cork Fianna Fáil TD Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>A discussion document on sex offenders will be published within the next two weeks but Minister O'Donoghue has already decided on a register of paedophiles, he said, adding: &ldquo;The discussion paper will look at all sex offenders but Minister O'Donoghue confirmed to me this week that he has already decided in principle on a register of paedophiles&rdquo;. According to Deputy O'Keeffe, the Irish register will help ensure Ireland doesn't become a haven for British paedophiles. &ldquo;The register will address a failing here and make for closer co-operation between the Gardaí and the police in the UK&rdquo;, he said.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked us to await the discussion document.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am keen to ensure that, in debating this Bill, we do not pre-empt the outcome of the debate that will undoubtedly ensue from the <Col N="1127" /> discussion paper and, in particular, that we do not deprive people of their opportunity to participate in the consultation process.  With the publication of the discussion paper now imminent, this debate should help to stimulate an interest in aspects of the law on sexual offences, in particular a sex offenders' register. ..</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 December 1997 states:</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice confirmed that the Minister, Mr. O'Donoghue, has decided to establish a register of convicted paedophiles.  . . The Minister had originally planned to seek submissions on whether a register should be established at all, but has now made the decision that it will be established, the spokesman said.</P>
    <P>He had brought the decision forward because of concerns that paedophiles might come to the Republic from Northern Ireland and Britain following the introduction of a register there.</P>
    <P>The move was welcomed by Ms Madeleine Clarke of Barnardos, who said paedophiles were notorious re-offenders.</P>
    <P>By not accepting the Bill the Minister is refusing to tackle the problem of child sexual abuse, which is of widespread concern.  He is depriving the Garda Síochána of up-to-date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders and of valuable information in the investigation and prevention of the crime of child sexual assault.  He is denying society of a powerful deterrent to offenders who would be aware from the moment they register an address or change of address that the Garda Síochána would know about their presence <Col N="1128" /> in the district and have them in their sights. He is sending a signal to those who are fleeing from the UK register that this State is a safe haven to continue their vile activities.  Paedophiles are highly manipulative and clever and their behaviour intensifies as they grow older. They do not consider their activities to be wrong. There is an urgent need to track these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced on several occasions that the discussion document would be published within two weeks.  We will not hold our breath that it will be published within the next two weeks.  The Garda Síochána need to know if a convicted sex offender is living in an area to ensure any danger to children is avoided and children are spared the trauma which, in most cases, affects them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>In 1990 I trawled through the details of a Bill in the Seanad to decriminalise suicide.  The then Minister for Justice, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, promised to introduce her own Bill within two weeks.  It took three years for it to come through. Exactly the same wording was used.  We will await the discussion document and participate in the discussion but if something is not done about this problem by the autumn, I will seek permission to reintroduce this Bill given the importance of this issue and the need to protect our children.</P>
    <P>The register would not be confined to the Garda Síochána.  They would have the opportunity to inform the health boards, those who provide services for children and any person whom they believe should be informed of the whereabouts of paedophiles.  They would have discretion to ensure people do not take the law into their own hands and persecute those who, having been rehabilitated, are behaving properly but still in need of attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The presentation of the report of the expert hearing group in the courts means it is within the court's jurisdiction to consider it. Would the Minister agree that it does not rule out the possibility of other expert group reports being presented in the courts, although they would have to go through a different procedure?  This report of the expert hearing group is reasonable, wide-ranging, well grounded in international research and not unduly punitory to those assessed by it. If this legislation is accepted, the Judiciary will take special note of the expert group's report. Could another group present an alternative green book as evidence, although it would have a different legal status once this Bill is passed?  I presume that possibility is not ruled out.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in this legislation to prevent any group from submitting as evidence what it considers to be appropriate in the circumstances.  However, since we have been waiting a considerable time to process a distinctive Irish standard with well known experts and advisers on many international fronts in order to compile a complete and comprehensive report, it is unlikely that there is any other report as comprehensive as this.  The Deputy is right, however, that it is possible for a group to present what it considers appropriate evidence on this or other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I noted the Minister's reply yesterday about appeals to the Supreme Court.  The report of the Irish expert group and the American or British standards are not identical.  Mr. Justice Johnson said there are approximately 27 different standards in America which tend to be applied depending on the state in which the case is taken. If the American standard, for example, had been tested in the Supreme Court here, would that have given us guidelines which could have been applied?  That is what the Minister is trying to do now with the expert group's report.  The key point seems to be that there are standards in the courts other than an Irish one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted a number of cases yesterday where the courts were not applying any particular <Col N="1131" /> standard which could be compared to standards already established internationally.  Should one of those standards not have been appealed on a point of law to the Supreme Court in order to set parameters for the courts when discussing this matter?  That is what we are doing in this legislation.  During yesterday's debate Deputy Wall asked if this could not be done without legislation. I appreciate the fact that the legislation sets an Irish standard, but up to now the Minister was asking the courts to accept a standard which was internationally valid, yet they did not do that. We are now asking them to accept the Irish standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that question on two fronts.  There are many different types of personal injury cases where the courts do not have what one might call a comprehensive standard on which to base their judgments.  Individual plaintiffs, therefore, put forward their position.  They are legally represented and the court has wide discretion.  I support their wide discretion because there can be many varying circumstances.  I do not know if it would have been possible to have achieved what the Deputy suggested, but we have moved on from that circumstance.  Judgments have been made.  I tried yesterday to go forward rather than back because we have moved on to the present position.  The Green Book, the Irish standard for assessing hearing disability, is more favourable to plaintiffs than the British Black Book or the American standard and I have no disagreement with that.  I had no involvement in its preparation and I am happy to accept the wise judgment of those who, based on their clinical experience, produced what we now have.  I am not interested in trying to assess what might have happened if other steps had been taken.</P>
      <P>Perhaps different actions could have been taken at an earlier stage, but we have moved on and we must wait and see how the courts will adjudicate on the merits of the Green Book.  We look forward to a more equitable system emerging which will deal with all the applicants who have serious hearing injury.  Those who have minor hearing injuries will also be paid appropriate compensation which will respect the rights of everyone, including the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make any general comments beyond saying I welcome the Bill and the principles behind it.  It reconciles the obligation on Government to make available to citizens the right of redress but also ensures that right is available within a reasonable framework. This Bill is a significant attempt to reconcile those two responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to seek clarification on a number of points with which the Minister may have dealt.  In section 1 &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;, in relation to personal injuries, includes any application or claim for compensation.  Presumably that means this provision does not apply only to cases of hearing <Col N="1132" /> injury suffered by Army personnel, but will apply to all hearing injury cases.  To that extent it is nondiscriminatory between Army personnel and others who may suffer hearing injury due to noise exposure in factories, on which guidelines are laid down in the factories Acts, in airport hangers or other such places where there are very high noise levels.  The Minister may have referred to this and, if so, it does not need further confirmation, but if not I would like him to confirm that point.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note hearing injury as distinct from hearing loss is defined in the Bill.  There was a need to set down guidelines and parameters for hearing injury.  As the Minister indicated in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald's point, judgment was at large in relation to what exactly constitutes hearing loss.  An audiogram will indicate high and low tone frequency hearing loss.  Hearing loss was not always a matter of hearing impairment.  As interpreted on some occasions, it meant the quality of hearing, the tone at which a person heard words. In many cases before the courts it was clear plaintiffs were not disabled in terms of understanding the exact words directed to them.  They could not only perceive and hear but completely understand the words directed to them.  However, they might have heard them at a slightly different tone or pitch from other people.  There is variation in hearing capacity as one grows older.  It was suggested by some consultants that from the age of 25 onwards one's hearing starts to change.  The inclusion in the Bill of a reference to age in relation to hearing loss is important.  Section 1 states . &ldquo;where available, of his or her uninjured hearing or, where such measurement is not available, from that predicted as normal for his or her age, .&rdquo;. That reference is fair and appropriate.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill includes a disability percentage age correction factor that starts at age 70.  I am not a consultant ENT surgeon, but it has been suggested that a change occurs in one's hearing capacity at a much younger age.  Disability may significantly occur only after the age of 70, but consultants advised me that even at my rather young age the level of my hearing capacity is different from that of someone who is 20 years younger, even though I am not conscious of that. Table 4 seems generous in relation to those who require an age correcting factor to be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>With the advent of the Green Book does the Minister envisage many more cases will reach court rather than be settled before the court hearing?  The majority of cases have been settled prior to the court hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister or his Department have an estimate or any way of obtaining an estimate of the numbers of those currently on the list?  Can he can draw conclusions from the data he has of numbers who will be excluded or will fall below the level, in other words, who will <Col N="1133" /> be seen to have zero disability as a result of introducing the Irish expert group report on hearing disability?  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to that point.  This ties in with Deputy Wall's point that most cases have been settled out of court.  Am I right in saying such data are not available?  The Minister said many times that such claimants would not get awards in other jurisdictions, but on what is he basing that claim and can he predict what will happen in the future?  He can only base that prediction on cases on which he has data.  On how many cases does he have data to allow him to make that prediction?</P>
      <P>Regarding the putting into law of a scientific standard agreed by an expert group, I understand this is the first time this will be done.  It is a major precedent brought about by an extraordinary situation. Because it is such a major precedent, I can envisage a situation where one group may claim that, for example, autism or another condition is defined in such a way and that condition consists of X, Y and Z. There is always room for disagreement in expert reports.  The very nature of expert evidence is that experts will disagree. While there is much agreement among this expert group within the Irish context it is such a large precedent &mdash; as Deputy O'Kennedy said, it will relate not just to Army deafness cases but will apply to all personal injury deafness cases &mdash; and such a basic readjustment of an approach to personal injuries, that it may run into trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed I did not get an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage.  In welcoming the Bill, I pay tribute to the Minister and the Front Bench spokespersons for the manner in which they have dealt with it.  This difficult problem has been tackled in a mature way.  I hope it solves the major problems that lay ahead.  I always thought the claimants would have settled for much less but the only avenue open to them was to go to court, which was becoming an expensive route.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated last night that the cost of cases and awards had reduced significantly in recent months and that, in the event of the courts accepting the standard which we were now producing and arriving at more realistic awards, he would consider setting up a more non-confrontational system.  Has the Minister decided what might be an acceptable award?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been seeking for the better part of 30 years to see if there was any vulnerability or frailty in my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy. I am glad to notice there is some small deterioration in one of the faculties but the rest of them are certainly superb.  The answer to the first question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it covers all cases, including the Garda compensation scheme, as well as all other workers as far as hearing disability is concerned.  The Deputy is correct to distinguish between it and what we all know as gradual hearing loss associated with age.  However, hearing <Col N="1134" /> loss can be hereditary, have medical causes or be caused by other noises, such as those at discos, etc., which might contribute to it.  On looking at the table, it starts at 1 per cent disability for males at 70.  Deputies will notice that generally speaking the ladies will not suffer that disability for a further eight years.  However, the 20 decibel lower fence takes account of the deterioration in hearing loss over the span before the age of 70.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall wanted to know is it likely that more cases will go to court now.  I do not know. If we take into account that there are 10,500 cases still pending, the effect that would have on the courts in terms of the amount of time which would be taken up if all of the cases were to go to court would be significant and would also have the effect of slowing up other personal injury cases, many of which might be much more serious.  From that point of view, it is important that we are able to move, as Deputy Power requested, to the non-adversarial system as quickly as possible.  That does not close the door to cases going to court ultimately.</P>
      <P>What we hope to see happening is that the quantum for minor and insignificant injury will come down to a level which the taxpayer can afford and which is appropriate to that injury; that the compensation for serious injury will remain high because serious injury should be properly compensated; and that a formula can be worked out in due time to find another way of dealing with such huge numbers so that we would not have to deal with this over the protracted period of some 17.5 years at present numbers which was indicated when I was in the High Court.  That would not be sustainable.  While we cannot predict with certainty what will happen, we hope that we can gradually move to looking at other options as the quantum is reduced.  I will come back to this House and seek agreement to whatever steps might be taken.  However, we must wait to see what will happen and to what extent the courts will have regard for the Green Book in the context of the existing numbers of claims. I hope we will not have all or huge numbers of that 10,500 going before the courts.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to move to a position where we will be able to settle cases outside of the court without bringing in at a significant cost people, whether engineers or other specialised personnel, who are necessary in the context of a court sitting. That is my aim and I think it is the route we should take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald wanted to know if we can estimate with any great certainty the numbers which would fall off due to the effect of the Green Book, if that were accepted by the courts. Using any of the other international standards of which we are aware, significant numbers would not qualify for compensation.  It would be impossible to put an exact percentage on that, but it would certainly be within the 30-40 per cent range.  It would appear that a substantial proportion of the 1,400 cases which have been dealt with either in the court or settled outside the <Col N="1135" /> court would either receive minimal compensation or none, although I cannot give an exact percentage because I would have to do volumes of work to be sure about that.</P>
    <P>To answer Deputy Power and Deputy Wall, the aim is to move to that non-adversarial system, whether that is settlements outside the court or a different way of dealing with this.  I am not in a position to give this House any real facts on what is an appropriate compensation for different kinds of injuries.  Each plaintiff has his or her constitutional rights and a case to make, and they will be defended by the legal profession.  It is up to the courts to decide what is appropriate in each case.  Nonetheless, because there is such a generality of cases arising from the same type of injury in the same type of circumstances, it suggests that a norm will begin to develop in relation to the percentage of handicap.  As I said yesterday, if 100 per cent disability in hearing injury should be compensated at a particular rate, we should try to work back on the basis of the appropriate percentage of disability.  I could not go beyond that, I am afraid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I did not look for the Minister to give a figure to the House.  I wanted to know had he set a figure in his mind.  I accept his answer, but I did not seek that he divulge to the House today what he might see as an acceptable figure down the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance of this report from a public policy point of view is that if it is accepted by the courts, claimants who do not have a case will be excluded.  How does the Minister know that 30 to 40 per cent of claimants may be excluded?  Most cases have been settled outside court.  Does the Minister have data on the hearing assessments carried out on those cases? Is that why he believes that the hearing of the 30 to 40 per cent will be below 20 decibels?  I am aware the Minister cannot be totally clear on this, but has he data on the 1,400 cases that have been settled which leads him to the conclusion that 30 to 40 per cent will be excluded because they have no disability or handicap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said.  Let us consider the international criteria and the standard set by the British and Americans.  For instance, the British system states that there must be 20 per cent disability before a person qualifies. Based on those standards, between 30 and 40 per cent of cases settled outside or in court would fall outside the realm of compensation.  In terms of the Green Book, it would be impossible for me to give precise percentages of the number of cases that would fall outside the realm of compensation. Either significant numbers would fall outside it or they would qualify for compensation at a level significantly below that awarded by the courts for such injury.</P>

      <P>From time to time I have meetings with the representative associations where all pertinent matters are covered, including pay and allowances and other matters.  We had the opportunity to discuss this matter at informal and formal sessions.  I hope to have early meetings shortly on present developments.  All of what I said to Deputy Fitzgerald is based on the data available to us and the audiogram undertaken of the plaintiffs.  The 30 to 40 per cent is based on the standard of assessment of handicap on the international front.  On the Green Book and its effect, detailed analysis has been carried out on about 700 cases and of the numbers dealt with, about 20 to 25 per cent have zero handicap.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister for Defence shall bring before the Dáil within four weeks of the enactment of this Act a proposal for an appropriate enquiry to establish who carries responsibility for the situation whereby soldiers' hearing was damaged during their army service.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to bring forward this amendment because the Bill is hugely lopsided and imbalanced. <Col N="1137" /> This amendment is the least that should be included to balance the Bill.  The Bill seeks to address issues arising from actions by victims of alleged hearing injury.  It is an emergency measure, a ham-fisted measure to stanch the flow of blood from a wound, but it is utterly silent on who is responsible for the wound, on where responsibility lies for this crisis.  The Minister seeks to blame the victims of this injury rather than establish where real responsibility lies, which is appalling.</P>
    <P>If bogus claims are involved I utterly condemn them and they should be unceremoniously dealt with.  In the overall conduct of this matter natural justice must prevail.  Natural justice involves setting up under this Bill a mechanism to establish responsibility for something that is about to cost hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  The Minister put responsibility for this crisis everywhere except where it belongs, and that should not go unchallenged by Deputies representing ordinary people, including rank and file members of the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to 1952 and said that knowledge of these matters was limited at that time as it was in the 1970s.  I will give an example of my personal experience.  In the early 1970s I worked in construction in Sydney, Australia.  I worked a jackhammer day after day taking rock out of the streets.  On the first day I joined the group of working men I knew some of them had their hearing damaged as a result of not wearing hearing defenders against the constant rattle of jackhammers.  It does not take an audiogram to find out that damage will be caused to hearing from constant loud and sharp noises.  Even in the 1950s, and much more so in the 1970s, people in the Defence Forces who had responsibility for firing ranges and other activities should have insisted upon precautionary measures against hearing damage.  The Minister is trying to absolve the military establishment.  Responsibility for this problem lies with that establishment but we must also consider where political responsibility for it lay in the past.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister stated that in the 1970s &ldquo;In conformity with the practice of the time, it was left to each individual to follow advice and wear the plugs.&rdquo; He also stated that 81,000 sets of defenders were made available but this is not taken as conclusive evidence by judges hearing High Court cases.  In the context of rank and file soldiers, this is an extraordinary statement because the wearing of defenders must have been the only matter left to their discretion.  No other matters were left to their discretion.  Was it left to the discretion of soldiers to decide the time at which they rose each morning or attended for drill practice?  Was it left to their discretion to decide whether they should take up Border duty, choose the type of uniform they wore, shovel snow off the streets of Dublin and other areas when so ordered or comply when they were scandalously dragooned to drive trucks to break a bus strike?  Absolutely not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> The Minister is trying to absolve the military establishment and place responsibility on rank and file soldiers.  His action is totally unconvincing to anyone familiar with the regime under which these individuals operate.  I reject the Minister's action.  The majority of soldiers joined the Army as working class youths and for decades they formed an exploited section of the workforce. Their rates of pay were scandalous and in the 1980s their spouses stood for election to try to rectify this.  I will be blunt &mdash; rank and file soldiers were treated like second class citizens in the past.  The Army operated an extremely entrenched class system with cadets and officers, for whom rank and file soldiers provided fodder, at the top.  That was the military ethos and the military establishment must take full responsibility for being negligent by not taking the necessary measures to protect those in its charge.</P>
    <P>The least the Minister can do is accept this amendment which seeks to establish the facts and discover where responsibility lies.  I am revolted by the continual tendency in the media and elsewhere to ridicule rank and file soldiers <i>en masse.</i> Scarcely a word has been said about the chain of command which allowed this problem to develop. Having put forward the point of view of the ordinary victims, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment and establish the inquiry I requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Hindsight&rdquo;, Deputy Joe Higgins, has given us a lesson in history as he perceives it.  However, many people would disagree with the views he expressed.  This amendment is completely unnecessary.  There is no doubt that a number of members of the Defence Forces suffered damage to their hearing in the course of their duties.  There is also no doubt that negligence occurred and people who were badly disabled must be properly compensated.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have reached the stage where taking a case to court has become very costly and, because of legal expenses, those who suffered have received only a percentage of their original awards.  We are now attempting to put in place a system under which people will be properly compensated for the injuries they received as a result of their duties in the Defence Forces.  This will remove the unnecessary expenses people have incurred to date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked who was responsible for this problem?  It is important that he should show a measure of responsibility by not singing the same tune at all times.  The amendment, which tries to apportion blame, is totally unnecessary. The Committee of Public Accounts dealt with this matter a number of weeks ago and Deputy Higgins did not show much interest in it at that stage.  A number of expert groups and individuals gave evidence before the committee.  It proved a worthwhile exercise.  I am satisfied with the role the Minister is taking on and in due course his action will be seen as correct.</P>

      <P>The question posed by Deputy Higgins is reasonable.  Who was at fault here?  It is appropriate to reconsider the history of this issue and examine the various issues at play.  In the current climate, health and safety issues are of major importance and legislation in this area has advanced considerably.  Is the Minister satisfied with current standards?  It appears that no claims have been made since 1987 when the new standards were put in place.  It is extremely important to ensure that adequate provision is made for the health and safety aspects of work in the Defence Forces.  Disturbing evidence recently emerged that health and safety standards at Baldonnel are not what they should be and a number of hangars were closed.  It is obvious that there are ongoing concerns in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>There was a time when a person's individual rights were subsumed on joining the Defence Forces because a different international situation obtained and there was a different awareness of the role of armies.  However, the Minister will agree that the awareness of individual rights within a military structure is changing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Power stated that the Committee of Public Accounts examined this matter and it took evidence from organisations representing officers and soldiers, from the Department and from the Chief of Staff.  One of the issues which emerged is that current safety standards are different to those which obtained in the early years.  It is important to remember that in 1961 the protection used was a piece of cotton wool moistened with vaseline, in 1972 ear plugs were issued to all members of the Defence Forces and in 1987 the new training circular was issued and safety procedures changed.</P>
      <P>Current health and safety standards must be properly implemented.  That is the important issue.  I congratulate Deputy Jim Mitchell and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the excellent hearings in relation to this issue and the comprehensive way it was examined.  The committee did an excellent job in examining the different factors involved and the weight to be given to each of them.</P>

      <P>While the thrust of the amendment could be agreed to, I have doubts about what would happen to all the cases currently pending before the courts.  If such an inquiry were established, many cases would be put on the long finger and problems might be created in regard to settling all the cases before the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated yesterday by my Fine Gael colleague, I am concerned that there are problems with the hearing apparatus being supplied to some sections of the Defence Forces.  In that regard I <Col N="1140" /> would like the Minister to give a commitment today that Defence Forces safety standards would be 100 per cent and that the situation would not arise where there would be further cases from 1987.  It is vitally important that, irrespective of which section of the Defence Forces is involved &mdash; the FCA, the Air Corps or the Navy &mdash; every effort is made by the Department to ensure devices and tests are made available to the members.</P>
    <P>During a previous Question Time I asked the Minister about individual tests taken from 1952. I stand to be corrected but I believe the answer I received was that the tests were the personal property of the individual on whom the test was carried out.  I hope that will not be the norm from now on.  The Department should also have the results of tests on individual members of the Defence Forces.  Such documentation should be available for each member so that their hearing condition over a number of years would be known.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins's contribution left me a little confused.  Perhaps the Minister may be in a position to clarify matters.  I got the impression from Deputy Higgins's contribution that there was a two-tier system <i>vis-à-vis</i> the military establishment and the rank and file members.  Will the Minister indicate if different types of ear defenders were issued to people in the Defence Forces or was the same type issued to everybody?</P>
      <P>With respect to the claims, have claims been made by officers for damaged hearing or are their ears slightly different from the so-called rank and file members?  When I served in the Defence Forces I do not remember any distinction between these ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, ear defenders, as they were at the time, were made available to officers and NCOs.  Claims have been received from officers and a number of plaintiffs who are officers have been successful both before the courts and outside.  In terms of overall responsibility, many of them would have had at least some responsibility at the time for the maintenance of standards.  Putting this into an international context, we had very little artillery fire at the time.  We had small range fire and, by any standards, the comparisons we made on the international front would indicate that at that time we were on a par with most other armies in the ear protection available.</P>
      <P>To deal with the more fundamental points, I have the greatest respect for everybody who is elected to this House, regardless of the party from which they come, and I know that all Members want to serve their communities. However, I resent any Member deciding for themselves that they are the saviour of the working class.  The majority of my supporters have come from the working class, and I do not like classification in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> I reject emphatically the contention that I tried to blame the victims.  I also reject any effort to put in train in this House the view that I am either trying to save somebody or not doing this job properly.  Deputy Higgins knows I did not cause the problem but I have the task of trying to solve it.  The greatest disservice one can do to the Defence Forces is to try to find a scapegoat and carry on this parade for years incurring more expense on the taxpayer.  Another disservice would be not to try to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>We could let this issue continue as it is but from the contact I have had with those in the military, from the top down, I know the level of support that exists for trying to solve this problem on a fair and equitable basis &mdash; fair to those who were injured and fair to the taxpayers.  We have had a pleasant debate up to now and I would like Members to remember that the ultimate solution to this problem is not to go back to a time when things were completely different.</P>
    <P>Before addressing the inherent flaws at the heart of this amendment I must point out that the proposal to establish an inquiry falls completely outside the scope of the Bill.  However, lest there be any suggestion that I am evading the substance of the issue raised, I will reply to the proposal.</P>
    <P>A very detailed inquiry into Army hearing loss claims is already under way under the auspices of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Time after time Members have asked if there is a way this House can carry out inquiries inexpensively and quickly.  The Committee of Public Accounts is one of those important arms in determining matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>In an unprecedented series of hearings spanning over three days, the Secretaries General of the Departments of Defence, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance attended the committee, with the Chief of Staff and other senior Army officers.  Representatives of other interested parties including the Defence Forces representative associations, the legal profession and the Health and Safety Authority were also questioned.  The Committee of Public Accounts has already published an interim report and I see no merit in duplicating work already under way.</P>
    <P>I have already addressed the history of hearing conservation in the Defence Forces in my contribution on Second Stage.  For the benefit of the Deputy, I remind the House that we are addressing the consequences of events which took place more than ten, 20 and sometimes 30 years ago. One can only imagine how a tribunal would try to delve into records that are lost and memories that have become frail in order to establish who was on the range, who was the officer in charge and whether ear plugs were provided on a particular day.</P>
    <P>With the wisdom of hindsight and the luxury of Opposition, it is easy to hurl the cheap insult of negligence at the Defence Forces.  Among Irish officers and non-commissioned officers there has never been a culture of negligence regarding the <Col N="1142" /> safety and welfare of the men under their command. As I have already explained, however, health and safety measures reflect contemporary practice and knowledge.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Higgins may outline comparisons with what happened in Australia in his own personal experience, he will know that the Factories Act, which protected workers in this country, was not established until 1975.  The health and safety legislation was enacted in l989, two years after a rigorous new system was put in place for the Defence Forces.  The regime for health and safety in the Army is excellent.  Any resources needed, and any extra knowledge that comes to hand that can enhance that, will be freely made available by me as Minister.  A permanent group established within the Defence Forces, involving different members, has provided 63 technical guidance documents as new information comes on stream to continually upgrade systems and ensure that we have the best possible regime for the health, safety and protection of soldiers.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for us to praise the members of the Defence Forces for their work here, for their loyalty and service to this country, and for the enormous honour they have brought us in the United Nations where we celebrate 40 years of involvement this year, but these are the same officers that Deputy Higgins now wants to blame who went out to the Congo and to other parts of the world to lead troops in peace-keeping operations. They are the officers who were called out in emergency situations here, that the Deputy seeks to blame.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment gives no clue as to what form an inquiry might take.  The legal fees being generated by the present situation are burden enough without adding a bill from a tribunal of inquiry which would simply duplicate work already under way.  My priority, reflected in the Bill before the House, is to search for a solution not for a scapegoat.  The roots of our problem lie in the unfortunate conjunction of a uniquely generous medico-legal interpretation of what constitutes a hearing loss, the unforeseen consequences of a relaxation of the statute of limitations in l991, a degree of a genuine hearing loss in some individuals, and our compensation culture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall wanted to know whether going ahead with a tribunal would lead to the postponement of cases currently before the courts.  It is not proposed to establish a tribunal.  Ordinary PAYE workers who pay for tribunals through their taxes, who wait for inconclusive results, who hear conflicting evidence at tribunals, who are unable to decide at the finish where all the millions have gone get fed up with an administration that is unable to solve national problems without exposing taxpayers to millions of pounds of expenditure in this form of attack on the past without determining what it is we should do for the future.</P>

      <P>A point I made last night that may have been lost might throw some light on <Col N="1143" /> the subject.  Deputy Higgins mentioned the wives taking a stand.  I am sure Deputy Power remembers it because his constituency was one of the targets.  Following those protests the Gleeson commission was set up in l989 and reported in July l990.  A team headed by the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, visited barracks, met various groups and received 216 submissions. There were 18 oral hearings.  It met roughly 3,000 people and produced a report of 300 plus pages. Nowhere in that report is there mention of deafness. In l990 people were not aware that there was a problem.  No complaint had been made to the commission about ear defenders.  It is important to note that.  The issue may have been raised with the commission by one or two people, but there is no reference to it in the report.  If it was an issue I am sure it would have been mentioned. I am not here to fight the Minister's corner but I would be interested in knowing, if the Department can produce the information, whether in the first 100 or 200 cases taken were the first, second or third case taken against the State by the individuals in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I stand over the points I made.  I did not apportion responsibility to specific officers.  I would like to know where the responsibility lies because it is necessary to redress the balance.  The rank and file members of the Army feel extremely put upon as a result of the mass of propaganda in the press which seems to rubbish every claim for compensation or injury.  The upshot of implications in the press is that people who have suffered disability are made to feel like cheats.  That is unjust and it is necessary to rectify it.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of a just and equitable solution, but this Bill does not provide that.  When we are dealing with particular measures later I will say why I believe this Bill is not just.  From the point of view of the overall balance it is necessary to establish that it is not a case of soldiers on the make and of absolving everybody else of responsibility.  The Minister knows that rank and file soldiers were treated very badly for a very long time in the Army.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the details, but there is a chain of command in the Army and the responsibility lies somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus has been on claimants and, at times, on the caricaturing and stereotyping of claimants.  As a House we should regret this because it seems that there was a vacuum in terms of legal structures, administrative structures and structures generally within the Army, and a combination of factors, including the fact that there was no compensation system in place within the Army and that we did not do what the British did when they brought in their statute of limitations in l987 &mdash; they provided that people could not claim in respect of the period prior to its enactment and put in new safety standards and so were able to assess in an ongoing way whether <Col N="1144" /> there was damage from l987 onwards.  All these factors came together.  A legal and constitutional vacuum allowed these claims develop.  I totally agree with Deputy Higgins regarding the stereotyping of claimants.  There have been awards given to people where there was low handicap, but that happened in the courts.  It related to not having available an expert Irish standard.  To focus on and totally blame claimants is wrong.  At the same time one cannot condone opportunistic claims or claims where people know there is no disability but try to buck the system.  It is reasonable to make this point.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that many members of the Defence Forces would like to see these cases taken out of the courts.  They would be willing to accept this if a fair assessment system was put in place, with clear guidelines which matched payment levels with the seriousness of the disability, as long as it was seen to protect their rights.  Such an administrative system would receive backing as long as it was not primarily introduced to give the State the upper hand.  If it was fair and rigorous with clear standards both the public and the Defence Forces would favour it.  The Defence Forces want the issue dealt with fairly.  They certainly do not want a continuation of the type of coverage witnessed over recent months which is very bad for morale, something that has been said many times.  The way forward is to move to an administrative system.  The inquiry being carried out by the Public Accounts Committee, which already has very good information, will continue.</P>
      <P>Hopefully action will be taken on the side of safety to ensure no recurrence of this issue.  Such action has been taken, with some exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for clarifying the position in relation to the Gleeson commission &mdash; I took it up incorrectly last night. I also thank him, as somebody who has served with distinction in the Defence Forces, for facing up to the problem in a comprehensive manner, taking account of the full nature of the problem as distinct from trying to side-track it into an avenue where one becomes the saviour of all.</P>
      <P>In my knowledge these hearing cases are among the first such experiences of the State in the context of any organisation.  Deputies are aware that there have been multiple claims by some individuals.  Yesterday I referred to one case, which was commented upon in court with regard to truthfulness, where three to five claims were submitted against the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with Deputy Higgins's request for a fair and equitable system &mdash; I also want that.  There is no way the House can hide 12,500 claims or the fact that hundreds of millions of pounds will be required to pay for them. Before reaching the question of which claimants are genuine and which have a lesser or no handicap, these significant sums have to be raised through taxation or by taking money from other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the major statements to the national <Col N="1145" /> newspapers were made by Army personnel in the context of asking the State to have claims processed in a different manner.  Some of these statements presented at least some of claimants as not being genuine.  These are not my words but those of statements made by experienced Army personnel, at least one of whom is retired.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to find solutions to this problem. I am not interested in publicity or scapegoating anybody.  Neither will I try to totally exonerate everybody involved in all claims.  Yesterday I mentioned that 5,000 cases were on hand when the High Court decided to award £80,000 for a minor injury.  The 5,000 claims arose over five years but in the nine months following that judgment almost the same number of claims were submitted.  People can make up their minds on the effect of the judgment.  I accept Deputy Power's comment that the vast majority of plaintiffs would have been quite happy to receive significantly lower amounts.  If this had been the case we would not have the astronomical problem we are now facing and trying to resolve.</P>
    <P>Audiograms taken while in the Army are available to the soldier and the Army medical officer. I should also have indicated when answering Deputy Timmins that claims by officers represent 4 per cent of the total, while officers represent 10 per cent of Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I would have preferred if much of the publicity had never taken place. However, there is no way of getting around the public media addressing serious questions which are tormenting many people.  They have agitated the minds of the courts.  There has been a significant reduction in the quantum and we are looking forward to a more reasonable outcome on foot of the Green Book in cases which involve little or no injury.</P>
    <P>I will defend to the last the rights of individual soldiers and others in society to fully exercise their constitutional right where they feel they have sustained a personal injury.  I have said many times on radio, television and other media, something Deputy Higgins has seen fit to ignore, that I want to see genuine applicants dealt with quickly and comprehensively.  I have stated publicly that I will be their friend and defender. However, we must remember that no defence of genuine applicants with serious injury attributable to their service in the Defence Forces would be possible if the train was allowed pursue the route it was taking.  As night follows day, two things would happen: those with a genuine injury would receive less than they were entitled to while those with insignificant injury would continue to receive more than they were entitled to. These are only two of my worries.  My biggest worry is that the greatest disservice to the Defence Forces would be a failure to ensure that a proper system was in place which was fair and equitable.  Failure to do this would see the decimation of the Defence Forces in terms of our total Estimate.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, no Government will make <Col N="1146" /> the cuts in education, health, environment or other such sensitive areas.  It is more likely that money would have to come from our Estimate. This would destroy recruitment, refurbishment and provision of armoured personnel carriers which we need in the UN.  All the positive things we want to do would be jeopardised.  This is why I must be forthright.  While others can skirt around the issue, I must face reality.  I am not afraid to do this and I want to do it on a fair basis. I am glad that every contributor in the debate has been anxious to do the same.  I appreciate the unanimous support I have received in going this far.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;whether commenced before or after the enactment of this Act.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;which proceedings deal with hearing injuries sustained after the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to respond to a number of specific points I wish to raise about the new standards he proposes in the Bill.  It is arbitrary to introduce a standard and apply it to injuries sustained during past decades.  In regard to fair and just settlement, it would be desirable if the parties concerned found a way to take this matter out of the courts.  Every effort should be made to achieve this as it would dramatically reduce costs.</P>
      <P>There are a number of difficulties with the Minister's proposal.  If the Bill is passed and the courts have regard to it, it will be applied strictly to claimants currently claiming compensation for injury before the courts.  On the other hand, it could have serious consequences for serving soldiers whose hearing competence is graded by audiogram tests.  For example, depending on the extent of hearing loss, this could result in failure to be promoted, denial of overseas service or, at the extreme end, in discharge from the force. However, if a soldier is discharged, obviously he or she would be entitled to a generous compensation package.  Under the policy of the Defence Forces, will the first 20 decibels of loss be disregarded when the Army is grading soldiers undergoing tests?  Otherwise, one standard will apply to people currently before the courts and much stricter standards, with possibly severe consequences, to hearing tests for soldiers in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal will also pose problems for soldiers who leave the Army and are obliged to take a hearing tests when they apply for civilian jobs. Such tests are often required for jobs in security firms, for which many former soldiers apply.  If they have a hearing loss of 19 decibels they could be turned down for such jobs, but that is not taken into account in the case of the courts.  If the Minister introduces a standard for the courts, does he not believe a similar standard should <Col N="1147" /> apply to grading soldiers in the Army and in respect of civilian jobs when they leave?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that measuring hearing loss is very difficult and that the facilities for doing so have not been fine tuned.  In that sense it is different from a visible physical injury.  What the Minister is doing is equivalent to saying if one loses the top of one's finger it may be disregarded for compensation purposes, whereas if one loses half a finger one should be compensated.  While a hearing loss of up to 20 decibels may not be a disability in the strict sense of the word, it is certainly a loss for the individual concerned.  Why should the aspects of life affected by hearing loss be disregarded?</P>
    <P>If the Minister introduces standards for the courts, they should also apply to injuries sustained from the time they are put in place.  To apply them retrospectively could give rise to the contradictions and inconsistencies to which I referred.  Will the Minister respond to those specific points?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins wants to confine the application of this Bill to proceedings which deal with hearing injuries sustained after the enactment of the legislation.  In the normal course of events that would be a reasonable proposal and consistent with the norms of law.  In reality, however, if his proposal were adopted it would apply to almost zero cases.  The hearing protection regulations introduced by the Defence Forces and the authorities in 1987 is recognised by all levels of the Army as entirely adequate. That, <i>ipso facto,</i> indicates that hearing injuries would not have been sustained since 1987.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the claims currently before the courts contains the assertion that a hearing injury was sustained after that date. Therefore, Deputy Higgins's amendment would not be applicable in any case although the reasons he outlined were justifiable.</P>
      <P>The Statute of Limitations is an important issue in all these cases.  It is clear from the views outlined in the Green Book and comments made by the Minister and others that hearing impairment, once sustained, is permanent.  In the vast majority of cases currently before the courts, the claimants and their legal advisers are, perhaps understandably, making the case that they only became aware of the injury three years prior to the commencement of proceedings, even though it may have existed before that.  The proceedings currently before the courts were initiated in 1995, 1996, 1997 and even in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, people may only have become aware of the gravity of their injuries in the past three years.  It will be for the courts to adjudicate on that in accordance with the Statute of Limitations. I will not comment on what might be termed the rather extraordinary coincidence that so many people, having sustained an injury prior <Col N="1148" /> to 1987, only became aware of it in the past three years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to achieve a balance in this situation.  There are inevitably some people who, when they heard access was available to the courts in matters of this kind, availed of it. Although I am reluctant to say it, it would appear that some may have been encouraged by legal advisers.  When the issue of the Statute of Limitations, which confines claims to injuries sustained in the three years prior to the initiation of proceedings, is raised, people's standard response is that they only became aware of the injury or its gravity within the preceding three years.  That may be true in some genuine cases.</P>
    <P>It is important that we, as politicians with responsibility to the taxpayer, attempt to achieve a fair balance in this matter.  That is what the Bill attempts to do.  It is then a matter for the courts to adjudicate on whether the Statute of Limitations applies in the light of the evidence before them.  Deputy Higgins's amendment, if adopted, would not apply to any cases.  One would also have to consider injuries other than those sustained in the course of Army service, although that is the focal point with which we are dealing. We must bear in mind that courts read the law as we pass it, not as we would wish them to read it. No specific reference is made in this legislation to the Defence Forces because the same non-discriminatory approach must apply to everything.</P>
    <P>Anyone with any awareness of the pattern of awards will realise that what the Minister said in regard to size and precedent is entirely true.  Having said that, it is equally clear that it was important to resist and defend some cases vigorously. When a general guideline to that effect issued from the Department, a considerable number of cases were dismissed.  That had not been the experience hitherto.</P>
    <P>Some judges may have felt aggrieved by comments made by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts which implied that all of the amounts awarded were determined by them when they were not.  The Minister for Defence made it very clear that those with genuine cases would have those cases heard and processed and would receive a fair and reasonable response from the Department and the Attorney General. However, where doubts exist, claims must be properly resisted.  In many cases, judges had nothing at all to do with the amounts awarded.</P>
    <P>Judges do not live in cloud cuckoo land, neither do solicitors or Army personnel.  From the initial judgment, referred to by the Minister, onwards, cases were dismissed which would not previously have been and awards as low as £2,500 or £5,000 were made.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts outlined a grossly inflated figure of what those claims were costing the taxpayer and he dominated the headlines.  He appeared to estimate the cost on the basis of the number of serving members of the forces who have not, as yet, had their cases dealt with and those likely to bring proceedings in the future.  He then seemed <Col N="1149" /> to multiply that global figure by an average award, which he fixed arbitrarily, thus arriving at a figure in the region of billions of pounds.  That did not do anybody any service.  It was not fair to the serving members of the Defence Forces or to those who were entitled to bring claims but chose not to for one reason or another.  If we are going to make a valid contribution on this issue, we should not grossly overstate the reality, serious though it may be.  I suggest that the figure will be significantly lower than that mentioned by Deputy Mitchell.  I wish I could be as sure of everything as that.  They will then ask what went wrong and on what information is it based.</P>
    <P>Obviously the issue is to get a measure of balance in dealing with the rights of serving members of the Army who have done this nation proud.  We all acknowledge that.  Even if there was, through an oversight, a lack of knowledge on the part of the authorities through successive administrations and command it would not have been the intention of any administration, much less this one, to deprive them of their rights. Therefore, we want to acknowledge &mdash; I think this is the intention in Deputy Higgins's amendment &mdash; their right to access to the courts in circumstances such as this, subject to their being another way if that is to emerge.  If the pattern followed before the cases were adjourned continues and with this new measures of hearing impairment, which is appropriate as distinct from hearing loss, the courts are free to make their decision, I have no doubt that many of the cases included in Deputy Mitchell's list will not appear in a list anywhere else because it will be clear to the advisers of those people that they have no chance of success whereas these have and costs will be incurred.  It is proper that the State, in circumstances where it considers the case had little or no merit, should not only apply for costs, to which it would be entitled if the case is dismissed, but pursue its costs afterwards.  In the event of a settlement the costs will be a different issue. One has to take a responsible view in all this given that the taxpayer cannot dole out sums to all and sundry to whom it might occur to bring claims.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of Deputy Higgins's amendment, perhaps the Minister and his advisers would look at what may be only a minuscule number of cases. Deputy Higgins wants to substitute: &ldquo;which proceedings deal with hearing injuries sustained after the enactment of this Act.&rdquo; A small number of cases, perhaps fewer than 20, was being heard before the whole process was adjourned and this Bill introduced.  There would be a certain difficulty if this Bill were to apply to that small number of cases.  If the formula of words proposed by Deputy Higgins that this Act shall apply to all proceedings before a court, which proceedings deal with hearing injuries sustained after the enactment of this Act, were accepted it would mean the small number of cases which had been conducted for two or three days, before the Bill was introduced, would be excluded.  This would <Col N="1150" /> mean just a small adjustment but there could be a difficulty.  In fairness to the courts it may not be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 4 states: &ldquo;.. the courts shall, in determining the extent of the injuries suffered, have regard to..&rdquo;. This Act could not have full and vigorous effect in respect of those cases which have been partially heard.</P>
    <P>It is significant and appropriate to acknowledge that the Bill provides that the courts shall, in determining the extent of the injuries suffered, have regard to the classification method.  That classification method, which is a matter for expert evidence &mdash; expert consultants &mdash; is that the courts shall have regard to that expert evidence, and rightly so.  I do not think the courts could object to that.  This is a very balanced approach and the parliamentary draftsman, the advisers and the Minister obviously had this in mind.  It does not state: &ldquo;The courts shall, in fixing compensation, have regard to..&rdquo;. The courts know that if they have to have regard to the extent of the injuries suffered, it means they will fix the compensation accordingly.  The balance which refers to the classification method, contained in Chapter 7.1, is appropriate and does not tie the hands of the courts.</P>
    <P>I can understand and endorse the views of those who say that if another system can be found, after we see the effect of this legislation in practice, we could come back and establish a norm which the courts had adopted.  On the other hand it may well be that if the practice, following the enactment of this Bill, in the courts is such as to greatly impact &mdash; maintaining the balance at all times between the plaintiff, the State and the taxpayer &mdash; that would be a matter for judgment. It is a judgment that would create a reasonable balance between an injured plaintiff and the State, which would have responsibility.</P>

      <P>Section 2 states: &ldquo;This Act shall apply to all proceedings before a court, whether commenced before or after the enactment of this Act.&rdquo; My question, which the Minister addressed slightly yesterday, asked about the Attorney General's advice on this section.  In his book, <i>The Irish Constitution,</i> Kelly states that the independence of the courts and their immunity from control by the Oireachtas is not absolute and can scarcely be made so.  He says that most of the court structure and court procedures are prescribed immediately or ultimately by Statute, which the Oireachtas can modify, and that there seems to be nothing to prevent the Oireachtas from changing the law retrospectively to nullify the effect of a courts judgment in one case or a series of cases, provided, of course, that this does not trench on the rights of the parties to that litigation.  That is a critical point.  He goes on to say that what does appear to be inviolable is the judicial process itself.  While in operation, once begun, it must be allowed to run its course without interference.  On the principle of judicial process being inviolable <Col N="1151" /> while in operation, what was the nature of the advice the Minister received?  Yesterday the Minister said that in the Buckley <i>v.</i> the Attorney General &mdash; the Sinn Féin funds case &mdash; there is a difference between that and this legislation. There was more of a direction involved in that case whereas this legislation shall take note.  This section seems to be a direct application and it is probably a legal constitutional point.  I do not know how it will be adjudicated on.  It seems that section 2 is giving a strong direction to the court. I thought the Minister made the point that the difference between the Buckley case and this legislation was slightly more open.  Is that an issue?</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins and I, in the earlier part of the game, tried to sort each other out while the referee was not watching.  I thought he had just come around to my point of view when he kicked the ball into the back of the net again.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear him say he wished to see the compensation bill reduced dramatically. We must ensure our resources are directed in the best possible way.  All public representatives are under pressure to try to meet the public's demands, whether it is a speech therapist for somebody who cannot speak, a physiotherapist for somebody who cannot walk or an artificial limb for somebody who has waited months for it. As a result of that pressure, we cannot afford to waste anything while at the same time ensuring that every genuine claim is met.</P>
      <P>The Army grades as H1 a person who has thresholds below 20 decibels.  The House will accept that 20 decibels is a fair threshold.  A person with up to 35 per cent disability will be retained in service in the Defence Forces to perform certain duties, although not necessarily those they did previously.  No measures are being taken in the Defence Forces which will use either the Green Book or any other threshold to change the fundamentals in this regard.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Kennedy for his comments.  It was important to hear from somebody who has experience with matters such as this in the courts. From the Deputy's perspective, in terms of his legal activities, his presentation to the Dáil on this matter was courageous on a number of the important aspects of this problem.  I also thank the Incorporated Law Society.  After our earlier encounters we have managed to come together to bring forward legislation which restricts advertising, albeit by a minority of legal firms who have not helped in this process. However, that is in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one makes comments about a certain profession, people are inclined to interpret them as a generality no matter how often one uses the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo;.  I have said on many occasions that I have the highest respect for the work of the legal profession and, as a public representative, I have experience of many cases which have been brought to court in circumstances where there <Col N="1152" /> was no question of money being paid because it was not available.  These actions are worthy of recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 2 ensures that the legislation applies to all proceedings at present before a court, whether those proceedings commenced before or after the enactment of the Act.  Deputy Higgins's criticism is misconceived as the courts will remain free to award whatever damages they see fit.  The Green Book will not be applied but the courts will have to have regard to the Green Book.  The issue of unfairness or retrospection does not arise.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 is to ensure that the provisions of the Act, namely, judicial notice to be taken of the Green Book report and for the courts to have regard to the handicap assessment formula for hearing loss and tinnitus, apply to all cases awaiting hearing.  There are 10,500 such cases before the courts at present.  If the Oireachtas is of the view that the Green Book report should be taken into account by the courts in assessing hearing handicap for future cases, it is only fair and equitable that such provision should also apply to current cases.</P>
    <P>Some misgivings have been expressed in relation to the possible unconstitutionality of asking the courts to take judicial notice of the Green Book report and to have regard to the formula contained therein in a retrospective manner. However, the effect of the Bill's provisions merely requires the courts to treat the Green Book as evidence and to have regard to its handicap assessment formula.  Under these provisions the Green Book will acquire the status of proved evidence in court but it will be a matter for the court to decide the weight to be attached to this evidence.  The court will remain free to come to whatever conclusion it sees fit.</P>
    <P>Since there is no interference with the adjudicative process of the courts I am advised that a constitutional difficulty in respect of the separation of powers and judicial independence does not arise.  For this reason I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tiny number of cases to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred, the provisions in the Bill which seek to have the court to have regard to the Green Book as distinct from it applying the Green Book should safeguard against his fears.</P>

      <Quest>if she will report on progress on the Irish Genealogy Project under the aegis of her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera) Síle de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in the course of replying to his previous parliamentary question on this issue I referred to the need for resources in my Department to enable a review of the project to be carried out and to examine, in detail, the points made about the project <Col N="1154" /> in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Value for Money report laid before the House in April last year.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to inform the House today of progress thus far.  My Department now has approval to appoint an officer to conduct this review.  This appointment, which will be for a three month period, will enable a detailed examination of the IGP to be undertaken.  At present, the arrangements are in train to effect this temporary appointment which must take place within the framework of the agreed measures for departmental promotions.</P>
      <P>In advance of that appointment my Department requested the chief executive of Irish Genealogy Limited to produce an interim report on progress to date addressing as many of the issues as possible that have been raised about the IGP. The report has recently been received and will be scrutinised as part of that formal review.  Subject to the conclusions of the review the report suggests some grounds for optimism on the future of the IGP, if the funding set out can be earmarked. Unfortunately, those resources are not currently available to my Department without other programmes being cut or eliminated.  If the review recommends the continuation of the project it will be necessary to secure a reliable source of funding for the IGP for the life of the project.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware the Heritage Council is currently in the process of examining the whole area of genealogical sources and records.  The council advised my Department its final report on the subject is expected to be completed this autumn.  To ensure the proposed review by my Department of the IGP project has as much relevant information to hand, I requested the Heritage Council to expedite its findings and it has agreed to do so.</P>
      <P>The formal review of the IGP will require about three months to carry out and I am not in a position to commit my Department at this juncture to the long-term future of the project other than assuring the Department and other Members the project will get fair consideration from the aspects of revenue generation and its ongoing costs.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious that genealogical services and genealogical data are being offered widely on the Internet to which many people around the world, particularly in the United States, have access.  I will ask that the review should consider the use of the Internet and its potential for the success of the IGP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister summarise her view of the objective of the Irish Genealogy Project? What does she want its end result to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the history of the IGP and I am sure I do not need to outline its job in hand.  We all know the value of genealogical research, not only its intrinsic value but its value for cultural tourism, not least in the Deputy's constituency but in mine and others throughout <Col N="1155" /> the country.  It is for that reason we want the project to be in a position to follow through on those principles.  I have reason to believe there is optimism for the future of the IGP, but I will wait to see the outcome of the review and based on its recommendations we will then know how to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given her view of what she wants the end result of the IGP to be.  She has had responsibility for it for almost 12 months.  I do not mean this in any way personal, but if the Minister was the chief executive officer of a PLC or co-operative trade union her resignation would be called for at this stage because of the unholy mess and uncertainty that surrounds the IGP.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act has been implemented and yet the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly has written a letter to the National Library which prevents people from having access to the primary source for genealogical records in respect of Tipperary.  Does the Minister consider that letter is valid?  Is the Freedom of Information Act to be applied to people who wish to have access to those primary sources and will she examine this matter?</P>
      <P>Will she lay a copy of the interim report she received from the chief executive officer of the IGL in the Dáil Library to enable Members have access to and make comments thereon?  The chief executive of Irish Genealogy Limited is due to retire from his position in August.  Is the Minister making arrangements for finances to be put in place for the continuation of his position after August?</P>
      <P>The experience gained by people in family records offices throughout the country has been exceptional, but the Comptroller and Auditor General's report referred to an error rate of 111 in 3,000 entries, 11 times the rate the quality control procedure allows.  Does the Minister regard the Irish Genealogy Project as being fundamentally flawed because it is not overseen by professional genealogists given that the level of error is as high as stated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy opposite is aware of the history of the IGP, that responsibility for it lay with the Taoiseach's Department and that only recently has specific responsibility for it been passed to my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the report, the Deputy will be aware that the Secretary General of my Department was examined by the Committee of Public Accounts last week specifically on the IGP and that what he told the committee was along the lines of what I stated in my initial reply.  I will see what I can do about forwarding further information on the report to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the chief executive's position and it will have to be taken into consideration in reviewing this project.  Funds will be needed if the <Col N="1156" /> review recommends the continuation of the IGP in the way it has been proposed.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the Deputy's point on error rate.  For his information, the chief executive of the IGL reports that every centre manager and IGL director, who represents the IFHF, has been made aware of the need to improve the level of accuracy in inputting data.  I understand that at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 30 April last a senior FÁS official reported that following a recent cross-check by her on accuracy she was happy to report a significant improvement in the current levels of accuracy in inputting.  I am sure we all recognise such accuracy is important and it is important that question is monitored.  From the information I have been given I am led to believe there has been a significant improvement in the error rate.  I understand there was a 3.7 per cent error rate and I am glad that position has been put right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to my question about the records in Tipperary or to my request that she lay a copy of the interim report in the Dáil Library.  Will she indicate how much has been expended to date on the project and what is the projected cost of finishing it?  Will she let me have a report on the participation rate in regard to the 32 counties, as this is an all-Ireland project?  I understand quite a number of centres and counties have not participated to the extent it is anticipated they should have by this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the report, in answering the Deputy's question I referred specifically to the fact that the Secretary General of my Department was examined by the Committee of Public Accounts and this information was obviously available to him.  I will see about getting further information that would be of interest to him.  I will also see if it is possible to lay such information before the House by placing it in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to costs.  According to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the value for money examination laid before the House in April last year, the amount of public funding spent on the project from 1988 to July 1996 was £15 million.  Of this sum, FÁS was responsible for £12.48 million, the Department of the Taoiseach for £0.25 million, Bord Fáilte for £0.68 million, SFADCo for £0.41 million and the International Fund for Ireland for £1.13 million.</P>
      <P>The chief executive has estimated that the project is likely to require a further £3.36 million in funding to bring it to completion by 2007.  This does not include the ongoing contribution to the project by FÁS, through its training scheme.</P>
      <P>I can give a breakdown of the £3.36 million if the Deputy requires it.  The technology update is £440,000.  The implementation of marketing strategy is £570,000 and the annual market and operational cost is £265,000 by nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of participation <Col N="1157" /> of the centres throughout the 32 counties. I do not have that information immediately to hand but I will see what I can do about accessing it and I will pass it on to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 572 on 21 April 1998 in which I indicated that the Government had decided on 7 April 1998 that Telecom Éireann's and RTEs shareholdings in the company should be disposed of by means of a trade sale as soon as possible.  This decision was taken following consideration of various options on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the Minister for Public Enterprise on the further development of Cablelink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between my question today and Question No. 572 of 21 April is that I have asked for the broadcasting reasons for the decision.  What specifically were the broadcasting reasons for the instruction to RTE to dispose of its 25 per cent shareholding in Cablelink?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of ownership of Cablelink, or any other cable television station, does not of itself raise any issues of broadcasting policy.  However, the Government decided to accept the proposal of the Minister for Public Enterprise on the 7 April when that Government decision was taken.  The nature of the decision that was taken was also made known to RTE at official level on the same day.  It was followed up in writing on 22 April when the chairman of the RTE Authority was given official notice of the Government's decision.</P>
      <P>This proposal was put to Government by the Minister for Public Enterprise and it was a Government decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for explaining to me how the decision was taken and the elaborate procedure for communicating the decision.  However, we are still left in the position that the national public service broadcaster &mdash; one of whose main assets was a 25 per cent holding in Cablelink &mdash; has made submissions in relation to, for example, digitalisation.  In order to achieve its proposals for digitalisation it has to manage its assets.  This is a significant asset in that the public service broadcaster owned it.</P>
      <P>Is it not seriously damaging to the proposals that RTE has made to the Minister and the Government in relation to digitalisation, to require it to dispose of its 25 per cent holding? Did the Cabinet have Cablelink valued before this decision was taken and was such a value communicated to the RTE Authority?</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Deputy that the 25 per cent shareholding in Cablelink is a significant asset.  However, I would not see its sale as damaging the potential of RTE or broadcasting policy.</P>
      <P>It might be of assistance for the Deputy to know that in his reply to the letter of 22 April, outlining the decision taken by Government on 7 April, the chairman of the RTE Authority stated that: &ldquo;The authority will be glad to co-operate in the sale process&rdquo;.  It is important to repeat that, as a shareholder, RTE will be involved in the process.</P>
      <P>With regard to any price that was mentioned, the Deputy will realise that it is not for me pre-empt the sale process.  I certainly have no intention of doing so at any stage, either now or at any future date.</P>

      <P>The promotion of Irish culture abroad is the function of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the cultural relations committee of his Department.  However, a crucial element of such promotion is a strong, vibrant Irish culture and the £26 million secured for the arts plan this year will ensure that we have the artists, both individuals and groups, in a position to establish a reputation overseas.  In addition, an allocation of 1.5 million ECUs in European Regional Development Fund funds has been secured to enable my Department to engage in overseas marketing of cultural and heritage attractions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister with responsibility for culture should be responsible for the promotion of culture internationally?  Is the Minister afraid of the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Why has she not presented a memo to Government suggesting that the cultural relations committee should be under the aegis of her Department which deals with culture?  She might also explain why culture was dropped from the Department's title and why it is not an aspect of the British-Irish Agreement now that we are promoting the two parts of this island in an all-Ireland context.</P>
      <P>The French music group have offices in many parts of the world promoting French music, which is less syllabled than Irish music.  What efforts is the Minister making to promote Irish commercial culture?  I am talking about Riverdance and the Broadway plays in particular.  The Dubliners are currently in Germany and every concert they play attracts an audience with Celtic roots.  Is the Minister's Department or the cultural relations committee making any effort to set up Irish stands at these concerts because those who attend them are attracted to Ireland and Irish music?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the multinationals are ripping off Irish artists and songwriters by not paying them for the use of their music?  The music heard by millions in the film &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo;, for example, is of no value to the economy or to the Irish artists who produced it.</P>

      <P>The cultural relations committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs has <Col N="1160" /> worked well for a number of years, so it is nothing new for it to be under the aegis of that Department. The Deputy made a spurious point in that regard.</P>
      <P>Cultural tourism is growing.  I have already said that 1.5 million ECUs in European Regional Development Fund funds has been put aside to specifically market cultural tourism.  It is important to note that we have a great opportunity to do so.  My Department is currently drawing up plans to ensure the proper use of that money in additional marketing of our national monuments, historic properties, national parks, inland waterways and major national cultural institutions.  We have wonderful natural and man-made attractions as far as our cultural and recreational interests are concerned.  It is a question of being able to combine that work with the responsibilities of the cultural relations committee under the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to hear the Deputy's claim that the arts are not part of the British Irish Agreement. Anyone who read the Agreement or knows anything about what was discussed recognises that there is tremendous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is used to blustering but if he listens to my answer, I will do my best to refer to the importance of this Agreement. Everyone has correctly highlighted the political significance of this Agreement.  However, it is also important to highlight its cultural potential. Culture, including the Irish language, plays a major part in the Agreement.  That was one area where the Nationalists in particular, although not exclusively so, were pleased to see enormous strides being made.</P>
      <P>There are many different facets of culture.  The Screen Commission gives us an opportunity to promote the Irish film industry nationally and internationally.  The <i>raison d'être</i> for the Screen Commission was that it would be a one-stop-shop and an information body for people who want Ireland as a film location.  We hope it will be successful in promoting the film industry.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's question about the Irish music industry.  Is he referring to copyright?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Copyright is not the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  That is a matter for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Two forthcoming Bills will deal with the issue of copyright, which is an intricate legal problem.  I am well aware of the difficulties faced by people in the Irish music industry in this regard.  I received many representations, particularly <Col N="1161" /> when in Opposition, from organisations such as IMRO.  If the Deputy wishes to promote that view, he does not need me to advise him to table questions to the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has once again abdicated responsibility for Irish artists.  I do not share the Minister's view about the cultural relations committee.  It should be under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>A major UN conference on culture was held in Sweden last March and April but no Minister attended it and no direction was given to the cultural relations committee to state Ireland's case there.  Perhaps the Minister could give me information on that.  Do we have an Internet site to promote Irish culture internationally?  If so, what is on it and when was it last updated?</P>
      <P>The Ireland office in New York, which houses Bord Fáilte, the Irish Trade Board and IDA Ireland is so big that these agencies have begun to look for sub-tenants.  Why has the Minister not considered sending a cultural attaché there to promote Irish culture in the United States where up to 40 million people claim Irish connections? I know from a reply I received yesterday that the Minister went to Los Angeles to ensure that film directors keep Ireland on their mental map.  Perhaps the Minister might explain that to me in terms of the promotion of the film industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, I replied to a question yesterday about a visit I made to Los Angeles.  As I was visiting the United States with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, I took the opportunity to visit many of the film studios and to speak to the top people there.  I was pleased there was a positive approach to Ireland.  They appreciated the fact that a Minister called to explain to them our wish to see them in Ireland and to promote the tax incentives and other proposals we want brought to fruition.  I stressed the fact that we wanted to encourage more people to come to Ireland, not only to reap the immediate rewards from such co-operation but to help build our indigenous industry through training and experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to keep Ireland to the fore with regard to the film industry.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware that there is increasing competition from many countries so far as incentives are concerned.  The industry is changing.  The point was made that it is based on trust and that those involved like to maintain constant personal contact with people directly involved in administration.  The point was also made that many film-makers, when they worked elsewhere in Europe, were concerned about the level of bureaucracy but that that is not the position here.  I was at pains to say, as has been proved in other examples, particularly Steven Spielberg's film &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo;, that if difficulties were encountered, the Department <Col N="1162" /> had experience of drawing a number of Departments together, such as the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, smoothing the way and making things easier for film-makers and encouraging others to come to make their films here.</P>
    <P>I said on that occasion that the Screen Commission was in place and that I intended, with the commission, to make a longer promotional tour of the United States to ensure the competition from others was at least matched, if not outstepped. The product we have to offer is far superior from that on offer elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the Cultural Relations Committee.  Did he encourage my predecessor to move the committee from the Department of Foreign Affairs to my Department and, if not, why?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi mar a chuir mé in iúl don Teach mar fhreagra ar Ceisteanna Uimhir 252 agus 254 ar 6 Bealtaine tá straitéis an Rialtais i dtaca le buanú agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, agus na céimeanna praiticiúla a nglacfar chuige sin, leagtha amach i gClár an Rialtais.  Léiríonn an Clár sin na céimeanna a ghlacfar a bheidh dírithe ar úsáid na Gaeilge a bhuanú sa Ghaeltacht agus a leathadh sa chuid eile den tír.  Aithníonn an Clár go mbeidh ról lárnach ag an tSeirbhís Phoiblí i gcoitinne, agus ag an gCóras Oideachais ach go háirithe, i bhfeidhmiú an pholasaí sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le mo Roinnse, tá sé mar bhunaidhm aici an Ghaeilge a bhuanú mar ghnáthurlabhra sa Ghaeltacht agus a húsáid a leathadh sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
      <P>Laistigh den Ghaeltacht leanfaidh mo Roinnse, agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, trí na scéimeanna cúnaimh agus gríosaithe dá gcuid, de bheith ag cuidiú le forbairt teanga agus cultúir, le forbairt tionscail, feabhsú infrastruchtúir agus le forbairt pobail ar mhaithe le buanú na Gaeilge inti.</P>
      <P>Lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht leanfaidh agus treiseoidh mo Roinnse agus Bord na Gaeilge a niarrachtaí chun úsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo a spreagadh ar fud na tíre trí scéimeanna agus tionscnaimh dá gcuid féin agus trí chúnamh a thabhairt d'eagrais eile atá ag gníomhú ar son na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tá tús curtha le hobair chun Bille Teanga don Ghaeilge a dhréachtadh a mbeidh mar chuspóir aige feabhas a chur ar an scéal maidir le soláthar seirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge do phobal na tíre.  I dtaca leis sin de dírim aird an Teachta ar an aitheasc uaim i dtaobh na ceiste sin os comhair an Chomhchoiste um Oidhreacht agus an Ghaeilge ar 10 Márta seo caite.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch den Aire as an bhfreagra sin ach bhí mé ag lorg eolas níos cruinne uaidh.  Ní raibh imní orm faoin bhfreagra a thug sé dom ar stádas na teanga ach bhí scéala sna nuachtáin le déanaí go raibh titim mhór i labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne.  Dúirt an <i>Irish Independent</i> go raibh an líon is mó faoin gcéad de dhaoine a labhrann Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht le fáil sa Rinn i bPort Láirge.  Cé go n-aontaínn an tAire leis an seanfhocal &ldquo;Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam&rdquo; níor luaigh sé an méid airgid atá leagtha síos don chlár oibre a leag sé síos nuair a bunaíodh an Rialtas seo.  Cé mhéid airgid a bheas le caitheamh air sa bhliain atá romhainn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Glacaim leis gurb í an cheist cé mhéid airgid a chaithfear ar an gclár oibre sin an bhliain seo chugainn ach mar is eol don Teachta níl na meastacháin socraithe agus mar sin níl mise in ann an cheist sin a fhreagairt.  Tá ceist eile ann inniu maidir le laige na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus rinneadh tagairt ann don daonáireamh a foilsíodh le déanaí.  Ní féidir liom teacht leis an méid a dúirt an <i>Irish Independent</i> mar ní féidir comparáid a dhéanamh idir na staitisticí atá ar <Col N="1164" /> fáil againn anois agus na staitisticí a bhí ar fáil cheana mar cheana níor tugadh aon bhriseadh síos idir an milliún daoine a raibh Gaeilge acu sa tír agus iadsan nach raibh.  Don chéad uair sa daonáireamh seo tá briseadh síos tugtha ar mhinicíocht na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>É sin ráite, agus is fiú staidéar níos géire a dhéanamh ar na figiúirí sin agus déanfaidh mé ceann, tá cúiseanna imní sa Ghaeltacht.  An imní is mó ann ná conas is féidir an t-aos óg a spreagadh leis an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Is féidir liom a dhearbhú don Teachta thall go bhfuilim tar éis an cheist sin a phlé le gairid le bord an Údaráis.  Tá moltaí áirithe réitithe acu siúd maidir leis an gceist seo agus beimid ag leanacht ar aghaidh ag déanamh scrúduithe ag súil le teacht aníos le plean comhaontaithe ar féidir é a fheidhmiú chun aos óg na Gaeltachta a spreagadh i dtreo na Gaeilge. Caithfimid a thuiscint go bhfuil an saol ag athrú agus gur mó an tionchar ag an saol taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ar an aos óg.</P>
      <P>Caithfimid breathnú freisin ar na fadhbanna sa chóras oideachais agus tá an t-ábhar seo clúdaithe i gClár an Rialtais.  Dá mbeadh cóip den Chlár sin ag an Teachta d'fheicfeadh sé go bhfuil tagairtí sonracha ann don mhéid seo.  Mar iomlánú ar sin, bhí polasaí an-chuimsitheach foilsithe ag mo pháirtí roimh an toghcháin agus táimid á úsáid mar bhunshraith ar a bhfuilimid ag obair.</P>
      <P>Caithfear díriú ar an oideachas, mar shampla, mar a thuigeann Teachta ar bith atá ag plé leis an nGaeltacht, tá fadhb sa Ghaeltacht i dtaca le daoine gan Ghaeilge ag teacht abhaile agus ag cur futhu sa Ghaeltacht.  Táimid ag réiteach pleananna faoina choinne sin.  Is féidir a bheith cinnte go bhfuil pleananna cuimsitheacha dá réiteach maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Ní hin go díreach an cheist a cuireadh: bhí sé i bhfad níos leithne.  Is dóigh liom go dtagann figiúr amháin áirithe as an daonáireamh, sé sin, go ndúirt 350,000 duine go n-úsáideann siad an Ghaeilge chuile lá.  Má bhaintear as sin na daoine óga a úsáideann Gaeilge ar scoil, fós féin, faightear riar maith daoine ar fud na tíre a deireann go n-úsáideann siad an Ghaeilge chuile lá.  Sin figiúr nach raibh againn cheana agus cruthaíonn sé gur éirigh leis na polasaithe a bhí againn go dtí seo go dtí pointe áirithe.  Is éard a chaithfimid a dhéanamh ná treisiú ar na polasaithe sin agus is féidir a bheith dearfa gur treisiú agus láidriú a bheas i gceist.</P>

    <P>An bhfuil aon imní ar an Aire Stáit i dtaobh an t-eolas a bhí san <i>Irish Independent</i> i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí?  Bhí fonn air cothromaíocht a thabhairt do na limistéir Ghaeltachta go léir nuair a bhí sé ag roinnt airgead na mbóithre áise.  Tá difear idir na figiúirí do chontae <Col N="1165" /> na Gaillimhe agus do chathair na Gaillimhe de 56 faoin gcéad.  Ar bhain sé úsáid as na figiúirí sin agus an t-airgead do na bóithre áise á roinnt aige?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil difear an-mhór idir an chathair agus an tuath agus is féidir a bheith dearfa nár dearnadh aon bhóthar áise taobh istigh den chathair.  É sin ráite, mar is eol d'éinne a léann na páipéir agus a éistíonn le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus le Teilifís na Gaeilge, táim ag déanamh scrúdú ar cheist seo na Gaeilge taobh istigh de limistéar na Gaeltachta agus taobh istigh de chathair na Gaillimhe.  Tuigeann gach duine cá as a éiríonn an scéal sin agus táim ag gníomhú air agus is féidir liom a rá go bhfuilim tar éis casadh le Bord an Údaráis agus dréachtphlean a chur os a gcomhair faoi bhealach amháin a fhéadfaimis déileáil leis an bhfadhb áirithe fíorshonrach sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gceist eile a ardaíodh faoi na múinteoirí, níl a fhios agam cén fáth inniu thar aon lá a bhfuiltear ag cur ceisteanna orm féin agus ar an Aire de Valera a bhaineann leis an hAireachtaí eile.  Ní mise an tAire Oideachais ach tá fáilte roimh aon mhúinteoir as na Sé Chontae teacht go dtí an taobh seo tíre agus dul ag múineadh i mbunscoil.  Tuigeann gach duine é sin: bhí sé sin oscailte iriamh.  Ach an cheist a chaithfear a phlé agus an dualgas atá ormsa ná cén chaoi go ginearálta &mdash; agus táim i gcomhairle le mo chomhleacaí an tAire Oideachais faoi seo &mdash; is féidir úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh sa tír.  Tá roinnt rudaí curtha chun cinn agam, táim ag plé leis na heagraíochtaí deonacha, táim tar éis a fhógairt go bhfuil Bille Teanga á thabhairt isteach agus athruithe a chur ar Achtanna an Údaráis, tá scéimeanna nua á mbeartú chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht, táimid ag díriú i gcomhairle leis an Údarás agus le Bord na Gaeilge ar cheist na naíscolaíochta agus freisin ar cheist sheirbhísí don óige a bhfuil an oiread sin tábhacht leo sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Táim tar éis dul chuig na Gaeltachtaí laga ar fad sa tír agus scéala a thabhairt dóibh go bhfuil siad mar chuid den Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil fáilte rompu ann agus go bhfaighigh siad buntáistí as a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ó thaobh cúrsaí teangan agus eile de i seirbhísí ó mo Roinn.  Ach is comhpháirtíocht atá i gceist agus go mbeidh ag súil leis mar chuid den mhargadh sin go gcuirfidh siad an Ghaeilge chun cinn taobh istigh de na ceantair sin.</P>
      <P>Murar leor é sin mar chlár oibre don mhéid ama a bhí agam go dtí seo le bheith ag dul ar aghaidh leis, ní féidir a thuilleadh a dhéanamh. Níor tugadh faoin oiread sin a dhéanamh in achar chomh gearr cheana faoi cheist na Gaeilge go dtí seo agus atá mise tar éis tabhairt faoi i naoi mí.</P>

Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá coiste idir-rannach bunaithe anois a bhfuil ní amháin cúram na n-oileán air ach cúram na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta freisin. Ceann dá feidhmeanna ná na fadhbanna idir-rannacha seo a phlé.  Tá fadhbanna móra ann maidir le cúrsaí oideachais agus téacsleabhair is ea ceann acu.  Caithfear díriú orthu i gcoiste idir-rannach.

      <P>Thabharfainn an-suntas do ghné eile den obair seo: táimid ag caint ar an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn sa tír agus mar a dúirt an tAire ar ball beag tá gné fíorláidir Gaeilge ag baint leis an gcomhaontú a síníodh ar Aoine an Chéasta.  Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann an clár oibre seo a bhrú ar aghaidh ar bhonn uile Éireannach, rud a threiseodh go mór leis mar bheadh Gaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt agus an Deiscirt ag obair as lámh a chéile agus bheadh súil agam go dtiocfaimid ar fhuascailt na fadhbe nó cuid de i gcomhpháirtíocht lenár gcomhleacaithe ó Thuaidh.  Tá cruinnithe rialta tar éis a bheith agam leis na heagraisí Gaeilge ó thuaidh.  Leanfar leis sin, cuirfear leis an gcomhoibriú agus trí chur le chéile acmhainní Gaeilge na tíre ar fad, tiocfaidh linn toradh níos fearr a bhaint amach as caiteachas airgid.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, níl bliain baileach caite fós agus má bhreathnaítear ar an gclár oibre a luaigh mé ar ball beag feicfear nach méar fhada atá i gceist ar chor ar bith ach gníomh an t-am ar fad.  Maidir le ceist an Teachta Uí Uiginn, táim ag súil le hacmhainní ní ón Údarás ach ó mo Roinn-se a chur ag plé le cuid de na fadhbanna seo agus táim ag obair ar leasuithe ar chuid de na scéimeanna atá ann i láthair na huaire.  Maidir leis an gceist a ardaíodh faoin Údarás táim ag plé leo agus déanfaidh mé cás anláidir le go gcuirfear na hacmhainní is gá ar fáil don bhliain 1999 le déanamh cinnte go gcuirfear stop leis an meath atá ag teacht ar an nGaeilge sa nGaeltacht.  Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go mbeidh an iarracht sin ar bun agus go bhfuilim dóchasach go n-éireoidh linn clár oibre fiúntach a chur i bhfeidhm go luath.</P>

    <P>Is dóigh go bhfuil éadóchas ann faoin nGaeilge le céad bliain anuas agus God knows cé mhéad tórramh a bhí ann di.  Cuireadh í an méid sin amanna ach tá sí beo i gcónaí.  Cuimhnímís go <Col N="1167" /> ndeireann 350,000 duine go n-úsáideann siad Gaeilge chuile lá.  Fiú má dhéantar coigeartú beag ar na figiúirí sin is dóigh gur i bhfad ón mbás atá an Ghaeilge.  Ní mór dúinn oibriú ní ar an mbonn go bhfuil sí ag fáil bháis ach ag tógáil ar an mbunsraith atá ann.  Tá sé cinnte go bhfuil sí ag teacht aníos sa Ghalltacht ach go bhfuil sí ag dul i laige sa nGaeltacht ar chúiseanna cumarsáide agus eile.  Caithfimid féachaint leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Thug an tAire figiúirí dúinn cúpla nóiméad ó shin.  An bhfuil aon scrúdú déanta le déanaí a dhéanann comparáid idir líon na ndaoine atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus líon na ndaoine atá ag labhairt Gaeilge sa chuid eile den tír?  Tá fás mór ag teacht ar labhairt na Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht: tá Glór na nGael ag cur na Gaeilge chun cinn sna bailte agus na gaelscoileanna ag cuidiú go mór lena fás.  Má tá an Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis go mall sa nGaeltacht tá fás mór ag tarlú sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil fás mór ag teacht ar labhairt na Gaeilge i gCeatharlach agus an bhfuil sé sin ar eolas ag an Aire?  An bhfuil gach baile eile faoin tír ag dul ar aghaidh chomh tapa nó an eisceacht atá ann?</P>

É sin ráite, is dóigh liom go bhfeicfear é mar eiseamlár den dátheangachas agus cearta saoránach agus d'fhéadfadh sé a bheith úsáideach ó thuaidh de réir mar a théann an próiseas ar aghaidh.  Maidir leis an gComhaontú agus an Tuaisceart is í seo an chéad uair ní amháin go bhfuil aitheantas speisialta á thabhairt don Ghaeilge ó thuaidh i gcomhaontú idirnáisiúnta ach tá creatlach de chlár oibre ansin ar féidir tógáil air agus a dhéanfaidh an-leas go háirithe ó thaobh na n-Aondachtóirí de mar bainfidh sé cuid den pholaitíocht sheicteach den Ghaeilge mar feicfear í mar rud a bhaineann leis an Stát agus go mbaineann an Stát leis an dá thaobh den phobal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le ceist an Teachta de Brún, tar éis dom a bheith ceaptha im' Aire Stáit chuir mé fios ar na mionstaitisticí a bhain leis an nGaeilge go mór mór i gcomhthéacs daonáirimh 1996 áit a cuireadh mioncheisteanna den chéad uair maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge seachas eolas ar an nGaeilge. Ní raibh siad sin le fáil ag an am agus foilsíodh <Col N="1168" /> na figiúirí maidir leis an nGaeilge den chéad uair tá coicís ó shin.</P>
    <P>Ar an bpointe chuir mé fios ar na staitisticí a bhaineann leis na ceantair toghcháin (na DED) chun staidéar grinn a dhéanamh orthu féachaint cad é fíorstaid na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí agus sna Galltachtaí.  Má thógaimid ceantar na Gaillimhe, rud atá ag cur as do na figiúirí san iomlán ná an fás ar bhruachbhailte na Gaillimhe.  Má thógtar Bearna, tá bunphobal ann ach tá an pobal nua i bhfad níos mó agus tá sé ag cur as do staitisticí. Ach má fhaighimse na mionfigiúirí beidh mé in ann iad a scagadh ó chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá spéis agam breathnú ar na figiúirí don tír ina iomlán go mór mór i dtaobh gasúir de thrí nó ceithre bliana nó daoine atá tar éis an córas oideachais a fhágáil, féachaint cá bhfuil na daoine a deireann go n-úsáideann siad an Ghaeilge chuile lá.  Cé mhéad acu atá i gCeatharlach, cé mhéad acu atá i gCnoc Mhuirfean, i dTamhlacht agus mar sin de.  Bheinn ag féachaint le pleananna a chur i bhfeidhm le déanamh cinnte go mbeidh breis deiseanna ag na daoine sin.  Is féidir a bheith cinnte a luaithe agus a fhaighim na figiúirí sin go mbeidh mo Roinnse ag déanamh mionstaidéar orthu.</P>
    <P>Luadh an Rinn ar ball beag, ceann de na Gaeltachtaí is lú sa tír murab í an ceann is lú.  Ag breathnú siar go dtí tús an chéid ní thabharfaí seans go mairfeadh Gaeltacht chomh beag sin in oileán an Bhéarla.  Ceann de na figiúirí is spéisiúla dá bhfuil feicthe agam ná gurb ann atá an céatadán is airde de ghasúir de thrí agus ceithre bliana atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge chuile lá.  Taispeánann sé sin go bhfuil todhchaí ag na Gaeltachtaí, fiú na Gaeltachtaí beaga, ach toil an phobail a bheith ann chuige.  Beidh mise ag cur go mór leis na pobail le féachaint go mbeidh an toil sin ann.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 32 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital funding provided by my Department in support of the arts is mainly through the cultural development incentives scheme &mdash; CDIS &mdash; which is part of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9.  The CDIS is primarily <Col N="1169" /> designed to assist the four main categories of the visual and performing arts &mdash; arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums.  The Deputy will appreciate that all decisions taken in relation to the funding of projects under this scheme were taken by my predecessor.  Of the total amount of capital funding allocated to the arts approximately 19.5 per cent of capital funding was allocated to Dublin, 22.5 per cent to other major cities and the balance, 58 per cent, to other areas.  I am very much looking forward to the successful completion of all the projects which have been allocated funding.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I am standing in for Deputy Jim O'Keeffe who put down those questions and is unavoidably absent in defence of his country.  Did the Minister give capital figures?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: How much money is allocated towards the running costs of other arts centres, one of which is west Cork arts centre in Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency?  There are more artists living in west Cork than elsewhere. Will the Minister give a breakdown of the 58 per cent of funding allocated to other parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The CDIS funding refers specifically to capital funding.  My Department does not provide funding for the running cost of those centres.  The funding provided gives an opportunity to set up arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums.  I hope this is a reflection of the arts plan in that it ensures the infrastructure is available.  As Deputy O'Keeffe's question rightly points out, it is important to ensure such centres are available throughout the country and not just in the more populated areas.  I share that view, as did my predecessor.</P>
      <P>There are 39 projects under the CDIS funding. In addition, an allocation of £1.8 million has been approved for the development of additional gallery space at the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery in Cork.  That figure is included in the proportion for cities other than Dublin.  The following allocation of Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism has been made in respect of a number of national cultural institutions: the National Museum, Collins Barracks, £29,850,000; the National Gallery, extension to premises, £7.5 million; Irish Museum of Modern Art, additional exhibition space, £1.5 million; the National Concert Hall, provision of a second auditorium, £1.6 million; and the Chester Beatty Library, relocation of collection, £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can provide the Deputy with information in respect of the 39 projects.  However, it might <Col N="1170" /> shortcircuit matters if he required me to communicate the information in writing.  I have it to hand if the Deputy desires to see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might circulate that information to Members on this side of the House.  In his former capacity as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins lit a beacon in this area for young people.  He did an enormous job in a short period to promote an appreciation of the nature of art in its broadest sense.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to the mid-term review of the operational programme.  What is the position in respect of this review?  Is it true that the Minister promised to allocate funding for the International Folk Centre, Ennis?  The excellent scheme operated by the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, under the capital programme was transparent. It established a new structure for arts facilities throughout the country in terms of exhibitions, participation, innovation and imagination. However, in the old scheme which applied to community centres, where assistance was given under the auspices of the Department of Education, committees broke their backs to put facilities in place.  There was no follow-on mechanism to ensure that they remained alive.  Is there a programme to oversee the operation of these centres and how will they be funded in future?</P>
      <P>Following the mid-term review, funding from Europe is now in place.  One example of a facility which has benefited in this regard is the Linen Hall Arts Centre in Castlebar where Mary Farrell and her staff have done a tremendous job.  What plans does the Minister have to enable these centres to operate properly in future so that young people can gain an appreciation of art in its broadest form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The CDIS funds will be exhausted in 1999 but Members can rest assured that my Department will fight to ensure that further funding will be forthcoming in the year 2000.  I hope that such funding will be secured because it has proved of tremendous assistance to arts infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As a result of the mid-term review of the CDIS funds, it was important to ensure that those projects on the list complied with the various conditions &mdash; one of which was that they would be able to complete the work before the end of the current operational programme in 1999.  It was never intended that these funds would be allocated in respect of the operational costs of the centres.  As already stated, the intention behind the funding was the establishment of an infrastructure. It was the responsibility of the community, individuals or committee involved with the centres to ensure that this would remain an ongoing concern and it was taken into account when deciding whether projects would be included on the initial list for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition Deputies tabled a number of questions regarding individual centres and projects <Col N="1171" /> which might have been included on the initial list but which were not given funding because they could not comply with the conditions.  One of those conditions stipulates that projects should be supported by, for example, a county council to ensure its viability.  If such support was not forthcoming and the centre failed, the money spent from the CDIS on that project would revert to the EU at the expense of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The conditions were twofold: first, to ensure fairness for all, namely, when the conditions were complied with the money would be forthcoming; and, second, to ensure that if this was not so the money would be made available for projects which could be completed in 1999.  With regard to the operational costs of the centres and their future, it is the responsibility of those advocating and supporting the projects to ensure they are sustainable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to a project in my constituency, the proposed folk music centre in Ennis, which is dear to my heart and which, unfortunately, did not receive the support of the previous Government for inclusion on the list for CDIS funding.  This project was on the books for a long period before the break-up of the previous Administration, when there was no movement in respect of funding for it.  On assuming office I stated I would revisit the file because the project is of particular interest to me.  I have been working assiduously with members of the county council, the urban district council and the local committee run by Joe Malone.</P>

      <P>As my original question dealt with the Operational Programme for Tourism, will the Minister indicate whether &mdash; in the period from 1999 onward, during the next period of structural funding &mdash; her Department will be seeking a separate operational programme?  I am grateful for the figures provided in respect of the distribution of CDIS funding which I primarily allocated, namely, 19.5 per cent for Dublin, 22.5 per cent for other cities and 58 per cent for the remainder of the country.  That contrasts with what has been often stated.  Will the Minister agree that those figures could be easily distorted by adding the capital expenditure on the major cultural institutions.  I am glad she did not do that and that she separated them.  I differ with the Minister on the third point.  Will she agree that what she calls political verve would in fact be political interference with the selection process that was independent of the Minister?</P>

      <P>I deliberately separated our national institutions from the 39 projects which were seen as separate.  I wish to be fair to the Deputy and I think he acknowledges I was fair in giving those statistics.  We all know that statistics can give a different complexion and I wish to give an accurate description of the case.</P>
      <P>With reference to the operational programme, the Deputy is correct that the CDIS funding will run out in 1999.  I intend to fight for funding and I will not be too worried, nor I am sure will the Deputy, about the mechanism that is put in place as long as it is one we can use in a similar way to the CDIS funding.  The CDIS funding was particularly helpful, coming under the Operational Programme for Tourism.  We are talking about issues of cultural tourism.  That is our strength, as I mentioned in an earlier question today.  The fact that the European institutions, and indeed the European Regional Development Fund funding, has put 1.5 million ecu aside to promote and market our centres, which have a strong cultural element, augurs well for funding from the year 2000 onwards.</P>
      <P>With regard to the CDIS funding and the case raised by Deputy Kenny, there is a selection process. However, a number of projects have been submitted and it is for the selection process to decide on those matters.  I would be interested to know whether that project featured even in phase one.  If the CDIS funding was not available for the folk music centre, the previous Minister, and indeed the previous Minister of State, had the opportunity of using other Exchequer funding to ensure the project would come to fruition.  There was no commitment in the CDIS funding nor in Exchequer funding for such a project.</P>

      <P>The point about a separate operational programme is that the mid-term review was conducted under criteria specific to tourism.  The advantage of having our own operational programme is that it would be entirely in terms of the criteria for arts and culture promotion. Does the Minister not see significant <Col N="1174" /> merit in allowing the existing projects that were submitted but not successful to run on, with adaptation, to save time and trouble and to facilitate drawing down money?  Perhaps the Minister could tell me which heading in her Department she sees as directly funding capital programmes outside the major cultural institutions.</P>

      <P>With regard to the type of funding that will be available in 1999, I understand the distinction the Deputy is making, particularly in respect of arts promotion.  I am interested in finding a heading that will be most appropriate to draw down funding, and I am working towards that.  It is important that there would be such funding because every Deputy in this House, regardless of his or her political opinion, knows there are a number of such centres and excellent projects throughout the country.  Some of those have not made it to this list and the people involved were disappointed they were not selected, but that selection took place before I took office.  I do not see any reason these projects cannot be resubmitted under any new proposal for consideration, and I hope they will be.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: A total of 58 per cent of capital funding is currently spent in rural areas.  That is understandable because Dublin has been catered for over the years.

As I explained in reply to an earlier supplementary question, the CDIS funding referred particularly to capital expenditure and it was to set up that infrastructure. I share the Deputy's concern that when we are talking about cultural facilities we must also talk about facilities for everyone and the importance of access and participation in the arts.  That cannot be done unless the infrastructure exists for people to take part in those cultural activities.</P>

      <P>As Minister with statutory responsibility for wildlife, including all wild birds, <Col N="1175" /> I am aware of some concerns regarding our native songbird population.  Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, is currently in discussion with Birdwatch Ireland in relation to the format of a countryside bird survey which will include our native songbirds.  This survey will provide valuable data on population and trends in population of all our common songbirds.  Until the results of this survey become available, I am not in a position to comment on whether there is a decline in the number of native songbirds.</P>

      <P>With regard to the bird population to which the Deputy opposite referred, I do not have such information to hand.  This question relates to our native songbirds with particular reference to the wren, sparrow, song thrush, blackbird, robin, finches, jackdaws and starlings.  This is what the survey will cover.  Until we see the results of the survey we cannot decide whether there is a problem and, if so, how best to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that there have been changes in agricultural practices which necessarily affect the habitats available to the birds, but some birds have benefited from this.  I am told that grassland pasture provides rich food sources of beetle larvae, earthworms and many other invertebrates which are attractive food for rooks, starlings and jackdaws.  The trends in such populations are a barometer where our environment is concerned. I share the concern of all the Deputies here.  That is why Dúchas is taking a very active role with Birdwatch Ireland.  I will be looking out for the results of that survey.  Perhaps we will have an opportunity to discuss it at a later date.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: What does it mean that judicial notice will be taken of the report? What effect will this have in the courts?  What level of obligation does it put on High Court judges in considering these cases?  Is it the case that they will bear it in mind and take a different approach or that they may take the evidence of <Col N="1177" /> hearing experts rather than be bound by the levels proposed by the Minister?

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we discussed the concept of judicial notice and what that would mean. Will the Minister agree there is an unpredictability about this, given the separation of powers and that we do not know, even if judicial notice is taken, how it will be interpreted and how it may relate to levels of disability and compensation? We may or may not see a reduction in compensation awards and, therefore, in the State's bills.  If, for example, judges apply it with reference to a scale which the State may still consider too generous, little or nothing will have changed.  The impact of the Bill, assuming it is found to be constitutional, will be unreliable even if applied as it may or may not reduce costs depending on the approach of the courts to the expert group report and compensation.  The Minister has already outlined some of the decisions he felt involved very high awards in cases of very low levels or no handicap.  We do not know how judges will take this report into consideration &mdash; if they decide to take it into account &mdash; when deciding levels of damages, or the comparative levels of compensation.  Similarly, we do not know what judgment we, as a Legislature, will make on the potential long-term costs.  Is this correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  While this Bill should have a wider remit than Army deafness, the fact that it is being introduced by the Minister for Defence seems to focus it specifically on Army deafness.  This may give rise to problems. The legislation can only be one facet in addressing a multi-faceted problem.  I am Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts but am speaking in a personal capacity.  The House is aware that the Committee of Public Accounts has spent much time considering this very vexed question.  It is too much to rely solely on this Bill to reduce or resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and Fitzgerald raised whether the Bill being taken into account by the courts will have any real impact.  We must wait to see how the courts interpret or apply the Bill. While the Committee of Public Accounts called for legislation to deal with the issue it was felt that to introduce into legislation a hearing loss and disability standard would not be sufficient on its own and that it would be necessary to accompany it with a table of damages for different levels of disability.  This is not included in the Bill.  Was this issue considered and, if so, why is it not provided for in the Bill?  It seems that herein <Col N="1178" /> lies the difficulty.  The courts may decide in the light of evidence that a person has X per cent of difficulty and give X multiplied by ten in damages. In this context the State's potential exposure to massive liability may not be diminished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the questions raised by Deputy Higgins, section 3 is the fundamental provision of the Bill.  It states that &ldquo;Judicial notice shall be taken of the Report in all proceedings before a court claiming damages for personal injury arising from a hearing injury&rdquo;.  This means the entire contents of the report &mdash; its discussion of the nature of hearing loss, its recommendations in respect of hearing disability assessment and treatment of tinnitus &mdash; acquire the status of proved evidence in court.  There is a requirement for judges, therefore, to have regard to it as evidence. However, it does not mean the court is obliged to take any specific inference from this evidence: it is purely of an advisory or persuasive nature. Obviously, given its distinguished authorship, it would be regarded as having a considerable degree of weight, particularly in the context of the current spate of hearing loss cases before the courts.</P>
      <P>There is no way I can prejudge how the courts will react to the legislation.  They must have regard to its contents and judicial notice.  The courts addressed the House in the sense of indicating that it was a matter for the Legislature to introduce legislation, if required, to change the circumstance surrounding the claims and not the courts.  Therefore, in the first instance we are addressing what has been said by the courts. Second, the absence of an Irish standard and the non-recognition by the courts of other international standards required us to produce the Green Book, something which was done independently and comprehensively.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Mitchell, this is not the beginning.  Last autumn a decision was taken to assemble a group of consultants to prepare the Green Book.  It was given to me in the first or second week of April.  It took about five years to produce the Black Book in the UK. Therefore, considerable work had to be done by the experts.  In addition, the Government passed proposals for legislation in relation to banning and restricting advertising by solicitors.  In this context the Bill is the third phase in dealing with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, annexing to the Bill a compensation chart indicating the amount to be paid for each percentage of handicap could not be easily done.  The advice from all sides was that it would be fraught with very significant constitutional difficulty.  Already questions about the constitutionality of the Bill have been raised.  We have been able to dispose of these arguments on the basis that it will be up to the courts to make their own decisions on the weight to give the legislation.  They are not being required by law to <Col N="1179" /> adhere to it but to take judicial notice of it and have regard to the formulas it contains.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Minister for Defence introducing the legislation was raised.  There is collective responsibility within the Government.  Matters which are complex and difficult for a Minister, the Government or the people must be resolved by the Government and this is what we are doing. The Bill has been agreed by the Government and backed by advice from the Attorney General: there are no other circumstances in which it could have been introduced.</P>
    <P>I cannot predict what will happen.  There has been significant support for this legislation in the House.  The distilled wisdom is that it is the most appropriate step to take at this stage.  There has been no other concrete suggestion which is capable of early implementation.  It is important that the question be addressed as quickly as possible and that we proceed to deal with the cases.  Earlier Deputy O'Kennedy indicated that there was a sea change &mdash; perhaps this description is too all-embracing &mdash; in the courts and the legal profession in relation to their perception of the change which is coming.  The courts have given us an opportunity to reflect on this matter.  The public, the Defence Forces and the people at the top in the military service have been given an opportunity to address the matter in a comprehensive manner at the Committee of Public Accounts and other fora.  These developments should result in a significant change in court awards and settlements to plaintiffs with insignificant disabilities or handicaps while those with serious injuries will continue to receive substantial awards.  Beyond that, I do not have a crystal ball.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the effect of the Bill on the level of compensation awards and the scale of liability to the State is unpredictable, the only answer is to introduce a scale of compensation or a pensions scheme.  Will the Minister elaborate on his advice from the Attorney General on the constitutional difficulties with such a proposal? Would a constitutional amendment be necessary to introduce a pensions Act with certain scales for the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A scale of compensation awards already exists in the social welfare system, but the number of applicants, even from noisy industry, has been very small and the award levels are manageable.  Why, therefore, would a scale of awards be unconstitutional in the case of this legislation?  The effect of the Bill will be weakened if such a measure is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered introducing other legislation in this area?  For example, is legislation to amend the Army Pensions Act being considered? Has consideration been given to widening the remit of the Army Pensions Board to deal directly with future compensation claims derived from military service?  Given the current experience with Army deafness cases, tummy upsets <Col N="1180" /> and so on, surely it would make sense for the Army Pensions Board to deal with future compensation claims.  We cannot continue to leave ourselves open to huge claims.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Defence on the courageous and energetic way he addressed this problem, but this is only part of a wider compensation culture.  The report of the Committee of Public Accounts states that the Government announced 15 months ago that it would set up a State claims agency.  Two years prior to that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs recommended setting up such an agency. Where is the legislation for that agency?  The compensation culture is affecting all local authorities, semi-State bodies and pubs and shops in the private sector.  Why is it so difficult to include in this Bill a scale of compensation, as recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts, when it is already included in social welfare legislation? Has consideration been given to extending the remit of the Army Pensions Board to deal with future compensation claims for disability and abolishing the one year limit, on leaving the Army, in which claims can be lodged? When will a State claims agency be established?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the more recent contributions that an important matter is being excluded from the debate, the constitutional right of every individual in the State to seek redress in the courts.  An alternative system would be tenable only where the level of response from the courts corresponds with that provided by a compensation board or a pensions system. The level of compensation for minor disabilities is such that an alternative system would not be acceptable to the individuals concerned because they would realise they could get a considerably larger sum through the courts.  We want the courts and all concerned to realise we cannot afford these compensation awards, particularly when there are people with other types of handicap who deserve our help but we are unable to assist them.  We want to gradually introduce an alternative way of dealing with such matters.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a large number of comparatively young individuals.  Therefore, when aggregated over a long period, the amount of pensions would be very substantial.  It is not a question of taking the easy road of paying pensions to rid us of the problem.  They would have to be funded over a considerable time.  It is more realistic to deal with the matter on the basis of direct compensation, assuming it is at a level we can afford and fair and equitable to each circumstance.</P>
      <P>The strong legal advice available to me is that it would be unconstitutional to stipulate a mandatory scale to the courts.  Since that is so, I do not have the option of combining this legislation with the added dimension of a charter or scale for compensation in respect of different percentages of disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have to await the courts' response on <Col N="1181" /> this matter.  If the quantum does not fall to the kind of levels which logic dictates, I will then have to give consideration to more radical measures and perhaps face down the constitutional difficulties which may lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to reach a consensus on this matter and do my utmost to deal with this complex question.  Bearing in mind the separation of powers, the courts will have the discretion to make their own fair and equitable decisions in due course.  In the absence of that, I will give serious consideration to other proposals which I already have in mind but am unable to divulge at this early stage.</P>
    <P>A State claims agency will only address legal transaction costs.  The Bill is designed to address the quantum in courts by showing that low handicap deserves low damages.  We cannot deny a person's constitutional rights and as long as awards remain at high levels, people will not wish to avail of any other option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said that the legal system was never designed to deal with thousands of cases in a mass action such as this.  This situation highlights the need to have an alternative structure in place to deal with such claims.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is optimistic in regard to the Bill's effects.  I, too, am an optimist but there is a certain unpredictability about this issue; we do not know how the courts will respond or how the scale of compensation will develop.  It may well be necessary to consider other options.  Will the Minister return to the House if the Bill is found to be constitutional and give us some feedback on its effects?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: This is a Bill for all citizens and workers, not merely Army personnel. It is important that we are just and fair in our approach to working people.  This Bill, if passed, will ask the courts to disregard the first 20 decibels of hearing damage for compensation purposes. Does the Minister agree that workers presenting themselves for new employment, when given a hearing test, should also have the first 20 decibels of hearing damage disregarded if such damage is ascertained?  Otherwise, the worker will be doubly disadvantaged if 20 decibels of hearing damage is taken into account for employment purposes and is also disregarded in the courts.  I see a clear contradiction here which should be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to soldiers who continue to serve in the Defence Forces, will the Minister categorically confirm that if damage of the level he wishes to be disregarded is ascertained in a serving solider, it will not be taken into account when the <Col N="1182" /> soldier's prospects for overseas duty or promotion are being considered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very significant publicity in regard to a case which has already gone before the courts.  The person in question was well compensated and subsequently promoted. As far as overseas duty is concerned, the obligation on the military authorities will always be to select the most capable people from a pool of volunteers.  I am not aware of any restriction which prevents people with normal levels of hearing loss from participating in this.  With regard to other employers, I think everyone agrees that the Green Book sets a very low threshold.</P>
      <P>I thank all Deputies and party Whips for the arrangements made yesterday and today to facilitate the passage of this legislation.  I thank the officials in my own Department who have worked diligently to ensure that the legislation would be ready in time and withstand the best wisdom available in this House.  It is important that people know that the Government's commitment to this problem, in staffing terms alone, is evidenced by the fact that in excess of 100 people are dealing exclusively with this matter between my Department, the military authorities and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  I wish to extend special thanks to the Office of the Attorney General and its staff which had to facilitate us in terms of timing by overstepping other matters to ensure we were in a position to pass this legislation by next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Green Book is set to become the Irish standard on hearing disability and related matters. In a few days, it will be underpinned by legislation. The legislation is due in the Seanad tomorrow and will, I hope, be signed by the President early next week.  It is the biggest lawsuit the country has ever faced and the biggest lawsuit in proportional terms that, perhaps, any country has ever faced.  We are trying, as honestly and as fairly as we can, to approach this matter in an open, transparent and accountable way.  The contributions by all sides, notwithstanding the early tussles this afternoon, are genuinely aimed at helping to secure the best possible solution to a very complex and difficult problem.</P>
      <P>If we have succeeded today in taking the right steps, which I hope we have, and moved the issue to a plane of equity and fairness, that is something of which we can be proud.  In the event that we have to return again I look forward to hearing from Members and receiving their co-operation in taking whatever steps are necessary to put it right.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the second occasion in 12 months that a Bill on local government funding has come before the House.  During the debate on the previous Government's Bill last year, there was broad agreement across all parties about the problems facing local government.  There was also a high degree of consensus that the lack of resources was a major factor holding back the local government system from developing and realising its full potential.  When it came to discussing how to address the situation, there was no such consensus.</P>
      <P>The funding system which the previous Government's Bill put in place failed to address the fundamental problem of under-resourcing. That problem has worsened over time as new and expanded functions have been conferred on local authorities without the necessary supporting resources being put in place.</P>
      <P>This Government recognised that the funding issue had not been adequately addressed by our predecessors and assigned the highest priority to remedying this.  We accepted that if local empowerment and local decision making, the central tenets of local government, were to have any meaning, they must be backed up by sufficient financial resources.  Only then could our local government system play its full role in serving the community.  With a strong financial base, there is no doubt that local government can meet the challenges of these changing times in a positive and constructive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, it has been a key <Col N="1184" /> priority for this Government to deliver on its commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium in relation to the resourcing of local authorities.  This Bill will give statutory support to delivering what is a new deal in terms of local authority funding.  I will outline the trump cards in this new deal.</P>
    <P>The principal feature of this Bill is that it will establish a local government fund which will come into operation at the start of next year.  This fund will have a number of significant features, three of which are as follows.  The fund will be substantial.  It will combine the proceeds of motor tax which will be used primarily to fund the non-national roads programme and an Exchequer contribution to fund the general purposes needs of local authorities.  In 1999, the Exchequer contribution will be £270 million which, when taken with an estimated £320 million in motor tax revenue, will see a fund of some £590 million being made available to local authorities.  That is £125 million more than the corresponding funding which local authorities received in 1997.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the fund is that it will be ring fenced in this Bill.  It will be devoted solely to the purposes of funding the local authority system.</P>
    <P>Buoyancy is a third crucial feature of the fund. The Bill provides an in-built mechanism for the Exchequer contribution to the fund to be increased in line with inflation.  Adjustments can also be made in any year to take account of &mdash; changes in the powers, functions and duties of local authorities, and variations in costs incurred by local authorities arising from their existing power, functions and duties.</P>
    <P>It was recognised in the KPMG 1996 report, the Financing of Local Government in Ireland, that significant additional annual funding would be required to enable local authorities to continue to operate at an acceptable level &mdash; the so-called funding gap of more than £30 million.  It was in this context that the previous Government introduced its funding proposals.  However, further analysis undertaken on how the projections proposed in that report are unfolding indicate that, even with the benefit of the buoyancy in motor tax, this source would prove inadequate to meet the long-term requirements of local authorities. This would have seen a reinforcing of the trend which had emerged under which commercial rate payers were being expected to pay more than their fair share.</P>
    <P>The £590 million funding to be provided through the Local Government Fund next year will address these issues by establishing a new baseline for local authorities.  The new fund takes account of new functions and responsibilities which have been placed on local authorities over the years without matching funding and which local authorities have not been able to discharge fully.  These include functions in the environmental protection area, litter control, building regulations, community-based efforts and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> While the new fund takes account of the needs of local authorities as they are now emerging, it has had to be framed within overall Government constraints on spending.  Local government could legitimately spend a great deal more money than the Local Government Fund will provide &mdash; however, the Government has a responsibility to other sectors of the public service, as well as the necessary constraints on the overall budget.</P>
    <P>I turn to the element of the fund which will see non-national roads being financed from national motor tax receipts.  This Government believes it is wrong in principle to ask any sector of the public to finance the provision of general local government services for the entire community.  I refer to the motorist who would have been placed in that position under the previous Government's funding arrangements.  This Bill will now right that wrong.  The proceeds of motor tax will be used primarily for the funding of the non-national road network.  Motorists will see where their motor tax money is being spent.  It is important for accountability and transparency reasons that motor tax income collected should be ploughed back into the roads network thus establishing a clear link between the services received and the payment made by the customer.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of non-national roads, I acknowledge the previous Government's recognition of the importance of those roads and its commitment to restoring them through the Roads Restoration Programme.  This Government has already accelerated the investment under this programme, ensuring that it will be completed on target by the year 2005.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also provide for an increase in national motor tax rates as part of the package of measures to address local government funding.  It will serve to increase the motor tax base of the fund, which will increase further from the buoyancy brought about by the growth in motor vehicles generally.  Some will say that the motorist is being hit again.  However, a number of factors should be borne in mind: The rates of motor tax have not been increased since 1992; the total increase of 6 per cent over this year and next year compares with inflation of almost 15 per cent since the last increase; and external expenditure associated with motoring such as air pollution and traffic management cost more each year.</P>
    <P>The combined increases of 3 per cent in 1998 and 3 per cent in 1999 means that the yearly motor tax on a 1200 cc engine car will increase by a total of £10.  The increase will have a minimal effect on a motorist's overall costs.</P>
    <P>This is more than a series of rate changes to fund local roads or local government.  It is also a reform measure and a major shift in the underlying motor tax philosophy.  I invite the House to carefully consider the rationale behind these reforms.  Two factors stand out &mdash; vehicle ownership is increasing very quickly and roads are clogged up, particularly in urban areas.  It is time to reward the more environmentally friendly user of roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> This Bill recognises the fundamental importance of adequate public transport facilities to our society and economy.  Under the Bill, motor tax rates for buses are being drastically reduced.  The rates for smaller buses are being reduced proportionally more than for larger buses which tend to emit more pollutants.  Taxis will also benefit with their tax rate being reduced from £60 to £47. This process of greening taxes is evolving and the cost of these first measures for buses and taxis is estimated at £700,000.</P>
    <P>The requirement to identify the various needs and resources of individual local authorities so that available funds will be disbursed equitably is of the utmost importance.  Indeed, the previous Minister for the Environment also recognised the need to effect equalisation measures.  There has long been dissatisfaction in local government about the way in which the old rate support grant system was not fine tuned to respond to changing needs and circumstances.  With the magnitude of the extra funding which will be available &mdash; £125 million more will be in the local government system compared with the funding available when this Government came into office &mdash; this need becomes even greater.</P>
    <P>In this context, Galway County Council is being funded to carry out a pilot study on its needs and resources and those of the other local authorities in Galway, with a view to developing a model that can be applied to any local authority. However the model develops, it is important that it does not foster a begging bowl mentality among local authorities, where the Minister of the day is petitioned for funding to resolve a particular problem and thus decides allocations.  We must achieve a model where various criteria are identified which contribute to higher or lower costs and where the capacity of a local authority to raise funds locally is factored in.  In a sense, we move to a new playing field where the rules have been revised.  The intention is to achieve maximum independence for local government, where local authorities resolve their own problems and make their own decisions, allied to an ingrained culture of delivering value for money services.</P>
    <P>During the debates in the House last year, there was total support from all sides on the need for better value for money in all local government activities.  These additional funds, which will be made available through this legislation, will have to be used wisely.  Value for money is a key requirement of all publicly funded organisations, big or small.  Our local government system must operate on a basis which gives value for money and is efficient, but not at the expense of its commitment to quality to the public.  This message has been unambiguously stated by the Minister at his many meetings with local authorities throughout the country.  Local authorities are aware of the Government's commitment to this philosophy and the intention to give greater discretion over their spending to those authorities which can <Col N="1187" /> demonstrate value for money in their various activities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of positive and practical actions under way to develop the value for money agenda.  The Department is working on the development of some initial performance indicators so that the efficiency of local authorities can be measured and compared with other local authorities.  Naturally the proposals emerging here will have to be discussed with local authorities to review their practicality.  It is important that performance indicators will focus on areas where local authorities have control over the achievement of objectives.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to introduce performance indicators which compare the costs of delivering services until further work has been done on the financial systems in place in local authorities. With this in mind, a study is being carried out by consultants to examine and appraise the existing system of costing in local authorities and to present a model suitable for present day financial management and performance measurement in local authorities.  The existing costing system is not conducive to determining the true cost of providing individual services as there is a lack of consistency in how both direct and indirect costs are apportioned.</P>
    <P>The existing form of accounts is in need of updating to make it clearer, more user-friendly and transparent.  A fundamental change will be the move to a full accrual based accounting system, thus reflecting modern needs and practices. The Department is working with local authorities with a view to introducing these changes over the coming months and years.  Next month will see the publication of an accounting code of practice. This will be the cornerstone of the new financial management systems, setting out the requirements local authorities must meet in conforming to accepted accountancy practices.</P>
    <P>These issues are at an early stage and it will be some time before the extensive changes they will generate will be in place.  However, I am anxious that the changes take place during the lifetime of this Government.  The end result will be a buoyant funding system for local authorities and a modern and meaningful accounting and financial management system.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects of the Bill which are not related to funding.  The first is the provision which provides for the postponement of local elections from June this year to June 1999.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  Installation aid is important to young farmers throughout the country.  In many cases, it has served as a lifeline in keeping young farmers on the land.  Farming is becoming less and less attractive as a source of income so it is of the utmost importance to encourage young farmers to remain on the land.  Depopulation of rural areas will be a further attack on the rural lifestyle as we know it.</P>
      <P>When installation aid was suspended there was widespread concern among young farmers' groups.  Macra na Feirme put installation aid at the top of its list in its last two pre-budget submissions. Before the introduction of the last budget, the Minister for Agriculture and Food kindly met my Independent colleagues, Deputies Blaney and Healy-Rae, and me and we discussed this matter at length.  In the budget an allowance of £3.5 million was allocated to clear the many files which were, at that stage, in limbo.  Many of them were with Teagasc.  That allocation was most welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food also announced that the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance would meet to discuss a more tightly focused scheme to target young farmers who needed aid.  Many such farmers have been in contact with my office in the meantime to find out the details of any such scheme.  They would benefit greatly from the scheme and are in genuine need of such aid to deal with the legal fees involved in the transfer of farms under the early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>Has any progress been made on the scheme announced last December to replace the installation aid scheme?  It is five months since the announcement of the more tightly focused scheme and young farmers are worried that it will be put on the long finger.  I hope the Minister will outline the plans he has in train to replace the installation aid scheme and when we can expect a favourable announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fox for giving me the opportunity to speak in support of her request for the early reintroduction of the farm installation grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The most disappointing decision which resulted from the change of Government last year, from the point of view of the farming community, was the summary decision by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to scrap the scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, in Opposition had stated his strong support for the retention of the scheme and it was a shock, surprise and bitter disappointment to farmers, particularly young farmers, that in one of his first acts as Minister, Deputy Walsh scrapped it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another scheme has been promised and we await the Minister's efforts in this regard with interest and anticipation.  He indicated both to <Col N="1189" /> the House and in writing to Members following individual representations that he hoped to establish a new scheme at an early date.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the matter is apparent to rural representatives who, on a weekly basis, come in contact with young members of the farming community who wish to remain in farming but cannot afford to do so.  An installation aid grant of £5,600 would make the difference between their remaining in farming and leaving the land.  To keep young farmers in farming and agriculture alive, we advocate the reintroduction of the installation aid scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated in the House and in correspondence with many Deputies that a revised scheme will be put in place.  We welcome this commitment but are fearful of what it will entail.  There are rumours that it will be restricted. Those who have contacted us at our clinics want it to be as broadly based as possible.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the alternatives available to the person who wishes to obtain an installation aid grant.  We should contrast the sum involved, £5,600 per annum, with the cost of creating an industrial job, which, according to the IDA, varies between £10,000 and £20,000.  It would be much better, from an economic and social perspective, to spend £5,600 to ensure a young person remains in farming.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that the numbers involved in farming have been reducing gradually over the past 20 years, while the population of urban areas has increased.  This has led to the creation of huge housing estates with the attendant problems.  It is in all our interests, therefore, to keep rural areas alive and farmers and their sons and daughters on the land.  We can ensure this by reintroducing the installation aid scheme.  I hope the Minister will live up to the commitments he has given at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fox and Bradford for raising this important matter.  The installation aid scheme for young farmers has been a successful instrument in assisting many young farmers embarking on their careers.  Some 6,400 young farmers were paid installation aid grant up to the end of last year.  Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry £17 million was set aside for the scheme.  Due to the high level of demand, it was necessary to suspend the measure in August last year when funds ran out.  At that stage almost 4,000 young farmers had been paid under the scheme, representing a total public contribution of approximately £22 million.  Recognising the importance attached to the scheme by young farmers, I am committed not only to meeting all existing valid applications but also to re-introducing the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance to draw up a new, more tightly focused scheme to be targeted at smaller farmers. My aim will be to ensure the new scheme results <Col N="1190" /> in resources being concentrated on those young farmers most in need of help.  Discussions have been held with the various farm organisations on the nature of the new scheme, the terms of which are being finalised within the Department.</P>
    <P>One aspect receiving particular attention is the need to accommodate qualified young farmers who failed to make an application under the existing scheme before its suspension.  Detailed discussions are taking place with Macra na Feirme which represents younger farmers specifically.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be 100 per cent financed by the Exchequer.  In the current financial year the necessary financial resources will have to be found from within the Department.  EU approval will be required before the new scheme can come into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of raising this important issue. The impending industrial action, the withdrawal of labour earmarked for 27 May, has regrettably been found necessary given the failure of the Eastern Health Board to implement the recommendations of the Labour Court.  Up to 100 employees working in 20 affiliated day care centres located mainly in Dublin city are affected.</P>
      <P>Each centre is staffed by a manager and up to five pre-school child care workers or assistants. The Eastern Health Board is the main funding agency, providing up to 90 per cent of expenditure in each centre.  The centres are situated in socially deprived or underprivileged areas and cater for the needs of children deemed to be at risk, the majority of whom are in the age group of two and a half to five years and are referred through specialists, referral groups, social workers, public health nurses, speech therapists and other professionals involved in child care. The criteria for referral include suspected child abuse and drug abuse by either parent.  It has been acknowledged by all that these centres have been hugely successful and enabled children to grow in confidence and lead a normal life.</P>
      <P>Ministers have paid lip service to the need for proper child care facilities.  They should recognise the achievements and role played by the staff of these centres by paying them a proper rate for the job they are doing.  They have not secured a pay increase in ten years.  In negotiations they have failed to secure the support of the Minister for Finance and the Eastern Health Board.  Any other group would justifiably have gone on strike years ago. How many other groups have gone ten years without a salary increase?  Is it any wonder that the morale of the staff is low, although they realise the invaluable service they provide for the children, families and communities with which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to ensure, by whatever means necessary, the implementation of <Col N="1191" /> the meagre recommendations of the Labour Court.  I do not want him to wash his hands of the matter like Pontius Pilate and transfer responsibility to the Eastern Health Board.  That will not help to resolve the issue.  In relation to nursery care workers, the Labour Court recommended that, from 1 January 1997, claimants in this grade be paid the same as the early start workers, i.e. grade 2 and assimilation to grade 3 when it is applicable.  The IPC report suggests that nursery managers be paid two grades above the nursery care workers.  The Labour Court went on to say it was not fully satisfied with these recommendations because they were not strong enough.</P>
    <P>We must come to an agreement with these people before 27 May.  They are doing a fantastic job but they are being left behind.  Let us not pass the buck.  The Department and the Eastern Health Board should come to an agreement with these people who justifiably deserve an increase. The money was found for many other matters and we, as politicians, should see that the money is found for this increase also.</P>

      <P>Health boards make a contribution under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, to a wide variety of organisations.  Examples of the type of organisations supported in this way include bodies such as the rape crisis centres, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; service and a range of other bodies is the general welfare area including local organisations staffed by volunteers.</P>
      <P>Under this Act health boards make contributions to certain pre school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged.  This function is in keeping with the board's overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Eastern Health Board as part of its child care services makes a contribution via the section 65 mechanism to day care nurseries in the region.</P>
      <P>These nurseries operate autonomously and are independent of the board in relation to their day-to-day operation.  The employees of organisations in receipt of section 65 grants from health boards are not employees of the board and, accordingly, the health board does not directly determine their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>In matters of recruitment, pay rates and conditions of employment, the arrangements agreed between employer and employee are not subject to control by the local health board or my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour Court recommendation No. 15671 refers to the pay of 20 day nursery managers and 100 other staff who are employed in approximately 100 day care centres in the greater Dublin area and, therefore, relates to the Eastern Health Board area specifically.  The recommendation <Col N="1192" /> makes provision for the revision of salary for these staff in line with the Department of Education's &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; programme, as the Deputy already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I understand that implementation of the award has been the subject of ongoing discussions between the Management of the Nurseries, the Eastern Health Board, the Health Service Employers' Agency and the trade union lMPACT.  lt.  is a matter for health boards to determine specific funding arrangements for voluntary agencies supported via the section 65 mechanism.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the award is a matter for the management of the day nurseries as the direct employer, in consultation with the health board about funding and service levels.  The board has to consider the implications of claims such as this in the context of its overall funding of child care services within the board.</P>
    <P>In that context the board made a proposal to the staff side in relation to the phased implementation of the award.  This proposal has been rejected by the staff side who have now served strike notice.</P>
    <P>Children who attend these nurseries are referred by the social work and public health nursing services of the board, industrial action will most likely have the effect of closing day nurseries so they will have to remain with their parents or carers.  I understand, given the voluntary nature of the committees managing the nurseries, that they would not be in a position to put in place alternative arrangements for the continued operation of the day nurseries during any industrial action.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that in an attempt to indicate a willingness to negotiate a realistic settlement, the management side has tabled a proposal.  Apart from the considerations of the effects of this disruption and the public concern it will generate, any dispute undermines relationships between the workforce and their employers.  In that context, I hope to persuade the union to defer its threatened action and to return to discussions with the board and the health service employers agency with a view to finding some resolution in the context of the Labour Court recommendations already issued.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.  I had hoped that the Minister for Education and Children, Deputy Martin, would be in a position to attend.  To coin a phrase, I was looking forward to seeing the whites of his eyes and the colour of his money on this issue <Col N="1193" /> because, as a Minister and as an Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Martin has given the most explicit promises to the school authorities that he would announce a decision in favour of retaining the motor apprenticeship school in Mallow.</P>
      <P>The history of that school goes back to 1967, during which time over 2,200 motor apprentices have been trained there.  It has been of huge benefit and status, not just to Davis College in Mallow but to the town and the north Cork region generally.  It has been at the centre of the development of VEC based education and the development of Davis College in Mallow.  We are all anxious that the motor apprenticeship school will be retained.</P>
      <P>The training of apprentices at Davis College has been a successful enterprise from an educational and training point of view.  It is a shining example of the goodwill and co-operation which can exist between the Department, County Cork VEC, the motor industry, FÁS, the Institute of Road Transport Engineers and the apprentices themselves.</P>
      <P>The college has a long tradition in apprenticeship training.  Prior to 1967, fitter and motor apprentices attended half day release courses.  In 1967 the automobile engineering department was built and was, at that stage, equipped to the highest standards.  Since then there have been significant further developments.  It is a senior centre for motor apprenticeship education and has the most modern facilities available.</P>
      <P>It was one of the first centres in the country to provide block release programmes back in 1968. It also provides a module in automobile engineering for the PLC applied technology courses, as well as providing modules in automobile engineering for Teagasc.  It is a major facility with specialist workshops and trained staff.  It has contributed greatly to the employment of young people in the area who wish to pursue a career in the motor industry.</P>
      <P>SIMI, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, is a major proponent of the case for retaining the school in Mallow.  The SIMI group in the north Cork and Limerick areas has lobbied strongly for the facility's retention.</P>
      <P>While we all concede that political promises sometimes have to be taken with a grain of salt, on this issue the Minister and other politicians now in Government, gave specific promises in advance of the 1997 general election that they would retain the facility in Mallow.  The Minister visited the facility last October and stated publicly that he would reverse a previous decision to close the course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time for that decision to be publicly announced.  I look forward to an early and favourable decision by the Minister on the matter.  Political cynicism is served by breaking solemn promises.  A very solemn political promise was given that this centre <Col N="1194" /> would be retained and fully developed.  I hope that the Minister of State, on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, will be able to announce good news for the motor industry, Mallow and north Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter and is glad of the opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The County Cork Vocational Education Committee provided an effective day release course for motor car engineering apprentices in its second level school, Davis College in Mallow, for many years.  Under the new standard based apprenticeship system all day release courses are being discontinued and are being replaced by block release courses.  The Deputy may be aware that under the PESP and the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-7 it was agreed that the statutory apprenticeship scheme would be improved by developing a standard based rather than a time served approach.  A new apprenticeship training model, comprising four on the job training modules and three off the job training modules, was developed by FÁS in consultation with the social partners.  The first off the job training module takes place in FÁS training centres and the second and final off the job modules take place in institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The new apprenticeship system has been introduced on a phased basis and will result in the rationalisation of provision for the delivery of the craft apprenticeship programme.  When this system is fully operational some institutes and vocational schools, which have been involved in the delivery of day release motor apprentice programmes, will no longer be required to be providers of such programmes.</P>
      <P>The operational arrangements for the delivery of the new system are those recommended by a working group representative of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS, the institutes of technology and the Department of Education and Science.  The new system is being implemented in the most effective and efficient way to ensure that expensive specialist training facilities will be utilised as fully as possible.</P>
      <P>The original arrangements involve phasing out motor apprentices training at Davis College in Mallow. However, as a result of representations the Minister has received and having regard to changing recruitment patterns and the increased uptake of designated apprenticeships, he has instructed his Department to urgently review the need for training places for apprentices in the education sector.  In the light of increased uptake of apprenticeships in the designated trades, he is reasonably confident that the outcome of the current review will result in Davis College in Mallow having a continuing role in apprenticeship training.</P>
      <P>I hope that is good news for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 May 1998.</P>

      <P>Consideration is being given to the most appropriate way of commemorating the millennium in Ireland and the Taoiseach will shortly announce the Governments approach.</P>
      <P>I consider that the establishment of an Academy for the Performing Arts, including a conservatoire in Dublin, would be a very suitable project for the millennium.  A working group established by me and the Minister for Education and Science is examining the steps necessary to establish the academy.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, will be organising certain events to mark the millennium.  The cultural institutions under my aegis are devising their own programmes to celebrate the event as follows.  The National Gallery hopes to mark the event with the opening of the new extension to the gallery in 2000.  Later that year, the gallery proposes to mount an exhibition to commemorate George Bernard Shaw to mark his contribution to the work of the National Gallery.</P>
      <P>The National Concert Hall hopes to mark the event with the opening of the new Second Recital Hall at Earlsfort Terrace.  They also plan a major programme of events to inaugurate the new hall and this will take place from the late autumn into the year 2000.  Running in parallel with the programme for the Second Recital Hall will be a major programme of events in the main auditorium, featuring outstanding international artists and visiting orchestras throughout the 1999-2000 season.</P>
      <P>The National Museum is in the process of formulating proposals to mark the millennium but no final decisions in the matter have been made as yet.</P>
      <P>The National Library is considering a possible publication &mdash; either in book or CD form &mdash; to mark the millennium.</P>
      <P>The National Archives is planning the publication of a CD-ROM and an exhibition based on 1,000 of the most important and visually attractive documents in the collection.  These documents may also be used as the basis for a travelling exhibition and possible associated publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chester Beatty Library is planning a <Col N="1197" /> special exhibition of its most important cultural material representative of many cultures and societies.</P>
    <P>The Irish Museum of Modern Arts plans include the opening of new display galleries in the Deputy Masters House building in the Royal Hospital complex, a major exhibition examining five decades of Irish art selected by a number of respected writers/critics.  A major group exhibition of artworks made in the 1990s and acquired for the Irish Museum of Modern Art Collection which reflect the changes and new developments in Irish society and culture in this decade is planned, which will tour to a number of important US and Canadian museums.  The exhibition will create new perceptions of Irish art and visual culture including aspects of film making. IMMA is promoting, along with other key visual arts institutions throughout Dublin, the idea that visual arts become a key theme of the millennium year of 2000 with a range of contemporary and historical exhibitions and projects radiating out to include other visual arts disciplines such as design, crafts, film and architecture.</P>

In Ireland, successive Governments have recognised the important role to be played by public service broadcasters and support for this role remains a central element of my policies in my development of legislative proposals for broadcasting in the digital age.  In this regard, the protocol is a vital recognition of the important role played by public service broadcasting in the European context and in recognising the initiative of individual member states to determine the remit and organisation of public service broadcasting in each member state. It will inform the European Commission as to its development of proposals relating to the European audiovisual sector generally and public service broadcasting sector in particular.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the statutory responsibility for the funding of the National Theatre Society Limited rests with An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  However, my Department was involved in tripartite discussions with an chomhairle and the National Theatre Society in 1996 and 1997.  The question of a severance package was discussed at this forum and it was agreed that the best way to proceed was for the National Theatre Society to develop a proposal and submit it to an chomhairle in the first instance.  The National Theatre Society prepared and submitted such a proposal.</P>
      <P>On foot of the advice subsequently received by me from An Chomhairle Ealaíon on the severance package, my Department has recently sought the views of the Department of Finance as to the proposed terms and costs.  Thereafter it will be a matter for the National Theatre Society Limited to determine whether the members concerned are prepared to accept the terms of whatever package may be offered and how it can be funded.  On this latter connection, my Department will be prepared to offer assistance to the National Theatre Society Limited and An Chomhairle Ealaíon, if requested, to explore funding options in the context in the first place of the annual grant payable to the society by an chomhairle.</P>

      <P>Excessive sheep numbers have largely been responsible for the problem of overgrazing in upland areas, particularly commonly-owned areas.  This problem is now being addressed in a comprehensive way by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food, working in close co-operation with each other.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for compensatory allowances and premia payments on sheep, sheep producers with commonage land in areas classified by the Minister for Agriculture and Food as overgrazed, including commonages in proposed natural heritage areas, will in future have to farm in accordance with an approved agri-environmental plan drawn up either under the rural environment protection scheme, or arranged directly by my Department.  These individual plans will comply with an overall framework plan for each commonage which will specify the maximum stock numbers that the land can carry, consistent with maintaining and if appropriate, improving the ecology of the land.</P>
      <P>Compensation for any losses arising will be available for those in the REPS through the availability of increased REPS payments for land in those areas.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has recently announced amendments to the REPS.  This amended package provides generous payments to farmers with land in proposed special areas of conservation, special protection areas, NHAs and commonage areas.  Under the amended scheme, payments for such land will be available at the rate of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre from 101 to 200 acres, and £6 per acre from 201 to 300 acres.</P>
      <P>Those who do not wish to join the REPS can claim direct from my Department for actual losses arising.  Independent arbitration will be available where agreement is not reached on the amount payable.</P>
      <P>The preparation of framework plans for commonages will begin shortly, and individual farm plans will follow.</P>
      <P>The new measures will radically change the way land in these areas is managed, with consequent environmental benefits, and both Departments are committed to ensuring that the new system works effectively.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the major new facility for the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks has been open to the public since last September. The initial phase of this unique development has provided approximately 6,500 square metres in exhibition galleries, located in the west and south blocks of the beautifully restored Clarke Square buildings on the eastern side of the Collins Barracks site.  These new areas have facilitated in the display of hundreds of artifacts from the National Museum collections, some of which were not previously exhibited due to lack of exhibition space.</P>
      <P>The opening of Collins Barracks for the National Museum represents the initial stages of a major investment on this site of the order of £30 million.  Of this amount, some £18 million in co-financed expenditure has been allocated in EU Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.  When completed, the Collins Barracks project will provide an exciting opportunity for the museum to expand, consolidate, and upgrade its facilities to enable it communicate the story of Ireland more effectively.  These facilities will provide space for collections management, artifact storage, public exhibitions and programmes which are essential for the preservation and presentation of Irish heritage.</P>
      <P>Preparations are at an advanced stage for the next phases of the development.  A comprehensive functional brief has been prepared by an international firm of museum consultants which sets out the requirements for the museum on this site and how they can be met within the existing resources in the short, medium and long-terms. An exhibition strategy for the site is also at an advanced stage of preparation which, with the functional brief, will set the parameters for the future uses and possibilities for this facility.</P>
      <P>In terms of the physical development of the remaining two-thirds of the site, it has been decided that a new building will be located on the vacant ground in the central area of the site.  This will house the major visitor reception facilities, as well as new introductory exhibition theme galleries. An equally important function of this building will be to orientate the visitor and to unite the site through making the key physical connections to the other sectors of the site.  It is envisaged that the central building would be opened by the end of year 2001 or early 2002.</P>
      <P>More immediately, plans are being prepared for works to be undertaken on the refurbishment and consolidation of existing buildings for collection management purposes plus some administration uses.  These works are intended to be finalised by the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>Following a package of proposals presented by Ireland for discussion at the International Whaling Commission meeting in Monaco in October 1997, the Irish commissioner, who is also the current Chairman of the IWC, called an intersessional meeting of whaling commissioners.  This meeting was held in Antigua in February last and was attended by representatives of 17 countries with all the major viewpoints within the IWC being represented. The agenda took the form of an individual discussion on each of the five elements of the Irish proposal.</P>
      <P>This meeting was a consultative one where no decisions or negotiations took place.  The detailed discussion of the proposals indicated the essential areas at issue and provided each of the participants with a clear understanding of all viewpoints. The meeting was very useful and there was consensus that the process was worth pursuing at the next meeting of the IWC which begins on 11 May next.  It will be a matter for the delegates at that meeting to consider if these proposals form an acceptable basis for agreement.  I have already stated clearly on the record of this House that the proposals put forward by Ireland are intended to ensure that fewer whales will be killed and that any whaling which does take place will be strictly regulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this question which relates to the Irish language has been put to me in English I will answer it in English even though I would prefer to answer such parliamentary questions in Irish.</P>
      <P>The recently published report of the Central Statistics Office on the principal socio-economic results of the 1996 census of population contains a section on the Irish language.  The question asked in the 1996 census &ldquo;Can the person speak Irish&rdquo; along with a question on frequency of use represented a major departure from the question used in censuses since 1961.  The version in use prior to 1996 asked respondents to write &ldquo;Irish only&rdquo;, &ldquo;Irish and English&rdquo;, &ldquo;Read but cannot speak Irish&rdquo; or to leave blank as appropriate.  The CSO report refers to the fact that the new question asked in the 1996 census gives rise to a discontinuity with the results of previous censuses and that for that reason no retrospective comparisons can be made.</P>
      <P>While the CSO report contains wide-ranging data I am unclear as to how the Deputy has interpreted that data as indicating that there is a decline in spoken Irish in Gaeltacht areas.  While the results of the 1996 census cannot be directly compared with the results of the 1991 census as the questions asked were different, it is worth noting that the 1996 census reported that 76.3 per cent of the population of the Gaeltacht aged three years and over indicated that they were Irish speakers compared with 71 per cent in 1991.</P>
      <P>It can be deduced from the CSO report on the 1996 census that approximately 43 per cent of the population of the Gaeltacht indicate that they speak Irish on a daily basis.  As there is no comparable data from previous censuses it is not possible to say whether this figure represents an increase or a decline on previous years.  I am well aware, however, that there are many areas in the Gaeltacht in which the use of Irish is in decline. There are other areas, however, in which this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a core policy objective of my Department to reverse the decline in the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  As to the specific steps which I propose to take to realise my Departments objective in relation to the Irish language I refer the <Col N="1203" /> Deputy to my answer to Priority Question No. 4 of today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, following the perfection of the order implementing the High Court decision in this case, I publicly advised, in a press release of 30 April 1998 my intention to appeal <Col N="1204" /> the decision.  This process is now in train.  Prior to making this decision, a comprehensive review of the issues involved was undertaken with all relevant parties, particularly the State's legal team. I also arranged for officials of my Department to re-open discussions with representatives of Blascaod Mór Teoranta, the principal landowners on the island, with a view to reaching an overall settlement if at all possible.  A meeting took place on 17 April but, unfortunately, it did not result in any prospect of a settlement.  The decision to appeal to the Supreme Court was taken, after much deliberation and taking all factors into account, as being in the best interests of preserving the homeland of the Great Blasket Island community.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will no doubt appreciate State possession of the island is eminently desirable on conserving, presenting and managing the island as a national historic park.  Unfortunately, I have not yet had the opportunity to visit the island but I would hope to do so at a future date.</P>

      <P>The Register of Historic Monuments provided for under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, is updated on an ongoing basis.  It includes some 4,000 monument sites, in State ownership and guardianship, protected under preservation orders and protected under listings/&ldquo;Registrations&rdquo;.  The register is continually added to.  However, one of the most significant effects of the 1994 National Monuments (Amendment) Act was the extension of legal protection to cover all recorded monuments on an accelerated &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; basis.  Section 12 of that Act provides for the establishment of a &ldquo;Record of Monuments and Places&rdquo;&mdash; RMP. This provides for comprehensive legal protection for all recorded monuments.  In this way protection is being extended to some 150,000 monuments nation-wide, as against some 4,000 prior to this.  To date sites in 21 counties enjoy legal protection under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994, as &ldquo;Record Monuments&rdquo; and it is intended to extend coverage to the remaining counties this year.</P>

      <P>In order for the National Museum to properly manage its collections, and not just for reasons of display, it is necessary that all its artefacts be documented and that an easily accessible record of these collections be in place.  In the past such documentation systems have been largely paperbased and were not always maintained in a consistent manner.  In recognition of the needs in this area, a programme was initiated in 1995 to prepare a computerised inventory of the National Museums collection, focusing in the first instance on those objects in the art and industry collection due to be transferred to the new National Museum facility at Collins Barracks.  This inventory of artefacts which is a long-term process of properly documenting all of the records relating to the museum's extensive collection, is ongoing at this time.  I am pleased to say that to date over 32,000 items have been included in the inventory.</P>
      <P>I look forward to sustained progress in this most important aspect of the National Museums activities in the future, and I am confident that with the records thus created, it will be possible to make available to researchers and the general public alike, a wider range of information regarding the collections of the National Museum.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the current Arts Plan was prepared by An Chomhairle Ealaíon /The Arts Council at the request of my predecessor as a three year plan covering the years 1995-1997.  However the required level of funding to deliver the plan in this timescale was not forthcoming from the previous Government and the plan had to be recast as a five year plan 1995-1999.  When I came to office I secured a major increase in the allocation to an Chomhairle Ealaíon thereby facilitating an chomhairle to implement the plan by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Compensation can be obtained in one of two alternative ways, as follows: Those with land in special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; special protection areas &mdash; SPAs &mdash; proposed natural heritage areas &mdash; NHAs &mdash; and commonages can join the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, under which generous payments are available.  My colleague, Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture and Food, recently announced an amended REPS scheme under which such land will qualify for payments of £80 per acre up to 100 acres, £8 per acre from 101 to 200 acres, and £6 per acre from 201 to 300 acres.  Questions regarding the administration of the REPS scheme, including when the increased payments will begin, should be directed to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Those who do not wish to join REPS can apply to my Department for compensation in respect of actual losses resulting from SAC/SPA restrictions.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in relation to the Office of Public Works, and I am not in a position therefore, to provide information in relation to it.  In the case of my own Department, contractors have continued to be engaged in carrying out specific tasks, which was the situation pertaining in the Office of Public Works <Col N="1208" /> prior to the transfer of the heritage services to my Department.</P>
      <P>The number of contractors providing services in the areas listed by the Deputy are as follows: 10 &mdash; The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage including recording of structures and the preparation of Inventories for publication, etc.; 22 &mdash; Various archaeological surveys in connection with the Archaeological Survey of Ireland, including fieldwork, writing up reports on findings and editing volumes on same; liaising with local authorities and advising on planning and development issues involving sites of archaeological interest; updating the Sites and National Monuments Records; implementing the new provisions of section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 and completing a Sites and Monuments Record for Maritime Wrecks as well as maritime archaeological survey constraint mapping manuals, etc.; and 19 &mdash; Facilitating the production of management plans for areas proposed as special areas of conservation, etc.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Social Partners are committed under Partnership 2000 to the delivery of quality services, and to an adaptable and responsive public service.  In this context, my Department is presently involved in consultations with the Department of Finance as to how the above listed services might best be provided in the future.</P>

      <P>The level of cross-Border co-operation in relation to cultural activities is already significant.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Northern Ireland Arts Council have held annual joint meetings since the mid 1970.  In addition, the two councils have established a joint committee comprising the chairmen, two ordinary members and the two directors.  This committee meets two or three times a year in addition to the annual joint meeting of the two councils to consider areas in which co-operation can be increased.  Furthermore, meetings now take place between the directors of the Arts Councils and the British Councils in Ireland North and South, Scotland, Wales and England.  The purpose of these meetings is to discuss the full range of cultural matters which are of common or mutual interest to them as policy bodies concerned with the arts and culture in these islands.  A forum consisting of the directors of the main cultural collecting institutions, North and South, is also in place since 1994 and this meets from time to time to discuss matters of common interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very much in favour, if possible, of <Col N="1209" /> exploring the possibilities for increasing further the considerable links which already exist between North and South and to this end I will be happy to discuss the matter with my counterpart in Northern Ireland at the first appropriate opportunity.</P>

      <P>The surveys of overseas visitors to Ireland conducted by Bord Fáilte confirm consistently that almost half of all overseas holidaymakers visit places of cultural/historical interest.  This confirms the relevance of the projects aided under sub-programme one of the Tourism OP to international tourism.  Indeed cultural tourism is fast emerging as one of the main growth areas in the tourist industry worldwide and the projects being assisted under sub-programme one aim to increase the range and choice of facilities available to the foreign visitor in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the mid-term review, a reduction of 10 million ECU in the European Regional Development Fund allocation as follows has been implemented for sub-programme one of the Operational Programme for Tourism administered by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which it was decided that only 8,500 hectares, in 33 sites, of raised bog are to be special areas of conservation when Ireland has 23,665 hectares of raised bog national heritage areas which have a high conservation value and represent 51 per cent of the remaining global reserve of this bogland type.</Quest>

      <P>Annex III of Directive 92/43/EEC, better known as the Habitats Directive, lays down the criteria for assessment at national level of the relative importance of sites for each natural habitat type in Annex I of the Directive.  These are: (a) degree of representativity of the natural habitat type on the site; (b) area of the site covered by the natural habitat type in relation to the total area covered by that natural habitat type within national territory; (c) degree of conservation of the structure and functions of the natural habitat type concerned and restoration possibilities; and (d) global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the natural habitat type concerned.</P>
      <P>Ireland's raised bog areas were carefully considered in the light of those criteria, and following that assessment the areas that clearly met the specified conditions were proposed for special area of conservation status.</P>
      <P>In general, those sites proposed for inclusion within our SAC network represent the best remaining examples of active raised bog, and my Department's scientists are satisfied that the amount and extent proposed will satisfactorily secure the conservation of this important habitat type.  Representations have been made to my Department requesting that consideration be given to the inclusion of additional areas, and those representations will be carefully examined, again taking account of the relevant criteria.</P>

      <P>A number of archaeological excavations are currently being carried out under licence from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in the medieval area of Dublin, particularly in the western sector of Temple Bar.  In general discoveries include the remains of Hiberno-Norse or Viking settlements dating to the 10th and 11th centuries.  Temple Bar Properties has engaged an archaeologist to explore, document and arrange protection measures for archaeology of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties, in co-operation with Dublin Corporation, has arranged for viewing of the existing research excavations in the western sector through the provision of specially designed <Col N="1212" /> platforms and viewing areas.  I understand that they have also made available to the public, information and educational material in relation to these excavations.  Research findings and artefacts from earlier excavations have been displayed in the Dublin Viking Adventure Centre by Dublin Tourism, in association with the National Museum of Ireland.  It is hoped to have a further exhibition mounted on the current excavations, in due course.  A permanent exhibition on findings from the Viking period in Dublin is open in the Kildare Street premises of the National Museum since 1995, and a new audio-visual facility is to be opened later this year to help elucidate on the material displayed therein.  Finds from the later medieval, post Viking, period are on permanent display at Dublinia at Christchurch.</P>

      <P>I indicated to Deputy Howlin yesterday in reply <Col N="1213" /> to Question No. 82 we are aware of the delays which are being experienced in providing advances of European Social Funds to project promoters in this joint Ireland-Wales EU-supported initiative.  These are due to problems which have been experienced by the UK authorities in Cardiff and London in relation to financial applications from their jurisdiction submitted to the European Commission in Brussels.</P>
      <P>My Department has had frequent contact with all concerned promoters on the Irish side, has drawn the nature of the delays to the attention of both the European Commission and the Department of Finance which has overall Irish responsibility for this initiative and has had several meetings in Brussels, Cardiff and Dublin in efforts to help to resolve the matters.</P>
      <P>Because of the joint nature of this initiative, funding arrangements for the Irish promoters of projects cannot, under EU rules, be made separately from those on the UK side.  I am hopeful that the European Commission may soon be able to give a favourable decision to joint proposals before it on this initiative but I cannot guarantee such.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that my Department is continuing to make every effort in this regard.  Again, to be of assistance, my Department has been in touch with all concerned Irish promoters to offer whatever assistance is possible, for example, by way of letters of comfort to the effect that the funding approved will not be jeopardised by the delays and the amounts approved will be honoured in full.</P>

      <P>There are some 12 vessels on the Irish fishing vessel register which are owned by interests from other EU member states.  Most of these vessels, which are based at Castletownbere, Dingle and Renard Point, have been registered in Ireland for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>The law governing the granting of sea fishing boat licences provides that a licence may be given where the boat is owned by an EU national, or by a company established under the law of an EU member state which has its principal place of business in a member state.  In considering licence applications, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources may take account of the economic benefits which the operation of the boat would be likely to contribute to coastal communities and regions which quotas are designed to benefit.  Specifically, the Minister may have regard to considerations such as the expected number of landings at Irish ports, the projected annual tonnage and value of fish landed, the projected annual level of expenditure in the State on wages, supplies, etc.  and the projected annual level of social security and tax payments.</P>
      <P>All fishing vessels, including flagships, which operate in Irish waters are strictly monitored and controlled, both at sea and in port.  I am committed to ensuring that our control systems operate with optimum effectiveness in enforcing compliance with fisheries law.  The Deputy may be aware that I have taken steps to strengthen the controls and I expect that these will have a significant impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is collected by self-assessment. Self-assessment of CGT applies to all CGT liabilities for all persons, i.e. self-employed and others directly assessed to tax, persons on PAYE and persons not already within the tax system.</P>
      <P>The due date for paying CGT preliminary tax is 1 November in the year following the year of assessment.  The due date for paying preliminary tax for the year of assessment 1997-8 i.e. in respect of chargeable gains made in the year ended 5 April 1998, is therefore 1 November 1998.  The amount of preliminary tax paid on 1 November must be not less than 90 per cent of the final CGT liability.</P>
      <P>A return of chargeable gains must be made on or before 31 January in the year following the year of assessment and the balance of the CGT due must be paid.  For chargeable gains made in 1997-8 a return must be made on or before 31 January 1999.  The obligation to make a return exists even where a person has not been issued with a return form by the inspector of taxes.</P>
      <P>Failure to submit a return on time will result in a surcharge being added to the basic CGT due. Interest is also charged on overdue returns.</P>
      <P>No special arrangements have been introduced to deal specifically with capital gains from sales of shares.  However, certain tax districts have particular expertise in dealing with the tax affairs of individuals with substantial personal investment portfolios.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reliefs which enable taxpayers to defer the liability arising on their capital gains.  The principal reliefs are:</P>
      <P>Roll over relief on trade assets, where a person reinvests either all or a large portion of the proceeds from the disposal of old business assets in new business assets; and roll over relief on shares where, subject to certain qualifying conditions, the CGT arising on the sale of shares can be fully deferred, if an adequate level of the proceeds are reinvested in other shares in certain Irish trading companies.</P>
      <P>There is no relief which enables an individual who disposes of quoted shares and reinvests in other quoted shares to defer the tax arising on gains realised in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>The taxpayer's Irish Life pension and the invalidity pension which he receives from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are taxable. However, the invalidity pension is paid without tax being deducted and, in order to collect the tax due on the invalidity pension, it is necessary to reduce the taxpayer's tax-free allowances by an amount equal to the invalidity pension he receives.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer will receive a weekly increase of £6.30 in his invalidity pension with effect from 5 June 1998.  The inspector of taxes has calculated that the total amount of invalidity pension to be paid to the taxpayer in the current tax year, 1998-99, will be £7,004.  This amount must be taken into consideration in calculating the taxpayer's tax-free allowances to avoid an underpayment of tax arising at the end of the tax year.</P>

      <P>As part of the process of commissioning new units completed under the major capital re-development at Waterford Regional Hospital, my Department has provided additional funding in 1997 and 1998 to enable the appointment of a consultant rheumatologist at the hospital, who took up duty in February 1997.  I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that it is intended that eight beds in a recently opened new ward will be dedicated to the rheumatology department. My Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board to ensure the development of the hospital's rheumatology service having regard to the board's overall priorities and the availability of funding.</P>

      <P>: Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and there are two categories of eligibility.  Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of public health services free of charge.  Persons in category 2 &mdash; non-medical card holders &mdash; have limited eligibility for health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges)(Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  This charge is currently set at £25 per night, subject to a maximum payment in any twelve month period of £250, which can be accrued in one or more public hospitals.  Since the person concerned has already been billed for £225 she would only be billed a further £25 in respect of public treatment within the twelve month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services.  There are number of exemptions to the charges including <Col N="1223" /> medical card holders.  Furthermore, the charge may be waived in respect of an individual if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment, and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  It is also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement. The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security for older and disabled people in their homes, who are either living alone or with persons who would be unable to summon help in an emergency.  The allowance, which is only for land lines, covers the rental charges and a small number of free calls. In common with other schemes of this nature, the <Col N="1225" /> free telephone rental allowance scheme is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Morning and evening peak time travel restrictions apply in relation to free travel on bus services operated by the CIE group in the major urban centres.  namely, Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and on certain long distance services from these cities on Friday evenings.  There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or on suburban rail services in Dublin and Cork, or on services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.  These restrictions have been in operation since the inception of the scheme in 1967.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these restrictions, instigated at CIE's request, is to ensure that adequate space is available on the bus services of Dublin Bus and the city bus services in Cork and Limerick for commuters to and from work and school.  An exception to the peak time travel restrictions is made in the case of people in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension who attend recognised long-term rehabilitation courses and for certain invalidity pensioners engaged on work experience programmes.  These clients are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>Extension of unrestricted access to urban services at peak time on a more widespread basis would cause capacity problems for CIE and would give rise to additional cost.  However, the Department will continue to monitor the situation in consultation with the CIE group to assess the scope for improvements having regard to the capacity and cost constraints.</P>

      <P>Since this question, which specifically relates to matters regarding a Gaeltacht island, is being put to me in English, I am answering it in <Col N="1226" /> English even though I have stated that it is my policy to answer all such representations and parliamentary questions in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I am aware of Mayo County Council's decision to grant planning permission for the erection of a cable car between Inishbiggle and Achill Island. As I have stated previously in the House, I visited Inishbiggle on 29 October 1997 at which time I had discussions with the islanders and the co-op regarding the needs of the island.  The need for safe access to and from the island was among the issues discussed and I understand that the islanders are in favour of the cable car proposal as a solution to their problem.</P>
      <P>A revised application for funding in respect of this proposal, based on the county council's decision and the conditions therein, is expected by my Department.  When it is received it will be considered and a decision will be made at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993 sets out how the amount which RTE must make available for the commissioning of television programmes from independent producers should be determined.  It is a matter for the RTE authority, in the first place, to interpret the legislation in calculating the appropriate amount. While I have no statutory function in the matter, I understand that RTE and Film Makers Ireland, which represents the independent producers, have had discussions as to the appropriate amount to be made available for independent commissions in 1999 in accordance with the legislation and that Film Makers Ireland do not agree with RTE's calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, in the event of continuing disagreement, it is not my function to offer an interpretation of the Act.  This would be a matter for the courts.  With regard to the use of section 4(7), the Deputy will be well aware, as the author of the legislation in question, that the invocation of this section is not as straightforward as may appear at first light.  The Minister can make an Order only after having had regard to a number of specific issues in addition to the consequences for employment in RTE.  If I was to contemplate making an Order under the subsection, I believe that consideration of the issues specified in the <Col N="1227" /> subsection would of necessity have to be detailed and time consuming if my obligations under the legislation were to be met and if I am to be seen to be acting in an even-handed manner.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing concerns, it would be inappropriate for me to indicate whether I will exercise the powers in section 4(7) in the manner and circumstances suggested by the Deputy.  He will appreciate, I am sure, that to do so could be construed as an attempt on my part to interpret section 4(8) of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I believe that my Department is applying effective conservation measures, in accordance with the terms of the habitats directive, on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have made it clear that I am fully supportive of the fundamental objectives of the directive.  I am well aware that to lose substantial areas of our remaining natural areas would be a tragedy.  However, in applying the directive, we are not operating in a laboratory situation, or in a vacuum where what we do has no effect on real people.  We need to be extremely sensitive</P>
      <P>I make no apology that those who are affected by special area of conservation, SAC, designation are a major concern for me and for this Government. This approach requires that those who find their lands included in protected areas be given every chance to object, should they wish to do so, and to have their objections independently assessed.</P>
      <P>I was, therefore, not prepared to send a list of proposed SACs to the European Commission until all appeals had been fully considered by the independent board that will advise me in such cases.  For various reasons, among them the need to identify and appoint a suitable chairman who would command universal credibility, this board has not yet commenced work.  However, Mr. Michael Mills, who has already given sterling service to the State as its first Ombudsman, has agreed to chair this board, and its deliberations should begin soon.  I expect the consideration of appeals to take some months.</P>
      <P>Another factor which influenced my decision not to send a list of proposed SACs to Brussels was the fact that all elements of the SAC compensation scheme were not yet in place.  However, my colleague, Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture and Food, has recently announced an amended REP scheme which will provide generous payments to those with land in SACs, SPAs and NHAs, including commonages.  This now makes the implications of designation much clearer and allows people affected to objectively assess what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while my Department has not yet furnished a list of proposed SACs to Brussels, in accordance with the terms of the directive in practice we are already applying a very effective measure of protection to our proposed SAC sites. Over 200 proposed SAC sites, covering over 500,000 hectares, were published in March 1997 and since then they have enjoyed legal protection <Col N="1236" /> in full accordance with the terms of the habitats directive.  Indeed, my sending a list of proposed sites to the European Commission will make no immediate practical difference to the protection afforded to these sites.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I have every intention of completing our technical compliance with the habitats directive when the necessary elements are in place.  I expect this to happen within a relatively short period.</P>

      <P>As this question which relates to the Irish language has been put to me in English I will answer it in English even though I would prefer to answer such questions in Irish.</P>
      <P>My Department's Estimate for 1998 includes a total provision of £9.074 million for the promotion of the Irish language.  This provision includes grants-in-aid of £385,000 for the language and cultural section of Údarás na Gaeltachta and a grant-in-aid of £2.96 million for Bord na Gaeilge.  The provision also includes grants for social and cultural schemes £2.97 million and Ciste na Gaeilge, £2.759 million.  A total of £2.150 million of this expenditure relates to Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge which assists people, mainly from outside the Gaeltacht, to attend recognised Irish courses there.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate the amount which will be paid in any one year to community groups in the Gaeltacht and outside the Gaeltacht but the amount of expenditure is relatively small.  A sum of £2.759 million is provided in the Vote this year for Ciste na Gaeilge from which grants are paid to the voluntary Irish language organisations and in respect of miscellaneous Irish language projects which are in the main community based.</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta and Bord na Gaeilge, the statutory State boards with responsibilities in relation to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, also provide assistance to community groups involved in the promotion of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>In answering this question I assume the artefacts referred to are those in the care and custody of collecting institutions and bodies under the direct aegis of my Department and primarily those artefacts which are suitable to be on public display in the normal course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main institutions under my aegis which are involved as a key part of their activity in the public display of artefacts are the National Museum of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and each of these institutions hold collections of material in storage which are not available for public display. It is in the nature of these collecting institutions that it is neither appropriate nor possible to have <Col N="1238" /> all the artefacts in their collections on public display at all times.  In general, however, a significant proportion of the collections of these institutions, at any one time, would be available for some form of public viewing.</P>
    <P>The main collection still in storage in the National Museum is the Folklife collection although a selection of material is now on display at the National Museum's new premises at Collins Barracks and some objects are on display, on loan, in various county museums.  However, the development of a National Museum of Ireland Folklife Centre at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo will ensure that a much fuller range of this collection will be available for public viewing.  The geological collection of the National Museum is also in storage.  However, it is planned to mount exhibitions drawn from this collection in a new exhibition gallery for earth sciences in the plans for the next phase of development at Collins Barracks.  Much of the art and industrial collections of the museum are now on display at Collins Barracks.  Key artefacts from the museums antiquities division are usually on public display.  In relation to other artefacts held in storage selections are provided for public display from time to time as appropriate and as the theme of an exhibition requires.  For instance, artefacts from the ethnographical collection are currently being displayed as part of a Spice Islands exhibition.  In some cases reserve collections of the National Museum are also accessible to the public, particularly for the benefit of researchers. Viewing can be arranged by appointment.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, its collection is shown on a rotational basis with the bulk of it being available for public viewing at the gallery in Kilmainham or at other exhibitions around the country in accordance with the museum's policy for the regions.  Even those art works that are held in temporary storage can be made available to researchers by appointment.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the National Gallery's collections are also available for public viewing on a rotational basis.  Some exceptions are those works of art which may be undergoing conservation work at any given time or works which may be on loan to other galleries or institutions.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for heritage houses and smaller museums throughout the country.  The main source of public funds for heritage projects is the Heritage <Col N="1239" /> Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body. The council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage.  It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>While my Department is committed to the development of a local museum's policy this has not extended to date to funding such museums directly other than, occasionally, by the provision of capital funding on a once-off basis.  Such funding as is currently available to me in the museums sphere is earmarked for the collecting institutions under my direct aegis.  However, in the broader context of the relationship between these institutions and other museums there are a number of important indirect supports, such as the provision of curatorial advice and arrangements for long-term loans of heritage objects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Interdepartmental Committee on Immigration, Asylum and Related Issues.</P>
      <P>This committee reported in February.  The following is a summary of its recommendations:</P>
      <P>1.  An amnesty should not be granted to asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>2.  When the additional staff for processing asylum applications are in place, the majority of the staff should be allocated to dealing with applications already made but a sufficient number should be allocated to deal quickly with new applications so as to bring about a speedy and effective system for dealing with new applications while cutting the backlog.</P>
      <P>3.  All appropriate assistance should be given by the relevant public bodies to facilitate the integration into Irish society of persons recognised as refugees or given leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>4.  Repatriation, acknowledged by the UNHCR (among other bodies) as necessary in order to preserve the integrity of the asylum process, should, as far as possible, be on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>5.  Ireland should participate in the work of the International Organisation of Migration and in the Intergovernmental Consultations on Asylum, Refugee and Migration Policies in Europe, North America and Australia.</P>
      <P>6.  Ireland should conclude re-admission agreements with appropriate countries.</P>
      <P>7.  Legislation should be examined to see what changes might be possible to eliminate abuses of Irish citizenship law in regard to post-nuptial citizenship and the deliberate arrangement of births to non-national parents here.</P>
      <P>8.  New legislation should be brought forward on immigration matters which should cover visas and other pre-entry clearance systems, admission and refusal of admission, residence permits and the regulation of employment, long-term inward migration and a more straightforward system for removal of persons who have no permission to be in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> 9.  Legislation should be put in place to criminalise trafficking in illegal immigrants and to penalise persons who employ such immigrants.</P>
    <P>10.  When a new system of residence permits is in place, the providers of publicly funded services such as social welfare, health, education, employment training and accommodation should notify the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of applicants for these services who do not have the appropriate documentation.</P>
    <P>11.  The proposed new immigration legislation should make suitable provision to regulate the immigration of persons who do not need to come in contact with State services.</P>
    <P>12.  A comparative study between Irish legislation and that of EU partners should be carried out to ascertain what changes might be necessary to the Refugee Act to align Irish policy more closely with that of EU partners.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted these recommendations and agreed that the new legislation referred to should be brought forward on a priority basis.  Work is proceeding on this.</P>
    <P>The recommendation at 7 above will fall to be considered in the light of the outcome of the Agreement Reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations on 10 April and its implementation.</P>

      <P>Nil.  As the Deputy will be aware, additional staff have been appointed to my Department to deal with the backlog of asylum applications.  However there has been some delay in giving full effect to the procedures referred to by the Deputy as it was necessary to implement a full and comprehensive training programme for these new members.  Following this training, carried out by UNHCR and personnel from my Department, these staff are now operating in accordance with the procedures in question and I am satisfied that decisions will be made on a number of cases in the near future.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment given in its joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, the Government decided in December 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.  The tender procedure is being conducted in line with procedures set out in EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC.  The tender procedure notice for the project was published in <Col N="1244" /> the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday 21 January, 1998 and in the Irish media on the following day.  The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable primarily of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition.  They were also required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the project. The final date for receipt of candidatures was 5 March 1998.</P>
      <P>Invitation to tender documentation, including a comprehensive project brief, issued to nine qualified candidates on 26 March, inviting them to prepare full tender submissions for the project.  Such submissions will then be fully evaluated and it is hoped that the Government will be in a position to select a successful tender in the autumn.</P>

      <P>A total of 12 primary schools in County Donegal have been granted disadvantaged status under my Department's disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>To date, my Department has received applications from 115 other primary schools in County Donegal seeking inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Details of these schools are attached.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>The needs of schools in County Donegal will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Physical education facilities encompass indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields.  Virtually all schools have at least one element of these facilities.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post primary schools, including community schools.  PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 14 community schools which do not have a PE hall <Col N="1253" /> provided as part of the accommodation at the school.  However, a number of these schools are located adjacent to community sports centres and have rental arrangements in place for the use of the facilities.  The following community schools currently have PE halls in architectural planning, either as part of an extension-new school project or as a stand alone structure: Leixlip, Rathcoole, Killenarden, Palmerstown, Bayside, Clane, Moate, Celbridge, Lismore, Ferrybank.  In addition to this PE halls are currently under construction in Kilrush and Hospital community schools.</P>

      <P>The existing national school in Donabate sought a permanent extension to cope with increased pupil numbers.  My Department agreed to the provision of the major extension and advised the school accordingly. If an alternative solution is proposed by the school management, my Department will consider any such proposal when it is formulated and submitted.</P>

      <P>There are no plans in my Department at present for the provision of a second level school in the Donabate and Portrane area of County Dublin.  Pupils from this area mainly attend second level schools in Swords, Malahide, Sutton, and Balbriggan.  I am satisfied that the second level schools in these areas are catering adequately for current demand.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that substantial housing development is taking place and planned for Donabate and Portrane.  The implications of these developments for the primary schools in the area are currently being addressed in my Department.</P>
      <P>The situation in this area will be kept under review in the planning section of my Department. Should the need for the provision of additional second level facilities arise, a decision will be made on whether it can be met through the extension of existing second level schools in that general area, or through the provision of a school in Donabate-Portrane.</P>
