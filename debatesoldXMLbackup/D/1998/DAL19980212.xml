It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that business shall be interrupted at 11 a.m. to observe two minutes of silence for peace, and business shall resume thereafter; and that the following arrangement shall apply to No. 22 &mdash; the opening statements of the Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case, the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, Members may share time, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which will not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>As we may not have an opportunity to discuss this before events develop adversely, has the Taoiseach considered asking the British Presidency to convene a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EU to see if it could assist in finding a diplomatic solution to the events unfolding in and in relation to Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not asked for such a meeting but, as I said during the week, our position is that any decisions on this matter must be made by the Security Council and we have conveyed that position to the British Presidency through the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider it rather sad that at the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, on Monday 26 January, there was neither a Minister nor a Minister of State representing the Irish Government?  This is not a criticism of the people involved, who have a heavy workload in Northern Ireland.  Since the Government made a decision to assign additional responsibilities to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, would it not consider the lack of coverage of European issues caused by the allocation of responsibilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Rabbitte, the Whip of the Deputy's party, raised that matter last night and the Government Whip agreed to it.  I do not know whether the time has been agreed but it can be worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make time available to debate the Road Traffic Reduction Bill, 1998, given the huge concern about the level of traffic on our roads?  When will we debate the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill, given the widespread concern about genetically modified crops and the expression of concern by a member of the Food Safety Authority about trials by Monsanto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="195" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill is awaiting Second Stage.  The Road Traffic Reduction Bill is a Private Members' Bill so it will be taken in Private Members' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the position of the Equal Status Bill, which ran into constitutional difficulties?  Will he introduce a constitutional change to permit people with disabilities to enjoy the rights to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the criticism was that the two Bills were taken together. They will now be taken separately, which seems to be a satisfactory arrangement.  No constitutional amendment has been suggested but the all-party committee can look at it if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in saying the Supreme Court struck down those Bills on the grounds that it was an infringement on the rights of businesses to ask them to make reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities?  It is clearly the view of the House that provision should be made for making reasonable efforts to accommodate persons with disabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Government will endeavour to ensure the legislation is in line with the Constitution.  Any difficulty arising will have to be examined but we maintain that our legislation has got over the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When it was introduced it was suggested it was a matter of urgency to address colleges where students had been thrown out onto the street and their contracts broken.  These colleges will soon be advertising for the coming year and will parents and students be afforded any protection?  If, as the Taoiseach said, it is at an early stage of preparation what happened to the urgent need?  Will it appear before Easter or summer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I appeal to the Taoiseach to prioritise the Attachment of Earnings Bill, particularly in light of the figure cited in the House on Tuesday that 6,000 people were arrested and jailed last year for not paying fines or civil debts?  That required the time of 12,000 gardaí and the use of Garda patrol cars, taxis and so on.  Given that a simple, straightforward, pre-scriptive Bill would deal with this problem, will the Taoiseach promote this legislation from the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; category to the list for this term?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Taoiseach removed this brief from his Department and gave it to the Department of Agriculture and Food. When will the Western Development Bill come before the Dáil?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to bring the legislation governing the Central Bank of Ireland into conformity with certain provisions of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty on European Union and also with certain provisions contained in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank contained in Protocol No (3) to the Treaty establishing the European Communities. The provisions of the Bill are designed to cater for the streamlining of the independence of the Central Bank of Ireland along with its institutional integration into the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are a necessary part of our preparations for full participation in economic and monetary union.  The treaty lays down that, in assessing the fulfilment by member states of their obligations for achieving EMU, the European Commission and European Monetary Institute are to examine the compatibility between each member state's legislation, including the statutes of its national central bank, and the relevant provisions of the treaty and statute. In that respect, the compatibility of our central <Col N="203" /> banking legislation is additional to the more wellknown convergence criteria in the key areas of prices, the Government's financial position, the exchange rate and long-term interest rates.  The EMI and the Commission were consulted on the terms of this Bill and the response of both organisations to it has been generally positive.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the detail of the Bill, I will put the legislation in its proper context by reminding the House of not only the institutional aspects of EMU, with which this legislation is directly concerned, but also the timetable for EMU and the background.  The treaty envisages EMU being reached in three stages.</P>
    <P>Stage one involved the completion of the Single Market and closer co-ordination of economic policies of member states.  Stage two, which began on 1 January 1994, involved intensifying the co-ordination of member states' economic policies, based on multilateral surveillance within the context of broad guidelines laid down by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers or ECOFIN. Most importantly, stage two brought into operation the excessive deficit procedure set out in Article 104c of the treaty which requires an annual examination of each member state's budgetary performance to see if it meets the deficit rules laid down in the treaty, with the Council making a recommendation for ending the excessive deficit of any member state which does not meet them.  Ireland has never been the subject of such a recommendation.</P>
    <P>Stage two also saw the establishment of the EMI which is the forerunner of the European Central Bank and has, <i>inter alia</i>, the task of developing the regulatory, logistical and organisational framework for the ECB to perform its task, as well as assessing the readiness of member states for participation in the third stage.</P>
    <P>Stage three is the final stage of EMU and will begin on 1 January 1999.  On that date, the euro will become a currency in its own right and the conversion rates of the currencies of the participating member states will be irrevocably fixed.  At that stage the ECB will begin operating the single monetary policy in respect of the euro.</P>
    <P>The major part of the arrangements necessary for the transition to the single currency are now in place.  More recently, the Luxembourg European Council last December adopted a resolution setting out principles and arrangements for strengthened economic co-ordination among states sharing the single currency and between those states and other states not yet in a position to participate in the euro.</P>
    <P>The European Council also concluded that the organisation of an ongoing and fruitful dialogue between the Council and the European Central Bank, respecting the independence of the bank, is an important factor in the proper functioning of EMU.  I will deal later with the matter of dialogue with the ECB.</P>
    <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of EMU is to be made at the beginning <Col N="204" /> of May this year in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 109j of the treaty. The ECOFIN Council will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the EMI.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these reports, ECOFIN, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.  It is expected that the Commission and the EMI will produce their convergence reports on 25 March next, allowing time for the Council and the European Parliament to examine them in detail before their formal decisions.  The Government is anxious to facilitate a Dáil discussion of these convergence reports before the Easter recess.  The changes included in this Bill, which will make our legislation compatible with the treaty, need to be enacted in time to be taken on board by the Commission and the EMI when they are finalising their convergence reports.</P>
    <P>There will be a pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states during the first weekend of May this year once the decision is taken on which member states will adopt the euro.  These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and, in line with the treaty, the setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.</P>
    <P>As regards the Irish pound, as I have stated previously, the Government's intention is that Ireland will join EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the word and that the decision cannot be finalised until next May.  In the meantime, we will keep the issue under active review.  Obviously, therefore, the final decision will take account of all the elements, including inflation and overall competitiveness, which contribute to the balanced development of the economy.</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after the decision on the participating member states, the executive board of the ECB will be selected.  The president, vice-president and other members will be appointed by common accord of the Governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or Government on a recommendation from the Council and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council of the EMI.  Under the treaty the ECB will be formally established immediately after 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>While the euro will become a currency in its own right on 1 January 1999, euro notes and coins will not be introduced into circulation until 1 January 2002.  Legal tender status will have been withdrawn from national currencies at the latest by 1 July that year.</P>
    <P>The European System of Central Banks is one of the three core elements of the EMU, the other <Col N="205" /> two being the establishment of a single currency among participating member states and the intensified co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies among participating member states.</P>
    <P>Article 4a of the treaty provides for the establishment of a European System of Central Banks, ESCB, and for the ECB to act within the limits of the powers with which they are conferred by the treaty and the statute of the ESCB.  The primary objective of the ESCB, which will comprise the ECB and the national central banks of the member states, is to maintain price stability.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the treaty requires that the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Community.  These include the promotion of harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high level of employment and of social protection, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among member states.  In carrying out this function, the ESCB shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>The basic tasks of the ESCB will be to define and implement the single monetary policy; to conduct foreign exchange operations consistent with the provisions of the treaty in relation to exchange rate policy; to hold and manage the official foreign reserves of the member states and to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. Member states with a derogation, or which have exercised an opt-out, are excluded from the ESCB's monetary policy responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The ECB's independence is guaranteed by the Treaty.  When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the ECB nor national central banks may seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body.  Furthermore, the treaty provisions in relation to the governance of the ECB and the ESCB are designed to copperfasten that independence.</P>
    <P>The decision-making bodies of the ECB, which also govern the ESCB, are the executive board and the governing council.  The executive board must be appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the participating member states.  The members of the executive board will be appointed for eight-year terms &mdash; with some exceptions for the first round of appointments to ensure subsequent vacancies do not all arise at the same time, and appointments will not be renewable.  The governing council comprises the members of the executive board together with the governors of the national central banks of participating member states, whose independence in turn is guaranteed by the treaty provisions with which this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> This independence will ensure the ESCB focuses on its primary objective of price stability. This independence will generate confidence in the euro as a stable and secure currency.  It will also ensure that in deciding issues, the ECB will be guided by the interests of the Community as a whole, rather than being unduly influenced by the views of a particular member state.  This independence must be complemented by appropriate arrangements for accountability.  In that regard, the ECB must present an annual report on the activities of the ESCB to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission as well as to the European Council of Heads of State and Government.  The report must cover the monetary policy of the previous and the current year.  It will be presented by the ECB president to the Council and the European Parliament, who may hold a general debate on that basis.  The president of the ECB and the other members of the executive board may be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament, either on their own initiative or at the Parliament's request.</P>
    <P>Whatever arrangements are in place at national level, under which national central banks are accountable to national parliaments, will remain in place as long as they are not in conflict with the provisions of the treaty which guarantee their independence and that of the ECB.  In this respect, Deputies will be aware of the current position in Ireland whereby the governor of the Central Bank attends, if so requested, before a select committee of Dáil Éireann and furnishes to that committee such information as it may request, while having due regard to the independence of the bank.  This practice will continue, except that, in accordance with section 17 of the Bill before us, such attendance and provision of information shall now also have due regard to the provisions of the treaty.  These include the independence of the ECB and of the national central banks in relation to decisions taken on monetary policy issues.  In particular in making such decisions instructions are not sought or taken from outside bodies, including the parliaments or governments of the member states.  The governor will be constrained, for confidentiality purposes, in relation to the extent and type of information on ECB decisions which he or she may be entitled to make public.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, under current legislation, the governor is obliged to attend before a select committee of Dáil Éireann.  In practice, this was the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  As that committee has now essentially been replaced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I intend to introduce an amendment to section 17 on Committee Stage which will have the effect of ensuring the governor will be obliged to attend before a committee of the Oireachtas rather than a Dáil committee.</P>
    <P>As a European institution, the ECB's accountability is principally provided for by the provisions <Col N="207" /> I have outlined in relation to the European Parliament.  In addition, the treaty provides a framework for dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Ministers, which is of essential importance.  Any dialogue will respect the respective competencies of the Council and the ECB.</P>
    <P>The president of the Council of Ministers may participate in meetings of the ECB governing council and may submit motions for deliberation, although he or she has no vote.  In turn, the ECB president may attend Council meetings whenever the Council is discussing matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.  In addition, the economic and financial committee to be set up under Article 109c of the Treaty will provide regular opportunities for dialogue between central bankers and Department of Finance officials at senior level.  Members of that committee will be appointed by the member states, the Commission and the ECB.</P>
    <P>Before addressing some of the consequences of EMU for Ireland, I would like to make the following points.  First, the global economic environment is changing fast.  This process will continue, and would continue even if EMU had never been thought of.  Second, the formation of EMU will mark a substantial change in the economic environment of the Union as a whole.  This is true for all member states regardless of whether they join EMU.  In other words, continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for any member state: EMU will change things even for member states which do not join it.</P>
    <P>The effects which EMU are likely to have for the Irish economy were analysed in detail in the ESRI study The Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU published in July 1996.  The ESRI report concluded that EMU participation by Ireland would yield a net benefit to the Irish economy, even if the UK remained outside the euro zone, estimated at 0.4 per cent of GNP on an annual average basis over the medium-term. This conclusion was also endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in a report European Union: Integration and Enlargement which was published in March last year.</P>
    <P>The principal benefit of EMU participation by Ireland identified in the ESRI report was the prospect of a lower trend in the level of interest rates for Ireland within the single currency area. The ESRI report also examined potential but unquantifiable effects of EMU participation.  It concluded that some of these, such as the increased attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment, could be substantially positive and hence strengthened the case for Ireland's participation in EMU.</P>
    <P>I stress that when the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, it did so without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union.  Ireland at present meets all the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty for qualification for EMU.  More generally, <Col N="208" /> Ireland is in a strong position for participation in the third stage of EMU.  There has been enhanced integration of the Irish economy with the continental EU countries generally over the past two decades, a trend that should continue to be reinforced as the full potential of the European single currency is realised.  Irish-based firms can continue to exploit new opportunities for market and product diversification in the euro zone.</P>
    <P>Ireland's capacity to participate successfully in EMU is also supported by our strong convergence performance over recent years, including growth in <i>per capita</i> income levels relative to the EU average, strong growth in employment and the reduction of unemployment, while maintaining low inflation and low budget deficits and achieving continued reductions in the debt ratio.</P>
    <P>The launch of the euro presents us with an historic opportunity to build on the economic and social progress we have achieved in recent years by promoting accelerated economic convergence and integration of the Irish economy with our EU partners.  According to the autumn economic forecasts published by the EU Commission on 14 October 1997, the Commission view is that a majority of member states should be capable of meeting the necessary conditions to participate in the euro from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Enhanced internal flexibility of the economy has a crucial role to play in underpinning Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU. This applies equally to those sectors of the economy likely to benefit from the expected lower trend in interest rates in EMU, but also likely to be sheltered from the direct impact of any competitiveness shock that may occur.  A key concern of many Irish firms is that sterling might be volatile against the euro.  That part of Irish industry which may be especially exposed in the event of such an occurrence must prepare appropriately for it.  Potential problems would exist not only for those companies which are largely dependent on UK markets but also for those who are in competition in the Irish market with UK producers and those who are competing with UK producers in the markets of third countries.</P>
    <P>Clearly the sterling issue is important but we must be careful not to overstate its importance. When we talk about a sterling shock we are talking about a sharp fall from its equilibrium level. Sterling is currently well above what most commentators, including the Bank of England, consider to be its equilibrium level.  At present, therefore, sterling would have to fall a long way before it could be considered to represent an economic shock.  Private sector preparation for possible shocks in an EMU scenario is, like all issues of competitiveness in the market place, primarily a matter for the individual companies.  The most obvious measures to concentrate on are to maintain as much flexibility as possible in their cost base and to take steps to minimise their exposure to sterling, for example by examining their <Col N="209" /> sources of supply and their opportunities for hedging.</P>
    <P>We have seen over recent years how policies designed for EMU qualification have helped secure our exceptional economic performance. The challenge presented to us from 1 January 1999 is to ensure the best return for the economy and for employment from our membership of the euro zone and to deliver on the Government's commitment in its Action Programme for the Millennium to share the benefits of Ireland's EMU participation among all sectors of the workforce. It will be evident that costs associated with the changeover to the euro, and their timing, will vary from company to company according to various factors, including the nature of the company's business.  A reliable estimate of such costs is not available.  It will be in companies' own interests to minimise such costs by appropriate planning and by making changes arising from the changeover in conjunction with other changes which would arise in the normal course anyway. It should be borne in mind in this context that EMU should bring significant benefits to companies. Furthermore, such benefits will be ongoing, while of their nature changeover costs will be once-off.</P>
    <P>The Government believes EMU will begin on time and Ireland will be a member from the outset. Ireland has always supported the process of European integration and EMU will be a substantial step in that process.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provision of the Bill which, as I have previously explained, we must introduce to comply with our treaty obligations. Indeed, to participate in the ESCB or the ECB, other member states are involved in similar legislative exercises.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the Short Title, construction and commencement provisions.  While these do not normally require special attention, the commencement provision in section 1(3) allows the Minster for Finance to commence any provision or part thereof on any day.  This is necessary in that, as decisions are taken at EU level, each of the relevant provisions of this Bill can be commenced at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is an interpretative section which defines certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 is a technical provision which amends section 5 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, by providing that the exercise and performance of the duties of the Central Bank of Ireland shall be subject to the provisions in the new section 5A of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which shall be inserted by section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 inserts a new section 5A in the Central Bank Act, 1942, and provides that the Central Bank of Ireland shall perform any functional duty or exercise any power required by, or under, the provisions of the treaty or the statute.  The section also provides that sole authority and responsibility of the ESCB-ECB tasks and duties in Ireland should rest with the Governor of the Central <Col N="210" /> Bank.  This is a significant change and I wish to explain it.</P>
    <P>As I explained earlier, the EMI was consulted on the terms of the Bill and it was a concern raised by the institute that has led me to propose a change in the policy concerning the voting rights of directors of the Central Bank in relation to ESCB-ECB issues.  In previous reports by the EMI on the computability of all member states' legislation with the obligation of Central Bank independence, it had been indicated that the presence of the Secretary General of my Department on the board of the Central Bank of Ireland with a right to vote on ESCB or ECB related issues was incompatible with such independence. Accordingly, I had originally intended that the Secretary General would not be empowered to vote on these issues.</P>
    <P>However, during consultation, the EMI went further by stating that no part time director should have a vote on ESCB or ECB issues because of the danger of a potential conflict of interest.  Removing voting rights in this area from the part-time directors would effectively leave the Governor as the only board member with a vote. To maintain voting in such circumstances would not make sense.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that sole authority in ESCB or ECB related issues should be vested in the Governor. It should be emphasised that this involves input by the Irish Governor to discussions at the European Central Bank, where the actual policy decisions will be taken.  The EMI and the Commission both favour this approach.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that the Governor shall keep the board informed of, and may discuss with it, the discharge by him of these ESCB or ECB powers, tasks and duties.  Provision is also made that, in instances where the office of Governor becomes vacant or the Governor is unable, for any reason and for whatever length of time, to discharge the ESCB or ECB related powers, tasks and duties imposed on him by the section and the authority and responsibility for their discharge shall become vested, for the period of such vacancy or inability, in the Director General of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Governor's new role, as set out in the section, will only apply to the bank's activities within the ESCB.  The board of the bank will continue to operate with exactly the same voting rights as it has at present regarding all its other, non-ESCB, activities such as the supervision of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the general functions and duties of the bank and its independence in the discharge of its functions as set out in section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942.  Under Section 6, the bank is given a role independent of the Government in the discharge of its general functions and duties.  Article 10f of the treaty provides that the primary objective of the ESCB shall be price stability.  Section 6(1) of the 1942 Act is being amended to unambiguously reflect this primary objective.  The opportunity is also being taken to specify the Central Bank's other main objectives, <Col N="211" /> given the expansion in its responsibilities since 1942.</P>
    <P>Article 107 of the treaty provides that, when exercising ESCB/ECB-related tasks, members of national central bank decision-making bodies shall not seek or take instructions from any outside organisation, whether governmental or otherwise.  Article 107 also contains a declaration by the treaty signatories, namely the member state Governments, that they will not attempt to influence decision makers in national central banks.  Section 6(2) of the 1942 Act, however, allows the Minister for Finance to request the bank to &ldquo;consult and advise with him&rdquo; in regard to the execution and performance by the bank of its general function and duty and the bank must comply with every such request.</P>
    <P>As far I know, the powers in section 6(2) have never been formally invoked.  However, it is not unusual in practice, and indeed necessary to the proper administration of public policy, for the Minister and the Department, on his behalf, to request the governor and the bank to consult in the day to day operation of monetary, exchange rate and financial policies.  This liaison has always been forthcoming.  However, the wording of section 6(2) as it stands, particularly the requirement to &ldquo;consult&rdquo; in relation to monetary policy, runs counter to the requirements in Article 107 of the treaty.  A requirement for the bank to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; is, however, acceptable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I propose to replace this section with a provision which allows the Minister to continue to require the bank to consult with him on the execution and performance of all its tasks with the exception of those related to the duties conferred on it by the treaty.  In such cases the bank shall only be obliged to keep the Minister informed.  The amendments will not affect the right of the Minister to seek information and advice from the bank and it is not envisaged that there should be any change of substance in existing practice.  The exercise of the Minister's right will be a matter for sensible and prudent judgment so not to overstep the line laid down by Article 107 of the treaty.  There is no reason whatever to believe that the bank will not act in an entirely reasonable manner in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends section 7 of the 1942 Act, as substituted by section 21 of the 1997 Act, which sets out certain specific powers of the bank.  The section confirms that the bank can participate in the ESCB, by contributing assets or liabilities to the ECB, and pooling its monetary income with the ESCB generally in accordance with the treaty; and also that it can perform any function necessary to give effect to the obligations imposed on it by the treaty and the statute.</P>
    <P>Section 21(2) of the Central Bank Act, 1942, provides that the President may, on the advice of the Government, remove the governor from office for cause stated if the directors of the Central Bank, by unanimous vote, ask the President to do so.  Article 14 of the statute of the ESCB <Col N="212" /> and ECB requires that the Governor may only be removed in such cases if he has been guilty of &ldquo;serious misconduct&rdquo; and provides that the Governor may appeal to the Court of Justice.  The wording of section 21(2) is being amended to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the treaty.  Accordingly, it is proposed in section 7 to amend the section by substituting the words &ldquo;on stated grounds of serious misconduct&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;cause stated&rdquo;.  The section also provides for the right of appeal afforded in Article 14(2) of the statute to the Court of Justice by the Governor against a dismissal.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the statute provides for the European Central Bank to collect statistical information from economic agents either directly or through the national central banks.  Section 8 extends the scope of section 18 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, which places an obligation on certain defined institutions in the State, for example, credit institutions and financial intermediaries, to provide information and returns to the Central Bank, to include &ldquo;reporting agents designated by the European Central Bank&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows the Central Bank to require institutions in the State to hold special deposits, observe certain liquidity ratios, etc. , on behalf of the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 19 of the statute of the ESCB/ECB.  The Central Bank already has both of the powers referred to in sections 8 and 9 in the case of banks for the purposes of domestic monetary policy, but these may have to be extended to other institutions to allow the bank facilitate the ECB's monetary policy operations.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, as amended by the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Central Bank Act, 1997, to provide for the disclosure by the Central Bank of information to the European Central Bank and to any auditor appointed by the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 27 of the statute.  The section also provides for technical amendments to section 16 consequent on amendments to section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the accounts of the Central Bank of Ireland may, in addition to being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, be audited by independent auditors appointed by the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 27 of the statute.</P>
    <P>Section 12 amends section 23 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which deals with the general fund of the Central Bank of Ireland, to cater for the bank's participation in the European System of Central Banks by providing for the pooling of the bank's monetary income as well as for accounting regulations.  The section also adapts the Minister's power under section 23 to regulate the periodical determination and distribution of the Central Bank of Ireland's surplus income by requiring him to pay due regard to the powers, tasks and duties conferred on the Central Bank of Ireland by or under the treaty or the statute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> Section 13 deletes section 24(2) and (3) of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which give the Minister for Finance powers in relation to the exchange rate of the IR£ and require any exercise of those powers to be made public.  Once Ireland joins the single currency, the exchange rate of the IR£ <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro will be irrevocably fixed in accordance with the treaty and subsections (2) and (3) can no longer apply.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 5 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to accommodate the fact that Article 105a(2) of the treaty provides that the issuance of coins is subject to the approval by the European Central Bank of the volume of issue.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends section 44 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, as inserted by section 120 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to remove the specific conditions in that section for the issuance of notes in order to allow for the issuance of euro notes authorised by the European Central Bank under uniform conditions in the euro area.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends section 118 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to accommodate the fact that Article 105a(1) of the treaty gives the European Central Bank the exclusive competence to authorise the issue of banknotes from 1 January 1999 and to include notes so authorised which are issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.  It also provides that banknotes issued by the European Central Bank will have the status of legal tender, again in accordance with Article 105a(1) of the treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Central Bank Act, 1997, provides for the attendance by the Governor of the Central Bank, if so requested, before a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann and the furnishing to that committee of such information as it may request while having due regard to the independence of the bank.  This provision is being amended by section 17 to be consistent with Article 107 of the treaty by providing that such attendance and provision of information shall also have due regard to the provisions of the treaty.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, prohibit the Governor of the Central Bank from being a director of or holding shares in a licensed bank.  Section 26 of the Central Bank Act, 1997, extended this prohibition to cover all commercial credit and financial institutions.  The purpose of section 26 is to avoid a conflict of interest involving the Governor in view of the bank's new role in supervising a wide range of financial institutions under recent legislation. This prohibition, however, does not apply to the Governor being a member of the European Monetary Institute.  Section 18 extends this exemption to the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 19 substitutes a new section for section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which empowers the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, to direct that certain business transactions be suspended if he considers it necessary &ldquo;in the national interest or for the purpose of safeguarding the currency <Col N="214" /> of the State&rdquo;.  The new section recognises the competence of the European System of Central Banks in the field of monetary policy and the transfer to Community level of all monetary powers of member states participating in economic and monetary union by deleting the reference to the Minister in exercising this power, having regard to &ldquo;the safeguarding of the currency of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the provisions of the Bill are necessary in order to fulfil our treaty obligations. They are, to a large extent, technical in nature and have been prepared in consultation with the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission.  I wish to inform the House that I will be introducing a further provision at Committee Stage relating to the superannuation provisions of the bank.  This is not related to EMU in any way, but I am advised that the measure, which provides for the introduction of a funded pension scheme, is desirable and the Bill gives us an opportunity to make the necessary arrangements. The technical drafting had not been completed when the Bill was published and I decided to go ahead with publication so that Deputies would have the greatest possible time to consider the primary provisions of the Bill.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the Bill, which is essentially technical, in great detail and that is of assistance to all Members in understanding its provisions.  He set the legislation in the wider context of entry into EMU and I thank him for that also.  Fine Gael will support the Bill on Second Stage and will subject it to the usual scrutiny on Committee Stage.  I presume the Minister intends to refer it to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and, if time is made available, this side will be co-operative in terms of examining the need to table amendments. Fine Gael's position on the Bill and EMU entry is clear.  We support entry and continue to do so despite the nervousness of independent commentators who become more strident as we approach the decision-making date in May.  Many respected economists are now casting doubt on the wisdom of EMU entry, which they are entitled to do.  It is being claimed that the decisions to enter EMU are being made on political rather than economic grounds.  There seems to be an undercurrent of criticism that this is the wrong way to behave in a democracy, and that in matters of such fiscal importance economists should make the decisions for politicians to follow. That is not how I see this, and it is not how the EU has grown over the last 30 years.  We must take cognisance of the views of the professionals, but in this, as in other matters, the decision is taken by the appropriate politicians and by Parliament on the advice of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing unusual about this in European affairs.  All the great decisions taken on the way to bringing us to the verge of real European union have been driven by politics.  Those <Col N="215" /> decisions have united a community of States in ways we would not have thought possible even ten years ago.  Considerations of security have driven many of those decisions in continental Europe.  The original coal and steel treaties were conceived to prevent France and Germany fighting about the sinews of war: power, coal and steel. A political and security agenda drove those decisions, so we should make no apology if that agenda is driving decisions now.</P>
    <P>That is why, regardless of the views of 150 German professors of economics, Chancellor Kohl will continue to drive towards EMU.  We should remember that, until the end of the Second World War, a united Germany was always a central European power.  When the Berlin Wall fell there was a possibility that Germany would revert to its historic role of central European power, with many of its interests to the east and south. This would have weakened the Franco-German axis which has driven the EU forward.</P>
    <P>When the European Community began, it was thought important to ensure the economies of France and Germany were inextricably linked to ensure they could not afford to fight.  The same agenda is being followed now.  It is inconceivable that the nations of Europe will go to war if their economies are inextricably linked by a common currency.  It would be ridiculous to consider that happening, but it would not have been ridiculous in our fathers' time.  Conventional wisdom now holds that peace will last forever, but the Balkan situation, and Bosnia in particular, shook many people.  Modern economies, with beautiful cities, high-rise buildings and dual carriageways, were ravaged by war in the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>We take account of commentators' opinions, but the reason for monetary union is the same reason for all the great European initiatives: it relates to politics and the security agenda.  It would be foolish to pretend there is no economic dimension, because there is.  The effects of this decision will be felt in business and in people's economic lives.  However, the primary spur has been political.</P>
    <P>This is true in Ireland also.  Breaking with sterling in 1979 was not the wisest decision, but there was a strong political feeling that while we had achieved political independence in 1922, and some economic independence after entering the EEC in 1973, we would advance our economic and democratic independence by having a separate currency.  That motivation underpinned much of the debates on the matter at the time, and that agenda still exists in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  It is also being driven by a strong political trend common to all parties: practically every party is pro-Europe.  Almost any major decision taken in Europe will be dealt with sympathetically in the Dáil by all parties.  We are more inclined to go with such decisions than to go against them.  There is no well-developed, respectable body of political opinion which would oppose reasonable European proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> To criticise EMU entry on the grounds that it is a political decision made by politicians, as if political and security considerations were trivial compared to economic considerations, is to misunderstand the development of Europe and our participation in that development.  It shows no understanding of how the Franco-German axis has operated for 30 years to drive the European ideal forward.  When the history of this period is written, it is clear that the movement from the Treaty of Rome through Maastricht to the Amsterdam Treaty will be shown as one of the main advances in Europe in the second half of the 20th century.  It is the most interesting thing to happen in Europe in a millennium, and it appears that the movement is forward.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister.  The Fine Gael position is clear.  We are pro-Europe, pro-EMU and we support the Bill, though we have some difficulties with its details.  We are going in; it is inevitable. Ten other nations will go in from 1 January 1999, and it is certain that this will happen.  Those pulling on the coattails of the decision makers will not slow the process down.  The timetable has been set out, detailing paper transactions from 1 January 1999 and the dissemination of notes and coins in 2002.  That will happen, and the message has to be given to business and the professions. They will have to be ready and to advise their clients.  If people think this is a dream from which they will wake without having to make preparatory arrangements or structural changes necessary, they are in for a very rude awakening.</P>
    <P>Major changes will happen very quickly when we enter.  It is a feature of modern life that one does not have an overview; people tend to follow particular issues without cross-referencing them to other movements.  EMU or a common currency will not cause profound change.  Those two factors combined with the progress in information technology which will cause profound changes.  In circumstances in which money can be transferred by pressing a key on a keyboard, rates for products can be quoted across Europe on a screen and electronic mail can link everybody in Europe for the price of a local call, the combination of a common currency and the huge advances in information technology will bring about profound changes in the way we do business and relate to our fellow citizens in Europe. It is the convergence of the two that will create the significant dynamic, not merely the decision to enter the currency.</P>
    <P>Once we have joined and the major changes take place, the decision will be irreversible. People who are not enthusiastic about the euro tend to think it will happen, but that during the first decade of the next millennium people will realise it is a bad idea and walk away as if it were an overnight card game where one could throw in one's hand and walk away from the table.  That will not be the case.  The changes will be profound and the perceived benefits for ordinary citizens will be so great that once it happens and the public experience it, the decision will be irreversible. <Col N="217" /> A common currency will make trade between the 11 countries of the EU much easier.  It will also make travel abroad much easier.  In 2004, when people have got used to using the euro as they travel around Europe to soccer matches and so on, they will not want to go back to the old days of changing currency every time they travel to a different country.  Once the business world gets used to the ease of making transactions in one currency, it will be not be possible to reverse the decision.</P>
    <P>Those who believe this will not happen are wrong.  It will happen.  Those who believe it will happen, but that it can be accommodated in the business world without making major changes, are also wrong.  There will be profound changes and businesses must get ready.  While the major multinationals that operate here are well aware of this, many small Irish businesses and some of the professions are not taking the necessary steps to prepare for EMU.  Once we have joined, the decision will be irreversible and it will change our lives profoundly.</P>
    <P>It would be easier if the UK also joined.  I do not know whether it will try to exploit the advantage of being outside the group and improve its terms of trade by playing the market and getting a competitive advantage by the way it deals with its currency policy or whether it will quickly adopt a tracking mechanism, give us the stability we all hope it will and, in effect, be a surrogate member waiting to enter at the start of the next millennium.  I hope the latter is the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's advice that Irish businesses should be prudent about controlling their cost base and source supplies outside the United Kingdom if that is where their suppliers are located.  The risk for Irish companies would be diminished if their supplies were sourced in countries inside rather than outside the club.  The Minister's advice on hedging is also very prudent. It would be more prudent, however, if he had indicated the rate at which we will log into the system.  It is very difficult to advise people to hedge if they have no idea of the value of the currency until the first weekend in May.  How can people make a decision on hedging when they do not know whether it will be £2.41 to the deutschmark at the central rate or higher?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will tell us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>While that advice is sound, it is not advice on which anybody can act until the Minister indicates the rate at which we will log in. Otherwise, his advice does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill emphasises that the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks will be independent and it is important that they should be.  We have seen the benefits across Europe of cutting the political links with central banks.  We have seen the benefits to Germany of the independence of the Bundesbank and the <Col N="218" /> benefits to the Irish economy of the independence of the Central Bank.  I am pleased the UK has decided to cut links with the Exchequer and make the Bank of England independent under statute.  That is the way of the world.  Traditionally, the record of politicians in managing currencies and setting interest rates for political reasons has not been great.  Any Minister introducing a Bill such as this would have to ensure the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks are independent.</P>
    <P>The issue of accountability, however, arises.  It is obvious from the Minister's speech and from the Bill that those who conceived the EMU, the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks are not happy with the accountability that will exist.  If one were happy with the system of accountability one would not need to adopt a belt and braces approach where four or five different groups are involved in the reporting system.  The annual report must go to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Council of the Heads of State.  It cannot go to national parliaments, but there is some provision for the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before a committee of the Oireachtas.  There is a great deal of notional accountability, but no real accountability.  That will prove difficult for small countries such as ours.  The provisions of the Bill are technical in nature and we will have time to scrutinise them later.</P>
    <P>How are we positioned if there is an asymmetric shock in the economy?  That is a key policy issue for the Minister, but he has given no indication that he or any section in his Department have thought strategically about this.  If there is a shock to the Irish economy the ECB and the ESCB are mandated to be independent, to maintain price stability and sustainable low inflation growth across the Community.  In particular, their considerations must be Community-wide, and not in the interests of an individual economy.  If there is a shock in the Irish market, the mechanisms being put in place &mdash; which are reinforced by the independence given to the ECB and the ESCB &mdash; will make those bodies very remote from political and public opinion in Ireland and unresponsive to any difficulties we might experience.</P>
    <P>This problem will be magnified by the fact that two of the main instruments of policy which a Minister for Finance traditionally had are being removed as a result of the decision to join EMU, the power to manage a currency in consultation with the Central Bank and the power to fix exchange rates.  These powers will no longer be vested domestically.  The stabilisation arrangement makes it mandatory on Ministers for Finance to introduce balanced or surplus budgets in normal circumstances and, in the event of an asymmetric shock, allows only a deficit of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The combination of the independence of the ECB and the ESCB, their remoteness from the normal life of Irish citizens, the fact that major <Col N="219" /> decisions will be made abroad instead of domestically and that Ministers for Finance will not be able to adopt Keynesian-type economics to drive demand forward by borrowing, except in a very limited manner, could cause major problems. One might ask what is an asymmetric shock.  If the war in the Gulf goes ahead it might affect oil prices, but that would be on a Europe-wide basis. I am not talking about a European shock.  If the whole economy of Europe gets a shock the institutions will be sufficiently responsible enough to deal with it.  The difficulty arises where things are going well for the UK and our other neighbours and something happens here which we cannot accommodate.  The deafness claims by the Irish Army is an example.  Suppose a tribunal is set up and over two or three years the drawdown is £2.5 billion or £3 billion.  That is a shock which would be difficult to accommodate within the terms of the stabilisation pact.  It would be difficult to have a balanced budget or to run surpluses in the event of such a shock and it would be difficult to accommodate it within plus 3 per cent in deficit.</P>
    <P>There are other examples.  For example a very bad winter or a bad spring or summer could diminish agricultural production to the point where it would have an impact on the wider economy.  One can conceive of situations where a Minister for Finance, in the medium to long term, would be bereft of the economic tools to manage the economy and could find an independent European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks remote and totally unresponsive to the needs of Irish citizens in our small economy.  That issue has to be dealt with.  There is no sign of strategic thinking.  It is not enough to advocate that businesses should be conscious of risk and should strive for flexibility on their base costs.  It is difficult to have flexibility on base costs if pay-roll costs are a major element of the cost base.  The cards have to be put on the table.  There will have to be serious discussions with the social partners on how to maintain flexibility, particularly in the labour market, and on cost base if a shock hits this economy.  How will it be managed?  What strategies are in place?  What are people around the table willing to do where the social partners meet to cope with an asymmetric shock in the economy?</P>
    <P>Social partnership has served the country extremely well.  Much of that is due to the trade union side rather than the employer side.  The trade union movement modernised and exceeded the British models and looked at what was happening in continental Europe.  It quickly adopted a social partnership and adapted the views of its members to it.  They have been a force for great growth in the economy.  I pay tribute to trade union leaders and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the manner in which they have helped to build the social partnership.  The employers' side have been more reactive than proactive in the manner in which they have dealt with social <Col N="220" /> partnership.  It is time those who represent employers came to the social partnership table with more creative ideas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the possibility of offering incentives to employers to pay their workers extra in good times while extra payments should not be mandatory in bad times.  If the Finance Bill were to be amended to give power to companies in the private sector to give, say, 0.5 per cent of pay-roll tax free under certain conditions &mdash; it should not all go to the directors &mdash; it should be mandatory to spread it over at least one-third or 50 per cent of the workforce.  That would give flexibility.  When a company was doing well bonuses would be paid and it would offer incentives to production.  If a company was doing badly it would allow for a company to pull back on its cost base without upsetting binding agreements on pay and conditions made with human resource departments and the representative trade union.  The Minister will have to think on those lines and put ideas on the table for the social partners.  Following from that the share options will have to be rerun.  There is difficulty with share options in Ireland because there are not enough publicly quoted companies to make it interesting for many workers.  Incentives will have to be offered to employers to provide cash bonuses tax free to employees.  There is some merit in examining how that would work.  I am suggesting it as a concept without having worked out the details.</P>
    <P>Another issue arises from this Bill.  The Central Bank has a fairly large reserve fund.  All the reserves in the Central Bank will not be necessary to underpin the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks and there will be a fairly extensive residual reserve available in Ireland.  Under the arrangements made, all the partners in Europe will have a say on what happens to reserves but there could be a domestic input as well.  One obvious thing would be to reduce the debt.  An alternative would be to hold it back for the prospect of reductions in Cohesion and Structural Funds so that a fund is available to keep the Cohesion and Structural Funds running at about the existing level beyond 2003. When the haul back takes place in Europe there will be a system whereby we can supplement. Another alternative &mdash; perhaps the Minister will advise whether it is legally possible &mdash; would be to hold it back as a reserve fund for the asymmetric shock.  The figure may be £1 billion or more and perhaps the Minister will give the exact figure. When the arrangements the Minister is legislating to put in place are completed in excess of £1 billion or more may be available.  If in bad times we could run a debt of up to 3 per cent and if a reserve was available to stimulate the economy by investing in capital programmes this would restore some of the flexibility.  I am not making political points.  I see a difficulty and I am encouraging the Minister to think strategically. This is not a situation where the Minister can say all this is useless, that it is all gone to Europe, <Col N="221" /> that we are only carrying messages around the country on instruction from Brussels.  It is not like that.  There are still domestic options which would be of benefit and which would prepare the country for the asymmetric shocks which are inevitable.</P>
    <P>In the United States there is a common currency. The dollar goes from coast to coast but fairly extensive federal budgets are combined with individual state budgets.  They have built in a system of self-correcting mechanisms.  When the GDP of California goes down in bad times &mdash; when the frost destroys the grapes &mdash; the federal budget automatically goes up.  There is a self-correcting mechanism between the federal budget and the individual state budget.  In its totality it is probably not more than the shock one would get on the demand side from being able to run deficits of 3 per cent.  It is worth exploring with his European colleagues at ECOFIN the possibility of the self-correcting mechanism if the asymmetric shock hits in Ireland.  Apart from permission to increase the deficit to 3 per cent it is possible to transfer European money to an economy or a region in shock.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to that issue in this reply.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy that the Minister has not told us today at what rate we will lock into the euro.  The Minister is tied in to his own rhetoric at this stage. We do not mind the Minister coming in and saying this was a mistake, that he has changed his mind.  We will not rub it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted by Deputy Noonan's musings and treatise on the history of the last half century of Europe to do the same but we would be here for some time if I did.  I agree with him that this is primarily a political project.  The European Union is and always has been a political project.  Political and-or economic nationalism is responsible for most of the woes of the 20th century in Europe.  It has condemned large numbers of citizens to poverty and caused wars in which huge numbers of people died.  Our experiment with protectionism in the 1950s and 1960s was a clear failure.  We are still suffering the consequences of political nationalism which tends to express itself more in what one does not like rather than what one likes.  There is nothing wrong with looking out for ourselves, economically or politically, but there is no reason we should do so at the expense of others &mdash; the traditional argument about the zero sum game.  If I was to say anything about the priorities of the present generation of European politicians, it would be that we should consign that variety of <Col N="222" /> political and economic nationalism to the dustbin of 20th century history.</P>
      <P>In many ways, this is a technical Bill but important nonetheless.  As the Minister indicated, we have little discretion in relation to its detailed provisions.  I acknowledge that, in most cases, they directly reflect the provisions of the Third Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty and understand that the Minister and his officials have agreed them with the EMI.  Nonetheless, this debate gives us an opportunity to look at some aspects of the operation of the Central Bank, to reflect on the nature of the European Central Bank and the system of central banks and its relationship with ECOFIN, and where we now stand on EMU.</P>
      <P>The central purpose of the Bill is to bring the legislative basis for the operation of the Central Bank into line with what is required by EMU. This is normally taken to mean that we must establish the Central Bank as a genuinely independent central bank.  We have been informed that the ECB will be a genuine, free standing, independent central bank.  The Central Bank must be placed in the same position.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Noonan, I find the arguments adduced for independent central banks worrying. The argument is usually made by bankers, economists or self-styled experts on management of the economy &mdash; the subtext is clear &mdash; that politicians are meddlers and should not be allowed to interfere in important issues such as setting interest rates or currency related matters and cannot be trusted to manage the economy in a way that would guarantee low inflation.  It is usually said in measured terms that these economic fundamentals are so important that they can only be left to experts.  After all, politicians cannot be trusted to make a decision which is right in the medium term, if a short-term option appears to be more palatable.  The usual example given in cases of this kind is setting interest rates.</P>
      <P>This argument may have some validity but it is fundamentally undemocratic.  There are dangers in this thinking, not alone for Ireland but for the future of the European Union as a whole.  The European Union is already seen as being remote and unaccountable by many of its citizens.  By putting in place a European Central Bank with enormous power and no accountability we are running some serious risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been upheaval in France where direct action has been taken by unemployed people and their representatives. Last week in Germany there were public demonstrations by unemployed people for the first time in many decades.  I am reasonably familiar with the way things operate in Germany and we should be careful not to underestimate the importance of what is happening there for the future of the European Union.  The unemployment figure is heading towards five million and economic growth is still sluggish.  Many Germans are being forced to consider, some for the first time, the basic tenets of post-war stability, growth <Col N="223" /> and prosperity.  Inevitably, this is causing upheaval and disquiet, not least among the unemployed. The likelihood is that the first and primary loser will be Chancellor Kohl's Government when the German people deliver their verdict later this year.</P>
    <P>We should be aware that there are real threats to the European Union from what is happening in Germany.  There have been indications in recent years that many Germans are becoming less enamoured of the European Union.  Specifically, they are becoming much less amenable to financing the European Union in circumstances where they are in some difficulty in financing themselves. Many Germans regard the Deutschmark as one of the building blocks of German prosperity. Opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of the German public is reluctant, to say the least, to abandon the Deutschmark.</P>
    <P>Other European countries, not least the Mediterranean countries, have endured serious economic trauma to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria. Italy, for example, has had to review its welfare provision, sell off large parts of the state sector and cut back significantly on some services. Much of this has been painful and many individual citizens of Italy, and the European Union, blame monetary union and the euro for this.</P>
    <P>Many Europeans have already made big sacrifices to facilitate monetary union.  There are some signs of anti-European Union and euro feeling in some of the bigger countries and there is every possibility that this will reflect itself when decisions come to be taken on the Amsterdam Treaty in a few months' time.  In that context, it is important that the institutions of the European Union are in a position to be responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens.  In that context, an ECB constituted as a largely unresponsive institution presents a serious problem.</P>
    <P>This argument, as the Minister is aware, has been articulated by others at European Councils in recent years.  Our French and Swedish colleagues in particular have been exercised by this issue and the need, as they see it, for a meaningful channel of consultation and communication between the Council of Ministers, ECOFIN in particular, and the ECB.  It is enormously important that there should be an effective channel of communication.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain and interpret the decisions of the Luxembourg Council which he quoted?  He said that the organisation of an ongoing and fruitful dialogue between the Council and the European Central Bank, respecting the independence of the bank, is an important factor in the proper functioning of EMU.  ECOFIN is restyling itself and will in future be at the centre of economic co-ordination.</P>
    <P>These are fine and, to some extent, reassuring words but what do they mean?  Is it intended that a representative of the ECB will attend ECOFIN meetings in the normal course?  Is it intended that there will be a consultative or information process <Col N="224" /> before important decisions are taken by the board of the ECB?  If it is intended to raise or lower interest rates, will ECOFIN be informed in advance?  Will its views be sought?  What role will it have in the operation of Article 109?  In principle, at least, the Minister for Finance is vested with the power to set the exchange rate.  As a member of ECOFIN, will the Minister for Finance have any role in setting the external exchange rate of the euro?</P>
    <P>These may sound like technical or even academic matters but time will show that they are far more than that.  EMU involves the surrender of a great deal of economic sovereignty.  We will lose several of the important instruments currently available to us.  We will no longer be able to devalue to deal with competitive pressures or to stimulate or reduce demand by altering interest rates.  These instruments, as the Minister is aware, have been of considerable value to us in managing the economy.</P>
    <P>The nightmare scenario is not difficult to envisage. Some day, perhaps in 15 years' time, something will go wrong that will seem to demand a specific response from the Government.  The Minister for Finance of the day will appear on national television and say there is nothing we can do about it, that we have no power and that we are no longer in control.  In a sense, we have already bought into this.  It is of some importance that the consultative mechanisms in place work and are seen to work.</P>
    <P>On a domestic level, I am fascinated by the balance struck in section 5 of the Bill.  The Minister is entitled to be consulted on matters which are not related to our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.  On the other hand he must submit a request to be informed in relation to such matters as are covered by the statute in the treaty.  I gather from the Minister's contribution this morning that he considers this is as far as he can go, and that this is what is required in terms of the strict legal relationship between a Minister and the bank.  I am somewhat concerned about this and it is an issue we need to go into in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another issue I would like to examine in detail on Committee Stage but which I want to flag now is the confidentiality requirement on the bank that is set out in detail in section 16 of the 1989 Act, which I understand reflects the banking directive of the same year.  Perhaps I should say where I am coming from on this issue.  The bank is an important player in the management of our economy.  It assembles and disseminates information which is vital to decisions made by it and made elsewhere.  Currently it manages money supply and interest rates and, for the time being at least, it has a role in maintaining low inflation and managing the exchange rate in accordance with the principles set out by the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the 1989 Act imposes a duty of confidentiality which is capable of being interpreted in a wide way and has been in some cases <Col N="225" /> in the past.  It has been interpreted in the past to prevent the bank, and specifically the governor of the bank, from entering into virtually any sort of public discussion.  It also means that the bank is entirely unaccountable in relation to the exercise of some of its more important functions.  For example, the bank has an important regulatory role but section 16 might well be interpreted so as to render it impossible for the bank or the governor to account in public for the implementation and exercise of that role.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to find a concrete example. The bank carried out an investigation into the so-called Ansbacher accounts before Christmas.  We know that report was furnished to the Minister and he in turn furnished it to the DPP.  Is it likely that that report will ever be made public?  We also know the bank is currently carrying out an investigation of the investment bonds sold by National Irish Bank on behalf of CMI.  Will that report ever be made public?  Will we ever be able to question the governor or his representatives as to how their regulatory role was discharged in these particular cases?  Can we even question the governor in public in general terms as to the way the regulatory function of the bank is discharged?</P>
    <P>A particular question arises in the context of the Moriarty tribunal.  The legislation makes it clear that the bank is permitted to disclose information to a court of law in particular cases, but there is no mention made of statutory tribunals set up by the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate the advice he has been given in relation to this because it would be unacceptable if the bank were prevented by existing legislation from disclosing information of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the opportunity in the Bill to clarify the position of the governor in relation to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  The committee provides a useful public forum and, in fairness to him, the governor has made it clear he will be happy to attend before the committee if he is invited to do so.  All of us acknowledge that some of the bank's activities are commercially or market sensitive and clearly there is a balance to be struck between the public's right to know and the need not to intervene in an unfair way in areas of commercial and market sensitivity.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out once again in section 5 the primary functions of the bank.  Rather unsurprisingly, the emphasis is on price stability.  I say that is unsurprising because all of us are familiar with the views expressed over the years by Herr Tietmeyer and his predecessors in the Bundesbank. The German terror of price instability is obviously reflected in the strategy and make-up of the ECB.  That is inevitable and not especially worrying in itself, but the Minister will be aware that other countries have expressed the view that the legal remit of the bank is too narrow.  We should take this opportunity to broaden the remit we give to our own Central Bank by including a reference to employment and unemployment in section 5 of the Bill.  Specifically, the bank should <Col N="226" /> be required to have regard to the desirability of full employment with particular reference to the employment chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty. Jobs, or the lack of them, is probably the most important economic criterion which directly impacts on the lives of ordinary European citizens. It is only right and politically necessary that the bank should be required to have regard to the employment consequences of its own actions.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that I may be a little alarmist when I say this, and I hope nothing of this kind will ever come into play, but I could not stand over a position where the European Central Bank were to focus exclusively on monetary supply and policy and impose on the Union policies which led to the loss of many thousands of jobs. This is exactly what happened in the early 1980s during Mrs. Thatcher's blissfully brief but nonetheless devastating fascination with money supply and monetary policy.  There is currently little indication that the ECB would be inclined in that direction, and in any event there is precious little we can do about it, but I see no reason in principle not to amend the remit of our Central Bank so as to include a reference to the importance of full employment.  I would like to pursue that issue further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am interested in what the Minister has to say about the voting rights of non-executive directors. For what it is worth, my instinct is that he has probably made the right decision even though it appears to leave the governor with what, on the face of it, seems to be rather extensive power. Our tradition of non-executive directors is a good one.  In principle it is only right that we bring in people with expertise in various areas of life as non-executive directors of the bank; this argument extends to many other State boards also.  It is not in keeping with the experience of most of our European partners but that does not make it wrong.  I understand the reasoning behind the EMI view is that we should exclude even the theoretical possibility of a conflict of interest by making it impossible for non-executive directors to vote in matters related to the ECB.  This brings up the whole issue of conflicts of interest and perhaps the Minister might elaborate on the systems currently in place in this country for ensuring there is no conflict of interest in decisions made by members of the board of the bank.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the banking sector generally and in particular the role of the Central Bank in regulating the banking sector.  Recent years have seen something of an explosion in the variety of financial products available in or through Ireland.  We have also seen an explosion in the number of investment intermediaries and banks located here.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Central Bank has sufficient power to regulate the position of the banking sector?  Even if the Central Bank has the power, does it have the resources to use that power?  The operation of the Ansbacher and the NIB accounts are just two examples which have caused a great deal of public anger and cynicism.  It is only fair to ask the <Col N="227" /> reason the Central Bank was not in a position to identify problems which arose in those banks at an earlier stage.  Did it not have the power to do so, did it not use the power or did it not have the resources to use it?</P>
    <P>Particular questions have arisen in recent weeks in relation to non-resident accounts. People applying in Ireland to open a non-resident account are required to complete a relatively simple declaration.  From a few examples I have seen, the declaration requires only basic information such as the name and address of the person looking to open the account.  Surely there should be some requirement that the person opening the account can prove they are genuinely non-resident in the State.  In any event, the suggestion has been made that nobody follows up on these declarations. I was interested to see press reports yesterday which suggested that the Revenue Commissioners are looking into this, and I welcome that.  However, if it is the case that that has not been done heretofore, we are entitled and must ask why that is the case.</P>
    <P>There are an extraordinary number of non-resident accounts held in Irish banks.  No doubt many of them are held by people who are genuinely non-resident in the State.  However, there are now good reasons why many Irish people should place money in non-resident accounts but the suspicion exists, and it is a strong suspicion, that Irish people and Irish companies are placing money on account in non-resident accounts which are effectively located in Ireland for reasons of evading or avoiding tax.  If these accounts are being used as a means of evading income tax, we have to give the regulatory authorities, the Central Bank or the Revenue Commissioners, the necessary powers to investigate what is happening. If that means they require a general trawling power in circumstances where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that a scheme or a scam is operating, this House must be ready to give them that power.</P>
    <P>A question arises in relation to the International Financial Services Centre.  When I spoke in this House a few weeks ago I expressed concern about the nature of the value added by some of the work done in that centre.  Since then there have been worrying reports and allegations about what is effectively, or would be effectively if it were true, money laundering.  It has even been suggested that criminal elements have used the centre to launder money.  We must be clear in this House that we cannot condone shady, improper or downright illegal activities to improve our tax take to the detriment of others.  I am aware, like all Members, of the contribution the IFSC makes to employment and the Exchequer.  I would like to think that the vast bulk of that is from the provision of legitimate financial services.  However, there are indications and reports that some of what happens in the centre is not legitimate and I urge the Minister and the other regulatory authorities <Col N="228" /> to take whatever steps are necessary to weed out those activities.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the reserves on which Deputy Noonan touched.  I am interested in the reference made to the pension fund which the bank maintains for its bank employees.  That would be a worthwhile use of the reserves.  There is a reserve fund in the Central Bank which is more or less capable of discharging its liabilities, but we need to examine the public service generally, which is operated by and large as a pay as you go system.  There is serious merit in using reserves available to us now to form a sinking fund which, in the first instance, would not be capable of discharging all the liabilities, but which could make a significant contribution towards public service pensions in decades to come.</P>
    <P>I deliberately refrained from entering into the issues we debated last week at the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Deputy Noonan went into great detail on the issue of asymmetric shocks if sterling continues to yo-yo particularly during the first few years of monetary union.  We dealt with that last week and I am sure I will have an opportunity to do so again so I will not detain the House with my musings on those issues.</P>
    <P>This is largely a technical Bill.  The Labour Party will be supporting it on Second Stage, but there are some issues that need to be teased out in detail on Committee Stage and I would be interested in participating in that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the manner in which he set out the detail of a technical but also a complex Bill.  Democratic Left will support the Bill as it proceeds through the House although there are some intriguing questions raised about the dynamics of the relationship between our Central Bank and the proposed European Central Bank, about the operation of the ESCB system, and questions of accountability versus independence.  Those are fundamental questions and it is difficult to be prescient about them from this standpoint.  There are also questions of responsiveness, the ability of the system to respond quickly to a small country.  There are other questions raised by section 4 which acknowledges the diminished role and power of the Central Bank, but confers additional powers on the governor <i>per se.</i>  There is also the wider question raised by Deputy Noonan on the role of economists versus the role of politicians and that the debate to date has been left largely to the economists.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy McDowell I do not want to go over ground covered at the recent finance committee at which I raised some questions, to some extent with tongue in cheek, in the hope I would get a reply from the Minister.  Perhaps I could short-circuit that by putting on record a letter typical of those Members get from businessmen, arguably provoked, as Deputy Noonan said, by economists' commentary.  This type of letter is typical of the type I have got on the issue.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Our most eminent economists have now warned of the dangers of Ireland entering EMU at the end of this year.  The original premise of the project might have seemed reasonable but even the ESRI report on Monetary Union suggested that the benefits were marginal .</P>
    <P>Well, as we now know, the conditions are not favourable.  Britain is not joining, the convergence criteria are almost certain to be fudged, the Asian economy is in crisis and our economy is being allowed to overheat just to get the pound down to Dm2.41.</P>
    <P>So Ireland joining EMU makes no <i>economic</i> sense.  It is purely a <i>political</i> decision.  A political decision that will have disastrous consequences for the Irish people if it doesn't pay off and all the indicators suggest now that it won't.</P>
    <P>The consensus on this subject among the main political parties has been total.  There has been virtually no political debate and it has been left to the economists and a few journalists to ring the alarm bells.  This is not democracy at work.</P>
    <P>I am writing to you because you are a politician with a duty of care to the Irish people and the people of Dublin South-West.  You have a duty to explain the risks of this process to the people so that that they are fully informed and do not amble into EMU just because they trusted their politicians not do anything silly.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is difficult to stand out on this issue given the political consensus.  It is unlikely to enhance anyone's political career (not in the short-term anyway) but the price the Nation may have to pay for generations to come is surely such that the country must come first.</P>
    <P>We can delay entry with virtually no risks other than some hard feelings in the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs.  We are drifting towards the waterfall and everyone in the boat is discussing the weather.  Well it's time somebody shouted stop before it's too late.  We have until May this year to change our minds.</P>
    <P>That letter probably points up the folly of the debate having been left to economists and the Minister deciding to adopt, as he described it, a button lip approach.  That kind of argument needs to be dealt with.  I accept the Government has to make a difficult decision about the rate at which Ireland joins EMU.  The Minister was at pains at the finance committee to explain that this is not a unilateral action.  The critical question for Irish policy makers is whether we believe our economic indicators or whether the real Irish economy is less vigorous than the current boom would indicate.</P>
    <P>A recent economic study asserts that hugely disproportionate contribution is made by the multinational companies, especially in the hi-tech sector, compared to the still seriously underperforming <Col N="230" /> indigenous sector.  Other commentators add in the transfers from Europe, equivalent to almost 5 per cent of our GNP, and conclude that those two factors are the main drivers behind our economic growth.</P>
    <P>The rate we strike must take account of the underlying credibility of our economic performance. It is likely the post-1999 situation will see transfers to Ireland step down somewhat.  It is impossible to know for how long the computer boom will continue, but in the medium term output could drop to more moderate levels.  The East Asian turbulence must dampen down western economies as the deflationary effects come through.  Will the present momentum continue? If the boom abates will somewhat lower interest rates boost investment?  It may be that the benefits of a common currency zone within a huge Single Market will provide a substitute stimulus for the Irish economy.  In any event the importance of not overvaluing the worth of the Irish pound on entry is evident.  What is the serious intent of those who argue for immediate revaluation which would push up the pound against the Deutschmark? It seems an exceedingly risky proposition to entrench a high value Irish pound against the deutschmark at precisely the point that we irrevocably lose control.</P>
    <P>We can argue interminably about the technical pros and cons.  Not all of the commercial sector will be happy irrespective of the argument advanced.  If the punt is weak against sterling we will have one series of complaints and if the punt performs strongly against sterling we will have a different series of complaints.  The vested interests will continue to advocate their case as they are entitled to do.  For example, the farming organisations and manufacturing exporters who benefit from the competitive advantage conferred by the lower value against other European currencies will be quite happy with what seems to be the Minister's strategy.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day Ireland must take a view of its role in the world at this historical juncture. What is Europe's place in the world and what is Ireland's role in Europe?  Even the economic commentators concede that they are addressing entry from an economic perspective only. However, EMU is a political construct, not an economic one, although it has an undoubted economic dimension.  What is our view?  Do we want to be part of the Franco-German orbit or the British orbit?  We must take a view and get on with it.  In seeking to answer the political question the overriding imperative is the impact Europe has had on society and the economy over the past 25 years.  On the other hand, our pre-European dependence on Britain effectively conferred second class status on Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Euro-scepticism that destroyed Mr. Major's Government seems to be, albeit on a more sophisticated plane, also represented in Mr. Blair's Administration.  I would not be as sanguine as Deputy Noonan on this point.  He wondered about the likely position of the UK <Col N="231" /> Government, whether it was likely to adhere to a tracking mechanism during the changeover period or to exploit its position for short-term gain. I find it difficult to see the point of Britain's staying out if it does not exploit it.  It is naive to think the British will have a fixed or semi-fixed tracking mechanism which will provide the yo-yo effect to which Deputy McDowell referred.  There is a significant Euro-sceptic element in the British Labour Party, although they are a great deal more sophisticated than the deadbeats who surrounded John Major.  However, the phenomenon which destroyed his Government is not entirely absent from the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The creation of a strong euro currency which will compete vigorously against the dollar must give Europe greater credibility and give Ireland greater opportunities.  If after all the investment we still have not learned how to compete the shock will be rude.  Inevitably there will be shocks but if the pound sterling should dramatically fall interest rates will fall also.  Whatever the balance sheet calculations, a decision to stick with sterling, irrespective of the short-term implications, cannot be politically prudent in the medium term. We would fritter away the credits we have built up and our capacity to punch beyond our weight in Europe would be diminished.</P>
    <P>There is a further compelling argument for not over valuing the Irish pound at the time of locking in to the euro which has been best advanced in a recent article by Angela Clifford who states that there is also the consideration that sterling can drop in value at any time and it may enter the European currency eventually at a much lower value than it is currently trading at.  She says the present appreciation of sterling with regard to the Deutschmark runs counter to the trend of the previous 30 years, when it had been depreciating by about 5 per cent a year and if it did enter at a more realistic rate, British producers would get a trading advantage over Irish, if revaluation had taken place.  She also says it would be unfortunate if the Irish entry level to the Euro had been distorted upwards by an illusory and short-lived rise in the price of sterling and that the position could not be rectified when Britain joined as the value of the Irish Euro will then be fixed.</P>
    <P>I am strongly persuaded by the argument. These events are not far away because in the light of statements by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer the decision will face the British in the not too distant future.  We should have some regard to the implications in the medium term.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged to a joint meeting of the Finance and Public Service Committee and the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that</P>
    <P>. the exchange rate can play a role in adjusting competitiveness and stabilising output following a severe economic shock.  In EMU, this instrument will no longer be available to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> That is manifestly true but a glance at the historical pattern shows that the power of the Irish Government to determine exchange rates is not absolute, to put it mildly.  The value of a floating currency is determined by the market.  Whatever we may think about the current reality of the underlying strength of the Irish economy, nobody could argue that the punt is dropping because of our current economic performance.  Rather the price of our currency in external trade is an indication that, for the first time in our history, the international currency markets recognise that the punt is moving away from the sterling-dollar zone and into the European sphere of influence. However much we may have tried to follow the European star in the past the markets did not believe us.  They believed that our relationship was with sterling because a great proportion of our trade, albeit declining in recent years, was with the sterling area.  What is happening now indicates that the markets believe we are inexorably heading towards EMU, a new reality of which they must take account.</P>
    <P>The customary reason for a decline in exchange rates is a loss of confidence by speculators and investors in the economic outlook of a country. Therefore, it is evident that exchange rates do not follow a scientific rationale.  This is further borne out by our experience since sterling fell out of the ERM.  The subsequent unpredictable sterling influence on the punt which caused some pain for Irish exporters had little to do with the real economy in Ireland since 1992.  This is not to say that as the Irish pound drops towards its central level in the ERM some pain will not be experienced as the punt's value falls <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  I do not know the correct rate at which to lock in, no more than do many others.  However, I am persuaded that it would be a great mistake to enter at an overvalued rate.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister feels unable to engage in this debate other than to repeat the mantra that we face into EMU from a position of economic strength, quoting &lsquo;very strong growth, rapid employment creation, low inflation, a budget close to balance and a rapidly declining debt ratio&rsquo;.  It is an impressive mantra and I thought the Minister might have taken the opportunity of the cosy chat on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; to talk about the rate at which we would lock in to the euro, but although he talked about other locks he did not talk about the lock-in rate.</P>

    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that there can be no reversing of engines now, so to speak.  We are headed inexorably on a particular course.  The document prepared by Forfás will be very helpful <Col N="233" /> to businesses and I hope they avail of it.  I raised the matter of asymmetric shocks and I will not go back over it.  At the joint committee meeting to which I referred I raised the cost of the Army deafness claims, a sobering matter to which the Minister might refer.  On the reserves, I take a slightly different view from that of my colleagues who have spoken so far.  I understand we will have to make a contribution of some £400 million to the European Central Bank and so on.  That should leave us with some reserves.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us the figure.  The Minister ought to look seriously at the devastated unemployment black spots in this and other cities with a view to using much of that money productively to try to lift areas that transparently are not being lifted by the rising tide.  That endemic long-term unemployment, where every conceivable kind of social problem is concentrated, is not benefiting from the economic success we are enjoying.  The people in the Department of Finance should organise a bus tour of some of these areas because they do not live in them and do not know the detail of life there.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt about that, and I am glad to hear it, but it is not conditioning our public policies efficiently.  It is a serious black cloud over our society and economy.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the single currency for the reason that it narrows the speculative angle for speculators who have been taking undue profits whenever the opportunity has presented itself in the past.  I would like to talk at another time about the question of independence versus accountability because there is reason to believe that some of these regulator bodies become captives of the very institutions they are supposed to regulate.  It goes a long way to explaining the phenomenon Deputy McDowell raised in relation to Ansbacher Bank and Northern Ireland Bank, and the 40,000 accounts that are said to be here, held by fairground owners in Cologne, who open a company in Leeson Street for £100 to avoid paying tax to the German Exchequer.  The Minister for Finance must know that sooner or later that will bring down on our heads the wrath of the German Government which will not put up with that kind of thing.  If it is the job of the Registrar of Companies to deal with that, it should be addressed there.  When I was Minister I put an investment of £1.5 million into that. There is now a new premises and 60 additional staff.  I do not know whether the chief executive that the Cabinet at the time decided, on the basis of a memorandum from me, should be appointed has been appointed, but it is a phenomenon that should be dealt with before we incur the wrath of the German and other Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised at many of the views expressed here today.  Deputy Noonan <Col N="234" /> spoke at length about asymmetric shocks.  While he was playing the Opposition game in one sense, he seems quite happy to support the whole concept of economic and monetary union, as are all the parties in this Chamber.  We have heard Deputies from what are commonly known as the five main parties again singing from the same hymn sheet on this issue.  However, a debate requires real opposition.  It requires people to put forward another point of view.  Clearly, this has not happened in this House on such an important issue.  The former Foreign Affairs Minister, Deputy Spring, compared the decision to join EMU to the decision to enter what was then known as the European Economic Community, but there has not been the same amount of debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>A debate in this House on the future of the Central Bank and the onset of economic and monetary union is long overdue.  Not only is it belated, it is probably too late.  Nevertheless, the opportunity to put on record and, where possible, to divert the path on which this country has been needlessly placed needs to be taken.  The Government, and those political parties that support EMU, point to the agreement of the Irish people gained through the Maastricht Treaty referendum in 1993.  However, can it be honestly said that the agreement was honestly sought and freely given? European Union treaty referenda in this country have consistently reduced complicated treaties into simple and simplistic slogans.  The Maastricht Treaty referendum was among the worst examples of the Irish democratic system being overridden by avoiding the type of questioning and debate that would properly inform the electorate and give confidence that decisions, when reached, had been freely made.  The constitutional action instituted by my colleague, Patricia McKenna, showed how Irish governments had propagandised voters with their own money.  Future referenda must reflect this important democratic principle.</P>
      <P>Technical aspects of the conduct of referenda are one thing, but the ethical conduct of referenda is another.  We wait to see whether the debate on the Treaty of Amsterdam will be an honest debate, not reduced to sloganeering over free money as was the case with the Maastricht Treaty.  If there are Members who have difficulty in accepting this argument, I urge them to conduct their own straw polls among their constituents, asking them how many believe they voted for EMU at the time of the Maastricht Treaty, or even how many understand EMU and its implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers asked about the difference between the view of economists on EMU and that of politicians.  There is one part of the equation to which they have not referred, the people's view.  We have to ask whether the decision to join EMU is a democratic decision. What would be the result if, for instance, as Jacques Chirac promised, a referendum were held in France where there is huge unrest because of <Col N="235" /> unemployment?  Deputy McDowell referred to the 4.5 million unemployed people in Germany. What would be the outcome of a referendum there on EMU, and what would be the outcome of a similar referendum in Britain?  We know the Danes are not holding a referendum.  The question then is, is the decision to join EMU a democratic one?  I have no doubt that if a referendum were held here, we would be made to feel that we had to be &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo;, whatever that means.  I consider myself to be a &ldquo;Europhile&rdquo;, but I question the expansion and the integration of the EU.  I feel I should be able to do that and not be in the category of &ldquo;Eurosceptics&rdquo;.  To describe me as a &ldquo;Eurosceptic&rdquo; because I question such decisions would be like calling someone a bad Irishman for questioning something the Irish Government wanted to do.  I do not know why we make a distinction, but it is a very good way of marginalising those who question.</P>
    <P>If there are Members who have difficulty in accepting this argument, I ask them to look again at all the referenda which have been conducted here and see how the opposition argument has been marginalised.  I hope that with the introduction of the referendum commission, we will have a fair and informed debate because this gulf of understanding has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Green Party believes that the debate on the Treaty of Amsterdam should centre around the implications of EMU, and the people must be properly informed before we embark on what could prove to be the most economically uncertain policy this country has ever faced.  It is regrettable that the debate on EMU has only recently been fired.  The Minister for Finance may seem content to whistle in the dark, despite these arguments. He seems happy to rely on the ESRI report which states that the likely impact of EMU on the economy will probably be neutral.  The ESRI has produced many important reports, and it would be encouraging if the Minister for Finance were to attach the same weight to all the comments issued through the ESRI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we are holding this debate as we should hold it at regular intervals. Deputy Yates and Deputy Stagg will know that there is a good committee dealing with the Department, which has already had much impact on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill.  We should embrace these occasions rather than viewing them as something to be endured.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss many aspects of aviation policy.  The topic is broad so of its nature it will range over many issues.  I welcome representatives of Ryanair and the aviation branch of the unions to the Gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on aviation policy.  I believe the aviation <Col N="236" /> policies of the current Government and its predecessors are coherent and comprehensive and I welcome this opportunity of setting our policy forth clearly.  At the outset I pay tribute to the vision and foresight of people like Mr. Brendan O'Regan and Mr. Tim O'Driscoll who were instrumental in laying down the framework for Ireland's air transport industry.  They may seem like names from the past but they are still very much around.  I know their successors will meet equally well the challenges facing the industry today.</P>
    <P>During the course of these remarks I will touch on the major aviation related issues of the day and review the performance of Irish aviation over recent years.  Policy is not just an accumulation of specific responses, it is the framework from which the specific actions or responses of Ministers derives. For me, aviation policy has an overriding theme and three main objectives.  The theme of aviation policy is competitiveness and that is the unifying theme of my policies in transport, energy and communications.  The three main objectives of my aviation policy are: first, to facilitate and encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade, industry and domestic consumers; second, to ensure that Irish airports are cost effective and have high quality infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of the Irish economy; and third and most importantly, to ensure the standards of safety of Irish aviation continue to inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>A thriving and vibrant air transport industry, ensuring adequate access to and from Ireland for tourism growth, for the business and commercial life of the country and for the development of our trade and commerce, is clearly crucial.  This applies all the more in view of our island position and our greater reliance on air transport relative to other countries for getting goods and services to market.  Ireland's economy is showing strong growth with low inflation, increasing employment and related benefits.  All this augurs well but it is vital that the air transport industry keeps pace with this development.  It has to be recognised that while air transport is a key service to support the economy in general, it has in turn been stimulated by the general buoyancy of the economy.</P>
    <P>Aviation in Europe has been going through a period of radical change over the last ten to 15 years.  We have been a supporter of this change, knowing that we need increased competitiveness, better access to markets, and all the other factors in which aviation plays a key role.  The liberalisation process has contributed to a phenomenal increase in passenger traffic to and from Ireland. Traffic between Ireland and the UK increased from 2.7 million passengers in 1987 to 7.6 million in 1997.  In the same period, traffic between Ireland and Europe increased from one million to 3.26 million, while transatlantic traffic increased from 0.6 million to over one million.  That is a <Col N="237" /> huge movement of people.  Statistics sometimes seem dry but, apart from the air freight sector, the aviation industry is concerned with people numbers and the immense increase tells its own tale.  This spans Government of different hues, from a minority Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, through Fianna Fáil-PDs, Fianna Fáil-Labour, Fine Gael-Labour-DL and Fianna Fáil-PDs again.  In drawing attention to the passenger increase I am not boasting, I am stating facts regarding the last decade.</P>
    <P>Irish airlines and those who work in them have played a major part in contributing to this growth. Aer Lingus and Ryanair, despite being major competitors, have performed extremely well over the last couple of years.  Aer Lingus, following a major restructuring plan and significant Exchequer investment, now has a clear commercial mandate and its performance will be gauged against that.  Ryanair's growth has been remarkable over the past two to three years, to the extent that it now rivals Aer Lingus in terms of overall passenger numbers and market share on its major routes.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am delighted to report that passenger numbers continued their strong growth during 1997.  Passenger throughput at the State airports reached an all time high of 13.3 million in 1997, representing a 12 per cent increase on the 1996 figure.  Dublin Airport showed the strongest growth with an increase of 14 per cent with Shannon and Cork Airports achieving increases of 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.  Shannon Airport has also shown a 19 per cent increase in the transit passenger segment.</P>
    <P>The question which arises now is whether our aviation industry is alive to and properly adapted to meet the challenges ahead.  I argue that it is, no matter how daunting those challenges may seem.  The industry is poised to continue to compete and be pre-eminent in the field.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the first of our priorities is to facilitate and encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry. The free market established within the European economic area responds to this objective. In many cases the possibility of new air services may be remote in the short term but the objective is to ensure that should airlines wish to operate between Ireland and these countries at some time in the future they would be in a position to do so.  Finally, the State airports and the regional airports are actively involved on an ongoing basis in marketing their potential and seeking to stimulate growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>Traffic growth has been unprecedented and the forecasts in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 fell well short of the mark. An unfortunate by-product of this has been congestion at Dublin Airport.  The existing terminal was constructed to cater for six million to seven million passengers per annum but there are now 10 million per annum &mdash; just before Christmas a young woman became the ten millionth passenger <Col N="238" /> in 1997 through the airport.  However, I am pleased to point out that the situation will be alleviated next month on completion of the first phase of a new departure area, which will provide additional lounges, airbridges and shopping facilities. It will greatly improve passenger facilities and assist the smooth flow of passengers through the airport.</P>
    <P>When that project is finished work will commence on the extension of the existing terminal, to be completed by summer 2000.  These two major projects &mdash; in conjunction with associated ones such as the ongoing expansion of the existing departure lounges, the provision of additional car parking accommodation, changes to the internal road network, upgraded airfield infrastructure and provision of accommodation for low cost airlines &mdash; will enable the airport to cope with the demands being placed upon it.</P>
    <P>The question of adequate public access to Dublin Airport is a matter of great concern to everyone. I am aware that increasing congestion on road access to the airport is leading to great difficulties. A preliminary study on direct rail access to the airport has been received by my Department and we are currently studying its objectives and financial implications.  These works are part of capital investment programmes totalling over £200 million at the three State airports over the years 1996-2001.  I have already outlined the programme at Dublin Airport.  The main element of the programme at Shannon relates to a major rationalisation and expansion of the passenger terminal, while the programme at Cork consists principally of upgrading both runway and passenger terminal facilities.</P>
    <P>A vital element of Aer Rianta's mission is continued cost effective delivery of airport services so that there will be the minimum cost imposition on the movement of passengers and goods.  This is vital, given the importance of access to transport to the Irish economy.  With this in mind, the basic airport charges levied by Aer Rianta on airlines using the State airports have remained unchanged since 1987.  In addition, since 1994 the company has operated a discount scheme in respect of growth in scheduled passenger traffic on existing routes.</P>
    <P>However, recent developments in 1997 are even more welcome.  A new rolling five year traffic growth incentive scheme at the State airports has been put in place with effect from 1 January 1997.  The new incentives, like previous schemes, are designed to stimulate traffic growth on existing routes and attract new services to the State airports.  Under the present scheme, airlines at Cork and Shannon airports incur no airport charges on growth and new traffic annually for the following three years and enjoy a 50 per cent discount in years 4 and 5.  There are similar incentives at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Those schemes will contribute towards keeping access transport costs into and out of Ireland to the minimum.  The success of the scheme to date can be seen from the record traffic levels.  The <Col N="239" /> scheme was piloted in 1997 and has been rolled forward for 1998.  Aer Rianta, to both invest heavily in the State airports and keep its landing charges low, depends crucially on the significant revenues which it earns from duty free sales.  That topic has been debated by the House for the past two nights and I will return to it briefly later.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the most important and vital objective is to ensure the safety standards of Irish aviation continue to inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure.  Not alone should we ensure our own house is in order but we should also continue to put forward ideas and objectives through international fora to ensure the upholding of safety standards worldwide.</P>
    <P>An aviation accident has a far greater impact than accidents on other forms of transport.  It is necessary if the industry is to continue to thrive that safety be maintained as a priority issue.  The Irish Aviation Authority plays a major role in this regard.  International fora, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation, European Civil Aviation Conference and the European Union, continue to examine safety standards on an ongoing basis to see how they can be improved and modernised.  We should not just visit safety issues from time to time, instead they should be a continuing theme in aviation policy.</P>
    <P>Transport safety issues unfortunately only come into play when there is a serious mishap, which is followed by another lull when the investigations are over.  I know I am speaking to the converted, but those who operate airlines must make safety their number one focus.  Regardless of competitive pressures, safety must never be compromised.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the bodies involved in the industry &mdash; Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>Having successfully undertaken a major restructuring programme in the early 1990s, Aer Lingus has emerged stronger and better positioned to meet the challenges posed by the liberalisation and globalisation of the aviation industry. We all trot out those fine words from time to time but what they mean is that the company will be exposed to full market forces.  We would be like King Canute trying to hold back the waves if we were to try to keep ourselves cocooned from those forces.  It would be comfortable and cosy if it could be done but it cannot.  The aviation industry is subject to those market forces every minute of every working day.</P>
    <P>Profits in recent years have demonstrated the extent of the turnaround in the underlying profitability of the company &mdash; this from a company which only a few years ago had been faced with the worst financial crisis in its history.  Following the successful implementation of the Cahill Plan, the fortunes of the group have been reversed. This resulted in net profits of £15 million and £32 million in 1995 and 1996 respectively.  The results for 1997 will soon be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> Against the backdrop of the many challenges facing the group, however, there is a real risk that unless the commercial imperative adopted under the recovery plan continues it may be unable to control its cost base sufficiently and adapt its commercial strategies.  I believe the only way to underpin the future viability of the company is to continue to foster and implement a partnership approach to change in an atmosphere of industrial harmony.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the board of Aer Lingus has been mandated by the previous rainbow Coalition to explore the possibilities of entering into a major strategic alliance, with or without the transfer of equity, and to submit proposals to me, as Minister, and to the Government. The former Minister, Deputy Dukes, wrote to Bernie Cahill, the chairman of Aer Lingus, in that regard in spring 1997.</P>
    <P>While it would be premature today to speculate on the strategic alliance issue, a positive Government decision on an alliance proposal would only be taken where such an alliance is clearly in the best interests of securing the future of the airline, having regard to the needs of all stakeholders, including staff.  This approach is entirely consistent with Government policy on the State sector.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that when answering questions on the subject of TEAM on 16 December 1997, I stated quite clearly there would be no strategic developments in relation to TEAM without the concurrence of TEAM employees.  I wish to state clearly there has been no change in this position.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that Aer Lingus announced subsequently that it had identified FLS Aerospace as its preferred investor.  FLS Aerospace is currently engaged in the due diligence process related to that bid.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that all the issues surrounding the possible sale of TEAM to FLS are currently being addressed by management and employee representatives.  The issues are varied and complex and include pensions, salaries, the letters of employment which were issued and current arrangements.  Neither I nor the Department have received any formal proposal, as yet, from the board of Aer Lingus on the matter.</P>
    <P>Any such proposal is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and any recommendation from the board will be considered politically by the Cabinet on its merits, having regard to the interests of all relevant parties.  I have the confidence and accord of my Cabinet colleagues, to whom I report regularly on the issue, in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is my strong belief that constructive discussions between both sides, with the assistance of the agreed independent facilitator, with full regard for employee rights as well as the commercial issues, is the way forward.  The desire to ensure a long-term viable future for TEAM will be my prime concern in examining any proposal from the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> We have already spoken about Aer Rianta's investment in the State airports.  The Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill is on Committee Stage.  It requires about a further hour's work, which has been scheduled for next Tuesday.  Report Stage will then be taken in the House.  While the consideration of the Bill has taken longer than any of us thought when we embarked upon it, the refusal by myself and our Opposition colleagues to rush it means important changes have been made to the Bill by amendment &mdash; with, perhaps, more to follow &mdash; and it will be a better Bill for it.</P>
    <P>The change in status will not impact on the State's ownership of Aer Rianta.  The primary purpose is to provide for the vesting or transfer of ownership of the State airport lands in the company and the termination of the present agency management; the formal powers, duties and function of the company will be set up.  The heads of the Bill were approved by the previous Government and the Bill was published last October.  I have told the House how we are proceeding on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A continuing topic of debate is the future of Shannon Airport.  Airlines that wish to operate transatlantic services to Dublin Airport must operate at least an equivalent number of direct services to Shannon over a 12 month period.  I have been on record since coming into office of reiterating my commitment to maintaining the status of Shannon.  I understand the concerns expressed about the stability of traffic at Shannon and believe we can now look at its future in a more positive manner.</P>
    <P>The number of terminal passengers at Shannon increased by 40 per cent between 1992 and 1997. Transatlantic traffic at Shannon grew steadily over this period.  Continental Airlines will provide a new service from June.  The chairman of Aer Rianta told me early bookings at Continental are strong and that it is pleased with them.  The route from Shannon to London-Gatwick carried over 116,000 passengers in 1997, it is planning to introduce a higher frequency to Gatwick in 1998 and a new service to London-Stansted.</P>
    <P>The development programme under way at Shannon is based on a 5 per cent annual growth in total traffic from 1.5 million passengers in 1994 to some two million in 1998.  Actual traffic results to date are ahead of target.  The new terminal at Shannon, unveiled by the former Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is scheduled for the year 2000 and will have facilities and resources, supported by state of the art technology and management practices.</P>
    <P>Recent reports have raised the spectre of the possible withdrawal by Aeroflot of services from Shannon arising primarily from the acquisition by the airline of long range aircraft which do not need to stop at Shannon to refuel.  Recently, my officials and I had discussions with Aeroflot officials who assured us there is no imminent plan to leave Shannon.  I would be foolish if I did not accept that Aeroflot will continue to look at the <Col N="242" /> economics of its operations because it was spelled out to me.  Aeroflot also spelled out to me that it has no immediate plans to leave Shannon.</P>
    <P>Airports generally attach far greater importance to terminal traffic which is the important traffic category for tourism.  There has been strong growth in Cork in recent years, increasing from 700,000 passengers in 1992 to over 1.2 million in 1997 &mdash; up by over 70 per cent in five years. Aer Rianta has plans for Cork.  It also has plans for a hotel which it will open shortly in north Dublin at the airport.</P>

      <P>I recognise the strong interest by all parties in regional airports to which we referred in our programme for Government.  I embarked on a series of meetings with management in the regional airports and I tweaked my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and £2 million of Exchequer funding was forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Some £2 million was provided in the Estimate and £3 million in the budget comprising a package of £5 million.  Regional airports no longer receive EU money.  This Exchequer funding will be available for infrastructural improvements at Donegal, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Waterford. All airports would like more funding but they are embarking on work with the money they have received.  The essential air services programme concerns Donegal, Sligo and Kerry airports.  This programme is being continued in 1998, 1999 and 2000 with extra flights added, including an extra flight from Galway to Dublin.  I hope there will be an extra flight from Farranfore to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to other topical issues on the Irish aviation scene.  Deputies will be aware of the flotation of Ryanair during 1997 which, from the company's perspective, is on a sound footing.  We are all familiar with the current industrial dispute at Dublin Airport between Ryanair and members of its ground handling staff.  I take this opportunity to state clearly the views expressed by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for labour, trade and consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, that it was disappointing Ryanair did <Col N="243" /> not accept the invitation to attend the Labour Court on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court intervention represented an opportunity to the parties to state their case to an independent third party.  We must all acknowledge the impressive record of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court in assisting parties in an industrial dispute to reach a settlement of their differences.  I am aware the court intends to keep the matter under review.  I urge Ryanair to accept the Labour Court's offer to facilitate the parties in any way possible.  With such an eminent chairperson, agreed machinery and the chance to resolve this matter, I repeat my belief that this is the route Ryanair should take.</P>
    <P>As the third Irish airline competing in the scheduled services market, I am glad Cityjet, despite an initial bumpy start, has successfully come through a period of examinership and re-established itself.</P>
    <P>The duty free issue has exercised our minds in recent days and on Tuesday, 400 people attended a conference in Dublin.  On Tuesday and Wednesday nights the House debated this issue. I am glad to announce dates for meetings have finally been arranged.  I hope to meet John Prescott at a dinner in London on 23 February and my German counterpart on 3 March.  We are only the transport ministers and this matter must go through the Minister for Finance, ECOFIN and the Commission, but the swell should come from the ground up.  The Secretary of State, Mr. Prescott, is the chairman of the transport Council of Ministers.  The Germans, who face a general election, are important players in Europe.  We hope to be able to table a matter for the transport Council of Ministers on 17 March in Brussels so nobody need table a parliamentary question requesting to know where I will be on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I was sorry the House divided on this issue last night because we are all in favour of the retention of duty free sales given the necessary finances it provides.  Although we are talking about aviation, ferry companies stand to lose a large amount of revenue if the abolition of duty free goes ahead. The House will understand that both Germany and Britain play key roles in the EU.  Time is short and we must press on with this issue.  It is a negation of duty and a promise because the EU has not conducted the European-wide study on this matter which it said it would carry out.  This was part of a general taxation measure which has not occurred throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of aviation related EU directives which have a particular social dimension.  Recently, an EU directive on arrangements for ground handling service at Community airports was adopted.  This issue arose in an amendment tabled by Deputy Yates on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  I will shortly make a statutory instrument to give effect to this directive.  My officials are continuing to discuss with all the interests concerned, <Col N="244" /> including representatives of the workers' the appropriate arrangements to give effect to this directive.  Directives are also being considered by the EU Commission in relation to limitations on flight times for pilots and training and competence requirements for cabin crews.  I will ensure the necessary consultation with worker representatives on these proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government's aviation policy is based on encouraging competitiveness on the domestic and international fronts, recognising the important role regional airports play in regional development and ensuring the maintenance of the highest standards in terms of aviation safety and security. This policy builds on the policies pursued by previous Governments, all of whom had a strong interest in this area.  I am glad of the opportunity to note the phenomenal growth in this sector, the forecasts for the future, the infrastructural changes required, the necessity for increased access to airports, the provision of adequate finance to regional airports and the continuation of subsidised air fares for three years.  The management and employees must adopt a partnership approach in dealing with these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate important aviation issues.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Nora Owen who will deal in more detail with the Ryanair dispute.  Fine Gael believes the issues in this dispute go beyond aviation policy.  I appeal to Ryanair to end the dispute and allow third party arbitration through the Labour Court.  If representatives of the airline can discuss the matter on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; I do not understand why they cannot do this.  The issues in the dispute involve more than baggage handling, and Deputy Owen will deal with these and the partnership concept in greater detail.</P>
      <P>I will deal principally with TEAM Aer Lingus. I am very critical of the way the proposed sale of the company has been handled by the Minister and the Government.  The sale is a matter for them and they will have to decide whether they support or oppose it.  The Minister's statement in December, made again today &mdash; it was also repeated on her behalf during an Adjournment debate last week &mdash; that it would be inappropriate to comment until there is a formal proposal, is evasive and intended to be all things to all people.</P>
      <P>She has told the management and board that she favours a pragmatic outcome which will ensure the best long-term security and commercial success for TEAM.  This means she does not disagree with them.  However, at the same time she has told the employees that the deal will not go ahead without &ldquo;worker concurrence&rdquo;.  She is speaking out of both sides of her mouth: she is telling the management to proceed, while telling the unions that she will give them every comfort. Those positions are mutually exclusive as there will either be a deal or there will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>

    <Col N="245" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever happens, one side will be unhappy.</P>
      <P>It is truly incredible that the shareholder is so unsure and uncertain about her views that she is neither a proponent nor opponent of the deal. This uncertainty and confusion makes it impossible for commercial negotiations to succeed or for clear industrial relations dialogue to proceed. Some of the unions are not prepared to enter into talks because of the political procedure which arises outside industrial relations dialogue.  The unions do not know if they should be negotiating with the Minister or management, given her statement on worker concurrence.</P>
      <P>Adding to this disorder is the threat, left in the air, of the withdrawal by the board of Aer Lingus of the £65 million loan to its subsidiary if the deal is rejected.  Fears of bankruptcy and subsequent redundancy &mdash; Aer Lingus will not require 1,200 workers for its maintenance section &mdash; have not been dispelled.  When I raised the matter on the Adjournment last week the reply did not deal with whether such a threat existed.  The Minister did not refer to the most serious threat facing the workers and I call on her to clarify this issue.</P>
      <P>This issue has not been handled adequately or correctly.  A strategic business development plan should have formed part of the memorandum of understanding between Aer Lingus and FLS Aerospace.  FLS should have put written proposals to the workers and set out its response to specific questions on job security, pension fund entitlements, pay and conditions, specific future individual departments such as ground maintenance, in which FLS has much expertise, individual increments and special entitlements such as sick pay and travel concessions.  More clarity is also required on the proposed purchase of or withdrawal from the letters of guarantee previously issued to the staff.  The failure to do this has resulted in all allegations being sustainable.  In such circumstances it is clearly impossible for the facilitator, Mr. Durkan, Mr. Behan or someone else, to reach a consensus.  The Minister should immediately instruct the management of Aer Lingus, in conjunction with FLS Aerospace, to provide this documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local representatives and party spokespersons have been contacted by workers who have genuine concerns.  These workers have agreed to the deferment for 16 months of pay increases under Partnership 2000, the deferment of increments and the loss of benefits.  There is uncertainty about the transfer of the pension fund which is currently Government backed.  They have raised genuine questions such as whether they will start work with FLS on a day one basis with the loss of holiday entitlements gained through service, whether they will start at the bottom of the pay scale, whether they will be entitled to pay increments, whether FLS will require only licensed mechanics, whether qualifications will be recognised and whether they will be entitled to pay if they get injured or sick.  If I was buying a business I would set out for everyone the guarantees <Col N="246" /> I could give and put my cards face up on the table.  It is incredible that the Minister expects people to proceed without answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's view on TEAM Aer Lingus starts from the reality that one cannot be all things to all people, which is what the Government is trying to be until after the by-elections.  Our strategic objective is to have the maximum level of employment in Dublin Airport and the aviation sector in a decade's time.  The aviation sector underpins commercial tourism growth and is a vital part of the access transport system.  Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus are relatively small in global terms in this regard.  The most relevant contemporary development in global aviation is the consolidation of massive conglomerates in airline and aviation maintenance business.</P>
    <P>I accept that Aer Lingus and TEAM have to look seriously and positively at strategic alliances with other operators, including cross-shareholders. This offers the potential to the airline of an expanded transatlantic network which is limited at present.  It also offers stronger resources for marketing capacity, the expansion of opportunities world-wide and a certain security for operational activity which a small regional niche player cannot guarantee.  Given that the EU Commission has deemed that the injection of equity by successive Governments of £175 million is to be the last, such an alliance provides a basis for access to future investment capital.  I favour circumstances whereby the ownership of TEAM and Aer Lingus should change in its own best interests.  In any commercial operation, what is successful for the company is in the best interests of its employees.  Acceptance of openness to change, given commercial global sectoral realities, does not result in approval for any proposed deal.</P>
    <P>Questions must be raised about FLS Aerospace. While it can be strongly argued that its parent company, based in Denmark and operating successfully around the world, has a long and well established multinational repute, the air maintenance division, FLS Aerospace, is more questionable. I have met FLS, which is to answer various questions I put to it.  FLS Industries, a global company, is a substantial worldwide player.  FLS Aerospace, however, has specialised in older planes and has not been a world leader.  It is a relatively new entrant to the field in terms of scale and its profitability has been questioned.  Its current profit and loss position and scale of operation do not fully inspire confidence.</P>
    <P>The issue of employee shareholding should be put upfront on the table.  I put that to FLS and it said it could not give an ESOP within the aerospace company but it would offer it to the parent company.  That should be put on the table as well as the answers to the other questions I raised.</P>
    <P>The staff have made sacrifices in the implementation of the Cahill plan and deserve the same right as has been given to other semi-State employees, for example, Telecom Éireann, <Col N="247" /> through an ESOP.  The success of any air maintenance business depends on the quality, skills and experience of the management team and staff.  Many employees blame the existing management structure for many of the past and present problems.  Where is the track record or evidence that FLS Aerospace has the proven level of contracts and profitability to ensure the future success of TEAM?</P>
    <P>The letters of understanding seem to be legally watertight.  This obstacle to any change in ownership seems to be more a matter for litigation and court clarification than for industrial relations. We must, therefore, expedite legal opinion and provide the subsequent parameters of negotiation. The Government must get off the fence. It should say that it opposes the deal, for whatever valid reasons it wishes to put forward, thereby sacking and replacing management.  Management has said that the only alternative to this deal is the path to extinction.  It also states in its document, &ldquo;TEAM cannot survive as it is now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, the Government, as shareholder, can be a proponent and persuader of the deal. At least it should set out its assessment of the implications for Aer Lingus of acceptance or rejection of the deal.  It seems the unspoken driving force for the sale of TEAM is that Aer Lingus cannot and will not enter into a strategic alliance while TEAM Aer Lingus remains a subsidiary of the parent company.  The Minister must state whether it is the Government's view that that is the starting point for any proposed sale.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Government to dot every &ldquo;i&rdquo; and cross every &ldquo;t&rdquo; in terms of its view on the FLS deal, but it should say whether it accepts that TEAM should remain in 100 per cent ownership of Aer Lingus and whether it supports the discussions entered into by management of Aer Lingus with three companies, after which it chose one.  The basis on which semi-State companies are established is that the Government as shareholder exclusively, with the exception of worker directors, appoints the board which appoints the management to be the best brains in that sector. That has been the case since Sean Lemass's time. If there is to be a new procedure whereby the Minister and the Department are to be the font of all knowledge, why not make that explicitly clear to the board?  I cannot understand why, each time this matter is debated, whether on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or elsewhere, or there is a report about an incident, the Minister is not aware of it.  What is her relationship with the chairman, Mr. Cahill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the other issues in the aviation sector.  When Deputy John Bruton requested this debate, the Taoiseach, in his usual well prepared, Order of Business sound bite, reeled off statements about growth in aviation, buoyancy and jobs, but did not highlight some of the crucial issues and threats to Irish aviation.</P>
      <P>The abolition of duty free facilities will result in a 50 per cent increase in airport charges.  It will move us from No. 46 to the top ten in the league table of airport charges for Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  The record growth we spoke about occurred over a period when airport charges were frozen.  If charges are to be increased by 50 per cent from June of next year, the knock-on effect on airlines will be increased fares and retarded growth as much air travel is leisure related and, therefore, discretionary.</P>
      <P>I would be much more concerned about the future of Shannon airport, which seems increasingly vulnerable with the departure of Aeroflot and the lack of a replacement.  That, together with the decision by the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, to abolish the Shannon stopover, means the mid-west region requires extensive Government support to market and develop new air traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Deputy last visit Shannon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well represented in Shannon &mdash; I see Deputy Carey in the House &mdash; and I get first-hand information.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I hope to visit that area shortly.  His constituency executive is preparing the detailed arrangements for my visit.</P>
      <P>Our ten regional airports face increasing difficulty in their air services, which are diminishing, and in containing costs.  The abolition of duty free sales may be a fatal blow for some of them.  Capital programmes are coming to a halt in many airports, despite Deputy Molloy's stroke that masked the overall under-provision of capital for those airports.  Their future is becoming increasingly uncertain and a proper marketing programme is needed for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta faces not only the loss of duty free income and, as we debated laboriously, liability for the first time for corporation tax and rates, but double payments in the next 12 months &mdash; on vesting day it will pay approximately £14 million for assets and a subsequent annual dividend on the company's resources.  That amounts to in excess of £30 million, at a time when duty free facilities are to be abolished.  The payment for the transfer of assets on vesting day is illogical, punitive and unfair, first, because the company paid <Col N="249" /> for those developments out of its own resources and, second, the existing owner, the Minister, as shareholder of the company, remains the new owner.  For the pleasure of a change of company structure on paper presentation, the Government will raid Aer Rianta for more than £30 million.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's sunny and happy disposition about all these issues.  At the end of the day decisions must be made about TEAM.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs a clear sense of direction from the shareholder and the Government in terms of biting the bullet or rejecting the proposal. Sitting on the fence will become so difficult as time goes by that I hope the Government does not fall off it.  The position of some workers and of management is &ldquo;never the twain shall meet&rdquo;. It is irreconcilable and the Government will not be able to straddle that indefinitely.  It might succeed with the by-election, but not for much longer.  In taking constructive decisions, the Minister will have our support.  The success and security of the employees is paramount, as is the national interest.  We will support whatever option gives the best security to the aviation sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Yates, for sharing his time with me.  I will not repeat the issues raised by the Deputy because I want to concentrate my few minutes on the Ryanair dispute, but suffice to say that the aviation industry is a major industry which provides thousands of jobs, particularly in the Dublin airport and Shannon airport areas.</P>
      <P>It is not a cliché to say that if the aviation industry or any of the operations at Dublin Airport catches a cold everybody north of the river Liffey takes Lemsip, Anadin or aspirin to cure it as quickly as possible.  We in North Dublin know how dependent we are on the tremendous incomes generated at the airport and for the way in which they permeate all the businesses in the constituency and in the area north of the Liffey.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Yates, for raising some of the continuing difficulties at TEAM Aer Lingus.  It is not enough for the Minster to make the odd statement saying she will not intervene. Workers at TEAM want to know if she will fulfil the commitments set out in the relevant letters and if she will honour the commitment that only 49 per cent of the company will be sold.  Perhaps they will like her answers.  In the meantime, they are working in a vacuum, their lives are in turmoil and they do not know where they will be at any time within the next year.  The Government is good at sitting on the fence but it is time for the Minister to get off the fence, otherwise she will need a medicament.</P>

      <P>The ongoing dispute at Ryanair is extremely damaging.  It is damaging to the young workers in the baggage handling section who do not want to be on work stoppages.  They have written to me saying they want to be back at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is damaging to the morale of the other trade union members at Dublin Airport because they see fellow workers having to take this kind of action.  It is also damaging to the national interest because the implications of the dispute go well beyond the baggage handlers. Article 40.6 of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions. That is something we cherish.</P>
      <P>The various national partnership agreements over the past ten years have enabled us to enjoy unprecedented industrial peace.  This has led to large scale investment, increased prosperity and a huge growth in employment.  This has arisen because of the efforts of many thousands of men and women who go to work early in the morning or late at night.  Both management and workers have gained from their work output.</P>
      <P>Social partnership has been the key to our present prosperity.  The dynamic, enlightened leadership of the trade unions under social partnership conditions has helped to change the more traditional stereotype of trade unions when they were seen as opposing management on behalf of workers.  Social partnership has worked and we must all guard it carefully because the country will lose if it breaks down.</P>
      <P>However, it is under severe strain because of the Ryanair dispute.  Like other workers, the baggage handlers have the right to have their point of view put forward by a trade union, in this case SIPTU.  They also have the right to have their conditions of work and pay examined.  If they want representation they have, at the least, the right to make that case in the structures we as legislators have established to ensure that people have their voices heard.  They have the right to go to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structures are in place to allow for negotiation and arbitration and Fine Gael has always believed that they should be used, not just by workers but also by management.  We support the concept of the voluntary code, which has also been supported by the trade unions.  The high level group, which was established under Partnership 2000 and on which the unions are represented, made an interim report last Christmas. It recommended that the voluntary code should be used.  The group is due to look again at the concept of a voluntary code because of the Ryanair dispute and the way in which the code is being strained to the limit by Ryanair management.  In this regard I am reminded of the wisdom of my <Col N="251" /> colleague, Councillor Philip Jenkinson, one of the first to make a statement on the Ryanair dispute, when he said that the regressive policy of management at Ryanair of refusing to recognise the basic right of workers to have their professional negotiators accepted is wrong for the company and the industry.  He went on to say that success must be built on teamwork and a progressive company must adopt a partnership approach in seeking excellence of performance from its workforce. Fine Gael hoped that Ryanair would listen to this advice, however, the company's intransigence is putting at risk the acceptance of the voluntary code.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that a company such as Ryanair, which has been innovative and open in the past, is now being so short-sighted and cavalier in its approach to the request of its workers.  The company is putting at risk the industrial harmony from which it benefited.  The growth of the company can be linked to the growth of the economy. Increased prosperity has enabled more people to spend more money on flying.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1998 the Chief Executive of Ryanair, Mr. O'Leary, wrote to Evelyn Owen saying that since the company had not requested the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court to investigate or intervene in the action it would not accept her invitation.  One can imagine the horror that would have been expressed if Ryanair had made an appeal to the Labour Court and SIPTU had written to it declining an invitation to attend on the basis that it had not sought a meeting.  The company should attend the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>In a notice pinned to the staff notice board Mr. O'Leary advised that the company had maintained its silence on this issue, was not stirring up debate and had, therefore, taken the lollipop from SIPTU who had used up all its scare tactics. That is not the kind of message to bring people together.  Why did Mr. O'Leary see fit to use megaphone public relations to put the case for Ryanair on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on RTE Radio 1?  The Labour Court is the venue for that. He attempted to answer some of the issues raised by Paul O'Sullivan of SIPTU on the programme. Why did he not attend the Labour Court to discuss them?  Perhaps he is right and maybe there is another argument.  However, he should not have used a popular radio show to engage in public debate on issues that are specifically suited to the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.  It was a mistake.  Mr. O'Sullivan will regret that he uttered his first public statement on the dispute on a popular radio show and not within the established industrial relations structures.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to decide who has the right information on this dispute.  We are told by management that none of the flights has been cancelled yet two people I know who had flights booked with Ryanair arrived on time for their flight but were told without explanation that they would be <Col N="252" /> flying an hour to an hour and a half late.  Their flight was not full and the company brought two or three flights together.  When they eventually boarded the flight it was packed.  This amounted to a cancellation by another name.  Such behaviour is affecting the schedules.</P>
    <P>Workers at the company have told me that they have been subject to intimidatory action by the management.  Will the Labour Court look into this?  Perhaps this is not the case, but these workers consider that they are being browbeaten and put under severe pressure.  It is not for us to make judgments on these matters.  They should be discussed under the relevant established mechanisms, such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>Ryanair has been a remarkable success in the aviation business.  The high cost of flying decreased when the company started to operate. However, it has also been the beneficiary of Government policies and decisions.  For example, when the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, was Minister for Transport he gave the company exclusive rights to fly to Stansted, a route which Aer Lingus had developed.  Aer Lingus was not happy about the decision but it helped Ryanair over a difficult period and allowed the company to stay in the market.  As flying passengers we were grateful because it ensured lower air fares. Ryanair has benefited from Government policy and it has an obligation to show that it is willing to listen to its workers.  It is time it used the system.</P>
    <P>The chief executive gained £17 million when Ryanair was publicly quoted.  That figure frightened young workers trying to rear families and pay mortgages from their earnings of between £8,000 and £15,000 a year.  They listened to Mr. O'Leary say the company will negotiate with workers over his dead body.  However, Ryanair would not exist without baggage handlers and other workers.  Mr. O'Leary should wake up and listen.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Ryanair management not to allow words such as &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; become part of the language of industrial relations.  We will rue the day that happens.  We have gained from the social partnership approach, the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court mechanisms.  Guilt will fall on Ryanair's head if the words &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; come back into industrial relations.  It would be a bad day for management and trade unions if that happened.  The continual refusal of Ryanair to come to the table may be to everybody's detriment and force the reintroduction of concepts in social partnership which we do not want.  This side has sympathy with the actions of the Ryanair workers and we call on the management to use the mechanisms available.  I hope this dispute can be brought to a speedy conclusion for the betterment not only of the Ryanair workers, but also to better the trade union and social partnership system that has been built up so carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in welcoming Ryanair workers who are in the Public Gallery.  I also welcome the debate.  The aviation industry is undergoing a period of rapid change and it is proper that it is discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>The importance of aviation policy to the overall performance of our economy is growing and will continue to do so in the future.  It represents a key component of many of our most important industries.  In 1996 alone, eight million people went through Dublin Airport.  That is projected to increase to almost 12 million over the next decade or so.  However, even that figure, although impressive, hides the significance of aviation policy to trade, particularly our export trade.</P>
      <P>Recent developments including the deregulation of the industry have opened up to the ordinary population the possibility of using air transport. The emergence of low cost operators in competition with the more traditional high cost services has increased choice and competition within the industry and the net effect has been a substantial increase in the numbers choosing air transport.  The high cost and low cost services complement each other.</P>
      <P>Tourism, one of our most important and dynamic industries, has benefited.  However, if this industry's impressive growth path is to continue, the evolution of a successful aviation policy is necessary.  I welcome the part this debate will play towards arriving at that policy.  I again emphasise that the Labour Party strongly supports the development and expansion of the Irish aerospace industry.  We are anxious that it is allowed to operate with the maximum commercial freedom commensurate with the interests of those who work in the industry and the consumer who must dictate the future.  We are open to examining the best structures to achieve those objectives while maintaining democratic accountability in the House and maximising the social control of the industry.</P>
      <P>Key to the success of the aviation industry in recent years has been the improved performance of the flagship company in this field, Aer Lingus. The implementation of the Cahill plan, finally agreed between employers and unions, has been central to making Aer Lingus competitive again. The injection of £175 million of equity at the insistence of my party has allowed Aer Lingus to reposition itself within the market and to retain its market share.  In so doing, Aer Lingus was allowed escape the problem of under-capitalisation which was foisted upon it by previous Fianna Fáil led Governments.  The company's performance since 1993 has vindicated my party's insistence at that time that this investment must go ahead.</P>

    <P>However, if it is to continue to grow, Aer Lingus cannot afford to stand still.  Such is the pace of change in the worldwide aviation industry, companies which stand still will ultimately fail.  My party has an open mind on the question of a future strategic partner for Aer Lingus.  As in the past, we are committed to its success.  The <Col N="254" /> Labour Party has been to the fore in recent years in securing viable strategic partners for some of our State companies.  Strategic partnership has fundamentally altered the debate about publicly owned companies.  The sterile debate about ownership, private versus public, which dominated political discourse in the 1980s and early 1990s, has given way to a more realistic discussion about how best a company can maximise its business and employment through co-operation with other companies on strategic issues.</P>
    <P>The debate about strategic alliance has particular significance for Ireland.  In a global industry, none of our domestic companies, however large, are capable of being world or even European players.  To succeed they need to identify niches in world markets and co-operation with major world players is a key component to this.  The Labour Party has no difficulty with a strategic partner for Aer Lingus.  However, that partner must be chosen on one criteria only, which is the ability of the strategic partner to assist Aer Lingus to grow.  The Exchequer has not been good to Aer Lingus in the past.  The search for a strategic partner for Aer Lingus cannot be Exchequer driven.</P>
    <P>As we saw with the acquisition of a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann, one of the key components of a successful alliance with any company is the full acquiescence following consultation of workers.  What is good for Telecom Éireann is also good for Aer Lingus in this regard.  Whatever happens at Aer Lingus must be buttressed by the active consent of the workforce and enhanced stakeholding by workers in the future of their company.  Unfortunately, the signs are that the Government is not committed to this type of development in the semi-State sector.  The Air Transport (Navigation) Bill, for example, which was introduced by the Minister, specifically sets out to undermine the role of worker directors.  So much for partnership.  It also gives leave to the Minister to sell Aer Rianta without further recourse to the Dáil.  The Minister said that is not the case and she will come back to me on that aspect.  However, this type of ministerial <i>carte blanche</i> in a Bill creates mistrust and unease among workforces.</P>
    <P>The Government appears to have a particular hang up with Aer Rianta.  The intent behind the Bill is clear.  It is to enable Aer Rianta to be sold off without prior consultation and agreement with its workforce or the Dáil.  The Bill is ideologically driven by a Progressive Democrats obsession with the type of privatisation we witnessed in Britain in the 1980s and Fianna Fáil's traditional indifference to the semi-State sector which is contrary to the rhetoric we are used to hearing from that party.  The Bill does not meet or attempt to meet the needs of the company as we approach a new millennium.  Aer Rianta has been one of our most successful semi-State companies at home and abroad.  Its success abroad has shown the way for many Irish public and private companies.  In addition to its much publicised <Col N="255" /> international duty sales free sales expansion, Aer Rianta has bought shares in non-Irish airports, including a 40 per cent share in Birmingham International Airport.  Many other semi-State companies, such as the ESB, have since followed suit.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's overall performance is also impressive.  Since 1969 when the management of Cork and Shannon Airports was ceded to Aer Rianta, the company has contributed more than £207 million directly to the Exchequer.  This figure does not include PAYE and PRSI payments by workers or taxes paid by the company.  Some £136 million of that figure represents contributions since 1987 alone, the period which coincides with increased competition in the aviation industry.  Prior to 1986, the Exchequer contributed up to £57 million in capital investment to the company.  Significantly, since 1987 Aer Rianta has generated its own capital resources.  In that period alone, Aer Rianta has funded from its own resources a £224 million capital programme.  This is a credible performance by the company under any criteria.  Other performance figures are also impressive.  Passenger traffic at the airports under Aer Rianta's direct management rose to almost 12 million in 1996, a figure achieved without any appreciable change in staffing levels at the company. Given this background the current approach being adopted by this Government is particularly perplexing.</P>
    <P>Like Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta faces challenges in the years ahead, and we have already debated the abolition of duty free, which is the main challenge. This was forced upon us by the cowardice of the current Taoiseach when, as Minister for Finance in 1991, he failed to stand up to his ministerial colleagues in Europe.  Last year, Aer Rianta raised over £26 million from the duty free industry. It now faces the total abolition of his source of revenue, with all the implications for higher airports costs and job losses that means, thanks to the Taoiseach.  The Government's response to this problem has been paltry.  A study to examine the implications for the economy of the abolition of duty free has yet to be published despite being commissioned by the previous Government almost nine months ago.  To use an aviation phrase, the Government's campaign to reverse this destructive decision has hardly got off the ground.  Deputy O'Rourke has been chosen as the Taoiseach's patsy on this occasion, and she has endured shutting doors all over Europe as she attempts to undo the damage done by the Taoiseach.</P>

Deputy McCreevy is known for <Col N="256" /> his directness and honesty, and if Deputy O'Rourke reads his speech she will stop wasting energy in trying to reverse the decision taken by the Taoiseach in 1991.

      <P>I do not intend to dwell on that matter as it was discussed this week.  However, it does provide a context within which this Government's attitude to Aer Rianta can be properly appraised. The Government's proposed legislation will do nothing to ensure the future success of this company. It proposes, for instance, to take up to £20 million out of the company for the Exchequer at a time when it is already facing its most difficult challenge since developing the duty free industry and giving it to the world.</P>
      <P>It is not just duty free that will go.  A smash and grab raid is being carried out for the purposes of turning this organisation into a semi-State body for no good reason.  The only justification is that the Government will take as much as it can while it owns the company, as the Minister will still be the only shareholder.  The Government proposes taking £20 million from Aer Rianta at a time when it will be forced to increase landing charges by up to 50 per cent.  The Minister demonstrated her concern in this area in the debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill. She should consider persuading Deputy McCreevy to leave Aer Rianta's money alone; the company needs it more than he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy towards TEAM Aer Lingus is also being driven, not by the strategic interests of that company or its workforce, but by short-term political and Exchequer concerns.  The chosen buyer of the company has limited experience in aircraft maintenance.  It deals mainly with cement, an area in which it is very experienced and profitable.  On any level it fails the criteria I outlined which should govern any strategic alliance or partnership.  The only reason the <Col N="257" /> Government has not already sold TEAM Aer Lingus to FLS is the pending by-election in Dublin North.  Notwithstanding the assurances being given to the TEAM workforce by Minister O'Rourke, I predict that the company will be sold lock, stock and barrel as soon as the Labour victory in that by-election is announced.  Aer Lingus will withdraw the £65 million in loans it has made to TEAM, precipitating the bankruptcy of the latter and forcing the TEAM employees back to Aer Lingus, where they will be told there is no work and made redundant.</P>
    <P>The people of north Dublin can send a clear message to this Government about TEAM Aer Lingus.  I remind the Minister of the 1,500 workers doing an excellent job in difficult circumstances in TEAM.  They are implementing a five year programme put in place by the last Government and supported by the then Opposition. TEAM is ahead of schedule with that programme, but we are now to sell the company in a rush.  I asked the Minister how FLS was picked, and she wrote me a letter to tell me that a trawl was done to see who could buy TEAM Aer Lingus.  There were three candidates, but two lost interest so the Government was stuck with the last.  Obviously the Minister knows nothing about this; there is no mention of it in her speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Deputy Stagg should not fool himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although she is the shareholder who owns the company.  Her management is about to sell TEAM to a company about which I have some concerns.  I predict that TEAM will be flogged when the by-election is over, contrary to the promises given to the workforce by the Taoiseach, and repeated since by Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>It would be instructive to look at the latest company returns to the Register of Companies by FLS Aerospace Holding, TEAM's new proposed partner.  In 1996 the company lost £9.4 million. The company is losing money like a sieve, and if it was quoted on the Stock Exchange its share price would collapse, despite the fact that £34 million was pumped into FLS in 1995 and 1996 by its parent company.  This failed to turn around the company's performance.  In this sense it compares unfavourably with TEAM Aer Lingus, which is a better operation than the company which is supposed to rescue it.  It is not difficult to deduce from the companies' own figures that FLS Aerospace is totally dependent on its parent company for its continued existence.  The question must be raised as to how long the parent company will be prepared to bail out its ailing subsidiary.  That stark reality, as outlined by FLS aerospace itself, is far from the &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; company promised by the Government to TEAM and its workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much criticism in the House of the letters of guarantee held by TEAM workers, the existence of which forms the only substantial obstacle to the Government's plans.  I remind <Col N="258" /> Members that these letters of guarantee were given to the workforce by a Fianna Fáil Government and continuously endorsed by that party. Workers have a right to represent themselves effectively.  They have this card and, rightly, they intend to play it.  They have my full support in that.  The Government has repeatedly stated that any change in the status of TEAM can only come about with the full and active consent of its workforce. It is high time they began to take this promise seriously.  However, as the first nine months of the Government's tenure has indicated, promises made prior to its election are cheap.  I ask the Minister in the context of TEAM to deal with this matter in a hands on way.  The Minister will complain that if she adopts a hands on approach she will be accused of political interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard her make that case previously. She cannot be totally divorced from a situation where the management of one of her companies is proposing to sell the company despite the promises made by the Minister and the Taoiseach to the workforce that only 49 per cent would be sold to the workforce and that the letters of guarantee stand.  The Minister must make it clear to her management that it can only sell within the policy guidelines she lays down.  All we have heard from the Minister is that she has no news of this and that nothing has landed on her desk.  It is time the Minister looked for full briefing from the management on what is happening.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to an issue which, though outside the remit of aviation policy <i>per se</i>, is damaging the aviation industry and has much wider implications.  I referred earlier to the emergence of low cost carriers.  On the whole they are to be welcomed but not on the backs of their workers.  I am pleased that my colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, will later today launch his Trade Union Recognition Bill.  Ryanair, a low cost operator which is hugely profitable for its owners and managers, has achieved these profits by paying low wages to its workers.</P>
      <P>In seeking to continue its high profit operation, Ryanair refuses to discuss conditions and wages with the selected representatives of the workers in the company.  I roundly condemn Ryanair and its massively wealthy director for his Victorian attitudes.  Who does Mr. O'Leary think created the £17 million he has taken out of the company in recent times?  The workforce created that money.  They are the people he will not allow to join a union and if they do he will not negotiate with it.  Does he agree that the workers in his company are entitled to a share of the wealth they have created and to have professionals of their choice to negotiate a fair share of that wealth on their behalf?  The answer is obvious, they are so entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Ryanair baggage handlers of the full support of the Labour Party for union recognition <Col N="259" /> and invite some of them back here next Tuesday and Wednesday when Deputy Broughan's Private Members' Bill is debated.  I call on the Government today to accept that Bill, given the speeches made earlier.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue today.  In three years the single currency will be in place and the Single Market will be a reality. Ireland's capacity to take advantage of that new economic situation to consolidate our recent high levels of economic growth will depend largely on the capacity of our infrastructure to facilitate that growth.  Our aerospace industry is a crucial component of that infrastructure and I am concerned that it is not in safe hands with this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister lay out her policy on aviation matters.  Much of the debate did not concentrate on the global aviation area in the sense that we would understand a national aviation policy.  I agree she has a coherent and comprehensive policy but it has to be looked at against a background of a great many Governments who did not have such a policy.  On numerous occasions Irish aviation policy has suffered because of the excessive influence of Aer Lingus, particularly at sensitive times.  This is something that must be guarded against.  Nobody could argue with the tenets of competitiveness based on reliable, regular access, cost effective airports &mdash; the key element of any aviation policy &mdash; and the safety factor which tends to be forgotten except when a tragic accident is reported in news bulletins.  The growth in UK traffic from 2.7 million to 7.6 million over a ten year period is impressive.  Those making projections in 1987 would not have come anywhere near to forecasting that growth figure.  Given the many variables in aviation policy, it is difficult to predict the likely outcome in any circumstance.</P>
      <P>That Aer Rianta has managed not to increase its charges in that ten year period is an important contributory factor to the growth rate.  There are others.  That the Minister has included it as one of her three key objectives is an important acknowledgment of that fact.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear what Deputy Stagg had to say about TEAM Aer Lingus.  If I understood him correctly, he said that if Senator Ryan is successful in the forthcoming by-election in Dublin North the news is bad for TEAM Aer Lingus and its workers.  I presume the corollary is that if the Fianna Fáil candidate is successful, the news is good for TEAM Aer Lingus.  I would agree with that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the free market within the European economic area.  Regulations are driven by the Commission to ensure this.  The major powers, particularly Britain, France and Germany, control important and strategic slots at their own main airports, such as Heathrow.  While technically obeying the European economic free market regulations, effectively because of their power they are able to control it to the benefit <Col N="260" /> of their own national airlines.  We need to take cognisance of this because clearly we do not have the same power.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the huge level of growth at Dublin Airport.  While, at first glance, this may be excellent news I am not convinced that &mdash; if it continues &mdash; it is in the best interests of Dublin, the nation or the staff.  This leads to the creation of more yellow-pack type jobs and plays into the management strategy of the Ryanairs of this world.  In the longer term that is not beneficial to Irish aviation interests or to the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>We need to look carefully at the road access problems which have been created.  The Minister has undertaken a study in relation to train access. The reality is that the cost may be excessive.  If growth continues at its present rate over a two or three year period the current and planned extensions will be scarcely enough.  In that context I question whether it is sensible and to anybody's benefit to continue to offer the rates of discount which are being offered at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Irish Aviation Authority which plays a key and central role in the entire aviation scene.  Excellent standards are maintained by the authority.  Excellent work is done and certainly it has made an enormous contribution. Aer Lingus is also a key player and its restructuring programme proved painful for many in the company.</P>

      <P>National surveys of reading attainment of 11 year old pupils in fifth class in primary schools have taken place at regular intervals over the past 25 years.  These have been conducted by the inspectorate in my Department in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre, ERC, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  The most recent survey was held in 1993.  The next survey will take place in 1998.  National surveys in mathematics have been less frequent.  The last such survey was conducted in 1984 involving fifth and sixth class pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to initiate a process to commence a national survey of literacy and numeracy standards at primary level in the forthcoming school year.  In this context, my Department is consulting the ERC regarding plans for national five year <Col N="261" /> surveys in English reading for fifth class pupils and in mathematics for fourth class pupils.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible up to now to make a direct comparison between such national surveys and international surveys.  This is because the international surveys have dealt with different age groups and involved different test instruments. Many countries are in the process of developing national systems of performance of pupils and linking these to international studies of achievement.  As part of a restructuring of the inspectorate in my Department, an audit unit is being developed for this purpose and plans are being finalised to conduct more regular surveys of attainment.</P>
    <P>At second level, no national surveys of attainment have been conducted.  However, Irish second level pupils have taken part in international reading literacy surveys for 14 year olds in 1991 and in the third international mathematics and science study for third class primary pupils and first and second year second level pupils in 1995.</P>
    <P>The international reading literacy study was conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, IEA.  The study showed that Irish nine year olds ranked twelfth out of 27 countries and, in the case of 14 year olds, twentieth out of 31 countries.  The data from the IEA study was further analysed by the ERC in 1994 and this indicated that between 6.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of Irish 14 year olds have serious literacy problems.  This figure, which was published by the ERC, is broadly similar to the national figures from the 1993 survey.  The mathematics results in 1995 showed significant improvement in Ireland's performance over earlier studies in 1988 and 1992.  Ireland ranked seventh out of 16 countries among third class pupils and twelfth out of 27 countries in the case of the 13 year olds in first and second year at second level.</P>
    <P>In general terms, Ireland has fared at or slightly above the international average in both English and mathematics.  It is towards the top of the middle band among participating countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also participate in an OECD survey of the achievement of 15 year old pupils in reading and mathematics which is scheduled for the year 2000.  This will be the first time a comparison can be made in key curricular areas.  Its outcome will also enable us to make comparisons with the outcomes of the junior certificate examination which the vast majority of pupils take at 15 years of age.</P>
    <P>No national survey of adult literacy levels has been conducted by the Department of Education and Science.  A 1995 international adult literacy survey across the age range from 16 to 64 showed that about 25 per cent of the Irish population was found to score at the lowest level, level 1.  The young adults in the age group of 16 to 24 who were surveyed had a much lower percentage scoring at level 1, 16 per cent, than for the overall group.  This is much more in line with the national <Col N="262" /> survey of adult literacy for nine year olds and the international survey of 1991 for 14 year olds.  As a result of the problems identified, the budget for adult education has been substantially increased from £2.315 million in 1997 to £4.065 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>In essence, for the reasons outlined, the historical picture has been one of irregular surveys and a limited capacity to make meaningful international comparisons.  For the future it is my intention that national surveys should be more frequent and closely linked with international surveys.  National five year surveys are planned, in English reading in 1998, 2003 and 2008 for fifth class pupils and in mathematics in 1999, 2004 and 2009 for fourth class pupils.  These will be conducted by the ERC.  The necessary arrangements are being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I admire his honesty in stating we have been complacent about this issue. Will he agree the OECD findings come as a shock?  It found that 25 per cent of adults scored at the lowest level and that 16 per cent of those in the age group of 16 to 25 have serious literacy problems and would not be able to function in a normal job.  That should shake us from complacency.</P>
      <P>There are plans to conduct surveys at first level.  Will the Minister agree there is a need to conduct surveys at second level?  The OECD survey showed that 20 per cent of Irish 13 and 14 year olds were low achievers in reading.  This compares with a figure of 5 per cent in France and Finland and 10 per cent in Sweden and Switzerland. Many children are not successful in making the transition from primary to second level. Will the Minister agree there should be an assessment of the entire system, not just a commitment to conduct the odd survey in future?  We need action to respond to these serious problems.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I am as concerned as he is about the irregularity of surveys over the past 20 years of standards in mathematics and reading.  I am determined to ensure there will be national five year surveys at primary level.  In September Ireland will host a physics colloquium at UCC which will mark the culmination of an international comparative survey of performance in physics at second level.  It will set a benchmark for similar exercises with other EU countries in all second level subject areas.</P>
      <P>We need data as a basic requirement for policy formation.  There is also a need for initiatives in early education.  A review of the primary curriculum is under way.  There has to be intervention to improve the position.</P>

We can no longer say that data collection is an issue, the issue is why are 13 and 14 year olds <Col N="263" /> four times worse than their counterparts in Finland and France?  Is there a problem about the way children are educated in making the transition from primary to second level?  Is the Minister aware the ASTI has indicated that almost one third of children at second level have literacy problems?  Will he agree to initiate policy responses in schools rather than focus solely on information gathering?  While this is laudable, there is a need for action.</P>

That is the reason a major national forum on early education is being held in the next two to three weeks at which all the partners will be brought together to develop a coherent national strategy.  International experience shows that early intervention can have a marked impact on literacy standards and educational performance.</P>
      <P>We are also putting in place a pilot project for eight to 15 year olds which is being co-financed by the European Commission.  That programme will be launched shortly, it will focus on the issue of transition from primary to second level and identifying early on in the system children in difficulty and most likely to leave school in first or second year of second level.  I would point out that on coming into office I discovered that we do not have a comprehensive database for primary education.  That is an immediate priority of this scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister arrange to put in place a tracking programme for every pupil so that we can follow pupils as they go from primary to second level and perhaps an early drop out? Will he also seriously examine the fact that only 2 per cent of his primary education budget goes to disadvantaged areas?  These are serious issues that need to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the figure of 2 per cent, but if the Deputy was listening to my contribution in the Seanad last evening in response to the motion tabled by Senator Joe O'Toole he would know that I told the Senators I was committed to the introduction of a tracking system for primary schools and that such a tracking system was about to be launched.  It is regrettable that one was not in place before I came into office because such a system is a fundamental part of any strategic attack on low standards.  The IT 2000 plan that we unveiled in November, which involves a £50 million investment, represents a radical tool in terms of dealing with remedial education and <Col N="264" /> strategies to help children experiencing difficulty in numeracy and literacy.</P>
      <P>I listened to the debate on the Education Bill yesterday and I was encouraged by the consensus among Deputies that there was a need for more remedial teachers throughout the system as they are extremely important in helping students cope with literacy and numeracy difficulties.  Clearly emphasis must be on strategies such as the appointment and allocation of greater numbers of remedial and resource teachers, targeting disadvantage and special needs children in particular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, a graded system of sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a code of behaviour appropriate to its needs.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area.  While the guidelines recognise that there is a need for sanctions, including temporary suspension, in order to register disapproval of unacceptable behaviour, they stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort.  In reaching decisions in individual cases, school authorities have to balance carefully the needs of individual students with their responsibility to the general body of their students.  In the context of imposing sanctions, schools are advised that they should ensure the rules of natural justice apply and pupils are advised of their right to appeal.</P>
      <P>The Report on Discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, has been made available to every school.  The report sets out models of best practice and is a valuable resource for schools.  The report also indicates that curriculum change, especially the new programmes at second level such as the transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme are impacting positively on students and contribute to a reduction in breaches of discipline.  The introduction of the junior certificate school elementary programme will further assist in matching the abilities, aptitudes and interests of each student which will in turn impact positively on the behaviour of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service. <Col N="265" /> This will be a resource for school management and help them in dealing with vital areas such as school planning and discipline.  I intend to put this service in place for the new school year in consultation with the partners in education.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill which is currently before the House provides for a statutory right of appeal against decisions of boards of management including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion.  This right of appeal will greatly strengthen the capacity to balance all rights and obligations in this difficult area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Extreme cases make bad law but I am sure the Minister will agree there are instances in which particular pupils are removed from a school in the overall interests of the operation of the school.  Two issues arise at that stage.  Can an alternative place be found for the child or where can the child go?  Another issue which has concerned me for some time is the fact that children who are expelled from second level school are not given another place in the education system.  How does the Minister intend to address that?  I do not doubt there are difficulties in this regard but it is not good enough to remove children from the education system without some other service being provided for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is unacceptable that students are expelled from a school without alternative programmes being put in place for them. The programme for eight to 15 year olds that I have outlined is a positive move in that direction in terms of providing models of intervention which will enable school managements to provide alternative programmes for children who are being disruptive for whatever reason.  These programmes will enable students to reintegrate back into the mainstream.  That must be a fundamental requirement.  When a child is expelled for misbehaviour there are obviously factors behind the misbehaviour exhibited in the classroom.  It could be for social reasons, the child might come from a dysfunctional family or the question of substance abuse might arise.  Children are disruptive in class for a host of reasons.  In the first instance we need proper assessment and identification of the child's difficulties and then proper intervention strategies.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that to date we have not had the range of intervention programmes that are necessary.  Youthreach is one such programme for 15 to 18 year olds which has been successful.  I have announced an additional 1,000 Youthreach places in traveller centres this year alone.  The programme for eight to 15 year olds will complement that initiative and will develop strategies in consultation with the area partnerships in terms of establishing programmes locally to combat the problem.</P>

      <P>In relation to the extreme cases we are talking about, will the Minister not agree that in the majority of these cases the main problem is that parents are either not inclined to co-operate with the school authorities or do not make themselves available?  Is it not true that in the interests of all children we need to put more responsibility on parents while providing the necessary support so that parents in dysfunctional families can develop the necessary parenting skills to allow the problem to be dealt with where it arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We need to expand the home-school liaison programme which has been successful. It is regrettable that it was not expanded at the appropriate rate.  I have visited many schools throughout the country operating home-school liaison programmes and I have met some home-school liaison teachers.  Much of their work involves bringing parents into the schools, particularly parents who may be experiencing problems themselves.  Participating in parenting programmes and co-operating with the schools in terms of the child's development is a step forward in dealing with this particular problem.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, in accordance with the rules, a school cannot expel a child under the age of 15 without the board authorising the decision and without providing an alternative programme for that child.  I understand the difficulties but that is the legal position and schools should be conscious of that.  They may not expel a child under 15 without having found an alternative programme for that child and without ensuring that the board of management takes the decision.</P>

      <P>I will give that undertaking.  We need to quantify the number of expulsions and suspensions throughout the system.  When I came into office there was no requirement on schools to notify the Department about expulsions. Invariably the Department found out about them from parents who were anxious to relocate their <Col N="267" /> child in a particular school.  The post-primary unit in the Department would receive up to 3,000 such requests on an ongoing basis and it proactively tries to find alternative places for the children concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The finding that approximately 25 per cent of Irish adults aged between 16 and 65 have very low levels of literacy was unexpected and is a cause for grave concern.  It showed that a considerable number of adults would benefit greatly from further education.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey for Ireland, which was the first of its kind ever carried out in this country, were published on 28 October last.  At the publication the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Dea, stated that adult education had not been given the priority it deserved.  In seeking to correct the situation as a matter of urgency, he set the following objectives: (a) he intends to increase public awareness of the importance of literacy in the modern world; (b) he will set out proposals in the forthcoming Green Paper on Adult Education which will develop a proper policy framework on all aspects of adult education and will give priority to those who left the formal system without qualifications; and (c) he will ensure that adequate funding will be made available to support a wide range of adult education services and will insist that priority is given to adult basic education.</P>
      <P>As an immediate response to the report, a significant increase was made in the 1997 budget for adult literacy.  In addition, in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 3 December 1997 the budget for adult literacy was increased by £2 million to £4.065 million.  That additional funding represents an increase of nearly double the initial 1997 provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Vocational Education Association, the representative body for vocational education committees, has been asked for its observations on how to put the extra funds to most effective use.  The matter will also be discussed with the National Adult Literacy Agency.  It has, however, been decided that the funds will be used entirely <Col N="268" /> for literacy to the exclusion of community education.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto states that the adult literacy and community education budget would be increased to a minimum of £4 million and that commitment was honoured within months of our taking office.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to increase the provision for the relief of adult illiteracy as resources permit. The development of the adult literacy service will be treated in the forthcoming Green Paper on Adult Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the implications of the survey, three main issues are highlighted in its findings.  The Minister dealt with one of them, adult literacy programmes.  Will the Minister agree that the findings support the view expressed in the Green Paper on Education, that a great number of people fall within the lower and middle range of literacy scales and are unable to participate fully in the economic and civic life of today's advanced nation?  That is a horrendous finding in anyone's language.  Will the Minister set up structures to provide for consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to see what can be done to improve people's participation in economic life, particularly in the industrial sector?  I will not detail the roots of the problem which are outlined in the survey, but it is necessary to identify them and come up with solid findings on how we can address the problem of a level of under performance in Irish industry compared to other nations of the developed world in tasks involving literacy skills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no difficulty in undertaking such collaboration with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Many of the initiatives in the realm of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are important in assisting adults generally, particularly the long-term unemployed, return to education.  We took a step in that direction by doubling the budget for adult literacy, but we must do more in the years ahead for the wider provision of education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of those surveyed over 45 years of age would have had no experience of second level education.  The vast majority of the older population would have left school at primary level and that is a factor.  Early school leavers feature highly in terms of low literacy standards.  One-third of the population have little involvement in activities requiring a functional level of literacy. By that I mean writing letters, visiting libraries and so on.  It is a matter of considerable concern that we had a higher percentage at level one, the lowest level of literacy measured in the survey, than the other countries surveyed with the exception of Poland.  Our figure of 14 per cent in respect of the higher levels four and five was a lower percentage than the other countries surveyed with the exception of Poland.  One could <Col N="269" /> argue that the countries surveyed were the more industrial and economically advanced.  The survey included Canada, United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.  I am extremely concerned about the survey findings and I accept the Deputy's points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughton Mr. Naughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughton</NameTxt>
      <P>To put this in perspective, half a million of our people have basic literacy problems. That is a cause for concern in areas outside the education system.  There are serious problems concerning paracetamol poisoning.  Some people cannot read the information on the back of a box of paracetamol tablets.  Resources need to be invested in the programmes but greater participation in them is also required.  The level of participation in some areas has been quite low and we must tackle that.  The Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto states that the Government will formulate and implement a national policy.  Will the Government do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that.  We are in the process of formulating a Green Paper and inviting submissions from all the groups involved. Groups such as NALA, the vocational education committees, Aontas and other organisations have experience in the field of adult literacy provision and adult education generally.  It is important to draw on their experience and utilise it in terms of the proper allocation of the additional money that has been made available.  Double the initial financial provision has now been provided.  I am a great believer in not throwing money at problems. Many submissions were made in advance of the election by respective interest groups, which proposed that at a minimum it was necessary to double the budget.  We successfully did that within months of coming into office, but in addition to that it is necessary to have a policy dimension to tackling this problem.  That is where the Green Paper and consultation with the various bodies come into play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister seemed to be surprised at the scale of the literacy problem.  Does the Minister agree that to have one out every four adults with basic literacy problems is a result one might get in a Third World country, not in a country that has had compulsory primary education for as long as the State is in existence and free second level education for the past 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this report was published what consideration has the Minister given to what is going wrong with the education system which has produced this appalling literacy problem?  Has he examined what is happening in primary education?  To what extent are pupils leaving primary school without being able to read or write properly?  I welcome the measures put forward in the adult education sector, but does the Minister accept that there has been a problem in the education system generally? <Col N="270" /> Will he indicate what the problem is and what has and is being done to address it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be careful not to draw simplistic conclusions about a survey which has an extensive age profile.  Many of those surveyed did not have a second level education.  &ldquo;Low level one&rdquo; as it is described in the report equates with the reading ability of an average 12 year old.  The OECD report was well known nine to 12 months ago and very little action was taken when the Deputy's party was in Government.  Successive Governments cannot take credit for the level of investment in adult literacy.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of the primary curriculum is under way and we hope the new curriculum will be published by the end of this year.  It is being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in consultation with the partners and will involve a greater emphasis on literacy and numeracy standards.  In response to an earlier question I announced that we intend to have a national survey every five years on literacy and numeracy standards so that we will be in a better position to monitor the situation than in the past.  It was agreed earlier that it was a matter of regret that such surveys were irregular in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the finding in the study that the likelihood of people with low literacy achievements participating in adult education was about one fifth of that of the more accomplished?  Does the Minister agree that if adult education is to serve those with literacy problems he must have novel outreach initiatives to target those people?  While he &mdash; rightly &mdash; congratulates himself for making more money available to promote literacy, does he agree that £6 per person with literacy problems will not go very far?  When one spreads the £4 million among the 700,000 people with literacy problems, £6 per person is the amount available to fund such schemes.  The Minister should examine novel approaches and greatly enhance the provision of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept it is only £4 million. That amount is for a specific allocation to the adult education area, adult literacy in particular. Through the broad education allocation considerable funds are made available to adult education generally.  I agree with the Deputy's point that a finding of the study was that those who need adult education most are less likely to get it. Alarmingly, another finding of the report was that many who have serious literacy problems regard their own literacy skills as excellent. People did not realise they had low levels of literacy. I take the Deputy's point on the need for more outreach programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many consistent trends in economic, social and educational disadvantage from an early age.  It is the degree to which we link those which is important so that targeting education intervention <Col N="271" /> at areas of disadvantage will yield results on literacy problems.  I envisage an approach of expanding the home-school liaison programme in areas of disadvantage and getting more parents involved with the schools their children attend and, perhaps, providing literacy courses on the school campus for the parents.  In Cork city, for example, I know there was tremendous secrecy attached to illiterate adults going to literacy classes.  They were not widely advertised but were make known by word of mouth.  Indeed, there can still be a stigma attached to availing of the service.</P>
    <P>We need to be more innovative in the programmes we provide and the manner in which they are provided.  We need to reach out more to the constituency that requires additional literacy programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A section of the report comments on the adverse impact of television on literacy and the involvement of people in other pursuits. In this era of increasing exposure to television, does the Minister consider that his Department has a role in seeking to educate people to a more balanced use of their television viewing time? Many children are becoming too passive through excessive television viewing and this is a serious matter in the context of the literacy problems outlined in the report.  Has the Minister any thoughts or proposals in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thoughts on it as a parent and as Minister for Education and Science.  The preoccupation with television and video is disquieting. Children are spending more and more time in front of the television.  On the one hand, one can argue that there are benefits to it but we may have to wait to see what happens the present generation.  Obviously, the more time one spends watching television the less time one has for concentrating on developing skills in literacy and other areas.  Television does not feature as a core part of the education curriculum.  We can give advice to parents but I cannot switch off televisions around the country.  That would not be a logical approach even if I could do it.</P>
      <P>This matter is related to the development of technology and it is a matter of concern. However, we need to focus on the curriculum in the schools system, make sure it gives proper priority to basic literacy standards, ensure there is regular assessment of what is happening in the primary schools in terms of attainment of awards and ensure we develop systems which lend themselves to international comparisons.  A difficulty to date has been the degree to which international tests do not compare with our own because different test models and methodologies are used.  There is a need for greater harmony in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>the extent of the rise in the number of suicides among persons of school going age in the past ten years; the number of second level schools without guidance counsellors; the average waiting time for a student at second level to receive an assessment by the psychological services; and the plans, if any, he has to make improvements in these two areas in view of the recent report by the national task force on suicide.</Quest>

      <P>The incidence of suicide in Ireland is recorded by the Central Statistics Office and is classified according to age groups.  My Department does not keep separate statistics for young people of school going age.  However, it is clear from the recently published report of the national task force on suicide from the Department of Health and Children that there has been a disquieting increase in the numbers of suicides reported among young males between the ages of 15 and 24 years.</P>
      <P>The psychological assessment and counselling of young people who have attempted suicide or who are considered to be at serious risk is properly dealt with by the specialised clinical psychological and psychiatric services of the regional health boards.  The main role of the Department of Education and Science is to assist teachers and parents to identify young people at risk, to promote a climate of good mental health in schools and to support staff and pupils if, tragically, a suicide occurs.</P>
      <P>A guidance counselling service in second level schools is funded by the Department of Education and Science.  Each school is given a guidance allocation which varies according to its size. There are currently 567 wholetime teacher equivalents allocated to guidance in the system.  A dedicated agency, the National Centre for Guidance in Education, has been established to provide professional support for guidance counsellors. It also provides a forum to review guidance provision and advances proposals for its enhancement. In addition, financial support for the professional development of guidance counsellors is provided by the in-career development unit of my Department.  This support provides for seminars which deal specifically with suicide, depression and bereavement.</P>
      <P>Where a risk of suicide is suspected, the guidance counsellor will support and counsel the young person concerned.  The advice of the Department's local psychologist will usually be sought and this is given promptly.  The psychologists give absolute priority to pupils experiencing difficulties of this kind and do not operate a formal waiting list.  Where necessary, the school psychologists refer pupils to the appropriate specialist agencies of the health authorities for further assessment and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I announced my intention to develop, in liaison with the health authorities, a national <Col N="273" /> educational psychological service.  This will be available to all primary and second level schools as well as to young people of school-going age who are outside the formal education system. Planning for this service is well advanced.  A planning group, representative of the partners in education, will report to me before the end of April of this year.  The report of the planning group will be critical in putting the psychological service on a firm footing for the future.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need for schools to promote mental health in all young people.  I am grateful to the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children for its co-operation and support for health promotion in schools.</P>
    <P>As part of the revision of the primary curriculum, a new subject of social, personal and health education is being introduced.  The syllabus has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Issues of self esteem and the need to express feelings are addressed in this programme.  A syllabus for post-primary schools is currently being developed.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;whole school&rdquo; approach to health promotion is being developed by the Irish Network of Health Promoting Schools.  This pilot project involves families and community as well as teaching staff.  Forty schools, both primary and post-primary, belong to the network.  The project will shortly enter the dissemination phase.</P>
    <P>In-career programmes for teachers are essential if health promotion in schools is to be effective. These are funded by the in-career development unit.  In 1997, approximately £200,000 was allocated for this purpose.  In addition, grants were made to schools and education centres in respect of specific seminars dealing with stress and depression in young people.  All such applications were granted.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister intend to respond to the specific recommendation made by the task force on suicide to his Department that guidance counsellors should be available in all schools?

Has the task force on suicide had a chance to look at the social, personal and health education programme being drawn together at secondary and primary level, in view of the fact that they have made specific recommendations about that programme in the course of their recommendations? Are those recommendations being taken on board or is the original programme going ahead as it was developed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister provide national guidelines along the lines of the ASTI guidelines which found that 30 per cent of their schools had experienced suicide in the past two years?  Will he also <Col N="274" /> provide directories of services to individual schools so that they can respond in a timely way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important and grave issue.  The recommendations and conclusions of the report will be taken on board in terms of the social, personal and health programme at primary level and second level.  The report is significant because it does not just deal with schools but with the broader community.  There is considerable empirical evidence that further contributory factors to the incidence of suicide in particular, are high rates of unemployment, increased stress in living, drugs and their abuse, particularly alcohol, and the length of adolescent dependency in today's world.  The report identified that the provision of good educational services at as early a stage as possible is extremely important to prevent the conditions which lead to suicide.</P>
      <P>In terms of the Deputy's question in relation to the USI figure, I would tend to go along with Dr. Michael Kelleher's assessment because he is one of the foremost experts and has put a lot of work into this in terms of the range of the problem.  It is now the second most common cause of death after road traffic accidents among 15 to 24 year olds.  Dr. Kelleher also came to the conclusion that 80 per cent of young males who take their own lives have not received counselling or medical care.</P>
      <P>In terms of guidance counselling generally, every school has some access to a level of guidance counselling, depending on the number of pupils.  Schools with more than 500 pupils have a full-time guidance counsellor.  At second level there are about 278 schools with fewer than 500 pupils which therefore do not have a full-time guidance counsellor.  There are 58 schools with more than 800 pupils; 75 schools with between 500 and 799 pupils; 278 schools with between 250 to 499 pupils; 41 schools with between 200 to 249; 43 schools with between 150 and 199 pupils; 27 schools with between 100 and 149 pupils; and 28 schools with fewer than 100 pupils.  We have to improve in terms of provision of guidance counselling. We are looking at the recommendations of the National Centre for Guidance Counsellors, particularly in terms of increasing the minimum number of hours of guidance counselling available to schools to eight hours.  We are working with them in terms of the implementation of that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children where we discussed the task force on suicide and para-suicide, Dr. Kelleher, who headed the task force, said categorically that there was no correlation between the points race and para-suicide and suicide?  Does the Minister accept that finding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will promote mental health in schools, but how does he intend to go about it?  How can baseline studies be established?  For example, in regard to physical <Col N="275" /> health one can assess an individual to establish how healthy he or she is.  How can that be done in the area of mental health?  That is very important.  The Conference of Religious in Ireland have always promoted the idea of a social health index that measures the quality of life, mental health and contentment of individuals, as opposed to having very crude indicators, such as economic growth.  In this instance how will the mental well being of students be assessed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The social, personal and health programme is not just about assessing the mental health of students.  One of the problems in Ireland is that as a society we have not developed a positive attitude towards mental health.  There was a taboo surrounding mental ill health, a stigma attached to it.  We intend to work with the associations involved in mental health, the Mental Health Association in particular.  I have had meetings already with the Cork association who have developed their own resource pack for schools.  One of the key issues they have consistently identified is that we must develop a positive attitude to mental health, and there must be a &ldquo;whole school&rdquo; approach to that.  It is not a question of focusing on suicide, going one dimensional in terms of the approach to mental health.  Mental health is as important as physical health, and we need to have the same degree of emphasis on that as we do on other areas.  We need to be much more open about the issue than we have been historically as a nation.  We need to work closely with the people who know most about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>How will we establish a baseline study, starting in primary schools or wherever, to establish how mentally healthy people are to begin with, because it is only by doing that that a comparative study can be made ten years down the road?  How are we going to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to talk to our colleagues in the Department of Health and Children to develop a baseline study of that sort.  I would be interested in the Deputy's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the sex education and drugs education programmes are an integral part of tackling the suicide problem?  However, some schools have complained they do not have room in their timetables to teach these subjects.  Does he also agree that the industrial action threatened in his Department's Athlone office will not help young people sitting examinations this June and will increase the stress on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to be clear on this. Deputy Gormley asked whether I accepted the conclusion of Dr. Michael Kelleher's report that there is no correlation between the points system, examination-related stress and suicide.  That conclusion was cogent and strongly argued and I <Col N="276" /> accept it.  We should be careful of using an industrial relations problem to score a political point about its impact on children.  I regret any additional stress on young people as a result of industrial relations difficulties, which is why we are working to resolve them and are treating the matter seriously.</P>
      <P>It is intended to incorporate the programmes on substance abuse and on relationships and sexuality within the overall social, personal and health programme, along with the Stay Safe programme, so that we have a comprehensive and solidly based programme which can be fitted into the curriculum.  I accept it would be difficult to do it in a piecemeal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it is important to have small numbers in the classroom when the social, personal and health education programme is being taught?  If teachers are forced to work with more than 24 pupils the programme will not work.  It might even be detrimental to its overall objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While we seek improvements to the second level pupil-teacher ratio the average is usually better than 24 to one &mdash; some classes are higher than that average but others are much less. The more we continue to reduce the ratio the better for all programmes, not just the social, personal and health programme.  In addition, where the school has a full-time guidance counsellor, he or she tends to take smaller groups for their programmes and to deal differently with students.  As a general principle there are benefits to be derived from continuing to reduce the ratio but there are other issues.  One could argue we did not make sufficient provision for guidance counsellors over the last four to five years but economic circumstances may have played a part in that.  We must increase the provision for guidance counsellors at second level.</P>
      <P>We await the outcome of the primary curriculum review, which will consider the social, personal and health programme.  Considerable inservice training will be made available to primary school teachers in that regard, including training related to the programme.  I think it will be successfully introduced to our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one problem in this area is the lack of co-ordination between different services as they apply to children at risk?  Whereas a teacher may quickly identify a minority of children who are at risk, in terms of their health or behaviour, there is little co-ordination between the school, the psychological service, the gardaí and the health board social services, all of whom may be dealing with the same family or the same child.  Would he consider formally putting in place a strategy or system of co-ordination which would address the problems of children at risk?  While I accept that professionals in the area, including teachers, contact each other on an informal basis there does not <Col N="277" /> appear to be a structured or co-ordinated approach towards bringing together all the services or professionals dealing with the problems of children at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's basic point. That is why, when I established the planning group towards setting up an educational psychological service, I ensured it included both educational interests and the health authorities, because whatever educational psychological service is put in place on a national basis must involve both sectors with their particular expertise.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who has responsibility for the drugs task force areas, is doing exactly what the Deputy suggests on a pilot basis.  He has identified four areas where he will put in place models of best practice for integration and co-ordination between the statutory and voluntary agencies in a given area where there are significant difficulties.  That is the way forward and when those pilot projects are completed, we hope to have models of best practice for integration and co-ordination which we can replicate throughout the country, particularly in the drugs task force areas which have been identified and which require special attention.</P>
      <P>The area partnerships are also beginning to show greater co-ordination between the agencies. I have met some of them but the difficulty is that practices vary from area to area.  In the psychological sector I have been heartened by what I have seen in some areas, where genuine intervention is taking place in terms of case studies on students and young children in difficulty, as well as helping teaching counsellors, etc. I accept the basic principle outlined by the Deputy and that is the road we must follow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 6, 14 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school transport review committee was set up by my predecessor in January 1996.  The committee undertook a comprehensive study of the entire school transport system.  Its report was received by my colleague, the Minister of State, <Col N="278" /> Deputy O'Dea, in September 1997 and is currently being evaluated in the Department.  The report was published on 21 January 1998 and has been circulated to various interests.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the report, including those concerning the introduction of new fees and increasing current transport charges, do not necessarily reflect Government policy.  I welcome the publication of the report, which will afford an opportunity for extensive debate on its contents.  I assure Deputies that I will give serious consideration to and reflect on the product of this debate before making final decisions on any future changes to the school transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is still looking at the report but he has not directly stated whether current policy will remain in place, as most people on this side of the House believe it should. Public transport should be regarded as a social service but is that how the Minister sees it?  We have seen the demise of rural post offices and Garda stations.  Will this be another blow to rural dwellers?  As a result of this measure, will we see increased traffic on our roads?  This is another aspect of the issue which is causing great disquiet. The school transport service has offered many people a way of getting to and from school but this report seems to spell its demise.  The system has existed since 1967.  Does the Minister not think the report is opening the way to rolling back an extremely good measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the introduction of the school transport system as probably the most radical and revolutionary move taken by any Minister for Education.  The late Donogh O'Malley took this step to enable children to get to school. It fundamentally opened access to education for children throughout Ireland and we in Fianna Fáil are extremely proud of this decision.</P>
      <P>All Deputies have problems with the school transport system, as is evidenced by the number of parliamentary questions I receive on individual cases, but we forget that by and large it has been a successful scheme in that it has achieved its fundamental purpose.  People have problems with it but it has fundamentally been a success.  Modern developments will necessitate a review, however.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the outgoing Administration produced the report which we then published. My difficulty in being categoric in what I say is that I do not like to rubbish a particular group's deliberations.  There is value in teasing out those deliberations with all the partners in education.  However, the policy is as it is now and not as it is in the report.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has disseminated the report among the partners and is waiting for feedback and to have discussions with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be frank, I am surprised by the scale of the proposals and I have great difficulty with all of them.  It is extraordinary to propose that medical card holders should have to pay for the service. <Col N="279" /> However, the report has been published and people will have to come back to us on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the review group exceeded its brief by applying itself to the issue of fees and that only the issues in the brief should be up for discussion now?  On that basis, the Minister should remove this proposal from the discussion and put us all at ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an awful pity the Deputy did not do that himself &mdash; this is one he left over for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is what I said not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point that when the school transport review was launched in January 1996 its terms of reference were to examine the effects of declining enrolments on the operation of the school transport scheme &mdash; which could mean anything &mdash; to address any anomalies which may come to light, to consider the possibility or advisability of revising catchment areas if necessary and to review the arrangements for pupils in special, multidenominational and all-Irish schools.  The committee was also expected to address a number of other issues which are a source of concern to parents and school authorities.  Those are broad terms of reference which one could argue, if one so wanted, included all relevant matters.</P>
      <P>This is the third review of the school transport system.  We need to involve the partners in a basic discussion about the service.  It is a necessary service but we should not underestimate its cost to public funds.  There are also issues concerning the condition and modernisation of the fleet, the recommended reduction of the qualifying distance from the nearest school from three to two miles and so on.  The problem with removing one part of the report is that its authors seem to say it has to be all or nothing.  In other words, they are saying the charges are fundamentally connected to their other proposals.</P>
      <P>However, I take the Deputy's point that there seems to be a consensus in the House not to proceed with the conclusions of the report.  We will take on board what the partners have to say and take it from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared, in the interests of clarity, to say here and now that he is ruling out the charge of £30 per medical card holder and £90 for everyone else which was recommended in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have allowed the report to be discussed among the partners.  I do not want to pre-empt what may emerge from that discussion. I think that is reasonable when a report has just been published.  I made the point that the previous Government appointed the committee, undertook the report and drew up the terms of <Col N="280" /> reference.  It was stalled for a long time and has now been published.</P>
      <P>We made no provision in the 1998 Estimates for increases of that sort.  The present policy remains in place and is not diminished in any way. This report is now being discussed by all the interested bodies and we will await the outcome of those discussions.  It is having no impact, as of now, on policy decisions taken by me or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in this area.  It is possible that we might come up with completely different ideas and proposals for the school transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>But no charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the current fleet of school buses is completely dilapidated and it is questionable whether many of them should still be on the road?  Will he give a commitment to an increased allocation in funding to bring some of these buses up to standard? There are situations where three post primary students have to share two seats.  Serious questions must be asked about the safety standards on these buses.  Has the Minister been in contact with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to legislation on school transport?  The problem seems to be there is no legislation to bring buses up to the proper standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we need legislation for that.  We need resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the issue has been lying around for many years and why no effort was made by the previous Government to improve the service or make any money available over the past four years, except to initiate a review.  I am conscious of the issue and we are deliberating the matter in the context of the report which has been published.</P>
      <P>The report was undertaken by many people whose bona fides I do not question in terms of their ability to have a root and branch look at the system, which they have done.  We owe it to the people who voluntarily put a great deal of time and effort into producing the report to allow it to be discussed properly by all the partners in order to develop policy.  That is a reasonable position. Meanwhile, the policy continues as it is, in that there is no impact on charges.  The degree to which we can improve the service is limited by resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is responsible for adult literacy and school transport, which has been the dominant issue today, is not here. Will the Minister assure me that Deputy O'Dea, who is frequently liable to speak personally on matters of Government policy, subscribes to the point of view put forward by the Minister that <Col N="281" /> there will not be charges?  He is apt to make announcements on a Monday morning which take the country by surprise.</P>
      <P>It is reported in today's newspaper that the Ombudsman found serious defects in the way a child with a disability was treated.  Does this indicate to the Minister there will have to be significant changes in the approach to school transport to ensure the rights of such children are properly provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly ensure that the recommendations of the Ombudsman which arise out of that case will be implemented.  That case arose in September 1994 and continued until 1996.  The Department then improved the situation after that length of time.  We must be absolutely fair to children with special needs in terms of the operation of the school transport scheme. I have already given a clear commitment, in response to the Ombudsman's report, to the implementation of its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I have a difficulty in preempting deliberations which are now taking place on the report.  In fairness to those who compiled it and all the partners involved, I am prepared to allow a discussion so that people can deliberate on all aspects of the report.  While that is taking place, there will be no impact on the school transport scheme in terms of costs, as per the recommendations of the report.  I will not reject or accept anything out of hand until the process in which we have engaged has taken its course.  That is reasonable given that people have put much time and effort into it, otherwise the process whereby we enlist people to help and assist a range of bodies and Departments will be undermined. People will ask why they should go on a committee if, as soon as a report is published, it <Col N="282" /> is arbitrarily rubbished by the Minister and relegated to the shelf.  That could happen and would undermine the process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time there are normal incremental increases in relation to second level.  In terms of the fundamental recommendations, we have given a commitment that they will not be implemented in the coming year.  We have no plans to introduce the new types of charges which have been proposed.  The Deputy wants me to reject the entire report out of hand.  I am allowing the deliberation to take place on the report.  People have no need to fear any fundamental alteration of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I would dispute that it was not asked to address that.  The terms of reference were sufficiently broad for the committee to investigate everything.  The committee had to work within certain financial constraints.  It proposed improvements in a range of areas and how to finance them.  The present Government was not responsible for setting up the committee.  We should at least discuss the report, which covers other aspects in addition to cost, to see why the committee came to these conclusions.  We should engage in some process.  People should not overexercise themselves on the question of cost which is a nice political issue which they want to drum up, although on the basis of a report commissioned by a previous Government.  People are trying to nail the present Government on whether the proposals will be implemented.  There is a process in place in which we will engage. Obviously, we will have to come back to the House if anything is to happen.</P>

      <P>I am asking a question but we must read between the lines.  The signals are very important in this regard.  The Minister might give some attention to parents and pupils who have to pay for school transport, particularly those within a catchment area or those who, because of choice of school, especially in urban areas, must pay for transport.  Given the impact which school car journeys have on general traffic congestion, <Col N="283" /> particularly in major urban areas, will the Minister discuss with his colleagues who have responsibility for transport and the environment the possibility of introducing a comprehensive school transport scheme in urban areas on a wider basis?  This would benefit children and reduce the amount of traffic congestion at peak hours in the morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 36 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>It is estimated by my Department that approximately 301 additional special needs assistant posts would be required to meet fully the recommended ratios set out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee.  The need for such posts extends across the range of categories identified by the committee.  At present my Department is funding a total of 272 such posts at an annual cost of £2.75 million.  This includes 20 posts which I allocated shortly after my appointment as Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It is estimated by my Department that a maximum of approximately 70 additional teacher posts would be required to achieve the pupil-teacher ratios recommended by the committee. The recommended pupil teacher ratios have already been achieved in nine of the 13 categories, including travellers, identified by the committee.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional teaching and special needs assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  I have to establish priorities and deploy resources to best effect.  As far as the current school year is concerned, decisions regarding the allocation of available resources had already been taken by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the work that remains to be done if we are to achieve the ratios recommended by the Special Education Review Committee. I assure the House of my commitment to this process.  I am reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible. The issues raised by the Deputies will be a key element of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that the deficiencies in relation to special needs assistants, in particular, without whom it is difficult for children with disabilities to participate fully at school, will receive a high priority? Does he accept that the needs of children with disabilities in our education system have been down played?  In the context of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, does he accept the criticism that the amendments he has made to the previous wording to remove the clear commitments to children with special needs should be addressed on Committee Stage of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that criticism, which we can debate in the context of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, particularly on Committee Stage.  The Deputy said the issue has been down played in <Col N="285" /> recent times.  I do not know if that is a reflection on his party when in Government.  Progress has been made since the SERC was established.  The establishment of this committee was perhaps the most important development in the area of special needs education.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, deserves credit for that because it established a benchmark.  I also pay tribute to my predecessor and others.  It is heartening to note that in nine of the 13 categories we have reached the pupil teacher ratios and that in the remaining four, we are about one or two short.</P>
      <P>As regards the child care assistant area, I agree it was neglected in recent years.  We should do more, and it is one of my priorities, particularly since there is more integration in mainstream education.  Where possible more parents are correctly having their children educated in their local parish school.  That has major implications for resources along the line.  We need resources to help children with special needs and we have made provision in the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997.</P>

The Minister said that this area is one of his priorities, but will he agree that his actions do not show this to be the case?</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the sudden changes in Government policy brought about by crises which beset Aer <Col N="287" /> Lingus.  There is always the danger that something similar will happen in the future and I am glad the Minister has enunciated the Government's clear aviation policy.</P>
      <P>The major restructuring programme undertaken by Aer Lingus following the Cahill plan resulted in a substantial measure of success. While the figures for profits are encouraging, as the Minister correctly stated, they must be viewed against the backdrop of cost effectiveness, which has proven to be notoriously difficult to achieve in the past.</P>
      <P>We should not ignore the last financial crisis in the airline which was entirely due to an appalling management system.  This matter was never properly addressed in terms of how it came about and the introduction of measures to ensure a similar crisis did not arise in the future.  I am not saying that those responsible should be held to account, which is the political fashion nowadays, but appalling mistakes were made.  For example, it was decided to buy a 767 fleet for a route which was not available.  These planes which were effectively unused were eventually sold for 12 per cent of their initial cost, leading to a huge loss for the airline.</P>
      <P>The airline operated a peculiar accounting system at that time.  I am not suggesting there was anything underhand in it but the way the figures, projections and write-offs were presented could have meant the then Government was misled in terms of the exact position of the airline's finances.  This has been substantially corrected and the position set out by the Minister reflects the true position in the company.</P>
      <P>I welcome the partnership approach advocated by the Minister as it is probably the only way of achieving the level of cost effectiveness Aer Lingus needs to achieve if it is to continue to meet demands and secure a partner in a strategic alliance.  People accept that this is the way forward for the airline.  I am glad well known companies are interested in the airline and would be concerned if no one was interested in it, as was the case five years ago.  This interest reflects the commercial progress made by Aer Lingus.  The airline will need to devise further commercial strategies if it is to withstand the increasing competitive pressures in the aviation sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus has a habit of attempting to psych out competition on new routes.  While this may be good commercial practice, it is greatly resented in various sectors.  There has been the high profile saga relating to competition on the Dublin route. During the term of office of the previous Government Aeroflot could have been thrown a lifeline and been retained on transatlantic routes to a much more meaningful extent.  However, Aer Lingus dictated Government policy and ensured that Shannon-New York rights were not granted to Aeroflot.  While Shannon-Newark rights were eventually grudgingly given to Aeroflot, they were not given early enough and were not attractive enough to enable it to develop the type of <Col N="288" /> service it wished to develop.  I am glad the Minister put on the record the outcome of her meeting with Aeroflot, which, given the business it is in, is driven by commercial concerns.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus had no interest in the Newark route until Aeroflot became interested in it.  The Minister helped Shannon marketing to entice Continental to use this route, which it will begin servicing later in the year.  However, in a pre-emptive strike Aer Lingus has decided to move its air bus fleet to the Newark line so that it will be able to compete with Continental.  This will make Continental's entry to the market very difficult.  As it does not have the necessary aircraft Aer Lingus has hired second-hand aircraft and American people to service the traditional Shannon-New York route, the mainstay of the transatlantic operations at Shannon Airport.  These planes which are crewed by non-Irish staff use 65,000 tonnes of fuel at a cost of between £1,000-£1,200 per tonne.  This diminishes productivity and profit on the route.  This will enable those people in Shannon who are suspicious of Aer Lingus to say at some stage in the future that the Shannon-New York route is not profitable.</P>
    <P>These aeroplanes carry less freight and fewer passengers and have a particularly poor configuration, thereby making the service second class. No Minister would spot these developments unless he was told what was happening.  This gives Aer Lingus huge power in terms of influencing aviation policy which has been used against Shannon Airport on occasion, against Dublin Airport on other occasions and strongly used against the national interest.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will correctly say that it is a commercial airline which is in the business of making a profit.  They ought to be in a position to provide on the Newark and New York lines a new airbus with proper configuration, which would need less fuel, enabling them to compete and develop both services.</P>
    <P>An interesting effect of the change made in 1993 is that the level of backtracking to Ireland, <i>via</i> London and Manchester in particular, has increased by huge proportions. One of the strongest arguments used for changing the Shannon stopover was that the number of people coming directly from the US to Ireland would increase in proportion to the number backtracking, but for some reason, which is not immediately apparent, the opposite was the case.  The number of Americans coming to Dublin <i>via</i> London, Manchester and other UK destinations is much higher than it was in 1993.</P>
    <P>Sometimes difficulties arise in terms of the location of airports, a number of them being in the least populated areas.  That leads inevitably to political competition, competition for a limited number of passengers and for scarce resources.  It will be difficult to address that matter in terms of reducing the amount of finance to particular airports because it will not be feasible or practical. Those airports will be a huge drain on aviation <Col N="289" /> resources in terms of improving infrastructure and marketing.</P>
    <P>One of the inevitable effects of the huge increase in passenger numbers through Dublin airport will be increased pressure for a second airport, for which there is a case to be made.  I strongly oppose the opening of a second airport in Dublin on the basis of my experience and interest in aviation matters.  Aviation policy should be decided before pressure is brought to bear from commercial forces.  The Government should take into account the best interests of the capital city, the country, tourism, trade and industry in deciding whether a second airport should be built.  From the experience in Belfast and elsewhere, there are good reasons for not proceeding with such a proposal.  There are also positive reasons that should be taken into account in deciding this matter.</P>
    <P>When changes were made in Shannon the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government of the day set up the Shannon task force, which reported to Government.  That task force made a number of recommendations, but the Government had already made a decision which militated against Shannon in some respects.  The report was the antidote to the change, one aspect of which was the setting up of a marketing fund.  In the first year the money was provided by the State.  There was then a change of Government and, in its first year, that Administration provided funding by the back door through Aer Rianta.  In 1997, however, no marketing funds were made available.</P>
    <P>The arrival of continental airlines here, which was a huge success for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, would not have come about if those funds had not been available.  Unless the fund is restored there will be long-term effects for Shannon. I base those comments on various matters, including the excellent task force report.  It is short-sighted of the Government to continue with policies which encourage Dublin airport to burst at the seams.  The result will be that money will be needed to provide extra capacity at Dublin airport, even though there is an enormous amount of spare capacity in seven or eight airports, including two owned by the commercial State company.  Government aviation policy should be designed to pick up the slack in Cork and Shannon and in the regional airports.  It will be difficult for Government to resist the ongoing pressure, created by an increasing number of passengers through Dublin airport, to provide infrastructure to cater for that development.</P>
    <P>The 1994-99 national plan estimated that seven million passengers would pass through Dublin airport in 1999, but by 1996 the figure had reached nine million.  When one makes the case I have been making, one is open to the charge of being anti-Dublin, but we must consider this matter from a national perspective.  In that context there are disadvantages for various areas.  The change made in 1993 had a minimal impact on Dublin airport in terms of passenger numbers and <Col N="290" /> services.  By comparison, it had an enormous effect on Shannon and particularly on tourism in the west.</P>
    <P>Aviation policy must be considered in the context of our membership of the EU.  There has been an ongoing debate in recent years, particularly between the Commission and the Council of Ministers, about who has rights to negotiate bilateral agreements with outside countries, particularly the United States, which is the most attractive commercially.  The Commission took the view that it has authority in that regard and made it very clear that member states are not entitled to conclude such agreements.  It went so far as to threaten legal proceedings against three or four countries, not including Ireland.  Eventually the Council of Ministers, faced with pressure from the Commission, made minor concessions in terms of the powers of the Commission and allowed it a mandate to open negotiations with the US, but only as regards the regulatory framework and certain ancillary matters.  Access and traffic rights were to be the subject of a second stage plan for which the Commission is pushing and for which the Council has not given a mandate and continues to resist.  In exchange for the concession made by the Council, the Commission withdrew its legal threat.  The Commission undertook its first negotiations with the US at the end of October 1996, but the outcome was not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Council proposal will provide for derogations by various states.  There are elements within the EU who see their role as superseding the role of the Irish Government.  In that context we should consider aviation policy in the context of competing forces such as Ryanair.  That company has been very successful in reducing charges and fares, particularly in and out of Dublin airport. It has, however, created an airport economy, which in the long-term is not conducive to a better standard of service for the passenger.  It will ultimately lead to passengers paying for higher standards, which will be difficult to achieve if they are allowed fall.</P>
    <P>As regards Shannon airport, I would prefer to see workers properly paid than for independent airlines to dictate terms along the lines which Ryanair management is trying to do at Dublin airport.  That company does not operate out of Shannon airport.  It tends to operate for three years at a time when there are reductions in airport charges and as soon as charges increase Ryanair disappears.  It has done that on two occasions.  In its absence, A. B. Shannon, a very small airline, which was given little hope of success, has built up an excellent business without impinging on the rights of workers to be properly paid and without demanding that they hang around for three or four hours before they get an hour's work.  Aviation policy should not dictate that airport workers must do their business under those conditions.</P>

      <P>For the passenger, the biggest change in aviation over the past decade or so has been the dramatic fall in air fares.  Credit for this is given to an active policy of deregulation in air travel, a policy pursued by the Government, Governments abroad and the EU.  In Ireland, Ryanair was believed to represent the new, deregulated, highly competitive low fares air policy. The company's many fans, especially in politics and the media, argue that Ryanair's arrival in Irish aviation acted as a catalyst to the competition which, in turn, cut air fares.  For example, the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, once pointed to Ryanair as a successful product of his party's policy on deregulation.</P>
      <P>In the fairytale version of the Ryanair story, the hero is a small new company in an unequal struggle against the giant State monopoly.  The happy ending is a glorious success by a company which worked itself up the beanstalk by its own energy and with no State aid.  Like all fairy tales, the truth is less heroic.  The reality is that it has been Government policy for a long time to promote competition in aviation, which in practical terms has meant giving Ryanair repeated doses of favouritism.</P>
      <P>When Aer Lingus started its Dublin-Stansted service the then Government ordered the State owned airline off the route and gave Ryanair exclusive rights to the airport.  The company was also give the exclusive rights to the Dublin-Liverpool and Dublin-Munich routes.  It was the only airline allowed to fly between provincial airports and the UK.  Money was made available to regional airports for route development to the UK from which Ryanair was the main beneficiary. It is widely believed that prior to 1994, Aer Rianta gave rebates on charges to the company which were not available to other airlines.  A new business rebate scheme has meant that on routes such as Dublin-Birmingham, Ryanair is effectively paid a subsidy for every customer it takes from a competitor.</P>
      <P>Ryanair has done very well from the State and could not have succeeded without the assistance and favoured treatment which it received from successive Governments.  I welcome the company's success and I hope it will continue to contribute to Irish aviation and our economy for a long time.</P>

    <P>However, Ryanair's unacceptable stand on the industrial dispute with its unionised baggage handlers will result in serious trouble for the company, for our aviation industry as a whole and the economy in general.  Just as the arrival of Ryanair has marked the real beginning of deregulation, the company's dispute with its baggage handlers <Col N="292" /> is announcing the imminent departure of social partnership on the economy.</P>
    <P>Ryanair's success was facilitated by an economic and social climate over the past decade which is enshrined in an understanding between business, trade unions and Government and which is known as social partnership.  The deal basically means that workers moderate their wage demands, avoid going on strike except as a last resort, that the industrial relations machinery such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission are used to settle disputes and that the Government and individual employers treat their workers fairly and with respect.</P>
    <P>Ryanair has broken the deal on every count. While low paid workers in Ryanair and elsewhere were making do with tiny increases in pay, the directors were stuffing themselves with bonuses plundered from their own company prior to flotation. The chief executive, Mr. Michael O'Leary, helped himself to £17 million over three years and the directors together took almost £24 million between 1995 and flotation.  These bonuses alone would pay the wages of all the baggage handlers together for the remainder of their working lives.</P>
    <P>When the baggage handlers decided to seek the professional help of a trade union in having their pay examined what was the response of the company? It has refused to have the matters at issue put before the Labour Court and it has been responsible for a dispute which the baggage handlers tried to avoid and which is now becoming more bitter by the day.</P>
    <P>As for showing respect and fairness towards the workers concerned, the actions of the company have been deplorable.  I have been told of abusive tirades from the chief executive directed towards striking workers, of demeaning comments towards union officials involved, of the use of private investigators to spy on individual workers and of old fashioned threats and inducements to get the workers back on the bags.</P>
    <P>If the baggage handlers were a group of workers in a key utility which had refused to go to the Labour Court and who had gone on strike for even a fraction of Mr. O'Leary's bonus there would have been a crescendo of outraged calls for a return to work and for respect for industrial relations procedures.  However, where in this case are the evening paper headlines demanding that this greedy employer go to the Labour Court?</P>
    <P>The issues are serious and may get worse.  If this dispute is escalated, as it may have to be, we will see a bigger disruption or even the closure of Dublin Airport.  Must the travelling public and business suffer because Mr. O'Leary will not go to the Labour Court?  What will be the implications for Irish aviation if the intermittent dispute in Ryanair becomes more generalised?  Will somebody please cause this company to see sense before there is a major disruption to air transport on and off this island?</P>
    <P>The president of SIPTU, Mr. Jimmy Somers, has already warned that this dispute could result <Col N="293" /> in the end of social partnership.  IBEC appears to think that he is bluffing.  I do not believe so. Nobody should underestimate how easily and quickly social partnership could unravel for the trade unions.  Already, many workers are frustrated that while they have kept their wages down in the national interest, the Michael O'Learys of the business world have helped themselves to the cream of economic success in their own self interest.  Already there are signs of unofficial industrial actions and of a fractiousness among workers which will be difficult to manage if social partnership cannot even guarantee the constitutional right of workers to join a trade union.  If the chief executive of Ryanair will not do business with a reasonable trade union official like Paul O'Sullivan of SIPTU how can social partnership be seen to be working?</P>
    <P>Ryanair's failure to honour social partnership will also pose difficulties for the company itself. Investors in the company would be well advised to give the company's performance on this dispute a closer examination.  Resistance to trade union organisation may be business friendly in an environment where the relationship between trade unions and business is characterised by conflict. However, in our economy and industrial relations climate it ultimately results in loss and isolation for the company concerned.</P>
    <P>Even the use of senior management's time and energies in attempting to browbeat the unionised workers is misspent.  Are the investors in Ryanair aware that the chief executive of their company is now spending his time in the baggage hall lugging bags and behaving like a champagne lout to his workers instead of addressing the new competitive challenges which are on the way in the Irish and European aviation industry?  For example, the new no frills service recently launched by British Airways and which will no doubt be followed by other airlines is the real challenge facing Ryanair.  Competition does not stand still and it has no sentiment for the Ryanair fairytale.</P>
    <P>Ryanair's success is not solely because of its low fares policy.  The increase in air traffic, to which the Minister referred, has virtually trebled on Ireland UK and Ireland continental routes and has also contributed to its success.  That is a function of increased economic activity in the country which has also been a product of social partnership.</P>
    <P>Ryanair is seriously misjudging the travelling public.  In this country price is not the only determinant of consumer choice.  Consumers have values and if a company is seen to be infringing fundamental rights and to be unfair consumers will turn away from it, no matter how many friends it says can travel free.  Irish consumers will never sell their sense of fair play for low fares.</P>
    <P>In this dispute, Ryanair has refused to talk to the workers' chosen representatives, to go to the Labour Court and to listen to the Government's advice.  We have a voluntary code of industrial relations so the company cannot be forced to <Col N="294" /> attend.  In these circumstances, the travelling public, the Ryanair customers should take a stand. The company's workers need our support.  The time has come for the public to boycott the company. People should refuse to travel with Ryanair until it goes to the Labour Court to settle the dispute. State bodies, companies and community, social and sporting organisations as well as individuals should place their travel business elsewhere as long as Ryanair insists on being an unfair airline.</P>
    <P>According to opinion polls, 91 per cent of the public supports the Ryanair workers' right to professional representation.  The public should translate that support into the only language Ryanair management understands, a threat to its profits. People should boycott Ryanair until it treats its workers fairly.  &ldquo;No rights, no flights, boycott Ryanair&rdquo; should be the message until the company goes to the Labour Court and settles its dispute with the baggage handlers.  By boycotting Ryanair, the public will ultimately help to settle the dispute.</P>
    <P>Another issue relates to the proposed open skies policy.  I am surprised the Minister did not refer to this but perhaps she will do so later.  I understand the European Union, in pursuit of its policy of liberalisation, has been in discussion with the United States authorities with regard to an open skies policy.  If implemented, this will enable other airlines to operate transatlantic flights from Ireland.  This obviously poses difficulties for Shannon Airport and Aer Lingus in terms of the competition they may face.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time.  The programme for Government includes a strong commitment to the existing network of regional airports.  The Minister said she was pleased to remind the House of her success in securing a total of £5 million of Exchequer funding for infrastructural improvements at regional airports in Donegal, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Waterford in 1998.  She said this funding will facilitate the completion this year of essential upgrading of infrastructure.  However, it is most regrettable that initially Sligo only received £242,000 at a 50 per cent rate from the total fund of £5 million.  This meant the Exchequer would pay £121,000.  After some pressure, I understand the funding was increased to 75 per cent but only on the sum of £121,000.  This means the overall spending on Sligo Airport can only be £160,000 from a total fund of £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome the funds, it falls short of the £3 million awarded to Galway at a 75 per cent rate for a £4 million project.  The claim that Sligo Airport only sought £242,000 holds no water because it was told the money was only for essential remedial work.  This is a most important point because the Minister said earlier there is no additional EU funding for regional airports and the £5 million fund, which has been allocated, must cover the period from now until the year 2000.  The sum of £161,000 for Sligo from a total fund of £5 million is extremely disappointing. Even with the £161,000, Sligo has a deficit of £80,000.  The Exchequer should provide an extra £60,000, in conjunction with £20,000 the airport company could raise, to cover this shortfall.  This would allow the company to spend the total sum of £161,000 on the airport.</P>
      <P>With seven weeks to go to the start of the new essential air service programme, why have the airlines not yet been named?  I understand Kerry and Galway Airports are in the same position. There is only one flight a day to Sligo and it is at a major disadvantage.  It is most important that the announcement is made immediately.  This would allow the airport board to advance plans and carry out the necessary promotion to entice business.</P>
      <P>What advances are being made on the recommendations of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, when in Opposition regarding the abolition of rates, the coverage of air traffic control costs and a policy for regional airports to put them on a firm footing for the future?  The airport in Sligo has undoubtedly attracted business to the area.  I appeal to the Minister and her Department to review overall policy and level the playing field to ensure this important piece of infrastructure survives and flourishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of Sligo Airport is crucial in terms of attracting industry to combat unemployment in Sligo and the north-west region.  It is most unfair that the local population must contribute considerable amounts when the airport requires necessary items of equipment.  Business people do not understand why they must do so when the citizens of Dublin, Cork and Shannon are not asked to provide matching finance when those airports need to extend runways or buy navigational equipment.  The end result is that regional airports will be unable to carry out necessary improvements or maintain their capital equipment because they cannot raise matching finance.  Unless the  Exchequer  provides additional funding before the year 2000, the prospect <Col N="296" /> of investment in Sligo Airport appears bleak. In Opposition the Minister's party promised to introduce a regional airport development Bill.  It should do so urgently so that the future of this sector can be charted.  It would also address the issue of funding of future capital works at regional airports.</P>
    <P>Two points are particularly crucial to Sligo Airport. The first is special tax designation.  The airport has a 50 acre site and special concessions would create much needed jobs in Sligo.  Such a package should be promoted not only by Aer Rianta, but also by Forbairt and other State agencies working in partnership.  The fact that Sligo has an airport is a huge advantage in terms of attracting manufacturing industries.  The second point is the huge burden placed on regional airports in terms of the cost of air traffic control.  In some cases this can amount to £150,000 a year and legislation is required to deal with this aspect. Regional airports would find it difficult to survive without the commitment of staff.  Rates is another huge cost factor for regional airports and they need to be changed or abolished.</P>
    <P>Much work needs to be done.  The long-term success of Sligo Airport will depend on the Government introducing changes that will provide funds.  It is most disappointing that Sligo Airport received only £161,000 from the total fund of £5 million.  Galway received £3 million and while I wish it well, the sum for Sligo is most disappointing. The airport sought £242,000 and I appeal to the Minister to provide the additional £80,000.  It would be a gesture of commitment to the airport.</P>
    <P>Airports assist the economic development of European peripheral regions.  In Ireland infrastructure which enhances transport and communications links to other regions are most important.  This aspect is even more important for the north-west region.  Regional airports have a huge role but they must be adequately funded and not given token gestures.  Legislation needs to be introduced to ensure regional airports are treated equally.  It is most unfair that there is an unequal distribution of money and that people were unaware of the funds available.  Sligo Airport should have had the option of seeking additional funds.  It is most disappointing that Galway Airport received £3 million when the management board of Sligo Airport was not even informed that the fund had been increased to £5 million.  The Department should be much more transparent, particularly with regard to regional airports.  This debate is most important and I appeal to the Minister to reassess the policy on regional airports.  When in Opposition her party made huge commitments and it is time it lived up to them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my solidarity with the workers of Ryanair.  Since 9 January they have been engaged in one of the most important industrial disputes of recent times.  The issue here is not just one of low pay and poor working conditions for ground handling staff at Ryanair but the basic right of all citizens to be members of a trade union.</P>
      <P>Certain employers have long felt secure in their refusal to recognise the duly chosen representatives of their workforces.  The effective nullification of the constitutional right to union membership has gone unchallenged by successive Governments.  As a result, some employers, such as Ryanair, ride roughshod over the machinery so painstakingly built up to resolve industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>In the face of this provocation, the workers at Ryanair have acted with great restraint.  They escalated their action last weekend only after a month of intransigence by management.  Their basic pay is £185 per week and they work long unsociable hours.  Their rates of basic pay and overtime are below the airline industry standard. Contrast this with the sums Ryanair management awards itself.  The directors received an average payment of £928,000 each in 1995.  The flotation of the company on the stock market last May yielded £17 million in bonuses to Ryanair's chief executive, Mr. Michael O'Leary.</P>
      <P>Is the Government prepared to allow Ryanair to continue earning enormous profits thanks to the favourable climate for civil aviation created by successive Governments, while at the same time imposing 19th century conditions on its workers?  Are we returning to the days before the 1913 lockout, when so much was sacrificed to win the right to union recognition?</P>
      <P>This dispute has profound implications for the notion of social partnership promoted by Governments, employers and trade union leaders for the last decade.  That means nothing if anti-union companies are allowed to proliferate and dominate the economy as they are threatening to do.  The Government must legislate to protect the workers' right to organise and to require employers to recognise the chosen representatives of their employees.  This dispute is where, as a former Minister said, a line must be drawn in the sand.  I was pleased to meet the Ryanair workers at the gates of the House this afternoon. They have the wholehearted support of all who uphold the right of Irish workers to trade union representation.  This is a fundamental, non-negotiable right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise a concern shared by all who use Aer Lingus's transatlantic service.  In my role as a party representative I have visited the United States many times, and it has been brought to my attention that there are fears for the future of Aer Lingus personnel based at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.  Any decision to relocate or <Col N="298" /> discontinue the role of staff there, who have provided a first rate service, would be very detrimental. I urge the Minister and Aer Lingus to ensure the continued presence of Irish-trained staff in that airport.  They bring very special skills to their work in New York.  It has always been of great importance to travellers to New York that they find the welcome, service and assistance one gets from Aer Lingus staff there.  This issue may not have been raised already, but the Minister should forward my concerns to the relevant authorities and advise me of her findings as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to examine the impact airports have on regions, particularly Cork Airport, which is small.  Dr. Richard Moloney of University College Cork carried out a fascinating survey on the economic impact of Cork Airport.  There are also surveys of the impact of both Cork port and UCC itself on the region.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that the airport was worth £17 million to the region and was responsible for 700 jobs, though some of those were not direct jobs but in spin-off industries.  The figure is equivalent to that of a sizeable industry and shows the important economic contribution the airport makes.  Cork Airport grossed £11 million in income last year.  However, over £5 million of that was generated by duty free sales.  If that is abolished there will be a huge impact on the viability of the airport.  Aer Rianta will have to market itself more, as it has a captive market. People wait for an hour or more for a plane. There is all-party support for the retention of the duty free facility, but if it goes measures and strategies will have to be put in place to counteract this dramatic loss in revenue.</P>
      <P>In the absence of duty free, an airport would have to generate revenue from other areas.  Landing charges would probably rise, which means that airlines would have to increase fares.  Cork Airport could then become uncompetitive, with a consequent effect on tourism.  Given the impact of the airport in the region, which is of the order of £17 million and 1,700 jobs, the loss of duty free sales to Cork could impinge on that dramatic record.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Aer Lingus and the services provided to Cork.  Aer Lingus does not fly from Cork to the Continent.  Those who wish to fly to the Continent must first fly to Dublin, thus increasing the cost by £50.  Often the plane arrives in Dublin just as the plane for Brussels &mdash; where a great deal of business is done nowadays &mdash; is taking off.  It is frustrating for business people in the Cork area that they cannot make the Brussels connection.  I urge the Minister and her officials to examine this matter and to raise it with Aer Lingus with a view to direct flights from Cork to Europe.  It is ridiculous that people have to fly to Dublin and wait for a few hours before getting a flight to Europe.  This costs time, time is money and money is business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flights from Cork to London are £50 more expensive than from Dublin to London.  The distance <Col N="299" /> involved is not great but it is more expensive. This is a case of the regions being discriminated against and the matter should be addressed. Aer Lingus flies from Dublin to Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dresden, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hamburg, Helsinki, Milan, Munich, Paris, Prague, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich.  It is ridiculous there is not one flight from Cork to the above destinations.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister's halo was glowing earlier perhaps she will shine it further by looking into this matter.  As a former teacher I share the comments of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in that I had admiration for her as Minister for Education.  She followed on from Mrs Hussey and others and we have had good Ministers for Education.  As Minister for Public Enterprise I ask her to examine the service being provided by the national airline to Cork.  Will she examine also the impact which the loss of duty free sales would have on Cork Airport?  There are approximately 30 businesses in Cork Airport from taxi services, food outlets and so on, many of whom depend on the airport for employment.  Following the restructuring of Aer Rianta perhaps the Minister would consider more competition between the airports and the State.  On the question of competition between the airports we must be careful to ensure the smaller airports are not wiped out by Dublin Airport. We are already aware that Dublin is favoured by the airlines.  It may be that some of the regional airports have advantages over Dublin. Waiting time which is a problem in Dublin is not a problem at Cork Airport which calls itself the friendliest airport in the world.  That people from Cork have to travel to Dublin to get connecting flights adds to the congestion and traffic problems at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for asking Aer Lingus to review its services into Cork from Europe, Britain and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday I accepted an invitation to visit the breast clinic at St. Vincent's <Col N="300" /> Hospital where there were 160 women.  The only common link among them was a fear of cancer because they had been referred by their GPs. They received a tremendous service: a clinical examination, a mammogram, a biopsy, were met by a surgeon and an oncologist and have the care of a clinical nurse and the friendship and services of the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>The service was excellent but the waiting was long.  In modern hospitals where there may be up to 220 women waiting for a service on a particular day it shows the need to expand that clinic and clinics throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is a disease from which 650 to 660 women in Ireland die each year.  I hope the Minister can reassure us the new development at St. Vincent's Hospital will include a specialised clinic to assist women at all stages of breast cancer disease.  One group which particularly needs attention are the high risk women who have a family history of cancer.  They need special care and a day allocated to them rather than all women at different stages being referred by their GPs from all over the country to attend on a Friday. It shows the need for clinics throughout the country.  Some 1,200 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year.  There is a tendency by all GPs to refer everybody to Dublin, thus creating a scare among women.  If dealt with locally, the problem may not be as bad.  When referred to Dublin women are more fearful.</P>
      <P>The need for a national breast screening service has been debated previously.  A number of factors lead to breast cancer but no real cause is known.  This means we cannot prevent breast cancer but we can detect it.  The most successful way of detecting it is by breast screening.  The Eccles Breast Screening Programme found a detection rate of 7.9 per cent per 1,000 women.  This is an extremely high rate, one of the highest in the EU. It has been proven that a national breast screening service for women aged between 50 and 64 can detect the cancer, therefore ensuring it can be treated.</P>
      <P>I accept there is a problem with compliance, getting the women to take up the offer of a mammogram. The results of the study in 1996 showed that 61.5 per cent opted to avail of the service in the first round but this was increased to 85 per cent in the second round.  This study asked about the feasibility of running a national programme. It needs to be phased in and women must comply. There is a need to get women to admit they are over 50 years of age and in need of the mammogram. Women need to accept that the test will not automatically show they have the disease.  Early detection means that women can be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to provide a high quality service throughout the country.  We will only accept the best when it comes to women's health.  Now is the time to start testing women in the 50 to 64 age bracket.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital will be established as a specialised centre and that the <Col N="301" /> first phase of the national breast screening programme will be implemented this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to providing a national breast screening service.  The implementation of a national breast screening programme is a major undertaking which requires careful planning and organisation.  From my Department's perspective, of particular concern is the need to achieve acceptable compliance levels and, at the same time, satisfy the necessary quality assurance criteria.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in March 1997 the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction, on a phased basis, of a national breast cancer screening programme. The first phase, which is in preparation, will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and target 120,000 women in the 50 to 64 age group, which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>A major challenge was the need to establish a named population register which would comply with data protection requirements.  However, following the passage of the Health Provision (No. 3) Act, 1997, and subsequent correspondence with the Data Protection Commissioner, we are in a position to proceed with the establishment of a population register for the programme.  Work is well advanced and it is hoped to have the register in place by April or May.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the cancer action plan there have been a number of other important developments in relation to breast screening.  These include the establishment of a national steering group chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, to guide the implementation of the national breast cancer screening programme; the establishment of a national quality assurance committee chaired by Professor Ennis, consultant radiologist, Mater Hospital, as a sub-committee of the steering group and which is representative of experts from all the relevant clinical disciplines; and the decision to appoint Dr. Jane Buttimer, deputy chief medical officer in the Department of Health and Children, as project director for the programme. Dr. Buttimer will take up her duties shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key development in recent months was the decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for phase one of the programme.  It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  There will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to <Col N="302" /> women in more remote-rural areas within the three health board areas included in phase one. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the lead-in time involved in the development of IT systems, the establishment of a population register and the recruitment of consultant and support staff, I am advised that we should be in a position to commence the screening programme by September.  I am committed to making the necessary resources available.  Substantial funding has been made available to meet the start-up costs for the programme.</P>
    <P>It is important to introduce the programme on a phased basis to ensure high quality and promote high uptake of the service.  Decisions taken in relation to the timing of subsequent phases will be guided by the experience gained in implementing phase one of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last two years 2,500 children in 32 national schools in east Galway, with Loughrea at the centre, have been without a dental service due to the retirement of the former dental surgeon last year and, prior to his retirement, his ill health.  This is not good enough. When children in fifth and sixth class move to second level in June they will no longer be eligible for inclusion in the scheme unless the Minister uses his discretion and asks the health board to extend the period of eligibility when the position has been filled.  That should be done immediately.</P>
      <P>The health board is seeking to fill the position by offering six month contracts.  No professionally trained dentist will accept such an offer which is neither attractive nor lucrative.  If there is an embargo, it should be lifted immediately.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider providing a fully staffed and equipped mobile dental unit on a pilot basis in County Galway?  A similar service is provided in other countries.  We could probably save money by providing the service on that basis, although I accept dental nurses visit schools on an occasional basis.  As the children in fifth and sixth class have not been screened through no fault of their own, will the Minister give a commitment that they will remain eligible for orthodontic treatment?</P>
      <P>A parent who sought access to the orthodontic service for her daughter received the following reply from the Western Health Board:</P>
      <P>Following your visit to Portumna Health Centre with your daughter Amanda last Friday, I contacted the Orthodontic Department at Merlin Park Hospital.  They have informed me that before a patient's name can be put on the waiting list for a brace all fillings must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter went on to state that she would have to have the fillings done privately in this instance. A footnote to the letter stated: &ldquo;You must take <Col N="303" /> Amanda to be seen by a health board dentist before referral is made.&rdquo; The current position in the Loughrea area is impossible without the services of a health board dental surgeon.  I ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure that a dentist is appointed permanently to the Loughrea centre serving Portumna, Loughrea and its environs, 32 schools in all, as a matter of urgency.  The problems with which parents have had to cope over the past two years are unacceptable and the dental health of some students is being damaged.  Will the health board take responsibility for that damage?  I thank the Minister for taking this matter this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for his contribution on a problem in his own area.  The problems being experienced by the Western Health Board in providing dental services to children in east Galway are not due to inadequate funding. They are due to difficulties being experienced by the board in the recruitment of dentists to fill approved posts for which funding has been provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>For the past number of years the Western Health Board, in common with other health boards, has been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school-based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in specific classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school-based approach.  The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  It is the policy of the Western Health Board to provide dental treatment to children in second, fourth and sixth class subject to available resources.</P>
      <P>The biggest obstacle being experienced by the board in providing a comprehensive public dental service to children is its difficulty, as Deputy Burke pointed out, in recruiting dentists to fill permanent posts in the region.  The seriousness of this problem varies throughout the board's area, but it is most pronounced in the outlying rural areas which he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Galway area the board prioritises second and sixth class for dental assessment and the provision of treatment as necessary.  This year, for the first time, the assessment programme is being extended to children in fourth class.  In practice, this target is only achievable where the dental services <Col N="304" /> are well established and have not been interrupted due to loss of staff.  This is most likely to be the position in Galway city and other large towns.  In most other areas children in second and sixth class only are being assessed.</P>
    <P>However, the position is that in a number of outlying rural areas in Galway, dental services are interrupted on a regular basis due to unfilled dental posts as a result of retirement, maternity leave or simply temporary staff seeking permanent employment elsewhere.  In these areas children in second and sixth class are not being assessed on time.  This creates a backlog of children requiring assessment and even when temporary dental staff are eventually recruited they are unable to clear this backlog for some time.  In some situations this can result in children leaving national school and not having had their sixth class assessment.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Western Health Board that the current position regarding the filling of vacancies for dental surgeons in the east Galway region is as follows.  In Ballinasloe there has been an interrupted service but a permanent appointment has been made as from 2 January of this year.  In Loughrea and Portumna the holder of the post retired last summer, as Deputy Burke pointed out, and I am informed the board has been unable to secure an appointment.  In the adjoining Tuam area, a dentist is currently acting in a temporary capacity and she will take up a permanent appointment from 2 March 1998.</P>
    <P>The board has made strenuous efforts regionally, nationally and to the extent of seeking recruitment abroad to fill existing vacancies for dental surgeons throughout its area.  It will continue to maintain these efforts.  It has had some success for east Galway and is hopeful of further success.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the position Deputy Burke has outlined.  I emphasise again that this is not happening as a result of lack of funds from central Government but because of the great difficulty in getting dentists into the public dental system. I take the point that the people in the area he is referring to are at a disadvantage because of that.  I will take up the matter personally with the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board and with the dental section in my Department to see what more can be done to ensure people in his or any other constituency are not at a disadvantage compared to other children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Education and Science for coming into the House to reply to this debate.  It is an issue in which the Minister for Health and Children might have an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a fairly regular basis, and particularly over the past number of weeks, there has been a great deal of discussion about child welfare and the need for good quality child protection services, but many of our child protection services are hopelessly inadequate.  Information is emerging rapidly in that respect which proves the point.  It <Col N="305" /> is unfortunate that we are spending approximately 80 per cent of our child care budget on emergency services, leaving only 20 per cent for any work in the vitally important prevention area. Any of the professionals working in the field will point to the enormous importance that must be attached to this area.  The earlier a problem can be detected, the better chance there is of intervention being successful.  The problem must be dealt with before it gets to the stage where it is out of control.  That has happened far too often in relation to children's issues.  We should aim to spend an equal amount on emergency and prevention services.</P>
    <P>One of the most important prevention services in relation to child care is the school attendance service.  If we had a proper school attendance service in place we could identify many of the child welfare issues at a point when we could do something to tackle them.  The service is hopelessly inadequate.  Most of the country does not have a service and, in the areas that do, it is hopelessly inadequate.  We must accept that absence from school on a regular basis is generally the earliest indication that there is something seriously wrong at home.  That is the point at which the services must kick in and the necessary support must be provided to children and to families if we are serious about tackling child welfare issues.</P>
    <P>There is a service in the Dublin city area and two or three areas outside of Dublin but incredibly, in the rest of the country, the gardaí are expected to deal with this problem.  That is a total nonsense because Garda time is more than taken up dealing with crime and traffic issues.  They do not have any expertise in the child care or school attendance areas.  The service as it currently operates is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the service in the Dublin city area with which I am familiar.  The service is barely adequate, it has some kind of vague relationship with the Department of Education and Science, Dublin Corporation pays for it and yet it is accountable to nobody.  As a member of Dublin City Council I find it extraordinary that we spend almost £1 million on this service yet we cannot ask questions about it or take any decisions in relation to policy.  Some of the decisions taken over the years in relation to the deployment of staff are beyond belief.  Areas of greatest need have the fewest officers and areas where there is the least need have the most officers.  There is no hands-on management of the service, no accountability and no co-ordination with other agencies.  However, it is better than no service.  Attempts were made in recent years to employ extra staff to improve the quality of service, but it is far from ideal.  The service covers the city area as it existed up to 1985, but that area excluded two important parts of Dublin, Cherry Orchard and Ballymun.  A major anomaly exists because the city boundary changed in 1985 but the boundaries of the school attendance service did not change accordingly.  Two major areas of <Col N="306" /> Dublin are not being served by the Dublin city school attendance service.</P>
    <P>Cherry Orchard is in the Taoiseach's constituency and I would have thought he would have played a more proactive role in ensuring the provision of a quality service in that area.  Ballymun is in my constituency.  Both areas have large populations, particularly large young populations, high levels of educational disadvantage and a corresponding high level of unemployment.  It is no coincidence that the latter two correspond.  A major problem in those two areas is the high rate of absenteeism in schools.  Many schools report a regular absentee rate of 20 per cent and in some schools the rate is 30 per cent at times.  On any one day almost one-third of the children are not present in school and nothing is being done about that.  How can we say we are serious about child welfare unless we are prepared to tackle that problem as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <P>Recent research in Ballymun revealed that a staggering 69 per cent of people in Ballymun leave school without any educational qualification, not even the junior certificate.  That figure is an indictment of our education system.  That relates to the high drop out rate from school and regular non-attendance at primary school.  There are two problems; students not transferring to the post-primary school and regular non-attendance at primary school, which results in children falling behind in their studies, finding school too difficult and irrelevant and then dropping out.  Until such time as the long awaited school attendance Bill is introduced, which should be given priority by the Government, will the Minister arrange by ministerial order to change the boundaries for the Dublin city school attendance service to include Ballymun and Cherry Orchard, two areas of great need?  I look forward to the Minister's positive response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since he became Taoiseach he has pointed out to me the needs of Cherry Orchard in particular.  We cannot attribute blame to him because he was not responsible for the school attendance service for the past four years and he did not have responsibility for education.  I did not want to begin to reply to the Deputy in this vein but critical comments were made.  I am surprised that nothing happened in the past four years about the school attendance service.  I accept the Deputy's points about its inadequacy, <Col N="307" /> but the reality is that in the past four years nothing was done to expand or reform the service. On the one hand we say it is an inadequate model but on the other we say we must expand it.  That is a false premise.  The existing model has inadequacies.  Solving the problem of absenteeism and school attendance is much more complex than simply appointing school attendance officers.  It has a good deal to do with the curriculum on offer in primary and secondary schools, the provision of better psychological services, the appointment of more remedial teachers and a comprehensive range of other measures required to intervene in the early cycle of a child to ensure greater attendance at school other than requiring a school attendance officer to call to houses to check which children are not attending school.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation the school attendance service is provided by school attendance committees in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford.  They are under the responsibility of the local authorities which recruit school attendance officers.  I served on a school attendance committee in Cork and I am aware of the Deputy's points in that regard.  In the remainder of the country, including the Ballymun and Cherry Orchard areas to which the Deputy specifically refers, the service is provided by the Garda Síochána.  I agree that is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I am not satisfied that existing arrangements governing school attendance services offer an adequate response to today's needs.  There is a need for a fundamental review of our approach to this area. We need a system which identifies potential school attendance problems at the earliest possible stage and which can intervene with the necessary support services tailored to the needs of the children at risk of drop out.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance. My objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn.  I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.  The existing draft legislation worked on by the previous Government envisaged that regional education boards would appoint school attendance officers.  There were no detailed plans for the establishment of regional education boards or the establishment by them of school attendance services over the next number of years.  Even if the Education (No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> 1) Bill had been passed we would be years waiting for those boards to be established and to put in place a school attendance service.  We have had to take the provision for regional education boards out of that Bill and change it completely because it was so reliant on them.  We are considering other ways of delivering a service around the country within an education context and in co-ordination with other statutory bodies and agencies outside education.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's point on special interventions, there is a range already in place to support children who might otherwise be in danger of dropping out of the school system.  They include the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home-school-community liaison scheme and the teacher counsellor scheme.  Those interventions make an important contribution to combating school attendance problems.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the House that an important new initiative, which will be targeted specifically at children in the eight to 15 year age group who have dropped out or are in danger of dropping out of the school system, is currently being put in place.  The aim of that initiative is to identify effective models of practice which can be replicated in other areas of disadvantage.  In March of this year I will hold a National Forum on Early Childhood Education to consider how services in this very important area can be developed for the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident the programmes which I outlined, coupled with the legislative measures I will bring forward later this year, will have a major impact on our school attendance problems.  We will consider other issues in the interim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the early 1990s the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has undertaken reviews of the certificate examinations in conjunction with the Education Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  This analysis deals mainy with subject choice, percentage participation by males/females and pattern of grades across subjects etc. International benchmarking has not been a feature of these reviews.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Education (No. 2) Bill, which is currently before this House, will place the NCCA on a statutory basis.  In this context my Department will discuss further with this body its approach to all aspects of its work programmes including issues such as that raised by the Deputy in his question.</P>
      <P>On a broader level, I feel that there is a real value in international comparisons of standards. Ireland is participating in an OECD project beginning in the year 2000 on the achievement of 15 year olds in reading, science and mathematics. This will be the first occasion in which direct comparison will be possible in three key curricular areas at 15 years of age, an age when the vast majority of pupils sit the junior certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason my Department has commenced a programme of international benchmarking <Col N="310" /> of standards of attainment in a number of leaving certificate subjects.  There are no developed international benchmarking exercises for curricular attainment in any subjects at age 17 or 18, when almost all pupils in Ireland take the leaving certificate examination.  Therefore the current international comparative exercise involving leaving certificate physics is both innovative and mould breaking.  The first such exercise, which is being led by Ireland, is focused on physics and involves eight other EU countries.  I intend that we will use the experience gained here to benchmark Irish standards in other leaving certificate subjects in succeeding years.</P>

I must await greater elaboration of the students' case and legal advice before deciding how to proceed on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education and training of nurses is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.  As Deputies are aware, a revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis and has since been extended to a large number of nursing schools in <Col N="311" /> association with local higher education institutions. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a Diploma in Nursing Studies and students are eligible with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.  The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children at a cost of some £13 million in 1997 and accordingly, the question of student fees for the diploma programme does not arise.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the continuing education of nurses is that the Department of Health and Children has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training. The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  These programmes are provided on a self-financing basis and the nurses involved can claim tax relief on their fees or can apply to their relevant health agency for assistance from the funding provided by the Department of Health and Children for the continuing education of registered nurses.</P>
    <P>A one year full-time degree course leading to a Bachelor of Nursing commenced last month in the National University of Ireland, Galway. When the Higher Education Authority became aware of the proposal to introduce this course, it had discussions with the National University of Ireland, Galway and asked the university to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.  The university has advised the Higher Education Authority that it is proceeding with the course and I understand that 51 students have enrolled on it.  In view of these developments and the implications for nursing education generally, my Department is currently engaged in further discussions on the matter with the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The latest report to my Department from the child abuse prevention programme CAPP team indicates that approximately 80 per cent of primary schools are teaching the programme.  Statistics are not available on the number of children in these schools who did not participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, over 85 per cent of schools have arranged parent meetings.  This is an encouraging and significant factor as the experience has been that the number of schools which have held parent meetings closely mirrors the number of schools which will eventually teach the programme. The Deputy will appreciate that there is often a time-lag between the holding of a parent meeting and the introduction of the programme into a school.</P>
      <P>CAPP is now providing a co-teaching service to a small number of the schools which have not yet introduced the Stay Safe programme.  A designated CAPP teacher teaches the programme with the class teacher.  This service is being well-received by the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the Stay Safe programme is considered to be the most appropriate and most effective programme for addressing the needs of school children in this area.  The programme <Col N="313" /> has been updated in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the user's handbook and lesson plans have been revised.  A new video has also been produced.  The introduction of the updated &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; pack to primary schools throughout the country is taking place this school term.  In addition, the revised primary curriculum, which is nearing completion, will place a renewed emphasis on social, personal and health education, and there will be a requirement on schools to provide personal safety education for children.  The nationwide network of 40 teachers, working on a part-time basis, is still in place.  This network is continuing to support those schools currently teaching the programme and to target those schools which are not yet participating in the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 15 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses of which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The annual higher education grants scheme which I approve sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme.  The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions.  However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
      <P>The scope of the higher education grants scheme was addressed in the report of the advisory committee on third level student support, which was chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir and published in February 1995.  That report recommended the inclusion of full-time courses pursued in private colleges which are NCEA validated within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants including the eligibility rules and the administration of the scheme.  In this regard, the scope of these schemes is being considered as part of an ongoing review of the existing arrangements.  This review will be completed in advance of the 1998 student support schemes.  I should point out to the Deputy that any extension of the existing arrangements can only be considered in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 28 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures is drawn up and applied in the school.  Such a code is unique to each school as it reflects a whole host of factors associated with the community which it serves.  My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area.  I am satisfied that these guidelines have provided a basis for a more uniform approach to discipline issues generally by schools.</P>
      <P>Primary and second-level schools have not to date been required to notify my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools.  For that reason I am unable to provide comprehensive statistics in this area.  I am unhappy with this situation and in consultation with the partners I intend to put in mechanisms to ensure the collection of such data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I can inform the Deputy that my Department is very significantly involved in securing alternative placement for students who have been excluded from school.  Typically, this involvement, which usually follows approaches <Col N="315" /> from parents of students who have been excluded, can entail a process of the student's educational assessment and consultations with school authorities.  At any one time this process is ongoing in over 100 cases.  In general we are successful in securing alternative places although I would stress that this can be a difficult and protracted process.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the Fianna Fáil policy document on education we are committed to addressing the needs of children with school attendance problems. In this context it is proposed to introduce a School Attendance (Amendment) Bill during the current year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of his assessment of the administration costs of establishing regional education boards; the way in which this compares with the administration costs of the vocational education committees; and the plans, if any, he has for organisation and development of the VEC system.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997 I indicated to the House that since taking up office I have discovered a 1995 estimate that the then proposed regional education boards would cost £40 million a year to run and that there was no credible plan drawn up for their establishment.  As the House will be aware I do not propose to establish these education boards.</P>
      <P>Meaningful comparison between that estimate and the administrative costs of the vocational education committees is not possible because the duties and responsibilites of vocational education committees and the formerly proposed boards are different.  Whereas the functions proposed for the education boards centred around the co-ordination of education services in their regions, the powers, duties and responsibilities of vocational education committees relate to the provision of education services both in an in school and in an out of school context within a significantly smaller geographical area.  I can, however, tell the Deputy that the administrative staff costs in the VEC sector in 1995 amounted to approximately £13 million.</P>
      <P>The strengthening of vocational education is an important part of my agenda and I am committed to full consultations with all contributors to this sector on the precise nature of legislation to achieve this end.  Following these consultations, I intend to introduce amending legislation which will deal with a range of issues including the future composition and development of vocational education committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>While the allocation of teachers to classes is, of course, the responsibility of the school principal and board of management, maximum class size guidelines aim to ensure that schools do not have excessively large classes.  Information available from statistical returns submitted to my Department by primary schools suggests that there are classes in breach of maximum class guidelines.  I should also point out to the Deputy that very many schools have classes which are much smaller than the maxima.  It is important to emphasise, however, that, where maximum class size guidelines are breached in a particular class or classes in a school, this decision is often taken within the school to facilitate much smaller classes elsewhere in the same school.  Where schools are unable to organise their classes within the recommended maxima, they may apply to my Department for the appointment of an additional teacher.  In the current school year, a total of 44 schools received additional staffing for this purpose.</P>
      <P>While detailed information in relation to class sizes in individual second level schools is not provided to my Department, the Deputy will be aware that significant improvements have occurred in the pupil-teacher ratio in recent years and this has undoubtedly been a factor in diminishing average class sizes.  Despite this programme of sustained improvement, I have no doubt that some classes at second level are larger than we would wish.  This is one of the issues taken into account by my Department when considering appeals from individual school authorities for increased teacher allocations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the findings in the 1996 ESRI annual school leavers survey which the Deputy is referring to, which indicate that a person's socioeconomic status continues to exert a strong influence on educational participation at third level.  The survey was sponsored by my Department.</P>
      <P>There is a range of measures in place to further the fundamental policy objective of promoting equality of access to, participation in and benefit from third level education.  The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the the third level sector has been recognised for some time.  In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>In 1997, my Department provided £77,000 in direct financing for three access initiatives involving Dublin City University, University of Limerick and Trinity College to improve participation of pupils from disadvantaged areas at third level. The initiatives involve linkages between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to measures specifically targeted at third level, the Higher Education Authority has provided £260,000 in 1996 and £475,000 in 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  I understand that further provision will be made by the Higher Education Authority in 1998 on the basis of proposals from colleges.  These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
      <P>In the technological sector, the colleges have a comprehensive set of activities in which they interact with second level schools and disadvantaged groups.  A policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.  The recruitment and admissions committee of Dublin Institute of Technology is discussing details of this decision, including the mechanism for its implementation and the quota of students involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Regional Technical College equality network project which arose out of the EU programme, New Opportunities for Women, is operational <Col N="319" /> in six institutes of technology. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus at women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.  These programmes include school taster programmes and a new module in mathematics for female transition year students.</P>
    <P>In 1995, approval was given for a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA Level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in institutes of technology.  This pilot scheme is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the implementation of the relationship and sexuality education programme in schools; if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by teacher unions and parent associations regarding the delays in implementing the programme; the steps, if any, he will take to expedite it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the majority of schools will introduce programmes of relationships and sexuality education RSE during the 1997-98 school year.  Schools are at different stages in the implementation of RSE.  Some schools have been teaching such programmes for many years; others are in the process of preparing for the introduction of the programme.</P>
      <P>Introduction of a programme of relationships and sexuality education in a school is a process, involving a number of stages.  Schools make progress through the stages at different rates.  I believe that this is the most effective way of moving forward.</P>
      <P>The first step is the development of a school policy, which is the product of a collaborative process between school management, teachers and parents.  When approved by the board of management, this policy, together with the curriculum and guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and approved by my Department, will guide the school staff in drawing up a school-based programme. The majority of schools are currently involved in developing school policies.</P>
      <P>All the partners in education, including the teacher unions and parent associations, have been consulted from the outset on all matters relating to the implementation of relationships and sexuality education, and are currently members of the implementation group established by my Department to oversee the implementation of the programme. None of the partners has brought concerns about the pace of implementation to the attention of the implementation group.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have ensured that all the necessary supports have been put in place to assist schools in preparing for the introduction of relationships and sexuality education. Most recently, I have requested my Department, in consultation with the partners on the implementation group, to prepare a newsletter detailing progress to date and the supports available, for issue to schools and parents.  The newsletter will be disseminated to schools in the coming days.  I will arrange for a copy of the newsletter to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently launched the national forum on early childhood education.  The forum will be held in Dublin Castle from 23 March 1998 to 27 March 1998.  Following the conclusion of the national forum, an independent report of its proceedings and conclusions will be prepared by the independent secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.</P>
      <P>I consider the national forum, and its independent report, to be a very important step in the process of developing the White Paper and I can assure the Deputy that work on the White Paper will commence without delay following the conclusion of the national forum and the publication of the independent report.</P>

      <P>My Department issued guidelines to all primary schools in November, 1991 under the title Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Child Abuse, and to post-primary schools in 1992 under the title Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse.  These guidelines were drawn up in consultation with the education partners.  They cover suspected child abuse, either external or internal, to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines make clear that the role of the school authorities is to ensure that suspicions or <Col N="323" /> allegations should be reported by the chairman, manager or chief executive officer to the health authorities or the Garda.  The guidelines advise that, if there is indisputable evidence that an individual has abused a child, the matter must be reported directly to the Garda.</P>
    <P>A working party, representative of the education partners, is currently examining those guidelines with a view to ensuring that they remain relevant to the situations faced by teachers in their classrooms.  Representatives of a number of health boards have joined the working party.  I am satisfied this type of close co-operation between the health board, the partners and my Department will assist schools and teachers in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.</P>

      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services, and in particular the lack of transparent procedures and adequate funding for core activities in certain institutions.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles <Col N="325" /> of transparency and accountability.  The working group has now completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has recently issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
      <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams-registration and towards student services on an annual basis.  In relation to my direction that any arrangements put in place should not adversely affect the current funding of students unions, clubs and societies, the framework recommends that institutions be cognisant of the average contribution from the £150 base in this regard of £50, when determining the revised contribution for these services from the £250 charge.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this framework will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>

      <P>Following a recommendation contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report on the provision of second level accommodation, the planning and building unit of my Department has undertaken extensive work on the issues that need to be addressed by an inventory of accommodation.  Some of the items, particularly those raised by the Deputy relating to the condition of existing accommodation, are of a detailed technical nature and will need to be addressed by qualified personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the building unit of the Department has been exploring the possibility of sub-contracting the work involved, including work relating to the creation of a computerised database. Proposals are at present being formulated by the building unit for consideration by senior management.  However, any decision to proceed <Col N="326" /> to the implementation phase will have to be subject to a cost benefit analysis by the Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the primary sector, my Department carried out a survey of schools in 1994 which provides some limited data on the overall condition of primary school buildings.  Depending on the results of the studies being undertaken at second level, it may be possible to undertake similar work at primary level.  However, it is far too early at this stage to indicate when such an exercise will be undertaken.  The cost involved will be a crucial factor in determining whether such a project would be justified.  The condition of school buildings and facilities is, in the first instance, a matter for individual school managements who receive annual funding from my Department for maintenance and minor improvement works.  It is also open to schools to apply to my Department for grant-aid towards the cost of larger projects and, in so doing, school management apprise my Department of any deficiences in their accommodation.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has established a committee to consider the development of an &ldquo;education bank&rdquo;.  The establishment of an education bank is in accordance with the current concept of lifelong learning arising from the need for constant retraining necessitated by the demands of the workplace, which are constantly changing, and the contribution that learning makes to the personal development of individuals.  The primary purpose of the bank will be to establish a fund which would remove many of the financial barriers to further education.  Contributions to this fund would come from a variety of sources which have an interest in improving the adult education services.  Withdrawals would be made as needed by individuals or groups to cover the expenses of compensatory education, upskilling and retraining.</P>

      <P>I raised the possible effects of the proposed changes to tuition fee arrangements with Mr. David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, at a meeting in London in December 1997.  The Secretary of State assured me that it was not the UK Government's intention to deter Irish students from coming to the UK and that the new fee arrangements were designed to allow students to contribute fairly to the costs of their higher education.  As the Deputy is aware, the proposals involve the introduction of an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, the continuation of free tuition for students from lower income families and the replacement of maintenance grants with student loans.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a more coherent and effective system of certification for higher education and training, other than universities, as well as for the vocational education and training sector has been endorsed by successive Governments and by the European Union, which also supports it as part of the current Operational Programme for Human Resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> This need for a more coherent and effective system was acknowledged in the National Development Plan which was agreed with the European Union.  This was agreed because all sides accepted and supported arguments of the needs for a system which would, <i>inter alia</i>, involve industry and the social partners.  Successive Governments have taken this position.  I have been in contact with the European Commission in relation to proposals for the development of a framework and the mutually supportive position remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Teastas, the Irish National Certification Autuority, was established as an interim authority on 18 September 1995.  Teastas reported on an interim basis in January 1997 and has recently issued its second report.</P>
    <P>My aim is to complete the consultation process in relation to the national qualifications framework in the coming weeks.  In that regard, I am hosting a forum with the key groups tomorrow. When the consultation process is complete, it is my intention to publish legislation to appropriately underpin a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <P>At second level, the approved course for junior pupils and for those following a leaving certificate course, must include Irish.  The rules of the Department of Education and Science do not specify the amount of time per week to be devoted to teaching the subject at second level. However this will vary with the year of study and the programme being followed.  It is estimated that the time involved would be between two hours and three hours 20 minutes per class each week.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the Department of Education and Science does not prescribe a specific amount of time per week for any curricular area.  When the primary curriculum was being introduced to schools in the 1970s, inspectors issued a set of guidelines on time-allocation at in-career development courses for teachers.  Their recommendations have become the accepted norm in the system and were supported in the &ldquo;Report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum (1990)&rdquo;, known as the Quinlan report.  It was recommended in these guidelines that 19 per cent of the instruction time in infant classes and 21 per cent of the instruction time in classes I to VI would be devoted to Irish.</P>
      <P>Primary schools typically allocate between three and three hours 30 minutes per week to teaching spoken Irish in infant classes and between four hours 30 minutes and five hours per week to the teaching of Irish, including oral Irish, reading and writing, to classes I to VI.  In a primary school year of 183 days or 36.6 weeks, this would approximate to between 110 hours and 128 hours per year in infant classes and between 165 and 183 hours per year in classes I to VI.</P>

      <P>The managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, a graded system of sanctions and procedures is drawn up and applied in the school.  Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a code of behaviour appropriate to its needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area.  While the guidelines recognise that there is a need for sanctions, including temporary suspension, <Col N="331" /> to register disapproval of unacceptable behaviour, they stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort. In reaching decisions in individual cases, school authorities have to balance carefully the needs of individual students with their responsibility to the general body of their students.  In the context of imposing sanctions, schools are advised they should ensure that the rules of natural justice apply and pupils are advised of their right of appeal.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin has been made available to every school.  The report sets out models of best practice and is a very valuable resource for schools.  The report also indicates that curriculum change, especially the new programmes at second level such as the transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme are impacting very positively on students and contribute to a reduction in breaches of discipline.  The introduction of the junior certificate school programme will assist further in matching the abilities, aptitudes and interests of each student which will impact positively on the behaviour of students.</P>
    <P>I am currently finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service. This will be a resource for school management and help them in dealing with vital areas such as school planning and discipline.  I intend to put this service in place for the new school year in consultation with the partners in education.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill currently before the House provides for a statutory right of appeal against decisions of boards of management including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion. This right of appeal will greatly strengthen the capacity to balance all rights and obligations in this difficult area.</P>

      <P>I have not proposed the establishment of a new central agency to pay grants to third level students.  I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants and in this context, I am considering the administrative arrangements for the scheme.  The report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, which was published in February 1995, found the administrative arrangements to be fragmented, <Col N="332" /> cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  The advisory committee recommended that the processing of grant applications and payments be transferred to a central applications office.</P>
      <P>I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  In August 1997 a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs commenced an examination of various options for the future administration of the student support schemes including the case for and against transferring this activitiy to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>There are currently 112 one teacher schools.  In March 1997, the then Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> Since there are no teaching posts available to me for allocation to these schools, I am currenlty examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.

      <P>I am aware of the recent report published by the INTO regarding substandard schools.  In this context, I point to the very significant increase on funding for primary capital projects contained in the 1998 Estimates.  Substantial progress will be made this year and the Government has signalled its clear commitment to tackle the problem of substandard schools.  In that context I point to a 40 per cent increase in primary capital funding over the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>Given the need to keep a tight control on the public finances, it is not possible to fund all deserving projects simultaneously.  Consequently, I have had discussions with the INTO, and others, concerning the development of a points-based project priorisation system.  I expect to make progress on this matter very shortly.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the class teacher to identify pupils who have clearly observable difficulties in acquiring basic skills in literary and-or numeracy.  The class teacher has the primary responsibility for teaching these pupils.

      <P>The criterion used to determine a pupil's appropriateness for remedial teaching is that she-he functions at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics.

      <P>It is the responsibility of the principal of the school to communicate directly with parents, or to delegate the responsibility to the class or remedial teacher, in regard to all matters concerning pupils who need remedial teaching.

      <P>I recently announced an amendment to the Irish requirement for appointment as a teacher in vocational schools and community colleges. The objective of the amendment was to remove anomalies and inconsistencies which existed within the second level sector in relation to the Irish requirement for teaching purposes. Up to now, to be eligible for appointment to a teaching post under a vocational education committee, <Col N="335" /> an applicant had to pass both the oral and written ceard teastas gaeilge.  In the case of secondary, community and comprehensive schools, a pass in the oral component of the ceard teastas satisfied the Irish requirement.</P>
      <P>In future it will be necessary for an applicant to have passed only the ceard teastas oral examination to satisfy the Irish requirement for appointment to a teaching position in all second level schools.  With a view to ensuring an appropriate standard in the case of the oral examination a revised syllabus is currently being prepared.  It is anticipated that the revised syllabus will be in effect for the examinations from spring 1999 onwards.</P>

    <P>Last year I announced my intention to develop, in liaison with the health authorities, a national educational psychological service.  This will be available to all primary and second level schools as well as to young people of school-going age who are outside the formal educational system. Planning for this service is well advanced.  A planning group, representative of the partners in education, will report to me before the end of April of this year.  The report of the planning group will be critical in planning for expansion of the psychological service.</P>
    <P>To meet the current need for an expanded educational psychological service in the primary sector, the Department of Education and Science is jointly organising with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, a development project which will last for three years.  Fifteen qualified psychologists are to be employed on a contract basis for the duration of the project.  The selection process for these posts has now been completed. These psychologists will work in regional terms under the management of the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science, and will be taking up their duties during the current school year.</P>

      <P>The performance of Irish nine year olds <Col N="337" /> in mathematics and literacy was examined in a number of international studies since 1990 and in each case gender differences were considered.  In the Second International Assessment of Educational Progress in Mathematics and Science (1991), and again in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (1995), the average score in mathematics of Irish nine year old girls was higher than that of boys of the same age. However, differences found were not statistically significant.</P>
      <P>The reading literacy performance of Irish nine year olds was assessed in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) Study of 1991.  Average scores on the reading literacy test were higher for girls than for boys in all participating countries. Gender differences were found to be greater in Ireland than in most other countries.  Gender difference in numeracy and literacy achievements is a significant issue which warrants further exploration. In this context it will form part of the national reading survey which will be conducted by the Educational Research Centre and my Department's inspectorate in May 1998.  In addition, the revised primary curriculum in English currently being prepared by the NCCA will place special emphasis on the development of oral language competence in both boys and girls.</P>

      <P>Class contact for teachers in second level schools is 22 hours per week.  There is no provision in the voluntary secondary sector for a reduction in class contact hours for assistant principals. In the case of vocational and community and comprehensive schools the class contact hours of assistant principals are reduced by four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the revised proposals for agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> approximately 1,300 additional assistant principal posts will be created.  These will be allocated as follows: approximately 400 in vocational schools, approximately 200 in community and comprehensive schools and the balance in voluntary secondary schools.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement did not provide for a specific additional teaching allocation to be made to school authorities arising from the creation of these assistant principal posts. However, the position of individual community and comprehensive schools and vocational education <Col N="338" /> committees will be considered in the context of curricular concessions within available resources.</P>

      <P>The specific qualification requirements for the purposes of teaching in a second level school vary depending on the type of school involved.  In general, in order to be qualified to teach in a second level school, a person must hold a recognised degree or equivalent qualification, a recognised training-in-teaching qualification and pass a test of competency in oral Irish.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the number of persons who qualified as second level teachers in the years in question.  However, the following tables show the number of males and females who registered as secondary teachers and the number who qualified for the award of the higher diploma in education in the ten years since 1986.  The available figures which are shown in the tables indicate a consistent and continuing trend of significantly more females than males entering the profession.</P>

      <P>I understand from my Department that the child in question was out of school for the period between January 1996 and December 1997 as a result of difficulties regarding his behaviour in the school.  I further understand that the child is currently attending the school in question for 12 hours per week, with the support of a childcare worker.  It is felt by the professionals dealing with the child that he is only able to cope with this level of attendance for the present.</P>
      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated to special classes which cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources, including child care support, are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the child in question will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 61 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The budget of £1.2 million referred to by Deputy Bruton is merely the cost in 1997 of the school attendance service in the areas covered by the school attendance committees.  These committees operate in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford.  The cost to the Garda Síochána of operating the school attendance service in the remainder of the country is not available as it is not possible to segregate this cost from the overall cost of the wider range of functions carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>My Department has a range of measures in place to support children who might otherwise be in danger of dropping out of the school system. These include the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and the teaching counsellor scheme.  It is my intention to review the effectiveness of each of these schemes and to introduce further developments or refinements as necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, an important new initiative which will be targeted specifically at children in the eight to 15 year age group who have dropped out of school or are in danger of dropping out of the system, is currently being put in place.</P>
      <P>While the above measures will make a valuable contribution towards combating non-school attendance, legislation is required to address the fundamental inadequacies of our current school attendance services.  My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance.  My objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn.  I hope to be in a position to publish the draft legislation before the end of the year.  A key objective of this legislation will be to put appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that children's attendance is properly monitored and that corrective action can be taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  A total of 32 resource teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a resource teaching service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of this recent OECD report which is based on an international reading literacy survey carried out in 1991.  As the report points out it would be a normal expectation that about 15 per cent of the population in any of the participating countries would have a low reading score. In the case of Ireland and a number of other countries a somewhat higher rate of 20 per cent was shown and other countries had even higher rates.</P>
      <P>A number of policy initiatives have been put in place to address this issue.  Special education facilities including enhanced remedial provision, visiting teacher services and teacher counsellors have been put in place.  Measures to help disadvantaged pupils at primary and second level have been strengthened.  The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has been reduced.  Foundation level syllabi in English and Irish at junior certificate level have been provided.  A junior certificate school programme has been introduced to help a small minority of students whose learning needs are not adequately met by the present junior certificate. The revised primary curriculum will have specific emphasis on reading literacy.  A new scheme is being introduced to help eight-13 year olds who are in danger of leaving school early and who may have literacy problems.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school to which the Deputiues refer has been seeking inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.

      <P>As an alternative to a further widening of the scheme, and following in-depth studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, a new pilot project, Breaking the Cycle, was launched in May 1996.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>National surveys of reading attainment of 11 year old pupils in fifth class in primary schools have taken place at regular intervals over the last 25 years.  These have been conducted by the inspectorate in my Department in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  The most recent survey was held in 1993.  The next survey will take place in 1998.  National surveys in mathematics have been less frequent.  The last such survey was conducted in 1984 involving fifth and sixth class pupils.</P>
      <P>I intend to put in place a process to commence a national survey of literacy and numeracy standards at primary level in the forthcoming school year.  In this context my Department is consulting with the Educational Research Centre regarding plans for national five year surveys in English reading for fifth class pupils and in mathematics for fourth class pupils.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible up to now to make any direct comparison between such national surveys and international surveys.  This is because the international surveys have dealt with different age groups and involved different test instruments. Many countries are now in the process of developing national systems of performance of pupils and linking these to international studies of achievement.  As part of a restructuring of the inspectorate within my Department an audit unit is being developed for this purpose and plans are being finalised to conduct more regular surveys of attainment.</P>
      <P>At second level no national surveys of attainment have been carried out.  However, second level pupils have taken part in international reading literacy surveys for 14 year olds in 1991 and in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMMS, for third class primary pupils and for first and second year second level pupils in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international reading literacy study was carried out by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, IEA.  The study showed that Irish nine year olds ranked 12th out of 27 countries and, in the case of the 14 years olds, 20th out of 31 countries.  The data from the IEA study was further analysed by the ERC in 1994 and this indicated that between 6.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent of Irish 14 year olds have serious literacy problems.  This figure, which was published by the ERC, is broadly similar to <Col N="345" /> the national figures from the 1993 survey.  The mathematics results in 1995 showed significant improvement in Ireland's performance over earlier students in 1988 and 1992.  Ireland ranked seventh of 16 countries among third class pupils and 12th out of 27 countries in the case of the 13 year olds in first and second year at second level.  In general terms Ireland has fared at or slightly above the international average in both English and mathematics.  It is towards the top of the middle band among participating countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also participate in an OECD survey on the achievement of 15 year old pupils in reading and mathematics which is scheduled for the year 2000.  This will be the first time a comparison can be made in key curricular areas at 15 years of age.  Its outcome will also enable us to make comparisons with the outcomes of the junior certificate examinations which the vast majority of pupils take at 15 years of age.</P>
    <P>No national survey on adult literacy levels has been carried out by the Department of Education and Science.  A 1995 international adult literacy survey across the age range from 16 to 64 showed that about 25 per cent of the Irish population was found to score at the lowest level, level 1.</P>
    <P>The young adults in the age group of 16 to 64 who were surveyed had a much lower percentage scoring at level 1, 16 per cent, than for the overall group.  This is much more in line with the national survey of adult literacy for nine year olds and the international survey of 1991 for 14 year olds.  As a result of the problems identified the budget for adult education has been substantially increased from £2.315 million in 1997 to £4.065 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>In essence, for the reasons outlined, the historical picture has been one of irregular surveys and a limited capacity to make meaningful international comparisons.  For the future it is my intention that national surveys should be more frequent and closely linked with international surveys.  This will provide more timely and meaningful comparisons which will be of real value to all engaged in education.</P>

      <P>The question of evaluation-assessment services for such children was one of a range of issues raised at a recent meeting I had with the mid-west support group representing parents of children with attention deficit disorder.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996-97, 5 per cent of full-time undergraduate students entering courses and almost 12 per cent of all full-time students, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, in the Higher Education Authority sector were aged 25 and over.  When one considers the position of mature students generally, which includes students entering higher education at age 23 or over, the relative proportion of full-time undergraduate entrants increases to 6.5 per cent.  In 1996-97 the proportion of all full-time students in the Higher Education Authority sector, aged 23 and over, was 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the non-university sector, provisional figures for the 1996-97 academic year indicate that 1,962 students or 4.7 per cent of full-time undergraduate students were over the age of 25.  When account is taken of students over 23 years of age the number increases to 3,984 or 9.6 per cent of the total enrolment.</P>
      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education considered the participation levels of mature students in higher education and noted that participation of mature students in higher education was low in Ireland having regard to the international experience, despite the different demographic profiles. The committee recommended that there should be a progressive increase in the number of mature students entering full-time higher education from 1,100 (3.7 per cent) in 1994 to 2,200 (6.2 per cent) by 2000 and subsequently to increase to 5,600 (16 per cent) by 2010.  When considering the steering committee's proposals, the Higher Education Authority advocated a faster rate of growth to a level of 7.5 per cent by 2000, rising by 2.5 per cent each year thereafter to a target of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, which was published in June 1995, was accepted by the then Government as a benchmark for the future planning of the sector, subject to regular review. The first review of the steering committee's report is currently being carried out by a study <Col N="348" /> group established under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir.  The study group's remit is to advise on the appropriate level of provision of education and training places for school leavers and others.  I understand that the study group's report will be available in the near future, at which stage I will consider its findings.</P>
    <P>There has undoubtedly been an increase in the number of mature students, which can be be attributed to the range of measures introduced in recent years, such as: improvements in the student support arrangements to extend them to mature students and to enable such students to be assessed on their own means; the free fees initiative and the provisions allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses, which apply to mature students; the special arrangements to enable mature students to train as primary teachers; initiatives aimed at facilitating the return to formal education of women in Cork, Dublin, Tralee and Galway-Mayo Institutes of Technology and the new national certificate in technology course, which was developed by a joint education-industry task force, and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, commenced in nine institutes of technology in January 1998.  Of 295 students attending this course, 107 are mature students.  It is hoped to organise further courses in this area in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition, the proposed new Institute of Technology at Blanchardstown and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute will have a major focus on non-standard applicants and on mature students and continuing education.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to its institutions for initiatives designed to support the participation of mature students, particularly second chance students.  In 1997, the Authority provided £601,000 for projects in this area.</P>
    <P>The HEA, in co-operation with third level institutions is also promoting the co-ordinated development of a system of modular course structures and related credit transfer arrangements. Such flexibility in course structures has the potential to facilitate access and enable mature and part-time students to study for qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.  Part-time options are often more attractive to mature students and while a current age profile for part-time students is not available, in 1993-94 almost 85 per cent of all part-time third level students were mature students.  In 1995-96 there were almost 22,000 part-time students in third level institutions aided by my Department.</P>

      <P>The performance of Irish 9 year olds in mathematics and literacy was examined in a number of international studies since 1990 and in each case gender differences were considered.  In the Second International Assessment of Educational Progress in Mathermatics and Science (1991), and again in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (1995), the average score in mathematics of Irish 9 year old girls was higher than that of boys of the same age.  However, differences found were not statistically significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> The reading literacy performance of Irish 9 year olds was assessed in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) Study of 1991.  Average scores on the reading literacy test was higher for girls than for boys in all participating countries. Gender differences were found to be greater in Ireland than in most other countries.</P>
    <P>Gender difference in numeracy and literacy achievements is a significant issue which warrants further exploration.  In this context it will form part of the National Reading Survey which will be conducted by the Educational Research Centre and my Department's Inspectorate in May 1998.  In addition, the revised primary curriculum in English currently being prepared by the NCCA will place special emphasis on the development of oral language competence in both boys and girls.</P>

      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for five custodial facilities which are authorised to accommodate young offenders sentenced to detention by the courts.</P>
      <P>However, the role of these facilities and my Department's involvement with them must be seen in the wider context of the State's overall response to children who have special care needs or who come into conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>A key objective is to ensure that the imposition of custodial sentences on children should be a matter of last resort.  It is essential therefore that every effort be made to address the needs of the children in question by non-custodial alternatives.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of this objective, my Department is in regular contact with Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These contacts involve close collaboration in the development of multi-faceted policy responses to the needs of the children in question. The extent and success of this collaboration is particularly reflected in the Children Bill, 1966.</P>
      <P>My Department and the managements of the young offender centres under its control are also involved in ongoing contact with the relevant healh and justice authorities and their agents on individual cases of difficulty which arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>The level of co-ordination between my Department and the other Departments mentioned has now been further enhanced by the Government's recent decision to delegate functions in relation to the Children Acts, 1908 to 1989 to Minister of State Frank Fahey who already has responsibility for children in the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is concerned to do all possible to promote good mental health in all educational institutions and to ensure the educational system does not contribute in any way to any increase in rates of suicide among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main role in the provision of counselling and therapy for potential suicide victims and their families belongs to the Department of Health and <Col N="354" /> Children.  This has established a national task force on suicide which has recently published its report and recommendations.  My Department has examined the recommendations which relate to the education system, all of which are already policy.</P>
    <P>Support for young people at risk of suicide in schools may be provided by the pastoral care system in the school, the guidance counselling service and the psychological service of the Department of Education and Science.  Concern about students who are considered to be at risk of suicide should be notified to the school's guidance counsellor and &mdash; or the psychological service who will then liaise with their colleagues in the clinical services of the local health board.  To improve my Department's response to young people in our schools who may need psychological help, I announced last year my intention to establish a national educational psychological service, and this was included in the Programme for Government.  The work of the planning group for the proposed service is well advanced.  The aim is to ensure that eventually psychological services will be readily available to young people in schools as well as those who have dropped out of school early.  Examination of the links between educational and health services which will be necessary to ensure comprehensive psychological services is included in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It is also important that young people should have access to counselling at the time when they need it urgently.  In recognition of the need for counselling to be available in all schools, my Department has been gradually expanding the guidance counselling service at second level.  An allocation of guidance hours is made to every school at this level, the number of hours depending upon the size of the school.  The National Centre for Guidance in Education, which is a support agency organised under the aegis of my Department, has issued Guidelines for the Practice of Guidance and Counselling in Schools which have been circulated to all post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>At primary level, a pilot scheme for the introduction of teaching counsellors in selected schools has been taking place over the past three years.  Some 27 teachers are participating in this pilot project, and are undergoing a programme of specialist professional development leading to certification.  Once the pilot phase has been completed and evaluated, decisions will be made about future developments in counselling in primary schools.</P>
    <P>For some years now, my Department has been developing programmes which help young people to alter behaviour which puts them at risk of suicide. All of them emphasise the importance of the development of self esteem and assertiveness and indirectly help in the prevention of suicide.  These programmes are to be incorporated in the subject <Col N="355" /> of social, personal and health education which is being developed for both primary and secondary schools by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  As soon as I receive its final recommendations, I will consider the way in which social, personal and health education will be introduced in schools, so that every school will promote good mental health.  I stress the value of a supportive school climate within which account is taken of pupils' personal needs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in several reports on suicide that the fact that male students seem to be particularly at risk may be explained by a reluctance to express their feelings and to seek counselling. It is my Department's policy that boys' schooling should be broadened, where necessary, to encompass emotional as well as intellectual development.  Relevant programmes are being piloted under the auspices of my Department's committee on equality of opportunity.</P>

      <P>My capacity to improve pupil-teacher ratios in any given year, including the ratios applicable to schools in disadvantaged areas, is entirely dependent on resource availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for the 1997-98 <Col N="356" /> school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing overall arrangements in relation to teacher post allocations, with a view to ensuring that all available resources are targeted to maximum effect.  The need of schools in disadvantaged areas will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The ex-quota allocation in respect of guideance to individual second level schools in a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September.  The allocation varies from 0.1 of a post to schools in the free education scheme with less than 100 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with 1,000 or more pupils.</P>
      <P>The total allocation in respect of guidance in the current school year is approximately 567 teacher equivalents.</P>
      <P>There are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education. These demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints.  The question of increasing the ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Sufficient information is not yet available to gauge the effect of the recent Forfás skills awareness campaign or its impact on the participation of young unemployed people in high technology courses.  The 1997 awareness campaign was the first stage in an initiative to create greater awareness of the opportunities for young people in the technical area.  A further stage in that campaign is now under way.  There is an inevitable time lag between providing information and seeing its impact in greater participation in the areas in question.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the new certificate in technology course which began in January 1998 is intended to attract applicants other than immediate school leavers.  I hope to build further on this initiative and thus provide varied opportunities and entry points which should be attractive to young unemployed, among others.  I will also be encouraging and facilitating foundation courses directed at enabling poeple to become qualified to enter technician programmes.</P>

      <P>The role of the resource teacher is to cater for pupils who have been assessed as having a range of learning difficulties and who are attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis but require regular periods of sustained teacher input.  The resource teacher can be attached to an individual school or a group of schools depending on the level of need in an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of resource teacher posts in any given year is subject to availability.  A total of 32 resource teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools since September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a resource teaching service.  There are <Col N="358" /> currently 78 resource teachers in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teacher area, to ensure all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  On receipt of an application from the school which the Deputy has in mind, the question of allocating a resource teacher post will be considered having regard to the needs of the pupils concerned.</P>

The Department psychologists assess pupils for a variety of reasons.  These include new referrals, reviews of progress in the case of pupils previously assessed and applications for special arrangements in certificate examinations.  It is estimated that approximately 1,300 such cases are at various stages of processing and finalisation by the Department's psychological service in the schools served across both sectors.  This figure does not include pupils who have been referred to psychologists employed by regional health boards or voluntary bodies or to psychologists in private practice.</P>

      <P>In the company where employees are made redundant it is the responsibility of the employer, in the first instance, to pay statutory redundancy entitlements to them.  In the event of the employer failing or being unable to pay these entitlements the employees may seek payment directly from the social insurance fund through the redundancy payments section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A liquidator appointed to a company must ascertain if funds are available to pay the employees their statutory entitlements.  Where sufficient funds cannot be found, the liquidator completes the relevant statutory forms and submits <Col N="361" /> them to the redundancy payments section for processing and payment.</P>
    <P>In a case where a liquidator delays unduly in submitting the forms, the employees have the option of appealing to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for their entitlements or complaining the liquidator to the appropriate professional organisation.</P>
    <P>While I am responsible for ensuring that the issuing of payments from my Department is not unduly delayed, I have no function under the Redundancy Payments Acts in regard to the work of a liquidator.  However, in this particular case, the completed forms have been received in the redundancy payments section and are being processed.</P>

      <P>Investment into Ireland from that region is predominantly from Japan, and to a lesser extent, Korea.  Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which are among the most seriously affected, are not sources of inward investment for IDA Ireland. IDA Ireland has, however, had extensive discussions with companies which may be affected by the Asian crisis and I have asked it to continue to monitor the situation closely.  The full impact of the crisis may take some time to unfold and while there is a need for continuing vigilance, there are no plans for introducing special assistance in this context.</P>

Food products which are found through the routine monitoring programme to contain pesticide residues exceeding the maximum residue limits, MRLs, laid down under the regulations are targeted for further sampling and analysis.  In cases where non-compliance by the farmer or grower with good agricultural practice in the use of plant protection products is established, the farmer or grower will be interviewed by officers of the Minister and is issued with a formal warning.  Samples of produce which are found to exceed the MRLs may be destroyed at the owner's expense and without payment of compensation.</P>

      <P>The position is that balancing payments under the 1997 special beef premium cannot commence until such time as a definitive position as regards our national quota usage has been determined. Quota usage is determined by the overall number of animals ultimately deemed eligible for the ten months premium and the bull premium. While the overall number of animals applied on will become clear over the next week or so when all the December 1997 applications have been recorded, the eligibility of those animals will not be known until all applications have been fully <Col N="363" /> processed for payment.  Any overshoot of the national quota will have to be reflected in balancing payments made to farmers on foot of 1997 special beef premium applications.  It is unlikely, therefore, that balancing payments can commence before April next.  Payments will be completed by the end of June in line with EU requirements.</P>
      <P>Balancing payments under the 1997 suckler cow scheme will commence later this week.</P>

    <P>The original certificate of tax free allowances which issued to the taxpayer for the current tax year did not incorporate the deduction for survivor's pension as the inspector was not aware that the taxpayer was receiving a survivor's pension. Survivor's pension is taxable but is paid gross by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs i.e. without tax being deducted.  The tax on the pension is collected by reducing the taxpayer's tax free allowances by an amount equal to the amount of pension he receives.  When the inspector became aware of the survivor's pension which the taxpayer was receiving he issued a revised certificate of tax free allowances showing the allowances set out above. The revised certificate is operative from the date of issue viz.  3 October 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the Preliminary Finance Bill List which was published on 22 January 1998, I am making provision in this year's Bill to amend sections 110 and 446 of the Taxes Consolidation <Col N="365" /> Act, 1997, so as to remove the restrictions which currently confine the carrying out of activities by IFSC companies to those which do not involve Irish currency.  This and further measures which are contained in the Finance Bill being published to-day are designed to deal with certain tax issues arising from the change in the currency of the State to the euro, on the basis that Ireland will become part of EMU from the outset.  These measures will not take effect until such time as appointed by me by order.</P>
    <P>In relation to concerns regarding the single currency and how it might affect IFSC/Shannon transactions after 1999, the issue of EMU has been on the agendas of the various IFSC working groups operating under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach which deal with matters of concern to the various sectors of the international financial services industry.  Apart from the Irish currency restriction issue which I have already dealt with above, other issues raised by the IFSC industry at these working groups would be matters of general concern to the overall financial services sector.</P>

      <P>There are currently two types of personal assistance service being provided.  The first is operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association and provides a service to 31 people, employing 58 PAs.  The other PA service is provided by centres for independent living throughout the country using the FÁS community employment scheme.  This provides a more limited service to about 175 people with severe physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the pay rate being paid by the IWA to the personal assistants whom they employ.  The position is that as the association is a non-statutory organisation my Department has no function in negotiating or fixing rates of pay for its employees. This is strictly a matter for the IWA as employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The differing needs of couples as compared with single people are recognised under the means-tested social assistance payment schemes, such as the pre-retirement allowance, PRETA, through the provision <Col N="367" /> of higher rates of payment rather than higher means disregards.  For example, a couple in receipt of PRETA is entitled to receive £107.50 a week, increasing to £117.70 from June, as opposed to £67.50, increasing to £70.50 from June, for a single person.  The payment of increased level of benefits to couples also means that they can have higher joint means than a single person and still qualify for payment.  For example, a couple can have approximately £49,500 in capital and still qualify for a minimum payment, whereas a single person can have approximately £35,600.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for the purposes of PRETA account is taken of any cash income the claimant may have, together with any investments in capital or property.  Under new provisions for the assessment of capital, which were introduced last October, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.  Accordingly, a single person whose only means consist of capital of £2,000 will qualify for a payment of £67.50 a week, whereas a couple with the same amount of means will qualify for £107.50 a week.  This also means that a couple can have substantially higher amounts of capital and still qualify for the same level of benefit as a single person.  For example, a couple can have capital of up to £26,500 and still qualify for a payment of £67.50 &mdash; the level of payment made to a single person who has capital of £2,000.</P>
      <P>The principle of achieving consistency and uniformity across all social welfare schemes and, in particular, in relation to the operation of the various means tests, is a desirable objective and one which the Department has been pursuing, where possible, over the years.  The further standardising of the different methods of assessing means would have cost implications and would therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 1998 budget contains a range of enhancements to the child benefit scheme.  First, it provides for increases in the rate of child benefit of £1.50 for the first two children and £3.00 for all subsequent children, to bring the monthly rates to £31.50 and £42 respectively.</P>
      <P>Second, it provides for a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins. In effect, where there are twins in a family, each child will receive one-and-a-half times the appropriate rate of child benefit.</P>
      <P>Third, the budget provides for increases in the grants payable on the birth of three or more children to bring them into line with the existing payments arrangements for twins.  Where three or more children are born together, a grant of £500 will be payable and where such children reach four and 12 years of age, further grants of £500 will also be payable.  The necessary legislative provisions to give effect to these measures with effect from September of this year will be included in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, 1998.</P>

      <P>The Garden of Remembrance is dedicated to all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom.  The garden is reserved exclusively for formal State ceremonials connected with this dedication.  It is considered that the proposal to use the railings of the gardens as a Sunday art facility &mdash; most likely with a commercial dimension to it &mdash; is at variance with the ethos of the garden and that the tranquil amenity of the memorial may well be diminished by the presence of such displays.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed this matter since a similar question was put down to me on 12 November 1997, but I must inform the Deputy that the position remains the same.</P>
      <P>I would, however, point out to the Deputy that, as the Minister responsible to the promotion of the arts in Ireland, I support the idea of maximising the use of public places and spaces to exhibit works of art.  I give practical expression to this viewpoint by facilitating such exhibitions on the railings of St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, which also come within the remit of my Department. Moreover, I can inform the Deputy that art exhibitions are held in a number of properties operated by my Department throughout the country and I am pleased to encourage such exhibitions, the Glebe Gallery in County Donegal being a prime example.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I have outlined earlier, however, I believe there should be certain limitations to this general approach, notably in the case of the Garden of Remembrance.</P>

      <P>The basic criteria for establishing who is entitled to be granted refugee status is the definition set out at section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a refugee is someone who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. Each application is considered on its own merits and where the above definition is met the person is granted refugee status.</P>

Australian nationals who wish to come to Ireland to take up employment are required to be in possession of a valid work permit.

In this regard, he may be required to produce evidence, including the work permit, to the immigration officer.

      <P>A range of special interventions is already in place to support children who might otherwise be in danger of dropping out of the school system. These interventions include: the Early Start pilot pre-school programme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the teacher counsellor scheme, and the Breaking the Cycle of disadvantaged pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to inform the House that an important initiative, which will be targeted specifically at children in the eight to 15 year age group who have dropped out, or are in danger of dropping out of the school system, is currently being put in place.</P>

      <P>The present approach to assessment at the age of transfer is that the schools devise and administer their own tests either before entry to second level schools or at the beginning of the school year following transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting of national standards in literacy and numeracy which all pupils would have to attain would inevitably lead to some children not transferring to second level schools at the appropriate <Col N="372" /> age.  This would have obvious undesirable consequences for the pupils concerned and for their families and would inevitably put an unacceptable degree of pressure on the weaker pupils.  Any approach to target-setting would have to take the needs and abilities of weaker pupils into consideration.  As a result, the targets set might have to be so low as to allow the possibility that they would be attained by all pupils. This type of minimum competency assessment and target-setting would, in the long-term, be more likely to lower overall standards than to raise them.</P>
    <P>Setting of minimum targets in literacy and numeracy might also lead to a narrowing of the primary school curriculum and a neglect of areas in which minimum targets are not applicable and which are not easily assessed like the arts, physical education, social, scientific and environmental education and social, personal and health education. This would not be a desirable development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>In March, 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year. Accordingly, I am not in a position to allocate concessionary teacher posts to the primary sector.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problems of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system. I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The document in question is currently being considered by my Department.  The main focus of the document relates to the level of support available for children with special needs who attend mainstream schools.  It is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 children with special need attending primary schools on a fully integrated basis.  At present, a total of 1,242 remedial teacher, 78 resource teachers and 42 visiting teachers are deployed to assist these children. This includes a total of 54 remedial teachers, 32 resource teachers and two visiting teachers newly appointed for the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium gives particular priority to this area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties.  It is my intention to honour this commitment and to maximise the opportunities for special needs children to participate in the education system on a fully integrated basis.  I am currently reviewing provision across <Col N="374" /> the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed to maximum effect.  The position of special needs children who attend ordinary schools on an integrated basis will be a key element of this review.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of places, the average unit costs and the average length of stay in each of the five young offender centres operated under my Department are set out in the following table.  A significant proportion of children placed in young offender centres by the courts would be repeat offenders.  A recent analysis of children placed in reformatory school, which cater for the older and more serious cases indicates that approximately 25 per cent had previously been placed in industrial schools.  No up-to-date statistics are available on the average rate of re-offending, in line with international experience, for the age group in question.</P>
      <P>The education programmes provided at the centres are very broadly based to take account of the wide range of needs and abilities of the children in question who can range in age from nine to 17 years.  Among the subjects taught are, English, art, PE, woodwork, maths, metalwork, typing, computers, horticulture, religion, home economics, personal development and life skills. While many of the children present are under-achievers on their admission to the centres, the intensive educational programmes made available have enabled many children to complete the junior certificate examination and to achieve significant success.</P>

      <P>There is a psychological service available from my Department to all second level schools. It is also available to 402 primary schools in a limited number of areas with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  Certain psychological tests may also be used by qualified guidance counsellors.  Every second level school has been given an allocation of hours for guidance which varies according to its size.  As part of their work, guidance counsellors engage in a systematic programme of psychometric testing in their schools.</P>
      <P>Last year I announced my intention to develop, in liaison with the health authorities, a national educational psychological service.  This will be available to all primary and second level schools as well as to young people of school-going age who are outside the formal educational system. Planning for this service is well advanced.  A planning group, representative of the partners in education, will report to me before the end of April of this year.  The report of the planning group will be critical in putting the psychological service on a firm footing for the future.  As an interim measure my Department is jointly organising with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, a development project for the psychological service which will last for three years. Fifteen qualified psychologists are to be employed on a contract basis for the duration of the project.  The selection process for these posts has now been completed.  These psychologists will work in regional teams under the management of the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science, and will be taking up their duties during the current school year.  Both of these developments will increase access to psychological assessments in schools.</P>
