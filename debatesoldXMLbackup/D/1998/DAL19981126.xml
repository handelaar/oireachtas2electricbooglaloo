      <P>Members of the Dáil and Seanad, after the long and torn history of our two peoples, standing here as the first British Prime Minister to address the joint Houses of the Oireachtas, I feel profoundly both the history in this event and the enormity of the honour you are bestowing upon me.  From the bottom of my heart, go raibh míle maith agaibh, with profound apologies to the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my party conference this year, I spoke about my other expedition into another language. Having addressed the French National Assembly in French, I got a little above myself and <Col N="747" /> decided to give a press conference in French with Mr. Lionel Jospin, the French Prime Minister. I attempted to say in French that I envied the various positions Mr. Jospin had taken in his political life but ended up saying that I desired Lionel Jospin in many different positions.  As you can imagine, it is not easy to recover from that in any language.</P>
    <P>I also express my pleasure at addressing the Houses.  Obviously, we have seen the proceedings of the Dáil on television many times, as you have seen the proceedings in the House of Commons.  I am aware of how cordial the exchanges are in this House.  I put it down to the shortage of time anybody spends in Opposition under your system.  However, when one has spent 18 years in Opposition, it is difficult to remain polite.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his most kind introduction.  It was deeply appreciated. Ireland, as you may know, is in my blood.  My mother was born in the flat above her grandmother's hardware shop in the main street of Ballyshannon in Donegal.  She lived there as a child, started school there and only moved when her father died, her mother remarried and they crossed the water to Glasgow.</P>
    <P>We spent virtually every childhood summer holiday, up to when the troubles really took hold, in Ireland, usually at Rossnowlagh, the Sands House Hotel.  We would travel in the beautiful countryside of Donegal.  It was there, in the seas off the Irish coast, that I learnt to swim and it was there that my father took me to my first pub, a remote little house in the country, for a Guinness, a taste I have never forgotten and which it is always a pleasure to repeat.</P>
    <P>Even now in my constituency of Sedgefield in the north-east of England, which at one time had 30 pits or more, now all gone, virtually every community remembers that its roots lie in Irish migration to the mines of Britain.  So, like it or not, we the British and the Irish are irredeemably linked.</P>
    <P>We experienced and absorbed the same waves of invasion &mdash; Celts, Vikings, Normans &mdash; which all left their distinctive mark on our countries.  Over 1,000 years ago, the monastic traditions formed the basis for both our cultures.  Sadly, the power games of medieval monarchs and feudal chiefs sowed the seeds of later trouble.</P>
    <P>Yet it has always been simplistic to portray our differences as simply Irish versus English, or British.  There were, after all, many in Britain who also suffered greatly at the hands of powerful absentee landlords, who were persecuted for their religion or who for centuries were disenfranchised. Each generation in Britain has benefited, as ours does, from the contribution of Irish men and women.  Today the links between our Parliaments are continued by the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and last month 60 of our MPs set up a new all party Irish in Britain Parliamentary Group.</P>
    <P>Irish parliamentarians have made a major contribution to our shared parliamentary history. I will single out just two &mdash; Daniel O'Connell, who fought against injustice to extend a franchise restricted by religious prejudice, and Charles Stuart Parnell, whose statue stands today in the House of Commons and whose political skills and commitment to social justice made such an impact in that House.  So much shared history, so much shared pain and, now, the shared hope of a new beginning.</P>
    <P>The peace process is at a difficult juncture.  Progress is being made, but slowly.  There is an impasse over the establishment of the Executive; there is an impasse over decommissioning. However, I have been optimistic the whole way through and I am optimistic now.  Let us not underestimate how far we have come and let us agree that we have come too far to go back now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> Politics is replacing violence as the way people do business.  The Good Friday Agreement, overwhelmingly endorsed by the people on both sides of the Border, holds out the prospect of a peaceful long-term future for Northern Ireland and the whole island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland Bill provides for the new Assembly and Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  It incorporates the principle of consent into British constitutional law and repeals the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  It establishes a human rights commission, with the power to support individual cases.  There will be an equality commission to police a new duty on all public bodies in Northern Ireland to promote equality of opportunity.  We have set up the Patten Commission to review policing.  We are scaling down the military presence.  Prisoners are being released.</P>
    <P>None of this is easy.  I get many letters from the victims of violence asking why we are freeing terrorist prisoners.  It is a tough question but my answer is clear &mdash; the Agreement would never have come about if we had not tackled the issue of prisoners.  That Agreement heralds the prospect of an end to violence and a peaceful future for Northern Ireland.  Our duty is to carry it out.  That is a duty I feel more strongly than ever, having seen for myself the horror of Omagh.</P>
    <P>That was not the first such atrocity but, with all of my being, I will it to be the last.  I will never forget the meeting I had in the leisure centre, accompanying President Clinton, with the survivors and the relatives of those who died.  Their suffering and their courage was an inspiration. They will never forget their loved ones, nor must we.  We owe it to them above all to build a lasting peace when we have the best opportunity in a generation to do so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's personal contribution has been immense.  I pay tribute to his tireless dedication. I value his friendship.  I also salute the courage of our predecessors, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Deputy John Bruton and John Major.  I also salute Deputy Dick Spring, whose role in this process goes back a long way.</P>
    <P>Like us, you are living up to your side of the bargain too.  You have voted to end the territorial claim over Northern Ireland, essential to the Agreement.  It is time now for all the parties to live up to all their commitments.  It is time for North-South bodies to be established to start a new era of co-operation between you and Northern Ireland.  I hope agreement on these is now close.  It is time to set up the institutions of the new government.  It is time for the gun and threat of the gun to be taken out of politics once and for all and for decommissioning to start.  I am not asking anyone to surrender.  I am asking everyone to declare the victory of peace.</P>
    <P>In Belfast or Dublin people say the same thing &mdash; make the Agreement work.  It is never far from my mind.  When anybody asks why I spend so much time and energy on this process I tell them that my sense of urgency and mission comes from the children in Northern Ireland.  I reflect on those who have been victims of violence, whose lives are scarred and twisted through the random wickedness of a terrorist act, of those who grew up in fear, those whose parents and loved ones have died.</P>
    <P>I reflect on those who although untouched directly by violence are nonetheless victims, victims of mistrust and misunderstanding who, through lack of a political settlement, miss the chance of new friendships and new horizons because of the isolation from others that the sectarian way of life brings.  I reflect on the sheer waste of children taught to hate when I passionately believe children should be taught to think.</P>
    <P>Do not believe anyone either who says the British people do not care about the peace process.  People in my country care deeply about it, are willing it to work.  And it is our two countries, our two peoples, not just the politicians, who have a role to play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> No one could or should ignore the injustices of the past or the lessons of history, but too often between us one person's history has been another person's myth.  We need not be prisoners of our history.  My generation in Britain today sees Ireland differently and probably the same generation here in Ireland feels differently about Britain.  We can understand the emotions generated by Northern Ireland's troubles but, to be honest, there are times when we simply cannot believe, as we approach the 21st century, that there is not a better way forward to the future than murder, terrorism, sectarian hatred and mistrust.</P>
    <P>We see a changed Republic of Ireland today: a modern, open economy; after the long years of emigration, people are beginning to come back for the quality of life you now offer; a country part of Europe's mainstream, having made the most of European Structural Funds but no longer reliant on them; some of the best business brains in the business world; leaders in popular culture, U2, the Corrs, Boyzone, B*witched; a country that had the courage to elect its first woman President and liked it so much, you did it again.  The politics of Northern Ireland would be better for a few more women in prominent positions in politics &mdash; I do not know whether that is the most controversial statement I will make today &mdash; as Mo Mowlam has shown, to whom I also pay tribute.</P>
    <P>We look at the Republic of Ireland differently.  And you see, I hope, a Britain emerging from its post-Empire malaise, also modernising, becoming as confident of its future as it once was of its past.</P>
    <P>The programme of the new Labour Government &mdash; driving up standards in education; welfare reform, monetary and fiscal stability as the foundation of a modern economy; massive investment in our public services tied to the challenge of reform and modernisation; a huge programme of constitutional change; a new positive attitude to Europe &mdash; is a programme of national renewal as ambitious as any undertaken in any western democracy in recent times.</P>
    <P>It is precisely the dramatic changes in both our countries that should allow us to see the possibilities of change in our relationship with one another.  It will require vision, but no more than the vision that has transformed Ireland.  It will require imagination, but no more than that shown by the British people in the last two years.  The old ways are changing between London and Dublin.  This can spur the change and healing in Northern Ireland too.  The old notions of Unionist supremacy and of narrow nationalism are gradually having their fingers prised from their grip on the future.</P>
    <P>Different traditions have to understand each other.  Just as we must understand your yearning for a united Ireland, so too must you understand what the best of Unionism is about.  They are good and decent people, just like you.  They want to remain part of the UK &mdash; and I have made it clear that I value that wish.  They feel threatened by the terrorism with which they have had to live for so long and were threatened, until the Good Friday Agreement, that they would be forced into a united Ireland against the will of the people of Northern Ireland.  Yet they realise now that a framework in which consent is guaranteed is also one in which basic rights of equality and justice are guaranteed, and that those who wish for a united Ireland are free to make that claim, provided it is democratically expressed, just as much as those who believe in the Union can make their claim.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, in the end, as so much in politics is, about belonging &mdash; the wish of Unionists to belong to the UK, the wish of Nationalists to belong to Ireland.  Both traditions are reasonable. There are no absolutes.  The beginning of understanding is to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>My point is very simple today.  Those urges to belong, divergent as they are, can live together more easily if we, Britain and the Irish Republic, can live closer together too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Down through the centuries, Ireland and Britain have inflicted too much pain on each other, but now the UK and Ireland, as two modern countries, can try to put our histories behind us, try to forgive and forget those age old enmities.</P>
    <P>We have both grown up now.  A new generation is in power in each country.  We now have a real opportunity to put our relations on a completely new footing, not least through working together in Europe.  I know that is what our peoples want and I believe we can deliver it.</P>
    <P>Our ties are already rich and diverse: the UK is the largest market for Irish goods, and you are our fifth most important market in the world; in trade unions, professional bodies and the voluntary sector, our people work together to help their communities; in culture, sport and academic life there is an enormous cross-over &mdash; our theatres are full of Irish plays, our television is full of Irish actors and presenters, your national football team has a few English accents too; above all, at the personal level, millions of Irish people live and work in Britain, and hundreds of thousands of us visit you every year.</P>
    <P>As ties strengthen, so the past can be put behind us.  Nowhere was this better illustrated than at the remarkable ceremony at Messines earlier this month.  Representatives of Nationalists and Unionists travelled together to Flanders to remember shared suffering.  Our Army bands played together.  Our Heads of State stood together.  With our other European neighbours, such a ceremony would be commonplace.  For us it was a first.  It shows how far we have come. It shows how far we can still go.</P>
    <P>The relationships across these islands are also changing in a significant way.  The Taoiseach has spoken of the exciting new relationships that will unfold as the people of Scotland and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland, express their wishes through their own parliaments and assemblies.  The new British-Irish Council must reflect and explore these opportunities.  We have much to gain by co-operating better across these islands in areas like transport, education, the fight against illegal drugs.  But I want our co-operation to be wider and more fundamental still &mdash; above all in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is 25 years since we both joined what was then the EEC.  We have had different approaches to agriculture, to monetary union, to defence but increasingly it is clear we share a common agenda and common objectives: completion of the Single Market and structural economic reform; better conditions for growth and jobs in Europe; successful enlargement; a united and coherent foreign policy voice for Europe; a more effective fight against crime, drugs, illegal immigration and environmental damage; flexible, open and accountable European institutions.</P>
    <P>We must work to make the single currency a success.  Unlike Ireland, we are not joining in the first wave, but we have made clear that we are prepared to join later if the economic benefits are clear and unambiguous.  For my Government, there is no political or constitutional barrier to joining.  There is no resistance to full hearted European co-operation wherever this brings added value to us all.</P>
    <P>Enlargement will increasingly test our political and economic imaginations, as we struggle with policy reform and future financing.  The international financial system must be reformed. We must learn to apply real political will and harness our skills and resources far more effectively to solve our regional problems &mdash; notably in the Balkans and further afield in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Above all Europe must restate its vision for today's world so that people understand why it is so important.  This means defining the priorities where common European action makes obvious sense and can make a real difference, like economic co-ordination, foreign and security policy, the environment, crime and drugs.  It also means distinguishing them from areas where countries or regions can best continue to make policy themselves, to suit local circumstances, while still learning from each other &mdash; for example, tax, education, health, welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> That is why I want to forge new bonds with Dublin.  Together we can have a stronger voice in Europe and work to shape its future in a way which suits all our people.  It is said &mdash; I have no idea whether it is true &mdash; that there was a time when Irish diplomats in Europe spoke French in meetings to ensure they were clearly distinguished from us.  I can understand that but I hope those days are long behind us.  The truth is we, the Republic of Ireland and Britain, can accomplish much more today in Europe when our voices speak in harmony.</P>
    <P>Our Ministers and officials are increasingly consulting and co-ordinating systematically.  We can do more.  I believe we can transform our links if both sides are indeed ready to make the effort.  For our part, we are.</P>
    <P>This must also involve a dramatic new effort in bilateral relations, above all to bring our young generations together.  We need new youth and school exchanges, contact through the new University for Industry, better cultural programmes in both directions.  We need to work much more closely to fight organised crime and drugs.  We can do much more to enrich each other's experience in areas like healthcare and welfare.  None of this threatens our separate identities.  Co-operation does not mean losing distinctiveness.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach and I seek is a new dimension to our relationships &mdash; a real partnership between Governments and peoples, which will engage our societies at every level.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, agreed to launch a new intensive process.  The Taoiseach and I will meet again next spring in London, with key ministerial colleagues, to give this the necessary impetus and agenda, and will, thereafter, meet at least once a year to review progress, specifically on these issues.  This will be part of the work of the new Intergovernmental Conference.  The objective is threefold: first, revitalised and modernised bilateral relations, where we can finally put the burden of history behind us; second, a habit of close consultation on European issues, marked by a step-change in contacts at every level, particularly in key areas such as agriculture, justice and home affairs, employment and foreign and security policy; third, working together on international issues more widely &mdash; for example, UN peacekeeping, to which both our countries have been important contributors, arms proliferation and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>What I welcome above all is that, after keeping us apart for so long, Northern Ireland is now helping to bring us closer together.  However, I do not believe Northern Ireland can or should any longer define the totality of the relationship between us.  Our common interests, what we can achieve together, go much wider than that.  Our two countries can look to the future with confidence in our separate ways but we will be stronger and more prosperous working together.</P>
    <P>For me to stand here is an extraordinary honour and privilege.  I hope that today marks a new beginning of shared hope for both our nations.  That is my ambition and I know it is shared by the Taoiseach.  Most importantly, I believe it is an ambition shared by our two nations and our two peoples.  The 21st century awaits us, a great prospect, but one which requires great achievements and ambitions to go with it.  Let us confront its challenge with confidence and together give our children the future they deserve.</P>

      <P>Mr. Prime Minister, this truly is a memorable day in the development of relations between our two countries.  Today, we meet at a level of goodwill and generosity of spirit that few of us could have foreseen.  We are sharing and celebrating defining moments that will be much analysed and pondered upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> The very institution of Parliament is a formal and proven testament to the need we have to dialogue in order to govern ourselves in truth and justice.  The parliamentary process itself facilitates us, indeed invites us, to come to respect and honour our differences, not only within the Chambers of Parliament but in the broader reality of our lives.</P>
    <P>Over recent decades, visiting Heads of State have addressed joint sessions of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this Chamber.  Each occasion was memorable but, Mr. Prime Minister, there is a sense in which your presence among us is more celebration than symbol and protocol.  We look forward with hope, indeed confidence, to the future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prime Minister, in leaving us today, be assured that you carry with you our goodwill and best wishes.</P>

The Bill is scheduled for after the local elections when the vocational education boards will be appointed.  It should be brought forward so that parents and teachers can have statutory representation provided for them before the local elections when these committees will be established.

      <P>Arising out of our proceedings this morning and the remarks made by the British Prime Minister, will the Tánaiste indicate if the Government would agree to prioritise some of the legislation relating to what the Prime Minister said?  For example, legislation on customs co-operation would assist in fighting the common drugs menace in these islands.</P>
      <P>On another matter mentioned by the Prime Minister, the University of Industry, perhaps the legislation on the establishment of teaching and other mutual recognition of qualifications might be prioritised and made the subject of co-operation between Britain and Ireland so that we will not just have recognition within Ireland but mutual recognition in the two islands of each other's qualifications under that legislation.  Perhaps the Tánaiste would indicate the time frame on this and on the other matter I raised?</P>
      <P>The proceedings this morning were greatly assisted by your introduction, Sir.  It was one of the best speeches I have heard made in the House by any Member.

In the context of the new British-Irish council many matters of mutual interest will have to be advanced more rapidly because it is in all our interests to develop the closer relationship there is now between these two islands.</P>
      <P>The memorandum on the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Bill has been circulated to Departments for observations and the heads of a Bill are expected to be submitted to the Government next January.  Given the new procedures to be established on the island and between these two islands, I hope we will be able to work more closely together as the Prime Minister suggested.

On promised legislation and in the context of the British-Irish Agreement mentioned by the British Prime Minister this morning, will related legislation include harmonising regulations for charities in this jurisdiction, the North and, perhaps, in Britain where a charities commissioner acts like a companies office for charities?

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I opened the debate on this Bill, I highlighted its purpose, to increase the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of Exchequer grant in aid which may be paid to Bord Fáilte Éireann to support tourism capital development works.  It is also important to point out that under the original 1975 Act the moneys provided to Bord Fáilte <Col N="762" /> under this specific provision are solely for the purpose of giving grants for development works which are capital and non-accommodation related in nature, along the lines of those mentioned in my earlier statement.</P>
    <P>In the debate a large number of areas were identified as problems in what is otherwise a very successful industry: jobs, the peace process, litter, Bord Fáilte, taxis, pricing, grants for small hotels, tidy towns, congestion, marketing, Dún Laoghaire, disabilities, sign-posting, the rail service, complacency and Dublin, to name but a few. As I will be dealing with most of these issues in the Seanad in the weeks before Christmas, I hope I will be able to address them in more detail at that time.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made contributions regarding the more important of these areas. After today's visit of the British Prime Minister, one of the events to the fore in the minds of most Deputies is the peace process.

There is no doubt that today's historic visit by Mr. Blair, the British Prime Minister, will add significantly to the work already being carried out by Bord Fáilte in the United Kingdom in particular.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Margaret Cahill and all the other people involved in Bord Fáilte in London for the magnificent work they have done over the years. They are very conscious of the improvement in relations between our two countries.  The vast majority of tourists who come here originate in the United Kingdom and we are the main beneficiary of their tourist trade.  There is no doubt that today will help significantly the efforts of our people in London.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome this Bill as a major contribution to the development of sport in Ireland.  I hope the Minister will be open to suggestions and amendments which may be submitted on Committee and Report Stages.  To date this has been a very inclusive process and I hope this will continue.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen, the previous Minister with responsibility for sport, for his initiative in setting up the strategy group under the chairmanship of John Treacy, a former world champion athlete, with the objective of producing a blueprint for the future of sport.</P>
      <P>Next to the weather, people talk more about sport than any other topic.  We discuss a forthcoming game and afterwards replay it, a disallowed goal, a try, a point and invariably the performance of the referee and players.  We talk about it in the workplace the following morning or over a pint before going home after a match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport, which is an integral part of Irish society, demands a combination of physical skill and strength, an alert mind, enthusiasm and teamwork. The body must be trained for these accomplishments, a person must work for them and become skilful.  Accordingly the successful teams or sportspeople are highly regarded and admired as role models for young people.  Over the years this country, with minimal facilities, has produced individual sportsmen and women and teams who have successfully competed with the best in the world.  Ronnie Delaney, Eamonn Coughlan and the late Noel Carroll are among those who spring to mind.  I wish to put on record the role Noel Carroll played in the life of Dublin and in sporting life generally in Ireland and throughout the world.  Sonia O'Sullivan, Catherina McKiernan, John Treacy and Jack's soccer team are only some of the sports people who will <Col N="764" /> always be remembered, not only in Ireland but across the world.</P>
    <P>Given the obvious potential which exists in every sports code, particularly for our young sportsmen and women, we must ask what could be achieved if we had proper facilities and a co-ordinated approach to sport, from the top down to the thousands of volunteers who give up their time and energy freely because of their love of sport.  Let us hope this legislation, in conjunction with the new grant schemes for recreational and sports clubs, new facilities and training for our coaches and volunteers, will rejuvenate the community spirit for which our people are renowned.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his commitment to the anti-doping programme he launched earlier this year.  Participation in the programme by national governing bodies and individuals should have been compulsory rather than voluntary.  The use of drugs to enhance performance in sports goes back thousands of years.  From around 400 BC the role of sport in Greek society was as prominent as it is everywhere today.  Victory in the ancient Olympic Games ensured high rewards in terms of money, food, housing, tax exemptions, etc.  However, drugs were ultimately a major reason for the dissolution of the ancient Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people are firmly of the opinion that the injection of banned performance enhancing substances is nothing less than cheating. There is no room in Irish sport for cheats.</P>
    <P>The Tour de France to Ireland &mdash; and the Minister rightly received a great deal of kudos for bringing the prestigious event to Ireland &mdash; outlined how deeply modern sport has been corrupted by these substances.  As journalists Tim Blair and Rod Usher reported in <i>Time</i> magazine recently, &ldquo;This year's world's leading bicycle race was revealed to be more of a Tour de Pharmacy than a competition which enabled the best cyclists win&rdquo;.  Festina, the top team in the competition, had its nine riders expelled.  As the race progressed, it became more obvious than ever before that substance abuse is rampant in professional cycling.  The same question must be posed in relation to other elite world sports involving massive money and sponsorship such as athletics, swimming, weightlifting and many others.</P>
    <P>As a keen sportsman, I first became interested in the problem of drugs in sport when a cyclist for whom I had great regard died during a stage of the Tour de France.  He was Tommy Simpson from England.  Until it can be positively proved that professional cycling has cleaned up its act with regard to drug taking, I will object strenuously to the Tour de France ever coming to Ireland again.  As a country and people who, by and large, believe that the deliberate taking of a banned performance enhancing substance is cheating we must call a halt, irrespective of how many shots of our beautiful countryside are scanned across the television screens of Europe and further afield.  We must make a stand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The stories from the former East European countries, for example, indicate there was an organised drug programme in operation at national level from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.  The real losers at the end of the day were the swimmers and athletes who went through the programme and whose lives were destroyed. Many of these athletes died and others have serious heart and liver complaints.  The message should go out to our young sports people that, irrespective of the glory to be had on a particular day, their health will be affected.</P>
    <P>The deterrent against drug taking in sport is not sufficient.  It was an utter scandal that Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his gold medal in the Seoul Olympics following a positive drug test, was only given a two year suspension.  Athletes found guilty of drug taking should be banned for life.  The Olympic Council of Ireland should take this issue up with the IOC.</P>
    <P>The recent revelations by a former Irish rugby player, Neil Francis, that Irish rugby players have been taking illegal performance enhancing substances is very disturbing.  The further revelations that two or three positive tests on Irish rugby players are under investigation requires clarification and there must be transparency in the IRFU. Nothing less is acceptable.  We cannot hide anything in relation to drugs &mdash; everything must be above board.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Minister's programme is up and running the better.  I appeal to all our national sports organisations to show their full commitment to fighting sport's most pressing problem. There is no place for cheats in Irish sport.  If these organisations are not prepared to co-operate, there must be a real deterrent.  I fully agree with the Minister that channelling grant aid from Government through the National Lottery must cease until there is full co-operation from these organisations in regard to dealing with drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In urban areas, particularly the greater Dublin region, there is an ever increasing demand for playing pitches, whether for soccer, Gaelic or rugby football.  In the past, the majority of football teams in Dublin had their own private pitches, either purchased or rented from a farmer. With the demand for housing land and prices reaching £70,000 per acre, it is no longer feasible, by and large, for new clubs to own their own pitches.  Accordingly, there is an increasing onus on local authorities to provide pitches.</P>
    <P>Various councils, particularly in the greater Dublin area, have been doing an excellent job to date, however their land banks have diminished. The net effect is that, with the wholesale rezoning that has taken place, sports fields and open spaces have not been provided in development plans to date.  We now have a crisis as there is insufficient space available for the local population for active recreation.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's attention a major problem I have come across in recent months.  A very successful club in my constituency, <Col N="766" /> called River Valley Rangers Soccer Club, applied to Fingal County Council for consent to change the use of an existing hard surface tennis court, which has not been used for the past seven years, to an all-weather floodlit training area, not only for its own club members but also for use by a community living in more than 2,000 houses.</P>
    <P>On the basis of legal opinion secured by the council it was deemed that as the area in question was designated public open space, they would not be allowed change the hard surface tennis court into an all weather training area.  This seems ludicrous and scandalous and I ask the Minister to ensure his officials investigate the matter.  Given the lack of land in the greater Dublin area we could be left with only designated open space as against open space which was utilised in the past. If this law exists and is applied there might be major problems in the future.</P>
    <P>Arising from this situation and the lack of pitches for clubs in general, I am of the view that a new approach must be taken in the context of development plans.  Developers and builders will have to accept that they have a social responsibility with regard to housing developments. Additional lands will have to be incorporated into every action plan to provide both active and passive recreational amenities in addition to the percentage which is available or should be designated as part of planning applications.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been of the opinion that planning authorities should have the right under planning legislation to condition builders and developers to make a financial contribution as part of planning permission towards the cost of a community facility.  This would be of huge benefit for new residential areas.  As authorities do not have the right to make such a condition, will the Minister take up this proposal with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government?</P>
    <P>In case some of my political opponents endeavour to misrepresent this proposal, I wish to make it very clear that this is totally at variance with a ploy used by some developers and builders in their efforts to achieve rezonings.</P>
    <P>For example, these people use the legitimate needs of sports clubs as a tool to secure rezonings. The way to provide pitches and funding for recreational facilities is through an amendment to planning legislation and not by means of a carrot of support for rezonings.</P>
    <P>Forty years ago the majority of football teams changed under bushes or trees at the side of pitches.  After a match many players found their clothes had been scattered by cattle or other animals &mdash; something which I and I am sure other Members experienced &mdash; and soaked by rain.  I was shocked to hear that, apart from the activity of cattle, this was still the case today.  The majority of new clubs cannot afford to provide their own dressing rooms and the various local authorities across the country do not have the finance to do so either.  This is totally unacceptable, particularly when we are endeavouring to attract <Col N="767" /> young school boys and girls towards a healthier life style and away from other attractions competing for the hearts and minds of our young people, such as drugs and vandalism.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the national lottery which commenced trading on 23 March 1987.  Total profits up to 1995 came to more than £800 million. In the light of these profits it is very difficult to convince thousands of volunteers in various sports throughout the country that their endeavours are appreciated by Government.  For example, the only grant available to the majority of clubs in my county last year was through the youth and sports grants scheme operated by the VEC.  Each club received £87 which would not purchase a set of jerseys, or even pay to have them cleaned.  It is imperative in the interest of sport that the original grant allocation of national lottery profits to sport, recreation and youth be restored.  In 1988 the percentage allocation for these areas came to 50.9 per cent.  In 1997 this had dropped to 33 per cent of total lottery funding.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago a fire destroyed the clubhouse of Fingalions GFC in Swords, one of the most progressive clubs in the country.  The members of the club, which caters for more than 30 teams per week, were devastated at the loss of their facility. However, with the support of the community of Swords and politicians they intend building a new clubhouse from the ashes of the former building. The clubhouse was used as a community centre as it was the only such facility in Swords, a town with a population in excess of 25,000.  It was used by all groups such as senior citizens, youths and many other organisations, including the local soccer clubs.  Given its pivotal role in the community life of Swords I strongly recommend that in the new grant scheme which the Minister shortly intends advertising &mdash; perhaps this has already been done &mdash; special consideration be given to an application by this club by providing it with a major grant, something which would be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge one of the requirements under the sports and community grant scheme is that projects should not proceed without grant approval from the Minister's Department.  I strongly recommend that a more flexible approach be taken in this regard.  For example, if a sports club draws up a viability plan, which in most cases envisages a loan from financial institutions, it should be allowed proceed and not be discriminated against when grants become available or are advertised.  If clubs waited until they received grant approval from the Department before proceeding many would not have got off the ground.  In this context a more flexible approach is necessary.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I will record the achievements of the Community Games, an organisation which must be complimented.  I hope in the context of trying to further develop it, making it even more successful and bringing a wider international dimension to it, which would include <Col N="768" /> Northern Ireland and England, that more facilities are provided for it.  Perhaps the Minister will meet with the officers of the Community Games to see how they can be facilitated in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a major step towards developing sport in Ireland and I look forward to making further contributions on subsequent Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Matt Brennan.  I offer my sincere condolences to the family of the late Mr. Noel Carroll, especially his wife Deirdre and his children.  I understand it may be possible for Deirdre and members of her family to spend some time with us this afternoon as we further discuss this Bill.  My brief involves addressing issues concerning youth, particularly in encouraging them to adopt active recreational pursuits and to avoid falling into the trap of the misuse of drugs.  Noel Carroll was an outstanding example of a person who made a fine contribution in his sporting and business careers in this regard, and in representing our capital city.  I express my sincere condolences to Deirdre and to his family.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan raised some interesting points, including the lack of playing pitch facilities in the greater Dublin area.  This is a serious issue but the Deputy may be able to make progress on it himself as a member of a local authority.  Local authorities should perhaps bring forward their own planning proposals for dealing with this issue.  As a member of Dublin County Council we could perhaps learn more about the utilisation of public open space, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  Our planners should look at how that space is provided because we may not have made the best use of our lands and there may be room for planners to designate public open spaces to service housing estates.  Many estates have open spaces in the centre of the estate and this does not lend itself to the provision of playing pitches, particularly when some individuals may not support constant playing activity in the centre of a housing estate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan pointed out that considerable resources have been provided by the national lottery scheme, and it is for the reasons he mentioned that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation intends bringing forward a new sports and recreational grant scheme.  All the matters Deputy Ryan and other Members have raised will be considered.  The Minister is concerned that the old scheme did not have a sunset clause, so that any offers of grants which had been made had a detrimental effect on the availability of funding if they were not drawn down within a reasonable period of time.  The points made by Deputy Ryan and others will be taken into account by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support this Bill, which is a major step in implementing the key policy objective of the Government in relation to sport and recreation. The Government has shown its full commitment <Col N="769" /> to sport by appointing the first full Minister for sport and by creating the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which brings together responsibilities relating to tourism, sport, recreation and local development.  The programme for Government clearly recognised the important role sport and recreation had to play in fostering a sense of physical and mental well-being generally as well as its potential for contributing to an improved society.  This Bill was specifically included in the programme, reflecting the Government's dynamic approach to the development and promotion of sport.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made it clear when creating the Department that &ldquo;sport has the same importance for national well-being as, for example, arts and culture.&rdquo; As Minister of State with responsibility for local development and the Government's national drug strategy I am working to ensure that the energy of local communities is channelled effectively to meet their own needs.  Focusing efforts on our most deprived communities is crucial to achieving the Government's primary goal of greater social inclusion, and sport is at the heart of this goal.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the strong growth in the economy in the 1990s.  However, considerable caution is required in assessing the contribution of economic growth to eliminating poverty and inequality.  Even in a time of exceptional national economic growth, with labour shortages in several areas, this growth does not automatically spill over to severely disadvantaged areas.  The economic boom may have the adverse effect of widening the poverty gap due to the weak capacity of the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of employment.  Their continued exclusion from the labour force leads to the buildup of enclaves of social exclusion whose very culture creates barriers to individual employability and helps to perpetuate the cycle of deprivation.</P>
    <P>The energies of these communities, if not positively harnessed, result in growth waves of crime, recourse to drugs and other social problems.  The failure of such communities to realise their condition represents a significant burden and social cost to the Irish economy, and the problems of these areas demand a comprehensive policy response.  Clearly, increased participation in sport and recreational activities, particularly by young people in these communities, is part of the Government's integrated approach.</P>
    <P>I also have responsibility for co-ordinating the national drugs strategy.  The House will be aware that local drugs task forces have been set up in 13 areas, 12 in Dublin and one in Cork.  These have been identified as having the worst levels of drug abuse.  These task forces comprise partnerships between the statutory, voluntary and community centres and were mandated to prepare profiles of the nature and extent of the drug problems in their areas and to develop action plans to provide a co-ordinated, integrated response to that problem.  The Government allocated £10 <Col N="770" /> million to support the implementation of these plans, which included strategies on treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and supply.</P>
    <P>While it is important to provide access to treatment and rehabilitation services for those already using drugs, it is equally important that, as a longer term solution, we put in place strategies to prevent people, particularly the young, from becoming involved with drugs in the first place. The cornerstone of the Government's strategy on the drug problem is that prevention is better than cure.  In this regard we are acutely aware of the benefits of sport and recreation as a preventative strategy in our efforts to tackle drug misuse, particularly among young people.  These young people have become the most vulnerable category in terms of the threat drugs pose to individual communities and to society in general.</P>
    <P>Sport plays a key role in reaching out to children and young people who are isolated from their communities and alienated from the formal education system.  Active involvement in sport has an important preventative role in relation to drug misuse as well as anti-social behaviour and crime.  There is a great need to increase the level of participation in sport and recreation in the most deprived and disadvantaged areas.  We all recognise that sport alone cannot solve the drugs and crime problem, but by providing motivation to young people in those areas it can help foster a sense of confidence and self-esteem which can only have a positive effect on their lives and communities.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed £30 million over three years to the young people's facilities and services fund.  The purpose of the fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities as well as services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The aim of the fund is to attract disadvantaged young people in these areas who are at risk of becoming involved with drugs into healthier and more productive pursuits, and £20 million of the fund is targeted at local drugs task force areas.  In these areas, development groups consisting of representatives from the task force, the VEC and the local authority were asked to prepare action plans to develop local facilities and services for young people.  These plans were recently submitted via the task force to an assessment committee chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which will evaluate them and make recommendations to the chairman of the committee on social inclusion in relation to their funding. While I am conscious that the evaluation process is difficult, given the wide range of issues to be addressed I am hopeful that, learning from the experience of the task force, the action plans will be effective and that funding to implement them will therefore be approved quickly.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council Bill is just one of the significant developments in the area of sport since the Minister and I took office.  The Department and the current Irish Sports Council, under its <Col N="771" /> excellent chairperson, Mr. John Treacy, have been working closely together.  These developments include the rationalisation, simplification and redesign of the grants scheme for national bodies to help them plan the development and promotion of their respective sports more effectively.  There is also the introduction of a new carding system for high performance athletes, which includes athletes with disabilities, to provide a range of supports designed to help the country's most talented sportspersons realise their full potential to perform successfully at the highest international level.  A comprehensive review of the sports capital programme is now nearing completion which will allow a more focused programme to be in place next year.  In addition, there is Ireland's first national sports anti-doping programme, which is targeted for nationwide application as soon as the new statutory council is up and running.  This underlines the Minister's commitment to assist all those involved in sporting activity, whether that is at recreational, competitive or high performance level, to participate in a sporting environment free from drug taking.</P>
    <P>A new independent sports council will constitute the linchpin of the Government's policy of securing a more focused, strategic approach to the development of sport in Ireland.  This Bill will provide for a council with the ability to support and assist sport across the sporting spectrum from the high performance athlete to the ordinary person who wants to take part in sport for recreation and pleasure.  The council's functions have been broadened beyond that of advising to encompass a number of functions currently carried out by the Department.  I am glad that encouraging increased participation in recreational sport has been made one of the council's primary functions. This is to recognise its important role and ensures that recreational sport will not be neglected in favour of high performance sport.  There is also clear recognition that encouraging participation in sport will require a partnership approach between the sports council and other bodies, such as national governing bodies of sport, and public authorities, such as vocational education committees, local authorities and health boards.  The council will have the power to co-operate, advise and assist these bodies in encouraging increased participation.  The Bill also requires that the council must have regard to Government policy in performing its functions and must comply with any general policy directive which the Minister may give it.  This means the council must take on board the policy aims of the Government which are expressed in the mission and goals of the Department.</P>
    <P>Social inclusion underlines the work of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Reaching out to our most deprived communities is the reason underlying the link between sport, local development and the national drugs strategy. We all recognise the potential sport has to <Col N="772" /> offer in improving our society and are committed to ensuring that the State plays its part in capitalising on that potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister, Deputy McDaid, for introducing it. It is a step in the right direction for sport.  Everyone in Ireland loves sport and it is very much talked about.  A total of 750 projects have been funded under the sports and recreation facilities programme.  Those projects were funded by the Department or by national lottery funding and are of great benefit to small sports clubs around the country.  I thank the Minister for allocating £30 million over the next three years to sport.</P>
      <P>I congratulate one of Sligo's young sportspersons, Mark Scanlon, who won the under 18 world cycling championship.  That win was a great credit to him and it was great for cycling, particularly cycling in County Sligo.  I support the funding of sports facilities from the national lottery or the sports council.  Many small Gaelic football clubs and soccer clubs find it difficult to raise the necessary funds to provide sporting facilities in their parishes.  Any football club that submits an application for lottery funding for sports facilities should be funded.</P>
      <P>I would also support the funding of small swimming pools in our smaller towns as they would be of great benefit to local communities.  Ray MacSharry made more than £1 million available to provide a 25 metre swimming pool in Sligo town. It is of great benefit to the north west and people travel more than 30 miles a week to use it.</P>
      <P>I was successful in securing £30,000 in national lottery funding for the provision of the nine hole golf course in Tubbercurry.  There was criticism of the allocation of lottery funding for the provision of golf courses, but that small golf course was provided by workers participating in FÁS schemes.  People gave of their time voluntarily and sold £100 tickets to raise funds for it.  It was funded by local fundraising events and national lottery funding.  I like to play the odd game of golf and it is great to have that facility nearby.  I favour the provision of more small golf courses and the allocation of national lottery funding to such golf courses should not be criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members have played hurling or Gaelic football.  I watched those games being played in different countries.  As a young emigrant I played Gaelic football in London and Manchester.  I travelled from London to Manchester and from London to Birmingham to play against different teams.  I watched many Irish organisations and county associations play Gaelic football and hurling in New York.  I also played Gaelic football in New York.  Many people emigrated from Kilkenny, Clare and Donegal and I saw many young men from those counties play Gaelic football or hurling in New York.  I was proud to see Irish emigrants play those games in Gaelic Park in New York.  If additional money is available, it should be allocated to overseas clubs which promote Gaelic games.  This year the London team <Col N="773" /> will play in the Connacht Championship and the New York team will play in the All Ireland series. I welcome that because Gaelic games are part of our national heritage and culture.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate our great sportspeople, in particular Sínead Smith who won many gold medals.  Ronnie Delaney and the late Noel Carroll were mentioned.  Those wonderful sportsmen represented Ireland for many years.  I hope to see the day when more sportspeople will represent our country.  We were all proud of the Irish soccer team that did well in the European Championships and in the World Cup in Italy and America, and many people travelled to see them play there.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction.  I particularly welcome the special grant to promote young athletes who have good potential.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  It puts sport on a statutory footing for the first time.  We have had various <i>ad hoc</i> committees down through the years such as Cóspoir.  Those who were appointed to that body did a great job in advising the Minister of the day on sports activities and devising policy on the future direction of sport.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Allen, for his initiative in ensuring a strategy for sport into the millennium was published during his term of office.  He indicated strongly that one of the recommendations of that strategy should be to put sport on a statutory footing with an independent board and finance to ensure that such an independent board would pay more attention to the activities of all the sports bodies that have been developed over the years through direct financial assistance from the Department. Deputy Allen has been to the fore over the years in ensuring sport is at the top of the political agenda.  The Government is heading in the same direction and there is consensus about the necessity for, and importance of, this legislation.</P>
      <P>The voluntary commitment of many people in sports and recreational organisations is enormous. I am always in awe of the people who devote a considerable amount of their spare time to bringing children and young people to various sports events, particularly at weekends. I am a member of the GAA, as are many colleagues, and I am aware of the huge commitment of parents and teachers in places such as Kilkenny in ensuring that the quality of sporting activity at primary and second level is second to none.  However, this voluntary effort is often taken for granted and it is time the criteria under which the national lottery was established are recognised and more of its resources are devoted to sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> It is unacceptable at a time when there is a budget surplus that we are unable to fund other activities without recourse to raiding the national lottery.  It has become an easy touch for successive Governments to allocate money for health services and other purposes.  Direct Exchequer support for those Departments is more appropriate and the national lottery should be allowed to play its full part in allocating resources exclusively to sport.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to make a clear policy statement in the run-up to the millennium, perhaps in the budget next week, so that more resources will be devoted exclusively to the development of sport.  Sport is part of what we are.  It raises morale, gives a lift to everybody and generates considerable participation among all age groups.  Additional financial allocations from the national lottery should be harnessed towards sport.  It is hugely expensive to run a club of any description.  For example, a hurling club must replace broken hurleys, injured players must be looked after and various facilities are required for the players.  As a result a huge amount of voluntary fund-raising is taking place.</P>
    <P>National lottery grants and sports and recreational grants from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation give modest assistance to the development of dressing rooms, playing pitches, etc.  I have always supported these grants, but it is a small amount in the context of that which is required on an ongoing basis to support sports organisations.  For example, a turnover of £10,000 per annum is considered the norm for a GAA club.</P>
    <P>I admire sports people, particularly those who perform at national and international level.  Emily Maher, aged 17, who is a recent 100 and 200 metre world champion, hails from my constituency. She has shown, through enormous dedication and commitment and the support she received from her coach and family, that supreme sacrifice and effort pays off for those who are cut out for the national and international arenas.  I congratulate individuals, such as Emily Maher and Susan Smith, who have gone beyond the call of duty to put Ireland on the map in a positive light in terms of sport.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the importance of sports centres.  A number of areas have been targeted for them as they have been the exception rather than the norm in various counties.  I wish to see an expansion of such centres to all counties as part of the millennium project.  There are regional centres, for example, in Waterford and it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility, with the resources available from the national lottery and the Exchequer to open such centres in other areas.  Additional facilities should be provided to boost existing sport centres which are small in towns such as Kilkenny.  The development carried out on Scanlon Park, Kilkenny, is a perfect example.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Aylward, who was Minister with responsibility for sport at the time, for playing a leading role in <Col N="775" /> ensuring some money was provided at the right time for the development of that facility.  More could be done to increase the number of facilities.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny swimming pool has outlived its usefulness. Its age is a worry to the local authorities and greater co-operation between the Ministers for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Environment and Local Government could yield a better dividend for those involved in the coaching of swimming for the young people in Kilkenny.  A new pool is urgently required to cater for the enormous demand the sport has garnered over recent years.</P>
    <P>Sport makes a major contribution to the lives of young people and it also has a major impact on their psychological development as they go through the education system.  It keeps them out of trouble in many areas.  The Ministers for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Environment and Local Government could also work together to ensure, in the context of the development of urban areas, community and recreational resources are put first rather than the development of the housing or industrial infrastructure of the community.  The cart has been put before the horse over the years in terms of the planning and development of urban areas.  Community and recreational facilities should be provided by the State and local authorities as the norm and a greater contribution should be sought in the planning process from developers, who have done exceedingly well over recent years as a result of the Celtic tiger.  Builders and developers have derived the greatest benefit from the growth in economic activity in Ireland and should make a bigger contribution to the development of community and recreational facilities prior to starting developments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly the section that deals with doping and drug testing.  If we are serious about the development of our young people, a rigorous approach must be taken to stamp out any possibility of illegal activity and substance abuse in sport.  Our young people must be protected in every way from the abuse of drugs.  Headlines have been made recently which will allow us to ensure young people are not exposed to the wrong substances.  This is in their short-term interest and in the long-term it will prevent potential damage to the sporting industry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille seo freisin mar tá sé fíor thábhachtach go mbeadh treoir cheart ag spórt de gach sórt in Éirinn.  Tá gearán amháin agam.  Sílim go mba chóir an focal &ldquo;COSPÓIR&rdquo; a choimead mar theideal ar an Chomhairle seo.  Deireann sé anseo &ldquo;An Bille um Comhairle Spóirt na hÉireann&rdquo;.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh éinne ag caint faoi Chomhairle Spóirt na hÉireann.  Bhunaigh an chéad Aire Spóirt, an t-Uasal Jim Tunney, an focal simplí, oiriúnach &ldquo;COSPÓIR&rdquo; mar the deal ar an mbord.  Tá an focal sin simplí agus tá gach <Col N="776" /> éinne in ann é a rá.  fiú daoine nach bhfuil focal Gaeilge acu.  Iarraim ar an Aire an focal &ldquo;COSPÓIR&rdquo; a thabhairt ar ais mar theideal ar an chomhairle nua seo.  Fadó, bhí daoine in ann a rá &ldquo;I wrote to COSPÓIR&rdquo; nó &ldquo;I got a grant from COSPÓIR&rdquo;&mdash; the word came naturally to them. People will not say &ldquo;I have applied to Comhairle Spóirt na hÉireann&rdquo;.  If we are serious about bilingualism or the restoration of the Irish language, the Minister should consider re-introducing the name &ldquo;COSPÓIR&rdquo; which the then Minister, Mr. Jim Tunney, so wisely gave to the former body.</P>
      <P>The council will have nine members, a chairman and eight others.  I have the utmost confidence that the Minister will pick the most talented people but it is important that he includes people with practical experience of sport, who have gone through hardship and training.  This does not mean people who have never taken part in sport are unsuitable but I would hate to see the council have too many academics, by which I mean people who lecture on sport but have never gone through the hardship.  The council should feature people who have shown, through their experience, that they know sport and understand the difficulties.  If the council has experienced people, they will know what the needs are and what has to be done without waiting for someone to write to them.  Our international athletes are prime examples.  I compliment Mr. John Treacy on the work he did with the previous Minister.  He is respected, as is Mr. Éamon Coghlan and as was the late Noel Carroll.  Good examples of current athletes include Ms Catherina McKiernan and Ms Sonia O'Sullivan.  Who would be better placed to give advice, or who could add more?</P>
      <P>The council must have at least three women, which is a fair reflection of how women have contributed to sport, but perhaps the membership should be evenly split between men and women. Women have contributed enormously in athletics and even in Gaelic football &mdash; we saw the tremendous standard displayed in this year's women's All-Ireland Final.  Women are becoming far more active in sport.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan mentioned the role of volunteers, which I have often spoken about also.  It must have been a record to have four representatives from Carlow-Kilkenny in the Chamber for this debate, until the Ceann Comhairle left.  It shows how strong sport is in our constituency. Deputy Aylward is a former Minister responsible for sport.</P>
      <P>We will never replace the voluntary work done by so many people over the years.  The GAA is often criticised for getting money but it has provided a marvellous facility in every parish across the country.  It kept people occupied and out of mischief &mdash; how many more people would be in jail if we had not had sporting activities down the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers have done so much but were taken for granted for so long; we now see the difference when they are not as active in sport, and this will <Col N="777" /> have a big effect.  At one stage teachers only had to teach the three Rs, which anyone with any talent could do.  Now they have to teach art and PE also.  I am glad I have left teaching because I could no longer teach PE.  Perhaps this is outside the remit of the Bill, but it is time the Department of Education and Science or this Department considered appointing PE teachers for primary schools.  It is unfair to ask middle aged and older teachers to teach PE &mdash; they can and do stand on the sideline but we have to take the subject seriously.  It provided great opportunities for children, and the more choice they have, the better for them.  They may not be hurlers, Gaelic footballers or soccer players but if they get an opportunity to take part in games they will develop their talent.</P>
    <P>The practice of taking school children to swimming pools has increased greatly, and it is a marvellous advance that so many children learn to swim in primary school.  When I heard Deputy Brennan say £1 million had been given for a pool in Sligo I could not resist smiling.  A lot of money is going to pools along the coast.  I do not begrudge them these pools, they may need them in winter, but it is unbelievable that inland counties like Carlow and Kilkenny should have so much difficulty getting money for a pool.  Two priests in Graiguecullen built a pool at the fraction of the cost of the grant given for other pools. Father Fingleton now wants to extend the pool, because so many people want to use it that good swimmers cannot practise properly.  That will cost £500,000 but grants of £1.5 million are given for pool renovations elsewhere, especially in coastal counties like Wexford, Sligo and Cork.  Inland counties should get priority because they do not have the option of going to the sea, which is at least 50 miles away.  People who do go to the sea are unable to swim there anyway because they are burnt like a rasher by the time they get there. I appeal for pools to be built in inland counties. Pools in County Carlow should be given every aid and I acknowledge the help given by the former Minister, Deputy Aylward, when the Graiguecullen pool was being built &mdash; he had to start at the wrong time, as it were.</P>
    <P>International athletes should be financially rewarded.  Some of them receive sponsorship but they represent Ireland and there is nothing better than seeing our runners represent us in the Olympics.  Recently I was in Sydney and saw the excitement about holding the Olympics &mdash; they are selling badges, constructing buildings and digging up roads.  The hold-ups in Dublin are nowhere near as bad as those in Sydney.  We all want our athletes to be in Sydney and they should be given every possible help by making facilities available.  It is also important to help those who have not made the grade.  This is why the council should have experienced members, because they will know it is necessary to fund lesser-known people who would otherwise not have enough money to become international athletes and gain sponsorship.  Young, talented people are emerging <Col N="778" /> across the country and we owe it to them to redirect the funds.  It is not easy to divide the funding between all the national bodies &mdash; the Minister for Finance has £1 billion extra income and every organisation thinks it should receive money &mdash; but the Irish Sports Council should be able to deal with the matter.  The volunteers are becoming scarcer because it is expensive and the scandals are putting people off, but help should be given to bodies at local level to ensure they can continue to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish my compliments to be conveyed to the Ceann Comhairle, a fellow Kilkenny man, on his performance here this morning in welcoming the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is one in which I am particularly interested and which I have advocated for some time.  I am delighted it has finally been published and that we are debating it in the House.  I welcomed the setting up of the new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. This is something very close to my heart as I had responsibility for sport when it was part of the Department of Education.  The Department of Education and Science is a very large one with a huge budget of close to £3 billion, and the sport section within the Department had a budget of approximately £20 million.  Although people in the Department had the best of intentions, sport did not get the attention it deserved.  It is for that reason when I was charged with drawing up a policy document I suggested that a special department dealing with sport and recreation should be established.  It was part of our programme for Government and it was done immediately on our return to office.  I very much welcomed that and compliment the Minister and the Minister of State in that Department on the advances that have been made since the setting up of the Department.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate Mr. John Treacy, the chief executive officer, on his efforts in the Department. He has done an excellent job and brings a breath of fresh air to that Department.  He is a most competent person.  There are few people in this country who know as much about sport or are as interested in the future of sport.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Browne's comments about COSPÓIR and dropping the title.  I would also like to take the opportunity to say a particular word of thanks to the many volunteers who serve in COSPÓIR over 20 years.  They are excellent, committed people, who did a tremendous job on a voluntary basis.  COSPÓIR had lapsed when I went into the Department in 1992 and I was very pleased to reconstitute it.  I have never had anything but the greatest help and co-operation from that body, and the very many people who served in it over the years should be acknowledged with a special word of thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not manage without the governing bodies of sport which are made up mainly of volunteers, the people who bring young people to <Col N="779" /> and from games and practice every day of the week for no reward.  It is their commitment and the interest they have in sport that leads them to do that.  It is unfortunate that in the scandals in recent years a few people have damaged the reputations and good work of many.  The vast majority of volunteers do tremendous work and are the lifeblood of sport.  While we have such committed volunteers, sport is in safe hands. Unfortunately things are all the more difficult now because of past events.</P>
    <P>The new Department has a new vision for sport in the future, particularly on the international market.  I have always maintained that the more international events we can attract here the better because of the spin-offs that will result for our economy and the improved the image of our country as a whole.  Events like the Tour de France earlier this year brought new spirit.  The tour passed the area in Carlow-Kilkenny that I come from and the effect it had on small communities had to be seen to be believed.  It brought communities together, working to present their area to the international viewing public, and it was tremendous to see.  Events like the Ryder Cup, which we hope to see here in a few years time will do likewise.  All these events do much for the image of Ireland abroad and for the tourism industry.  That is where the areas of tourism, sport and recreation really blend together.</P>
    <P>One small concern I have about the creation of a statutory body is that it might become too remote from volunteers and voluntary organisations like the national governing bodies of sport. That has happened in the case of another organisation that represents sport here which, even though it is based in Dublin is totally removed from the governing bodies.  I hope that will not happen with this statutory body.  There is a danger of it, and I warn against it.  Whatever else, we should not forget the concept of sport for all. Sport is about fun, first and foremost.  We then graduate to competitive sport and finally, if we are fortunate, to the elite sportsperson.  There was reference to the success of a particular person in my county, my neighbour, Emily Maher.  For years we have listened to advice that our elite sports people should travel abroad to avail of proper facilities and a higher level of competition. Here is a case in point where a person preferred to remain at home in her own country.  Because the facilities had been provided in my native Kilkenny, she was able to stay at home in the security of her own family to train and perform at top class level.  The same was true of Catherina McKiernan.  It is a myth that top Irish athletes must travel abroad to compete at the top level. It is an area we should examine with a view to expanding existing facilities and developing them further in the interest of keeping as many athletes as possible at home.  Not everybody likes to travel. Some people feel far more secure and perform much better if they can remain at home, and that should be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> I turn now to funding for sport.  This has always been a contentious issue.  Sport does not get its fair share of funding in Ireland.  Funding has increased, and I compliment the Minister for that. However, all current spending should come from the national Exchequer and lottery funding should be used for capital development.  It is my objective to ensure that 40 per cent of the national lottery is automatically available for sport and recreational facilities and activities.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the question of recognition of other activities and sports by the Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sport. Much has been said about the game of bridge. When I was in the Department I was anxious that that game should be recognised under the recreation side of the Department.  I understand the Minister is favourably disposed to this.  While there may be problems with the running of martial arts, they also have a place in Irish sport and I ask that that be considered and facilitated if possible.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mattie Brennan, spoke about golf.  Golf should be included for grant-aid purposes.  I am not talking about elitist golf clubs. Golf is one of the fastest growing sports.  In many parishes small nine-hole golf courses are being developed by voluntary organisations, and they have no access to funding.  I have discussed this with the Minister and he is favourably disposed. I ask that golf clubs, just like any other sporting organisation, should be entitled to apply for funding. The merits of each case can be considered but they should be included, particularly the smaller clubs.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of the drug problem, particularly in urban areas.  I put forward the proposal in the Fianna Fáil Party's policy document that sport and leisure officers should be appointed in each local authority area, with specific emphasis on urban areas.  Full-time recreational officers should be appointed to try to steer young people away from involvement in drugs and towards sports and recreational activities. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, now has a large budget to deal with the blackspots and I hope he will consider this proposal. No stone should be left unturned in dealing with the scourge of drugs in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that each local authority has a sports officer attached to its staff.  Many areas have no facilities at all, but there is a duplication of facilities in others.  I am aware of areas where schools have the most up to date facilities and the community also has facilities.  The school's facilities close at 4 p.m. and the other centre opens at 6 p.m. This is a waste of funds in a country which is crying out for more facilities.  If resources were pooled under the auspices of a local authority sport and leisure officer, it might emerge that the current deficit is not as large as we think.  Better use could be made of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern to me is the lack of physical education in schools.  At second level, there are 750 physical education teachers nationwide. <Col N="781" /> They are obliged to give 30 minutes to physical education instruction.  At primary level, there are no physical education teachers.  Sports days which are open to everybody are held once a year, but despite the best intentions, they do not work.  This area needs to be considered and I hope the new body will deal with it as a matter of urgency.  The facilities in schools must be considered in conjunction with the facilities in communities to ensure there is a proper network throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that tenders have been invited for the provision of a 50-metre pool.  This matter has been ongoing for years.  When I was appointed to the Department in 1992, it had been decided that the project would be discontinued. Fortunately, it was put back on the agenda. Numerous reports on the project have been prepared and I am glad that finally a pool will be provided.  I look forward to the availability of a national 50 metre pool in 2000 and also to the provision of a proper national stadium.</P>
    <P>I hope the new body will review the existing regional facilities.  Some years ago it was decided that decent facilities should be provided in each region.  The then Government made a large investment to provide facilities at regional level. Unfortunately, some areas were left out and this needs to be addressed.  There should be proper regional facilities within 30 miles of every part of Ireland which represent the broad spectrum of sporting activity.</P>
    <P>The best programme operated by the Department is the recreational facilities scheme.  Unfortunately, in recent years the amount of money allocated to it has been totally inadequate.  I urge a substantial increase in the figure.  Apart from providing necessary infrastructure and facilities, the scheme recognises the role of volunteers who do so much for sport and recreational activities. The scheme should be a priority of the new body when it is established.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that greyhound and horse racing do not come under the aegis of the Department. They should be included and I hope that will happen eventually.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned, in relation to developments by local authorities, that no proper provision is made for recreation and sporting facilities or green areas.  Regulations state that a green area must be provided for housing developments, but this has not been properly enforced.  Planning authorities should be given special powers to insist when planning applications are made that provision must be made for such areas.  Local authorities should specify, in consultation with the planning office, the types of facilities which would suit particular developments.  Local authorities should be directed to do this.</P>
    <P>There is great potential in the area of joint ventures where the private sector is interested in becoming involved in providing facilities.  This should be encouraged.  There is also potential in the area of tax breaks.  If people are prepared to invest in the provision of sporting facilities, they <Col N="782" /> should be encouraged to do so through tax breaks.  This would free up much money and ensure that the rate of development of sports facilities is much increased.</P>
    <P>The role of volunteers has not been sufficiently recognised in recent years, even by sports governing bodies.  I hope the new body will insist that the role of volunteers is put on a new plane.  They have contributed hugely and done much for the sporting public.  All credit is due to them.</P>
    <P>Sport and leisure are important not only in terms of the enjoyment they bring to people of all ages, but also because of their beneficial impact on society.  It should be fully appreciated that many of our most acute urban problems, such as drugs and crime, stem from a lack of self-esteem and confidence in young people and particularly a sense of purpose.  An interest in sporting activities can provide the motivation to adolescents to avoid the scourge of drugs and crime.  Sport and leisure by themselves will not solve the drugs and associated crime problems, but they can play a vital role in that battle.</P>
    <P>While much attention has been given in recent times to the need for increased police power and more stringent investigations of the assets of drug pushers as a means of seeking to challenge the supply of drugs, the other side of the equation must not be ignored.  We must ask why there is a demand for drugs and through sport and recreation we must try to devise policies to reduce this demand.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the collection and collation of courts statistics is as follows.  Court statistics are compiled on the basis of the legal year which runs from 1 August to 31 July.  District Court and Circuit Court offices forward periodical statistical returns to my Department in respect of each legal year giving details of the number and type of cases dealt with by the court in the period under review.  These returns are collated by officials in my Department to provide information on the volume and type of cases dealt with by the courts in each legal year. Material from these returns is forwarded to the CSO for inclusion in its statistical abstract.</P>
      <P>The superior court offices also forward statistics at the end of each legal year via the Department for inclusion in the CSO statistical abstract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> It is acknowledged that the level, detail, accuracy and timely nature of statistics currently available in the courts is far from satisfactory. However, this is largely due to the fact that court statistics are, in the main, still collated manually, which severely restricts the level and detail of statistics which can be compiled within the resources available.  Legislative changes, especially in the area of family law, have also increased the demand for more relevant and detailed statistical information from the courts.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made by court offices to produce the more detailed statistics required.  In 1996 all statistical return forms were redesigned for this purpose.  However, it is accepted by all parties involved in the collating and compiling of court statistics that the accuracy of these statistics cannot be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>On assuming office, I immediately recognised the only way in which relevant, accurate and timely court statistics could be produced was by expanding the use of information technology in the courts and the provision of dedicated computer systems for the courts.  To this end I provided an additional £2.5 million for expenditure on information technology for the courts in 1998, thereby increasing the IT expenditure for the courts in 1998 to £3.7 million.  Earlier this year, my Department tendered via the EU journal for computer systems for the courts and today I will be announcing the award of the contract for the provision and the development of computer systems for the courts.  These systems will run in every court in the land.  They will include criminal and civil case tracking, financial management and accounts systems, production of statistics, management information and document management systems.</P>
    <P>The expansion of information technology into the courts and the development of dedicated court systems will revolutionise the type and the level of detail of statistics available on the courts and is the first real step taken by any Minister to resolve the old age problem of the court statistics. The new computer system will not only provide statistics on the number and type of cases dealt with by the courts and the type of orders made in any format and for any period required, but will also enhance the management information sought by this Department for future planning and policy making.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>The first phase of the computer system will be installed by end June 1999 and it is hoped to have the entire project completed by mid 2000.</P>
    <P>I expect the development of a sophisticated and effective IT-based court data system as outlined will be reinforced by the establishment of the new independent court service.  Under the Court Service Act, 1998, the new court service will be required to adopt a strategic approach to managing its services and this is expected to include putting in place a comprehensive information <Col N="784" /> function to underpin statutory and management requirements.  I will ask the board of the new service to have particular regard to the recommendations of the working group on a courts commission concerning statistical and other information needs for the new service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I am pleased the question has brought forward the Minister's announcement. The Minister's acknowledgement that the figures up to now cannot be guaranteed is a frightening indictment in relation to court statistics which are a vital component in a criminal justice system.  The absence of accurate court statistics has caused public disquiet and anger at inconsistent court sentencing.  This was graphically illustrated a number of weeks ago when in one week a bag snatching drug addict had her sentence reduced from nine years to six years, a Garda convicted of drink driving in a hit and run case, in which a young man was killed, had a six month sentence suspended and a farmer who kept an animal which strayed onto his lands was sentenced to two months and will lose £20,000 in agricultural grants.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware such inconsistency is doing irreparable damage to the reputation of the courts and public confidence in the courts?  Is he aware that in recent months a judge awarded £3,000 for a 2 per cent Army deafness claim while in the same week another judge awarded £30,000 to a claimant who suffered the same level of deafness?  Is the Minister aware that such gross inconsistency is turning our courts into a legal lottery?  Will he agree he has an obligation to set down non-statutory guidelines to ensure consistency in sentencing and to restore public confidence in the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Opposition benches I continuously made the point that it was difficult for anybody to know precisely what was going on in the courts in the absence of relevant details.  On assuming office I moved to ensure we would have adequate information technology in the courts.  In this context, the establishment of the new court service will mean that the function of the day to day management of the courts will be transferred from the Department to that board.  That board will continue with the technological advances being made with regard to the collation and collection of court data.  I would be loath to delve into the circumstances of any one case with regard to the issue of sentencing.  A court hearing a case, more often than not, has a far better idea of what sentence should be imposed than any outside commentator.  I accept that on occasion there appears to have been inconsistency in sentencing, but sentencing is a reserved function of the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only on very rare occasions has the Oireachtas intervened to impose mandatory sentencing on the courts.  One such occasion was when the death penalty was abolished for capital murder and a 40 year sentence was provided for by the Oireachtas <Col N="785" /> in its place.  The most recent example is the legislation before the House which is nearing completion, whereby an individual convicted of dealing in drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more will obtain the mandatory or minimum sentence from the courts of ten years.  The only other instance I can think of off-hand is the crime of murder where a life term is mandatory.  In general terms that is the position and I trust it is of some assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I arranged for a copy of the report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas together with a summary, prepared in my Department, of the recommendations which it contains. I also arranged to provide copies of this documentation to the Opposition spokespersons on justice as well as other Deputies who have tabled questions about this matter in recent days.  The report was also circulated to the media and copies are available from my Department.  It is also being placed on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>I am glad this question acted as a catalyst and has resulted in publication of the report which proposes that the right to silence be modulated.  Will the Minister give an assurance that this would not be done without the safeguards suggested, that video recording equipment be installed in every Garda station where persons are interrogated and that there be an entitlement to have a solicitor present during interrogation where video recording equipment is not available?</P>

      <P>The report of the working group does not recommend that the right to silence be abolished.  The right to silence dates from an age when an individual could not speak in his or her own defence.  That is a far cry from the position today where an individual is entitled not only to make his or her own case but also to criminal legal aid if he or she cannot afford a lawyer. The working group recommended that an inference be drawn by the court where it considers it reasonable to do so from the refusal of an individual to answer questions which he or she could reasonably have been expected to answer while in detention.  This is broadly in line with current practice under the criminal justice drug trafficking Act and the more recent Offences Against the State Act.  An individual being questioned has a legal right to consult a solicitor.  The questions of whether an individual should have the right to have a solicitor present while being questioned and whether video recording equipment should be installed will be considered by the Government in tandem with the legislative proposals which I hope to present in due course.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the number of date rape cases reported to the Garda Síochána in 1997 and to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, since the term &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; is not, in legal terms, a specific sexual offence, it is not recorded as such.  It would not be possible to extract the information requested by him without making inquiries in each case and, even then, it would not necessarily be possible to provide statistics with any degree of confidence that they were completely accurate.</P>
      <P>From research published earlier this year by An Garda Síochána into rapes recorded during the 1994-97 period, offenders were known, to some extent, to the victims in 87 per cent of cases. The term &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; is subject to a high degree of subjectivity and variability as the victimoffender relationship can range from friend to acquaintance to stranger.  The Garda estimates that 11 per cent of rapes occurred in circumstances where the victim began the day in the company of the offender or where they joined company during the course of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the term &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; has been linked in recent times with the abuse of the drug Rohypnol.  In reply to a question tabled <Col N="787" /> on 10 February 1998 by Deputy Upton I informed the House that the Garda authorities had advised me that that there was no specific information available linking the use of Rohypnol to crime in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The number of rape cases recorded in 1997 showed, approximately, a 40 per cent increase on the 1996 figures; of the 256 rape offences recorded in 1997, 214 were detected.  The indications are that the number of rapes recorded in 1998 will show a further increase, unlike other crime which will show a further decrease.  Like every other Member of the House, I am concerned with the increasing trend in the number of reported rapes.</P>
    <P>As I indicated previously, the Garda Commissioner shares my concerns at this trend.  Earlier this year he asked the Garda research unit to conduct an analysis of the number of reported rapes between 1994 and 1997.  The majority of cases for 1997 were historical child abuse cases.  It seems that there is now a greater willingness by the victim to report rape, some of which may be due to the more sympathetic climate for reporting such crimes.</P>
    <P>I understand the Garda is about to continue its research in the area of rape and proposes to examine all recorded rapes for 1996.  The focus of the research will be on the experiences of victims of rape who report to the Garda.  It will also try to quantify the attrition rate at each stage from reporting a case to case outcome and to suggest how the processing of cases might be improved with reference to Garda practice.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there are victims who do not come forward to the Garda to report on rape cases.  My Department has, therefore, commissioned another research project, specifically to focus on rape, which will be undertaken jointly by the Department of Applied Social Studies, University College Cork and the Cork Rape Crisis Centre.  The research will run in parallel with the Garda research project and will have more of a focus on victims' experiences.  It will examine, on a step-by-step basis, <i>inter alia</i>, the obstacles which rape victims encounter before coming into contact with and while progressing through the criminal justice system as a whole.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Date rape, in legal terms, should be a specific sexual offence.  It has become a regular feature of weekend happenings.  I have been contacted by members of the Garda Síochána who have investigated such distressing happenings. Is the Minister aware that Rohypnol which is used to spike drinks takes effect within 20 minutes; is ten times stronger than valium, and while, in theory, is legally available only on prescription is now readily available on the black market?  Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to make contact with medical and pharmaceutical organisations and ask them to be vigilant and conduct an investigation into how Rohypnol is falling into <Col N="788" /> the wrong hands?  They should also be obliged to add a colouring agent to ensure it is visible and detectable.  A taste ingredient should also be added.  Something will have to be done to stamp out what is a frightening and growing development. From the point of view of the prosecution it is an offence that is almost impossible to prove given that the person concerned suffers from amnesia and Rohypnol leaves the system after a period of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of imposing restrictions on the sale or availability of the drug rohypnol is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children to consider.  In view of what the Deputy has said I will raise the matter with the Minister to see if he believes if restrictions of the kind described by the Deputy should be imposed.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether there should be an offence for date rape, rape is a criminal offence, irrespective of whether it is committed on a date with an individual.  It is still rape and, as such, carries very severe penalties.  It is one of the most heinous offences known to mankind and is regarded so seriously in this jurisdiction that, with murder, it may only be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  The introduction of a new offence of date rape would make not a difference because the penalty for rape, including date rape, is heavy and very heavy sentences are imposed by the courts.</P>

      <P>The Statute of Limitations, 1957, provides a period of three years for the commencement of personal injuries proceedings based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty beyond which the proceedings may be struck out because they were not commenced in time.  The three year period does not run when the plaintiff is under a legal disability, principally where the plaintiff is a minor or of unsound mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, amended the law so that the three year limitation period in such cases runs from the date on which the injured person discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, that the injury occurred if this date is later than the act or omission leading to the injury.  I understand this Act substantially implemented the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's Report on the Statute of Limitations &mdash; Claims in respect of Latent Personal Injuries (LRC 21-1987).</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1957 Statute provides for a flat six year period for claims for personal injuries arising out of actions not based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty.  In such actions, the limitation period does not run during any period when the plaintiff is under a disability.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the application of the Statute of Limitation in cases of sexual abuse of children has been the subject of recent comment in the media, including the legal press.  This is a complex area of the law which merits the closest examination. I am considering a number of options open to me for carrying out that examination and the decisions made will be announced shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute of Limitations, 1957, as amended by the Act of 1991, does not adequately meet my concerns, especially with regard to school children who may have been abused by teachers or children in care who may have been abused by care workers.  Care workers and teachers are employees of the State, which has a duty to ensure that a technical bar, a blunt instrument in the form of the Statute of Limitations, cannot and should not be applied to bar a victim from having his action heard in the courts.</P>
      <P>Teachers and care workers are now pleading guilty in the criminal courts to acts of abuse that may have been perpetrated years ago.  They are doing so in the knowledge that they will have no responsibility towards their victims because of the Statute of Limitations, which debars any action being taken three years after the attainment of the age of majority by a student in a case against a teacher.</P>
      <P>The situation is fundamentally unjust.  The position of the State is also fundamentally untenable with specific reference to teachers, because the State is the ultimate employer.  Does the Minster accept that he can stand over a situation where perpetrators of the most gross acts of indecency against children can walk away with no civil responsibility because of the inadequacy of the law, including the Statute of Limitations?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the referral of the matter to the Law Reform Commission is under active consideration, not least because of the complexity of <Col N="790" /> the issues involved.

      <P>Much has been achieved in the area of disability since the Government took office and I am committed to continuing the momentum that has been generated and to making further progress in this area.  There has been significant progress in the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. In November 1997 and July 1998 we made significant announcements regarding the key infrastructural recommendations of the report relating to the National Disability Authority and a disability support service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made towards achieving our commitments on the issue of mainstreaming training and employment for people with disabilities and the provision of a comprehensive information service.  The establishment of a permanent representative council of people with disabilities in 1999 is also being facilitated and funded by my Department.  In addition, six pilot projects relating to people with disabilities are being funded by the Department in line with the commission's recommendations.  Four relate to the information area and two relate to <Col N="791" /> the cross-sectoral planning for delivery of services, such as in the transport area.</P>
    <P>A plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report, is to be presented to us by the end of next February and it is our intention to submit that to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>We are also involved in monitoring the 3 per cent quota for people with disabilities in the public service and are in the process of establishing a monitoring committee in that regard.  Much has happened in this area, particularly with the announcement of the National Disability Authority and the disability support services and all that will happen in terms of building a future together for the equality of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We have allocated £160,000 to four of the pilot projects and £45,000 to the other two.  The commission also recommended community action plans.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to radical change to ensure the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  We are working across all Departments to ensure the recommendations made by the commission are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress is not nearly as good as the Minister of State claims.  She has now set up a monitoring committee on the implementation of the proposals of the commission.  I understand that committee has not met since approximately last Easter.  In the meantime, who is monitoring implementation of the report?  I understand the NDA, when it is up and running, will monitor it but it will not be in a position to do so until next February or March.  It is worrying that almost a year will have passed without an independent body to monitor implementation of the recommendations of the commission.  I hope the Minister of State is not happy with a system whereby one monitors one's own recommendations. If that is the case, there is no guarantee that the recommendations of the commission are being implemented.</P>
      <P>In view of the statement she made, is the Minister of State aware of the disenchantment caused by the slow implementation of those recommendations?  Is she not even a little embarrassed that in the past two weeks the Irish Wheelchair Association protested on the streets of this city and last week 600 people from the national representative council protested outside Buswells claiming their rights?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the very adverse and damaging publicity the Irish Council for People with Disabilities is unfortunately receiving at the moment and of the bad image being presented?  Is she satisfied that the steps she is taking are necessary to ensure we will have a permanent council soon?  When will she report on her investigations and will she publish that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> What difference will the National Disability Authority, on which we will depend to ensure the recommendations of this report are implemented, make?  When will it be set up and when will it meet?  Can the Minister of State assure me she will make adequate funding available to ensure the NDA will be able to act as an independent, efficient and successful monitoring body of the report of the commission?</P>

      <P>I will go through the Deputy's queries on monitoring.  A monitoring committee was set up in my Department to monitor the recommendations of the commission report.  That committee has met on eight different occasions throughout the year and has had a valuable input into what is happening with the interdepartmental task force on the plan of action.  Much has been happening, including information as regards the Employment Equality Act.  Much advice came from the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right to raise the question of what will happen in the future as regards monitoring in this area now that the National Disability Authority has been established.  The role of the National Disability Authority includes monitoring as well as the setting of standards, research and policy.  We have provided ample funding with just over £2 million provided in the 1999 Estimates for the National Disability Authority. The authority had its first meeting in September and although the legislation is due in the House prior to Christmas, the authority continues to meet so as to be ready for its establishment on a firmer footing.</P>
      <P>The existing monitoring committee has done all the work it can in terms of paving the way for the plan of action which will come to us in February. The monitoring committee will meet again when it has a final plan of action but in the meantime, all its work has been done and has been fed to the Department.</P>

      <P>Plans to deal with traffic congestion in the Dublin area during the Christmas period were drawn up following consultations with the various agencies involved in traffic management in Dublin city, including the Garda traffic department, Dublin Castle, the Garda divisional officers for the Dublin area, the <Col N="793" /> Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Public Enterprise, the Dublin Transportation Office, Dublin Bus and the four local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>Operation Freeflow IV will operate from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Saturday, inclusive, from 4 December 1998 to 9 January 1999.  The operation will be city-wide covering both the city centre and the outer suburbs, including 22 main traffic arteries into the city, with special attention being paid to urban villages.  The key elements of this operation in so far as they affect the Garda are as follows: 206 extra gardaí, including 160 probationary gardaí, will be specifically allocated to enforce Operation Freeflow IV; at any time there will be 108 foot patrols; 43 motorcycle units will participate in the operation; Garda towing facilities will be directed at the main approaches to the city, including the outer suburbs; a total of 43 traffic wardens will be utilised by the gardaí throughout the city centre and suburbs; the Garda helicopter unit will be deployed to provide live visual and radio updates to ground traffic units which will help to deal with any serious problems and will enhance point duty management; and key routes in the city and suburbs will be targeted for priority attention and blockages, whether by car, other vehicle or, for example, building skips &mdash; that will be number one objective for the gardaí.</P>
      <P>In addition, the following offences have been targeted for necessary action: box junctions violations; enforcement of the regulations concerning bus lanes and clearways and double-single yellow lines; continuation of tow truck activity and enforcement of loading bay regulations.</P>
      <P>Operation freeflow will encompass high visibility patrolling by mobile Garda resources, particularly motor cycles and foot patrols.  In addition, there will be rigid enforcement of the bus lane and clearway regulations in order to maintain the smooth flow of public transport. There is a system in place which allows for instant communication between the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation traffic control centre and the public utilities which will assist in co-ordinating Operation Freeflow.  I am confident that these measures, with the co-operation of the public, will go a long way towards alleviating traffic congestion in the Dublin area over Christmas.</P>

Have any targets been set in relation to the time it will take this operation to ensure illegally parked cars, skips and so on will be removed?  To what extent will the process extend to urban villages given the restrictions on the number of people employed in it?  Will all urban villages be covered by the initiative at all times during the period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Does the Minister agree that the decision to open bus lanes to motorists last Tuesday gave all the wrong signals and discriminated in an unfair way against bus users?  Does he agree that it would have been desirable to hold the line last Tuesday when the importance of the bus service and bus lanes could have been highlighted so as to illustrate how effective they can be as a way to alleviate traffic chaos, in getting people in and out of the city and in increasing the extent to which buses are used as a mode of transport?</P>

      <P>Special attention will be paid to urban villages.  There are 206 additional personnel to deal with Operation Freeflow this Christmas, some 106 of whom are probationary gardaí but they will have the full powers of a Garda Síochána in the context of Operation Freeflow. It is obviously a problem for anyone commuting in Dublin.  The increasing number of vehicles on the roads into the city is a major part of the problem.  In those circumstances, as Deputy Upton will agree, the Garda Síochána operating Operation Freeflow have a difficult task.  They will pay special attention to urban villages. In addition the co-operation of the public is of crucial importance.  If the public does not co-operate the initiative cannot succeed.</P>
      <P>In relation to advertising Operation Freeflow, the general public has a good idea of its existence. It is not the first occasion it has been operated and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, presided over a very well attended press conference this week, and gave great detail in reply to all questions as did the members of the other agencies in attendance.</P>

It is only a temporary measure and it is an admission of how pathetically inadequate is the public transport system and traffic management in Dublin.  A long-term strategy to end the gridlock which exists all year round and intensifies at Christmas is needed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the park and ride scheme from the RDS to Whitehall from Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. is designed for the urban shopper rather than the urban worker?  To get to the bottom of an ongoing and worsening problem creating gridlock, an overall vision and plan is needed for the regulation of traffic in Dublin to ease the nightmare which driving in the city has become.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins' question comes close to asking for Operation Freeflow all year round.  It is the intention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to devise a long-term plan for traffic management and he is more than capable of answering these matters himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> On the matters raised in relation to my Department and the responsibility of the Garda Síochána it is intended to introduce on-the-spot fines in 1999 for bus lane offences and the Garda will rigorously enforce them.  Other proposals include fines for violations at box junctions.  These issues are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government although the question of enforcement is a matter for the traffic wardens and the Garda Síochána.  The law in this respect will be rigorously enforced all year round.</P>
    <P>The broader question of traffic management in Dublin relates to issues such as bus corridors, Luas and the future expansion of other modes of transport and clearly these matters do not fall within my remit.  The 206 gardaí who will be working on Operation Freeflow this Christmas are dedicated to this cause.  They will be augmented by the Garda helicopter which will be of considerable assistance during the morning and evening rush hours.  The helicopter will identify trouble spots and assist the gardaí on the ground in clearing them.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, I earnestly request that the public co-operate with the initiative.  It cannot succeed unless there is a high level of co-operation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that an advertising campaign would be very effective in conjunction with this initiative?  It could encourage people to pool cars or use public transport.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister discuss with his colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, the possibility of grossly subsidising or even providing free transport on Dublin Bus during December as way of dealing with problems and as a useful experiment to see what the public's response would be to such an initiative?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to an advertising campaign, the Minister, <Col N="796" /> Deputy Dempsey held a successful press conference which was well attended by members of the media and well reported.  An advertising campaign could not add much to the cause but I will mention it to that Minister within whose remit Operation Freeflow falls.</P>
    <P>My Department is involved through the Garda Síochána and its enforcement of the initiative. This operation, however, goes beyond the enforcement issue into the wider context which Deputy Higgins mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>If the initiative for the Christmas period is successful, will it be introduced over the rest of the year?  It is incredible that we could have a solution to traffic congestion at Christmas when it will be so much more severe. If we can do something over the Christmas period, we should be able to do far better for the rest of the year.  After all, the frustration felt by the traveller every day is far greater than that felt by people on a Christmas shopping expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>While in Opposition, I stated on a number of occasions that there were not sufficient numbers of Garda Síochána in the force. That is why we moved to increase the number in the force to 12,000 members.  When I took office there were 10,700 gardaí.  Today there are more than 11,150 members and I hope that number will continue to climb.  We hope to recruit 550 extra gardaí next year.</P>
      <P>I make this point because availability of resources is extremely important in the context of establishing an operation similar to Operation Freeflow on a year round basis.  It is not for the fun of it that we take 160 probationary gardaí from Templemore and put them on to the streets of Dublin.  The reason we do that is that we do not have a sufficient number of gardaí to release from other very important work.  The implementation of a freeflow operation would clearly hinge on the availability of resources.  However, everyone recognises that the problem must be resolved.  In that respect, it is the intention of the Garda Síochána to review Operation Freeflow at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I can give the House astonishing figures on the number of fines and so on imposed throughout the year, which show there has been active enforcement.  For example, in 1997 the Garda issued 70,171 on-the-spot fines for parking offences and traffic wardens issued 239,330 such fines, which compared with 272,641 fines in 1996. Enforcement will be maintained, as far as it is possible to do so, to ensure there is an adequate deterrent for those who breach the traffic laws. Let there be no doubt about it &mdash; people who indiscriminately breach the traffic laws, whether by parking illegally or other such manoeuvres, contribute seriously to gridlock.</P>

      <P>The Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1998, made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government on 14 February 1998, delegated the powers and duties of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform conferred on him by, or under, the Children Acts, 1908 to 1989, to Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Consequent to that delegation, the Minister of State has responsibility for progressing the Children Bill, 1996, through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>On assuming responsibility for the Children Bill earlier this year, the Minister of State initiated a thorough review of its provisions.  He also visited New Zealand in September to study at first hand that country's juvenile justice system, with particular emphasis on its innovative approach to family group conferencing and restorative justice.  Both the review and the study of the New Zealand system will result in many amendments being proposed for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It is hoped that these can be published in time to commence Committee Stage early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a definitive indication of exactly when Committee Stage will be taken?  Why has there been such a delay in taking Committee Stage of the Bill?  Will the Minister assure us that a sufficient number of places will be available for children who are out of control, so that the courts can send them to appropriate centres if that is deemed necessary?  Will the Minister assure us we will no longer have to rely on the Judiciary to create the initiatives in regard to the treatment and management of children with difficulties who are out of control?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to perceived delays, the difficulty is that this is a very large and comprehensive Bill with 230 sections.  The Bill will probably have become larger rather than smaller by the time it is enacted.  The Minister of State has been working very hard since assuming responsibility for this Bill, which he wants to improve and make more relevant, particularly in the area of preventing juvenile offending, or preventing further offending where it has already occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first major review of juvenile justice legislation since the foundation of the State and it is imperative that we get it right.  I was in Opposition when the Bill was introduced and I stated in the House at that time that I believed it required certain substantial amendments, which I clearly still believe.  As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I want to ensure that <Col N="798" /> the amendments which I proposed then are now incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is particularly necessary for us to be definitive, one way or the other, in relation to the age of criminal responsibility.  There is no doubt there is a need for young people to have to face up to their offences.  In this context, the holding of family conferences is of perennial importance.  There are other issues which should be given very careful consideration before this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sufficiency of places, I remind Deputy Upton that the whole question of the detention of children is, in the main, one for the Minister for Education and Science, for fairly obvious reasons.  However, I accept there is a need to ensure we have adequate places for young people and that this should be given priority consideration where deficiencies are identified.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the need for a co-ordinating Minister to ensure responsibility can be identified, which is why the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has been given specific responsibility for the area of children. That is why, for example, he is going to progress the Children Bill, 1996, on Committee Stage. There is now in place a co-ordinating Minister of State who is readily identifiable as having responsibility in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has been working assiduously on the Children Bill, 1996, and on all areas affecting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Apropos that answer to the very worthy suggestion made by Deputy Upton, it is fine to talk about a Minister co-ordinating what is happening at present, but what is <Col N="799" /> needed is one Minister with specific responsibility for this entire area.  For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for St. Patrick's Institution while St. Michael's and some of the other centres come under the control of the Department of Education and Science.  Those who stand most indicted in this regard are the health boards.  With the exception of the Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board, which has six places, none of the other health boards is discharging its responsibility in relation to emotionally disturbed children.</P>
      <P>There is a huge crossover in this area and what is everyone's business is no one's business.  There is not only a need for the Minister of State to coordinate what is happening at present, there is a need to assign specific responsibility, when this Bill is passed, to one Minister who will have overall, ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to juvenile offenders, potential juvenile offenders and emotionally disturbed children.  Unless we go in that direction we will never get to the bottom of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised the matter as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, has established an expert working group to examine certain aspects of the juvenile justice system and in particular to inquire into the increasing number of children appearing before the Children's Court.  The group is examining intervention and prevention strategies, non-custodial options and best practice models in other jurisdictions where community sanctions are in place.  In addition, I understand the working group has commissioned independent research into the profile and number of children coming before the Children's Court and their behavioural patterns.  It is fair to say the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is treating the matter extremely seriously.  He is recognising his co-ordinating role, but has also acted through the working group to obtain the research which is necessary to advance the situation in relation to children's propensity to re-offend and non-custodial sanctions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23, 48 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Child care is clearly a very important issue and I am committed to the development of a national child care infrastructure as an equal opportunities measure in partnership with the EU.</P>
      <P>In July 1997 we established an expert working group on child care to devise a national framework for the development of quality child care services in Ireland.  It is intended that the child care infrastructure which will be recommended by the expert working group will form the basis of demands for EU funding in the context of the next round of Structural Funds.  Membership of the expert working group includes representatives of the relevant Government Departments, statutory bodies, employers, unions, non-governmental organisations, service providers, parents and individuals with expertise and experience in child care.</P>
      <P>The group is considering a range of child care issues all of which contribute to the development of a framework for quality child care, including the financial and employment implications of an integrated approach to the development of a child care framework; registration, training and qualifications; resourcing and sustaining child care in urban disadvantaged areas; equality of access and participation in relation to a national framework; needs and rights of children in relation to a national framework; early childhood education and standards and regulations.  The group is exploring the benefits, limitations and implications of a range of policies bearing in mind the diversity of the needs of parents and child care providers.  I understand it intends to finalise a report and recommendations in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has provided funding to support the development of child care services in disadvantaged areas since 1993.  In July 1998 I announced expenditure of £5.2 million on the equal opportunities child care programme over the 1998-9 period which marks a significant increase in my Department's child care budget. The equal opportunities child care programme is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment.  It is targeted primarily at community based projects in disadvantaged areas.  The programme is part funded by the EU and provides funding for capital infrastructure upgrading, enhancing or establishing facilities; core funding to meet salary costs for child care workers in 25 community child care projects nationwide and funding for an employer <Col N="801" /> demonstration child care initiative which is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in the development of child care services.  In addition, a child care database is being established by my Department in conjunction with Area Development Management Limited to document and quantify the range and extent of child care provision and training being supported under EU funding and to establish baseline data on other facilities and services in child care supported by the State.  The child care database is also part funded by the EU.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that whatever system is introduced it will maintain equality between different income groups and working and non-working parents?  Is he prepared to guarantee the provision of a comprehensive service which will meet the needs of all people irrespective of circumstance or the area in which they live?  Does he agree that introduction of the minimum wage will create some new burdens in terms of finance available and has he measures in mind to cope with this?</P>

      <P>The structure of the labour force has altered dramatically in recent decades. Twenty years ago the number of women in the workforce was extremely low.  This has dramatically and irrevocably changed, with women constituting in excess of 37 per cent of the workforce.  In these circumstances there is a need to follow the equality agenda to its logical conclusion. It is unquestionably true that unless something is done for women in disadvantaged areas they cannot have the kind of equality of opportunity to enter the workforce as women in a more advantaged situation.  The child care programme which I funded in 1998 concentrated very heavily on attempting to bring about equality.  In this context I believe it is necessary to expand the private projects to ensure funding goes to disadvantaged areas and that women who are disadvantaged for one reason or another are not prohibited from entering the labour force because of child minding responsibilities.  We have embarked upon an enlightened path which strikes the correct balance.</P>

After seventeen months will the Minister say where the regulations in relation to child care and cre che facilities are?

Is he aware that we have a major crisis, that work outside the home for women is no longer an option but a necessity in the vast majority of cases?  Is he not aware that women are prevented from working because of a lack of affordable child care facilities?  Surely he is aware that the gap is being filled by up to 30,000 people providing child care facilities in the black economy?  Is there not an urgent need to put properly organised management of child care in place to enable women to go to work, which is not an option for them but a necessity in the vast majority of cases?  Those women are entitled to the mental assurance that their children are in safe custody.</P>

      <P>Child care is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.  However, I will try to answer the Deputy within the confines of the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>An expert working group was established in this area on 18 July 1997 which is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department.  The group commissioned a number of research projects which are quite comprehensive.  In addition, Goodbody Economic Consultants were engaged to carry out a study of the economics of child care following a tendering process.  The objectives of the study included an estimate of the current and likely future needs of children and child care, but the report is not yet to hand.  I am awaiting the expert group's report, as this is clearly not an area where one devises something overnight.  While I recognise the need for an integrated strategy, Deputies will appreciate that I must wait for the report.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the Child Care Act is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.  I am involved with the equality agenda, and I will answer for my own Department in that matter.

      <P>This is a repeat of an earlier question.  What is important in this regard is that we have done a trawl of all Departments regarding the commission's recommendations and we have prepared a first preliminary report as a result of the replies from different Departments. We have also had a costing of the report done, as one of the difficulties was that it was not costed. The final report from the financial consultants charged with costing is due within a matter of days, and the action plan will be out in February.</P>
      <P>The National Disability Authority and the disability support service announcement this year is the engine room of the commission's report and will make the difference for people with disabilities on the equality agenda.  It is important that this is put on a statutory basis.  We are working on the draft Bill for this, which has progressed well.  The National Disability Authority (Establishment) Bill is on target for publication by the end of this session.</P>
      <P>One of the most important decisions the Government has made regarding the commission's recommendations is the move from the health model to the equality model.  Regarding training and employment, Irish people with disabilities used to be trained by the Department of Health, but following the recent announcement they will be trained by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, like everybody else.  This is what Irish people with disabilities have been calling for, equality and mainstreaming. They want their training to be dealt with by the mainstream Government Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, they do not want information for people with disabilities to be segregated.  The National Rehabilitation Board provided a very good service, but it was segregated under the Department of Health.  Part of the Government's mainstreaming announcement is that this should be joined with the National Social Services Board to form one new mainstream information board.</P>
      <P>A lot has happened on the disability front in the past 12 months.  There has been a move from the health aspect of disability to the equality aspect.  That has been the major movement on the commission's report.</P>

      <P>The commission report is now two years old and according to the Minister's statement we will not have an action plan until next February, so the report will be into its third <Col N="804" /> year before we have a plan of action.  Does the Minister of State agree that this is putting the cart before the horse?  Any Minister would prefer to forge ahead with recommendations and would ensure that the plan of action is published before the budget?  If we have the plan of action in February we may have to wait for the 1999 budget before it is put into action.  A lot of paperwork is being done, but are those on the ground getting the services?</P>
      <P>In that regard, is the Minister of State in the wrong Department?  How can the Minister of State achieve equality when she is not in the Department that delivers services in that area?  If she was in the Department delivering that service she could create equality, but she cannot do so without being able to deliver the service?  In her opinion, is the Minister of State in the wrong Department?</P>

      <P>Traditionally the Minister responsible for disability would have been in the Department of Health, but that is the old way of looking at this area.  This Government has taken the route requested by the commission report, that is, to leave behind the old health model and to move towards the equality model.  Those with disabilities are entitled to be dealt with by every Government Department and agency.  When the Taoiseach appointed me to my position that was the clear role he gave me and the equality division of my Department.  Ours is a cross-co-ordinating role across all Departments, so that a disability issue in education would be dealt with by the Minister for Education and Science, as has happened with classroom assistants and resource teachers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs recently made an announcement on aid with appliances, and each Minister is looking at how he or she can work on the disability issue. If we took the route the Deputy suggested we would be going back to the old health model rather than going forward on the equality model, where Irish people with or without a disability are entitled to be treated the same.</P>
      <P>When the former Government tried to bring in a plan of action it faced the difficulty of having the Employment Equality Bill being thrown out by the Supreme Court.  The new Government has had to deal with that Bill by publishing it and bringing it through the Oireachtas.  It was passed in June 1998 and is an important part of the plan of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the plan of action and trawl of recommendations are to be completed by February 1999, a huge amount of work has been done in the meantime, including the costing of all recommendations.  That had not been done when the report was published in November 1996, so we have had financial consultants costing the report.  We have also put in place the major infrastructural changes that will form the engine room of the report, such as the National Disability Authority and the disability support service.  The <Col N="805" /> Employment Equality Act was also passed and signed into law.  It is action every day in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on disability, despite the fact that the plan of action will not be out until February 1999.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Does the Minister of State recall giving a commitment that the personal assistant independent living scheme would be expanded and put on a proper basis and that it would be taken away from the aegis of FÁS?  A cost benefit analysis showed a 100 per cent return from this scheme, and there were no ifs, buts or maybes about the Government's commitment to putting this on a statutory basis, properly funded by central authority.  What has happened to it?</P>

      <P>This is a matter that is equally relevant to the Department of Health and Children, but I am happy to respond to the Deputy's question.  Another report, Towards an Independent Future, published by the previous Government, is also relevant.  It states we should deal with the issue of independent living in the short to medium term through funding through the health boards and in the long-term through the establishment of an independent living fund. The short to medium term period commenced in 1998 when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, allocated additional moneys to the eight health boards to ensure funding for independent living was spread across the geographical base of the country rather than centred in one area.  Committees empowered to determine whether those additional moneys should be spent on respite care, residential care or on the important area of independent living were established in the eight health boards. Last May the Minister for Health and Children addressed the Health Board Association Conference in Wexford on the importance of ensuring that each health board should deal with the independent living issue as this is the first year of delivery on the report, Towards an Independent Future.  We will have to analyse what happened across the eight health boards in the first year of delivering on this report in 1998 and what will happen in 1999 and then examine how we should address this issue.  A key to addressing it is the allocation of additional moneys to the eight health boards and they have been asked to deliver on the area of independent living.  That is what is important.  Addressing this issue is, in many ways, about ensuring those who require a personal assistant are assigned one and it is about development in the area of independent living. We are working to the report, Towards an Independent Future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome.  The creation of a sports council on a statutory basis is important.  Sport plays an ever increasing valued role in the life and development of communities. If we promote sport correctly, it will have a significant impact on the quality of life for all.  Its potential to improve society is enormous.  Sport can provide an environment where physical health can be enhanced as well as catering for the mental well-being of those who participate in and are touched by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we should have a national body to set standards, create a value system and enhance the cause of sport.  It is important that the traditional value of fair play is respected.  We must create an environment where cynicism and gamesmanship along with commercial excess are frowned upon.  Winning at all costs is not the best policy.  What matters is how one plays the game. <Col N="807" /> A sports council could consider how to involve people in sport at all levels and to widen as far as possible the availability of sport to enable everyone to participate in it.</P>
    <P>The potential of sport to encourage young people to focus and to address their lives in a particular way is enormous.  We are all aware that those who are involved in sporting activities are far less likely to become involved in drug abuse, other antisocial behaviour or in lives of crime. The question of drugs in sport is one we must address.  Drugs are a cancer eating away at the heart and fabric of society.  The public must be clear that taking performance enhancing drugs in sport is irresponsible behaviour.  If drugs are tolerated or perceived to be tolerated, that would pose a danger to the value of sport.  Heroes are created and when young people see them felled, they ask questions.  If their role models take drugs to be successful, they would ask themselves if they should also take drugs to achieve success. If drugs are acceptable in sport, they might ask themselves if they are acceptable in daily life. Taking drugs is not acceptable.  The Minister must enforce and promote a drug free culture in every aspect of sport.</P>
    <P>Structures must be immediately put into operational mode with power to insist that the governing bodies of all sports are active in promoting a drugs free culture and financial supports and competent sampling and testing must be operated by the Department.  The Government, through the Departments of Education and Science, and Health and Children must develop comprehensive education programmes to ensure the youth understand and embrace the unacceptability of performance enhancing drugs.  When a coach or any other person provides or encourages taking such substances, they should be banned for life from having any involvement in any sporting body in this country.</P>
    <P>We have seen how people of the calibre of Brian Kerr have impacted in an inspirational way on young people.  That is the type of issue the sports council should examine.  It should examine how people can be enabled to make a positive contribution in a meaningful way which will allow them to touch the lives of those around them.  The capability to develop a positive attitude, sportsmanship, team building and self-confidence in young people is enormous.</P>
    <P>Sport can do so much more than formal education. It can bring people together and make them understand the need for team work, co-operation, setting sights, having targets and scoring goals.  As we face into the next millennium, it will be increasingly important to ensure people are not only trained to work but that training and support is available to them to enable them use their leisure time in a constructive and valuable way.  We all know about contributions towards creating an enhanced society, but it is also important that people should be encouraged to take part in sport not only at a particular stage in <Col N="808" /> their lives but throughout their lives.  It is obvious that those who are involved in sport and in community related activities will be physically healthier than those who are not, and in the long run they will cost the State considerably less.</P>
    <P>It is important that the State recognises and starts to direct sufficient funds towards helping people to promote sport within their communities. Voluntary leaders, who devote so much of their time towards helping young people and trying to make their communities better places, are the unsung heroes.  They are real patriots and contribute to the life blood of society day in and day out for little thanks.  All too often they have to struggle against the odds and are involved not only in training young people and organising events in a particular sport, but in trying to gather a few shillings to develop and improve physical aspects of their clubs, such as club houses, pitches and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider devoting a percentage of revenue each year solely for the promotion of sport.  It is welcome that for the first time a Minister with responsibility for sport sits at Cabinet.  The Minister must use his position in the interest of developing sport in a positive and constructive way to ensure that it flourishes and develops and that the benefits of it are maximised. This Bill is one step along the way.  We need much more proactive development from the Minister.  The Government must contribute in the long run to developing sport of all types in every parish and community, meeting fully the needs of all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cosgrave for sharing his time with me.  Sport occupies a valued and important position in the lives of people.  As we approach the 21st century, the nature and delivery of Irish sport is changing.  There is a need to address the planned and sustainable development of sport for the foreseeable future.  Traditional approaches need to be reappraised in the light of new developments and likely future demands. People take part in sport for many reasons &mdash; competition, fun, social contacts and health and fitness.  The contribution sport makes to the quality of life of people and the economy in general has increased significantly in recent years.  The contribution of all sports organisations and volunteers over the years has formed the back bone of the existing structures in sport.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I extend my deepest sympathy to the wife and family of Noel Carroll, who contributed enormously to Irish sporting life.  He made a fantastic contribution and played a huge role in the visionary document &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland&rdquo;, which forms the back bone of the new innovative policy.  His memory will live on long after the new millennium.  His vision and dedication to youth sports will be a lasting testimony to his great efforts.  Deputy Allen cannot be here today, unfortunately, and he asked me to convey that message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The continuity, progression and effective use of resources are critical success factors in the future development of sport.  The goal is to build an integrated and co-ordinated sports system where sound technical and professional expertise combine with the energy and commitment of volunteers. Volunteers work selflessly and are dedicated, and this has led to our success in sport. Their time and energy has ensured sport has reached its current position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sport in Ireland: 1997-2006 and Beyond&rdquo; is an important document and I am delighted the Minister has taken it on board and put the necessary legislation in place.  It is the most important change for many years and will be recognised as one of the major documents to be introduced in the House by the Minister.  The purpose of the sports strategy is to provide a blueprint for the development of sport and give it an independent status.  It seeks to bring all elements of sport together in a cohesive way for the benefit of all those involved as participants, coaches, leaders and administrators.</P>
    <P>Ireland is extremely lucky that it has fantastic sports people.  Mark Scanlon from Sligo is a world champion who fought through the system.  It is unfortunate to hear of controversy with regard to drugs.  Despite that, 98 per cent of people are in sport for the right reasons.  Mark Scanlon was dedicated, cycling 25 to 30 miles daily.  He did not have a sponsor or somebody to push him, but had the persistence and determination to succeed. While he is now in popular demand with sponsors, it is unfortunate that people have to fight very hard unless they reach his level.  He had little or no support when he was a member of the cycling club in Sligo but once he became world champion people were queuing up to meet him. The Minister should target those who need help as early as possible.  If Mark Scanlon did not have vision and the support of his family to bring him through, he would not be a world champion today.</P>
    <P>Community-based indoor recreation facilities should be developed in identifying priority areas, particularly where existing provision is well below an agreed national average.  Where there is a huge population base, people tend to say it makes sense but it is fairer to spread the development of such facilities.  There is a huge necessity for multipurpose recreational centres.  Priority should be given to the development of new community based sports centres where the opportunity exists to meet the dual demands of providing a school-based sports facility in conjunction with community recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Many hotels have private facilities, which help a great deal in tourism promotion.  Obviously, they are aimed at an elite market but I was in a hotel recently where I was told that only 1 per cent of the clientele use the sports facilities. There are exclusive clubs for members and friends who pay £400 or £500 for membership. The facilities are provided out of their own resources.  However, there is huge scope for <Col N="810" /> developing facilities in schools which cater for the school and the community.  The former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, allocated almost £1 million for a 25 metre swimming pool in Sligo. There is also a sports complex, which is a huge facility, but, as previous speakers indicated, the time has come to invest in sport.  Sport is the greatest facility for our youth.  The dangers of drugs, etc.  are eliminated if people become actively involved at a young age.</P>
    <P>Sports facilities should be provided in the building of community centres where the expressed demand matches the real demand. Sport provides great satisfaction and enjoyment for people of all ages and backgrounds.  It also provides great occasions for celebrating excellence and achievement and enhances the health and well-being of the participants.  These values add enormously to the quality of life of all people and should be proportionately recognised in Government policy, as they are by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The key aspects of strategies for the future should involve sport for young people, which is critically important; recreational and high performance sport; sports facilities and natural resources and training and development.  More young people should be involved in sport at all levels and encouraged to develop a life long interest in playing and enjoying sport.  That is the real challenge.  Funding for the recommendations in the document to which I referred earlier will be critically important.  The national lottery has sales of almost £200 million.  When it was set up its focus was to help sporting activities.  The Minister should seriously examine this organisation.  It is looking seriously at major projects but there are communities with a fantastic ability to raise money and it is amazing what they can do with a small amount.</P>
    <P>High performance athletes and teams should be supported to reach their full potential in national and international sports by providing quality coaching, training, technical support, appropriate competition and facilities.  Our greatest ambassadors are our sports people, who are recognised throughout the world. Ireland has a fantastic image abroad and the return on investment in this area of sport would be quadrupled.  It is necessary to develop a network of trained volunteers and professionals working harmoniously and successfully in all aspects of sport.  New jobs will need to be created which will link closely with the voluntary tradition of sport.</P>
    <P>We have been extraordinarily fortunate to have people who devote weekend after weekend and night after night to sports.  The Minister has a unique opportunity to tap into that energy.  In this era of commercialisation and the ongoing debate about a minimum wage the real heroes are those who coach and line pitches on Saturdays. They should be supported as it would be the best investment.  When we reach the millennium we should have a thriving sporting sector. This new independent statutory group is being set <Col N="811" /> up to regulate the sector.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the nine members he appoints to the board are practitioners who have worked hard in the field and know how difficult sport is. We do not need people to lecture us on sport, we need people with proven track records who have trained early in the morning, started from the bottom up and know what sport needs.  I am sure there are plenty of those people.</P>
    <P>To develop a strong, well co-ordinated sports sector, which maximises national strengths and resources, we should also address the following issues.  We should use the unique characteristics of sport to help overcome the isolating effects of social exclusion.  Many people in excluded communities feel sport is not for them but for the well-heeled, and we must involve everyone. Every child coming through school should have sporting opportunities.  If parents cannot afford to pay for coaching it should be made available, no one should feel excluded.</P>
    <P>Irish women should be encouraged to participate in sport on an equal basis at all levels and age groups &mdash; we have seen how successful they are on the world stage.  We should provide full access to sport on an integrated basis to people with disabilities.  The Minister has been supportive of the Special Olympics and that is also important.</P>
    <P>We should ensure Irish sport is fully involved in European sport and the wider international arena.  There should be no difficulty about funding people who travel to compete in Europe.  If we have people good enough to compete on the European or world stage, money should be made available to them.</P>
    <P>Some £200 million is being raised through the national lottery and the people who contribute to that fund are delighted to know it goes towards sport.  Lottery money also goes towards many other good causes.  When it began in 1987 one of its principal aims was to develop sport in Ireland, but much of its funds have been diverted elsewhere since then and we should consider redirecting them towards sport.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to speak on this issue. I compliment my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Allen, who worked on the visionary document for sporting change in Ireland, and congratulate the Minister for putting the document on a legislative footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for bringing the Bill before us.  The speedy drafting and presentation of the Bill shows the wisdom of the Government's approach to sport in appointing a Minister of Cabinet rank to deal with the sector. Sport has often been the poor relation in the Cabinet room but those days are gone.  I congratulate the Minister for his down to earth and common sense approach to his brief, which has been all the more effective for that.  For a country which prides itself on its involvement in and <Col N="812" /> healthy attitude to sport, the delay in the provision of an Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis is baffling.  The measure introduced by the Minister is not only long overdue but will shepherd sport into the new millennium in a professional and caring way.</P>
      <P>As we have seen in recent years, sport is no longer about athletes, hurlers, footballers, boxers, etc., entering their respective arenas to do battle in a fair but often haphazard fashion.  We have come a long way from the more relaxed era of Olympic heroes like Dr. Pat O'Callaghan and Bob Tisdall, a time when athletes could decide almost at random to compete in a particular discipline at the Olympic Games, with a reasonable prospect of success.  The greats of another era included Mr. Frank Murphy and the late Noel Carroll.  I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Murphy for the first time last night, and he spoke fondly of Noel Carroll.  I extend my sympathy to his widow and family on his untimely passing.  As a young boy I remember him competing over 800 metres on many occasions, invariably coming from the back and winning.  He was an inspiration to me and many others.</P>
      <P>In more recent times sport has been taken out of the hands of the participants and given over to coaches, medical directors and administrators, often to the detriment of the game.  Medals seem to be won in the laboratory rather than on track or in a field.  Worse still, a sad and miserable picture has unfolded of myriad abuses in sport.  The swimming debacle has been exposed to public view after many years behind closed doors, and if I am not going to discuss that area in detail it is only because of legal restraints.  As one who has been involved in one sport or another for most of my life, and who has had responsibility for encouraging young people into sport, I condemn and deplore without reservation the happenings in swimming pools and other club houses and changing rooms.  If the knowledge we have gained, combined with the strength and authority of a statutorily based sports council, can prevent those abuses, that alone would be sufficient reason for setting it up.  There must be a visible and accessible mechanism for protecting the vulnerable in sport.  Knowing what we now know, young people must never again be subjected to abuse of any kind within sport, and they must have the best protection the legal system can extend.</P>
      <P>This year also the scourge of drugs in sport has become a major issue.  Whether the problem is home based or imported from abroad, there must be no hiding place for cheats in sport, and that message must go out loud and clear from this forum.  It is in our hands to restore the innocence of sport and protect it from those who would exploit it solely for financial gain.  It is less than healthy that television companies are almost more powerful than sports governing bodies, as shown by cross-channel events, but it serves to indicate the direction taken by money-based sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> The Bill is not extensive but it need not be &mdash; the less interference from the Legislature the better in this instance.  However, we have a duty to ensure that sport is promoted effectively and administered properly and fairly, that the participants are not exposed to unnecessary risk and that a watchdog is working on behalf of citizens. The Minister has provided adequately for this in the legislation, with the proposed Irish Sports Council filling in the blanks where required.  The functions of the new council, as defined in section 6, are admirable and comprehensive.  Not alone are the broad guidelines indicative of the way people would like to see professional sport develop, and of the safeguards they would like to be applied, but an emphasis is placed on recreational sport also.</P>
    <P>It would be all too easy to see sport merely in terms of high profile professional participants, but it is about more than that.  This has been recognised for decades in Ireland and over the years the &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; concept has taken hold, from the &ldquo;Be Active, Be Alive&rdquo; campaign to the more recent &ldquo;Get Active, Get Alive&rdquo; promotion. These have worked well in their time, and within the constraints of budget and philosophy, but we must now be even more professional.</P>
    <P>Much of the responsibility for the promotion of sport as a pleasant element of everyday life rests with schools and PE teachers.  PE teachers are still not as well regarded as those teaching academic subjects, and it is up to the council to raise further the profile of sport in schools to make it both a desirable activity and a subject on a par with languages and the sciences.  This will not happen overnight but it is necessary and inevitable.</P>
    <P>The value of sport to young people cannot be overstated.  Teachers constantly say that, for students who have little aptitude for academic life, sport can be a lifeline or even the difference between being a well balanced adult or a social misfit.  An investment in sport for those apparently disadvantaged students would pay major dividends in later life, but unfortunately this is rarely recognised at official level.  The members of the new Irish Sports Council would be familiar with that philosophy, but we must also provide the resources to facilitate such an investment.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of sport in schools I congratulate St. Augustine's college, Dungarvan, which has represented Ireland in two successive years and on both occasions has won the European schools competition against some of the more advanced schools in Europe.  This is a splendid achievement which shows some of our sport's potential in the years ahead.  In that college, as in so many others around the country, they know the value of sport in the lives of their students. Let me quote their principal, Fr. Moran:</P>
    <P>I have seen students do well in a variety of sports and disciplines other than the classroom, and I have seen how much it has encouraged their overall performance.  If we can improve the whole person, then we have produced balanced <Col N="814" /> individuals who will be better able to fit in, whatever slot they find in life.</P>
    <P>It is this practical application of sport which will benefit students most in the years ahead.  There is a huge potential for recreational sport and leisure tourism here.  It is an area which should be exploited to the full.  It is capable of giving good employment in a safe, clean and healthy environment. In many instances it is a most desirable area in which to work.</P>
    <P>The potential in the home market is tremendous and there is no doubt that with the perception abroad of Ireland as having a clean environment we could capitalise greatly to the benefit of job seekers and the Exchequer.  I would caution, however, that there are areas of the industry at present where working conditions are less than generous, in some instances downright exploitative, and I find this less than acceptable, particularly where the facilities have been provided with the assistance of public finance.  In this respect the industry will have to get its act together and recognise that it is becoming a major employer with all the responsibility that brings with it.  For the employee attendance is for work, not play, and this should be recognised in remuneration, working conditions, holidays and rostering.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me not to avail of this opportunity to congratulate and thank the very many sports people from the county and city of Waterford who have made their mark both nationally and internationally in the past few years.  Perhaps the first of those in more recent times is the distinguished chief executive officer of the Irish Sports Council, John Treacy, who brought back silver from Los Angeles in one of the most testing and demanding of all events, the Olympic marathon.  His performance that day and the pictures from the streets of Los Angeles will forever live in the memories of all Waterford people, and there can be no more appropriate, more qualified or more effective individual in this country for the office he holds as the chief executive of the Sports Council.  I congratulate him on his achievements in the field, on the strides he has already made in bringing the administration and supervision of sport into the modern era and on the professional and realistic approach he has adopted towards his given task.  He has had much work to do, attitudes to change, and extraordinary difficulties to overcome, and there is much work yet to be done.</P>
    <P>Seán Kelly too has been a major inspiration and a source of pride to all Waterford people.  His work of promoting this country abroad can never be overstated nor fully acknowledged.  Though a shy person by nature, he has been a very effective ambassador abroad.  Where many speak of their contribution, his has been one of action.  In that respect his work in getting the Tour de France to come to Ireland should be acknowledged.  In the light of events after the tour had left our shores it might not be politic to talk too much about it, but let us remember that before the decision was <Col N="815" /> made to bring the tour here all and sundry were clamouring for the event and still are.  It may not have lived up to its reputation as the spectacle it undoubtedly can be, but I am happy that we as a nation got good value for money from the tour.</P>
    <P>As part of our development and maturing as a nation, we need to be able to project ourselves as a competent people capable not only of living in but also of being leaders of a united Europe.  We handled the arrangements for the tour very competently as a value-for-money exercise as regards publicity abroad and the promotion of the country as a tourism destination, and I congratulate all those involved.  We did very well indeed.  The pictures that went abroad could have been seen not only as pretty but also as positive.</P>
    <P>In the matter of drugs in sport, I have no difficulty in condemning such practice wherever it may occur.  It is impractical to expect that during the three days when the event was in Ireland we could have done anything about a problem which had yet to be exposed.  Those who have the tour for four weeks each year and who are closer to it are the ones with most responsibility for policing it, and, of course, the whole commercialism of that and many other sports would benefit from a major study.  I repeat, lest anyone think otherwise, that I see no place for banned drugs in sport and will support all reasonable efforts, like the ones before us today, to control and eliminate them.</P>
    <P>This has been an extraordinary year for Waterford on the Gaelic field, by any standard.  It was the year when Waterford lady footballers dominated their sport, winning all-Ireland honours at three levels, including senior, with a fourth team winning a Munster title for good measure &mdash; I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for bringing that up.  This was a commendable achievement, especially in the light of standards prevailing in the game at the moment.  I was in Croke Park last month to see them win the senior final in a replay against the worthy and gallant Monaghan side.  I was extremely proud to be there, although a little sad when I reflected later that, despite being a regular visitor to the venue since my childhood, this is the first time that I saw a Waterford captain in the person of Siobhán O'Ryan lift a cup aloft in Croke Park.  This was a year when ladies football was unveiled to the public at large.  At last, courtesy of RTE, the Irish public were able to see that ladies football is not just a female version of that which men play but an exciting and, I suggest, a better game in its own right, played by talented, committed and skilful women.  The curtains have been drawn back and under the glare of the national spotlight, ladies' football has experienced a new birth.  I am delighted the Waterford organisation has been a splendid midwife.</P>
    <P>The name of Michael Ryan will be forever etched in the annals of the game as one of the greats of all time.  Through him and national president Noel Murray, together with the effective <Col N="816" /> and extensive administration and coaching team in County Waterford, I extend my congratulations and the good wishes of the people of Waterford to those involved in the sport.</P>
    <P>Hurling too has experienced a resurgence and, even though we came through the senior campaign with no trophies to show for our many outings, there was a new pride in Waterford which extends to all our people regardless of whether they are avid supporters.  That is what sport can do.  This was entertainment at its best, and as the game of hurling is uniquely Irish, the GAA can be proud of having a game which is on a par with or even better than anything offered on our screens today.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the point, but the debate is about sport, and it would be wrong not to acknowledge in full measure all those who have been successful on the sports field in Ireland and abroad, especially those from my own county and city.</P>
    <P>In the fields of athletics, cycling, boxing, show-jumping, soccer, board-sailing, horse racing and many other disciplines, we have produced a host of world class participants.  They have made our people proud, have given splendid performances and have given magnificent entertainment.  This, too, is what sport is about, and it is unnecessary for anybody to consult a dictionary to find that it should be primarily about enjoyment both for those taking part and for those who watch.</P>
    <P>I am pleased too that the Minister has not parted with the responsibility for the allocation of local sports grants to organisations.  There are circumstances where local knowledge is required and where particular local conditions need to be taken into account when allocating grants.  Very often the amounts are not as large as applicant bodies would like, but they fulfil a purpose and serve to affirm the good work which is carried on at local level.</P>
    <P>All in all the Minister has produced a good mix in this Bill.  It is not overly intrusive into sport, yet it provides for official involvement when desirable and required.  It is a significant advance in the development and maturing of sport here and should be supported on that basis alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first express my sympathy to Deirdre Carroll and her family on the death of her husband, Noel.  Noel was an ambassador for sport and for Ireland, and a role model for many people who grew up during his era in sport.  He continued to be involved in sport over the years and he should be acknowledged in this debate today.</P>
      <P>One of my own role models is the current chief executive officer of the Irish Sports Council, John Treacy.  I do not think I will ever forget the day he crossed that line to get the silver medal in the Olympics.  It was a tremendous achievement for this country.  It was something for the young people of that era to look up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> The Irish Sports Council exists to promote and encourage the development of sport here, and I welcome this Bill to set it up on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases where people are adamant that various sports should not be promoted.  Some people say soccer should not be promoted because it is a foreign game.  While those voices are dying out, and the sooner they die out the better, it is vital that all sports irrespective of discipline are promoted.  It is crucial that young and older people are encouraged to take part in sport. Sport should be promoted not only among young people although they make up almost half the population, but also among middle aged and elderly people to keep them active.  It is important to target this area.  Deputy Allen's report, &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland&rdquo;, covered this issue and he said it should be part of any policies that are formed.</P>
    <P>Tourism is related to sport.  Golf is a huge tourism attraction and it also encourages more people to take part in sport.  This area should be used to encourage more senior people into active participation in sport.  Another area is walks, such as the fabulous walk in Arigna which is known as the Miner's Way.  Tourism and the active participation of older people in sport are encouraged at the same time.  The Slí na Sláinte walks operate in a huge number of towns and these also should be actively promoted.  There is a cycle route in my area of south Roscommon.  These areas address tourism and health aspects.</P>
    <P>There are major health implications in relation to sport.  Heart disease is one of the biggest killers in Ireland.  Money to promote sport should be provided not only by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation but also by other Departments. It is vital that they encourage and promote sport because a healthy body is a healthy mind.</P>
    <P>There is a huge problem in relation to funds. The Minister is aware of the issues involved and the lack of funding.  Deputy Perry mentioned national lottery grants.  I am disappointed that the Minister suspended these grants over the past 12 months.  He had a strong case in terms of the need to reassess the system, but it is disappointing that people do not have the opportunity to apply for such grants.  We are waiting since last February for the new application procedure to be announced, which is a long time.  It is crucial that the grants are reinstated but also that they are promoted because many people were unaware that money was available under the last scheme. They were not aware of the time schedule involved or that applications had to be submitted before the beginning of March.  It is difficult to promote sport without this funding which must be targeted at the youth area and sport.</P>
    <P>Many sporting organisations are crying out for funds.  For example, in my county the Elphin day care centre wants to build a gymnasium and it is seeking funds for equipment.  The facility will be available to elderly people who use the day care centre and the community as a whole.  If funds are provided for facilities, it is crucial that they <Col N="818" /> are available to the entire community.  In some cases the Minister of the day will provide money to a particular organisation for a pitch or other facilities but the organisation believes only it can use it.  It should be a condition of funding that the facilities must be made available to the community as a whole.  Another application relates to the girl guides in Roscommon who want to develop a campsite in Castlerea.  This would be a huge tourism asset to a small town such as Castlerea and would bring other guide troops to the area.  This type of development should be targeted.</P>
    <P>A huge and growing problem facing organisations is the lack of parental participation.  I am very involved in the community games organisation and I participated in the games up to relatively recently.  The people involved when I started in community games are still involved today.  There have been very few changes.  People who initially brought along their own children to participate in community games or other sports such as swimming have maintained their involvement, but parents who came along later have not taken up the mantle or carried the flame for other young people.</P>
    <P>The individuals involved will soon be grandparents and their grandchildren will go through the system.  It is unfair that the onus is placed on them.  They know that if they pull out, nobody will fill the vacancies.  This serious problem must be tackled if sport is to be promoted.  The backbone of sporting organisations are the people who run voluntary organisations.  They deserve the utmost respect for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The allegations of abuse are compounding this problem.  The Minister will agree that this only involves a small fraction of the total number of people involved in sporting organisations. However, they hit the headlines and they are the individuals on whom the media focus.  It happens in all professions in life, but it only involves a minority of people.  The onus is on sporting organisations, and will be on the council when it is established, to ensure that regulations and supports are in place to deal with warning signs if they arise.  Proper reporting procedures must be in place.</P>
    <P>It has reached the stage that before volunteers become involved in any sporting organisation, regulations have to be in place to protect them as well as the children.  Many people who would wish to get involved as volunteers are afraid to do so because of allegations that could be made against them.  Nowadays people are conscious of walking down a street and handing a child a sweet.  This is the way society has developed and it discourages people from getting involved in sporting organisations and supporting existing volunteers.</P>
    <P>Regional sports centres are a huge issue in the town of Athlone, which is in my area.  These centres were supposed to be established many years ago and the development of such facilities is vital.  There will not be major facilities in all <Col N="819" /> communities and counties but they should be provided on a regional basis.  However, the sports centre in Athlone has not yet been built.  The issue has been dragged out over many years and there is a need for a certain amount of localised facilities.</P>
    <P>My county of Roscommon is not in a unique position in relation to swimming pools.  I could not avoid mentioning in a debate on sport the three pools in County Roscommon which are located in Roscommon town, Ballaghaderreen and Castlerea.  The Minister is aware of them. Public policy in the UK is that everybody over the age of eight must learn to swim.  Such a policy is needed in Ireland.  I do not need to remind the Minister of an Adjournment debate matter I tabled recently about three young people from County Sligo who died.  A number of them attended the secondary school in Ballaghaderreen. Over £250,000 has been gathered in local fundraising to build a swimming pool, but they cannot get matching funds from the Department. They have given their commitment and put the money up front and yet cannot have a swimming pool.  If those young people had access to a swimming pool when in St. Nathan's College, Ballaghaderreen, we may not have had such a tragedy.  It is said that young and older people are drowning. A priority of every school should be that its pupils learn to swim.</P>
    <P>In the county town of Roscommon there is only one indoor swimming pool.  The Minister is well aware of its condition.  Given that the floor of the swimming pool is cracked and is leaking, the water level is topped up by a running tap.  Sewage is coming back up through the toilets.  Due to a shortage of funds the swimming pool has to close for a number of months.  Every winter the local sub aqua club which does a tremendous job in search and rescue on the River Shannon tries to locate three or four people.  The club which is starved for funding has to bear this additional cost.  During the winter months its members travel 30 miles to Ballinasloe to train.</P>
    <P>The open air swimming pool in Castlerea which is open during the summer months does not have proper changing facilities.  That is the situation in one inland county.  Inland counties should receive priority funding for swimming pools.  Counties Laois and Offaly and other inland counties have serious problems with swimming pools while coastal counties seem to have got the necessary funding.  Swimming pools are not provided where they are needed.  People in the inland counties do not have the opportunity to swim until they go to the sea.  This presents huge risks.</P>
    <P>When established, perhaps the Sports Council will examine the whole area of planning.  That every inch of space is built on in large housing estates without provision being made for sport facilities is a disgrace.  We may talk about housing density but basic facilities such as a football pitch must be planned for initially.  It is difficult to put them in afterwards.  The village of Monksland <Col N="820" /> outside Athlone has no facilities.  Some 1,000 people in the vicinity do not have a community centre, no place in which to hold a meeting, no football pitch.  The county council is the main culprit because it allowed those houses to be built without putting the facilities in place.  I ask the Sports Council to examine this area.  The onus should not be on the State to provide funds for these facilities.  Given that developers are making a killing, they should provide funding for sport and recreation facilities in the communities being developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 240 deaths &mdash; 188 males and 52 females &mdash; from suicide in the first six months of 1998, producing an annualised increase of 20.7 per cent for males and 5.6 per cent for females per 100,000.  The figures show an increase of 20 per cent over the 1997 figures.</P>
      <P>The increasing level of suicide is no longer just a serious issue, it is a crisis and action must be taken.  States other than Ireland have introduced effective suicide prevention programmes.  There is an urgency for the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to follow suit.  We must reduce the level of suicides and ensure that those who feel suicidal have help from State agencies.  This help must be readily and easily contactable, 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 52 weeks per year.  The recommendations of the national task force on suicide are clear and unambiguous.  I recognise that moves have been made by the Department in recent months with regard to setting up various committees and looking at information on the problem. Efforts should be made to reduce the levels of suicide, to raise an awareness of the need to cater for mental and physical health.  I agree the Minister of State present has an interest in this area and I thank him for his support for the work of the Irish Association of Suicidology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more devastating for a family than a death by suicide.  The death of a parent, son or daughter, partner or any other family member or close friend by suicide brings further stress.  Suicides leave the bereaved in a state of shock.  They experience sadness, guilt, anger and disbelief.  Subsequent to the initial shock, the <Col N="821" /> bereaved begin a long period of searching for an explanation for the tragedy.</P>
    <P>Research in the US shows that about half of people affected felt a suicide in the family was a stigma and were unwilling to discuss it with others, least of all with their children.  These individuals experience less relief and sadness but more anger and guilt.  One of the first clinicians to call attention to this problem suggested:</P>
    <P>The person who commits suicide puts his psychological skeleton in the survivor's emotional closet.  He sentenced the survivor to a complex of negative feelings and, most importantly, to obsessing about the reasons for the suicide death.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a terrible act against human nature.  In any attempt to respond to it there must be no hint of acceptability of the act as a means of dealing with any life crisis.</P>
    <P>Last year 433 people in the Republic committed suicide compared to 378 in the previous year &mdash; 355 males compared to 78 females.  The figures today show we are heading for 480 this year, if the trend in the first six months of the year continues. There is a crisis among males between the ages of 15 and 30 given the vast increase in the number of suicides in this age group.</P>
    <P>On several occasions, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, announced psychological services would be available to all primary and post-primary schools but action has not been taken in that area.  Will the Minister inform the House if progress has been made in setting up these services for schools?  This is vital.  Young people must be informed how to deal with deep anxiety and despair and that there are ways of responding and of overcoming it.  A more proactive approach by the Department is necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuing rise in the incidence of suicide is a cause of considerable concern.  The report of the national task force on suicide published earlier this year recommended a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.  Since its publication my Department has been in contact with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Education and Science, and the Environment and Local Government with a view to implementing the recommendations of the task force.  It has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting that the necessary measures be put in place to ensure implementation of the recommendations relating to their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have established a suicide research group which will have an important role in combating the growing incidence of suicide.  The main <Col N="822" /> responsibilities of the group include a review of ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, the coordination of research into suicide and the making of recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards.  My Department is providing the necessary funds to allow this important work to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has made recommendations involving additional restrictions in the sale of paracetamol with additional warnings on packaging and information leaflets.</P>
    <P>The majority of health boards have established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. These will promote positive mental health, provide information on suicide, liaise with the media and provide training for staff in relation to suicide and parasuicide.</P>
    <P>The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups on the issue of suicide has commenced in many health board areas.  Resource officers have been appointed in many health boards with responsibility for implementing recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the objectives of the report of the task force to recommend a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and to further develop the mental health services to tackle this growing tragedy in society.  I will be in contact with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on the educational and psychological service aspects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a medical practitioner, the Minister of State present will have some knowledge of the subject I wish to raise.  The case involves the most extraordinary decision ever made in terms of eligibility for unemployability supplement.  While it is accepted that the individual concerned remains unfit for his original occupation as a labourer due to the loss of four fingers on his right hand, the opinion has been expressed that he is fit for certain types of work which does not require a fine grip.  It appears that the residual functional capacity of his hand has improved since the first medical assessment was made.  I do not know how anybody could come to that conclusion, although the wound has healed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should contact his colleague in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and ask that the matter be looked at again.  It should be acknowledged that the individual concerned was involved in a serious accident and that the limb cannot be replaced.  I have no difficulty with somebody being told that they should look for work, that it would be therapeutic and helpful but it is wrong to reduce their social welfare payments by 50 per cent if they fail to do so.  An employer would be held liable in the event of an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual concerned has no difficulty in looking for work but he should not be forced to do so or have his social welfare payments <Col N="823" /> reduced.  That is unacceptable.  He will attempt to deal with the problem in his own way.  Some people can overcome their disability readily, others cannot.  We should ensure that in such circumstances there are options.  The individual concerned should be encouraged to look for work through which he is able to improve his quality of life and general well-being.  Under no circumstances should the rod of iron be brought down upon him.</P>
    <P>I reject the argument put forward in this case and hope the Minister of State will not say that the Minister has no responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>The matters which are the subject of debate are, as the Deputy is aware, determined by statutorily appointed deciding and appeals officers. The Minister has no function in the adjudication process which by law is initiated by the officers appointed for this purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The person concerned sustained injuries in an occupational accident on 19 June 1995.  He claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of incapacity for work and received payment for the maximum period of 26 weeks up to 16 December 1995.  Thereafter he was paid disability benefit for the 12 months to 14 December 1996 followed by unemployability supplement in respect of his continuing incapacity for work up to 8 October 1998. Unemployability supplement is payable where a person who is incapacitated as a result of an occupational accident or disease does not meet the contribution conditions for continuing payment of disability benefit but is considered to be permanently incapable of work.  For this purpose a person is regarded as permanently incapable of work if they are considered likely to be incapable of work for at least a further six months.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of unemployability supplement, like everybody else in receipt of a payment in respect of incapacity for work, are liable to have their payments reviewed in light of up-to-date medical evidence.  Disallowance of unemployability supplement in this case resulted from a routine examination by a medical assessor who expressed the view that the person concerned was capable of work.  In making this assessment the medical assessor took into account the person's age and the alternative employment opportunities available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the medical assessor's report it was decided by a deciding officer that the person concerned was no longer entitled to payment of unemployability supplement on the grounds that he could no longer be regarded as permanently incapable of work.  An appeal against this decision was recently lodged in the independent appeals office. In the context of preparing the case for appeal, arrangements have been made for a further <Col N="824" /> examination by another medical assessor by my Department on 21 December 1998.  In the process the person's medical condition will be fully reviewed again and he will be afforded the opportunity to present any additional facts or evidence in support of his appeal.</P>
    <P>The person concerned also claimed disability benefit, which is payable in respect of loss of faculty resulting from an occupational accident or disease.  The Department medical assessor considered that he will suffer permanent loss of faculty from his injury.  On the basis of this assessment he was awarded a disablement pension based on 40 per cent loss of faculty.  This is payable for life.</P>
    <P>Following the disallowance of his unemployability supplement the person concerned claimed unemployment assistance and he was awarded payment under that scheme at the rate of £136 per week in respect of himself, one qualified adult and two dependent children.  This is payable in addition to his disablement pension of £37.70 per week.  As soon as a decision has been made on his appeal against disallowance of his unemployability supplement claim he will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter following the reply by the Minister for Education and Science to Parliamentary Question No. 399 of Tuesday, 24 November in my name when I asked him the number of complaints received by his Department over the past 20 years of child abuse in schools at the hands of teachers</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was inadequate.  It stated that the Department does not have details of the number of such allegations.  This is unacceptable and unbelievable.  The reply went on to state: &ldquo;It ensures that allegations which are brought to its attention are reported to the proper statutory authority.&rdquo;  I assume the Minister means the Garda, the divisional inspector and the school authorities.  I hope the Minister of State will elaborate on this in his reply.  I ask the Minister to advise the House the number of allegations reported to his Department and the number of such reports which have been passed on to the Garda Síochána.  Information of this kind is essential to the proper management of our education system.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of a recent criminal court case in my constituency where a former teacher pleaded guilty to multiple charges of abusing pupils at a school and where one of the victims stated that he had reported the matter in writing to the Department of Education in 1982.  It appeared that no action was taken and the teacher against whom the allegations were made continued to teach until 1988.  This is clearly a case of massive systems failure, or worse, no system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could this have happened?  The matter was reported to the school and Church authorities <Col N="825" /> and again, incredibly, no action was taken. This is an appalling state of affairs.  I do not make any charges against the Minister or the Minister of State, but I call on the Minister, whose responsibility is the Department of Education and Science, to investigate this matter without delay by introducing a full and appropriate inquiry into the facts of the case.  In this regard I have written a detailed letter to the Minister outlining the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also satisfy himself that no similar complaints from other parts of the country remain unaddressed.  Further, he might elaborate on the action, if any, taken by the Department in relation to teachers who have been the subject matter of complaints.  Were there any transfers, retirements or resignations?  While I accept the question of the suspension of a teacher is a matter for the management of a school, I urge the Department to adopt a hands-on approach and that the entire matter be reviewed and re-examined as a matter or urgency.  In this regard a Sunday newspaper has reported that nine primary school teachers, including two former Christian Brothers, are currently on full salaries from the Department of Education and Science despite the fact that they are under investigation following allegations of sex abuse.  How were teachers, against whom complaints were made, subsequently given glowing references when transferred to other schools in other parts of the country under circumstances that would lead me to believe there was an element of cover up?</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot stand over a system where complaints were ignored and filed away, where a Garda investigation commenced 30 years ago was suddenly abandoned and where a teacher continued to teach up to the date of his natural retirement and was not brought to justice until a period of ten years had expired after that date. Investigations will never right the wrong inflicted on victims of sexual abuse at the hands of teachers but such an investigation, if implemented and given full force by the Minister, will ensure that such a case cannot happen again. If the Minister does that he will have embarked upon a worthwhile exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no personal knowledge of the case to which the Deputy refers.  I note he has written to the Minister on the matter and I will bring that to his attention as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The role of the Minister and the Department of Education and Science as regards teachers in primary schools relates to recognising persons as teachers, based primarily on their qualifications, and paying teachers.  Neither the Minister nor the Department has a direct role in respect of the conduct of teachers in schools as this is the responsibility in the first instance of the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued guidelines to all primary schools in November 1991 under the title <Col N="826" /> Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Child Abuse and to post primary schools in 1992 under the title Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse.  These guidelines were drawn up in consultation with the education partners.  They cover suspected child abuse, either external or internal to the school.  The guidelines make clear that the role of the school authorities is to ensure that suspicions or allegations should be reported by the chairman, the school manager or the chief executive officer to the health authorities or the gardaí.  The guidelines advise that if there is undisputed evidence that an individual has abused a child the matter must be reported directly to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>My Department does not conduct investigations to establish the veracity or otherwise of allegations of sexual abuse.  As pointed out in our guidelines, this is the responsibility of the health authority and the gardaí.  While my Department does not have details of the number of such allegations, its role is to ensure that allegations which are brought to its attention are reported to the proper statutory authorities.  Such allegations would also be brought to the attention of the managerial authorities of the relevant schools who have responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of the children entrusted to their care.</P>
    <P>In the event of a teacher against whom allegations of abuse are made being suspended by a board of management pending the investigation of the allegations, my Department will give sanction to the board of management for the employment of a substitute teacher.  A working party, representative of the education partners, is currently examining the guidelines issued to schools with a view to ensuring that they remain relevant to the situations faced by teachers in their classrooms.  Representatives of the health board have joined this working party.</P>
    <P>In addition, my officials have held discussions with representatives of the working group to review the child abuse guidelines which have been established by the Department of Health and Children.  It is our intention to issue updated guidelines to schools once the group has completed its final report, which I understand will be due at the end of February 1999.  I am satisfied that this type of close co-operation between the health boards, the partners in education and my Department will assist in safeguarding the well-being of the children in our schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday, 22 April 1998 I raised the need to appoint a shared remedial teacher to the combined schools Gaelscoil O'Doghair, Caisleán Nua, Monagea and Ahalin national schools.  According to the Minister's reply, the matter would be fully considered in the context of the remedial teacher allocation in September. There was understandable bitter disappointment in all these schools when they were not allowed a remedial teacher.  The three schools <Col N="827" /> have a combined co-educational enrolment of more than 400.</P>
      <P>As a result of various tests, it has been determined that an average of 14 per cent of the pupils in each school are in need of remedial teaching. It is estimated that more than 50 pupils are in need.  The three schools are in close proximity to each other and because of that a remedial teacher should be able to function effectively with the minimum of time lost in travelling between the different schools.  There is close co-operation between the schools and, understandably, they are losing pupils because they do not have a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Since 1995 they have been making submissions to the Department of Education and Science. Two of the schools, Monagea and Ahalin national schools, have been requesting a remedial teacher for the past ten years.  Of a total of 146 national schools in County Limerick, 125 or 86 per cent have the services of a remedial teacher and 21 or 14 per cent do not have a service.  Of the 21,428 pupils attending primary schools in County Limerick, 19,937 or 93 per cent have access to a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>It is totally unjust that the other schools, which combine 1,431 or 7 per cent of the total in County Limerick, do not have access to a remedial teacher.  Surely it is grossly unfair that the combined schools of Gaelscoil O'Doghair, Caisleán Nua, Ahalin and Monagea national schools, should be deprived of a remedial teacher.  It is totally unjust that some of those pupils because their schools do not have a remedial teacher will go on to second level at an educational disadvantage. I call on the Minister to rectify this injustice and ensure a remedial teacher is appointed in the next round of appointments of remedial teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been indicated to the House <Col N="828" /> in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently allocated 60 remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998.  There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in national schools.  It is estimated that 91 per cent of primary school pupils attend schools which are served by a remedial teacher. As Deputy Finucane correctly pointed out, of the 146 primary schools in County Limerick, 125 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This means that 93 per cent of primary school pupils in County Limerick have access to a remedial teacher.  The Minister's capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to consider demands for improved services across a wide range of special needs.  Unfortunately, he is not always in a position to meet all these demands.  He has to decide priorities and try to allocate available resource to best effect.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of Gaelscoil O'Doghair, Monagea and Ahalin national schools will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be made.</P>

      <P>The expert group on the probation and welfare service in its first report, published on 2 November 1998, recommended the recruitment of an additional 65 probation and welfare officers and appropriate senior staff and clerical support.</P>
      <P>The actual number of staff serving at present is 189.5. There are 14.5 vacancies at present, nine of which were filled in October by appointing temporary unestablished probation and welfare officers on a contract for six months.  It is hoped to fill the remaining vacancies by the appointment of temporary unestablished probation and welfare service officers between now and early December 1998.  The Civil Service Commission is currently interviewing to enable the permanent positions in the probation and welfare service to be filled in the first half of 1999.  As regards the posts recommended in the expert group's report, my Department has submitted proposals relating to those recommendations to the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>A pilot scheme on the use of audio and audio-video recording of interviews with suspects is ongoing in four selected Garda stations &mdash; Tallaght, the Bridewells in Dublin and Cork, and Portlaoise stations.  These trials are overseen by a steering committee under the chairmanship of Judge Esmond Smyth, President of the Circuit Court, whose task is to evaluate the scheme and report to me on whether an effective and economic basis can be found for a national scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> There are plans to extend the pilot scheme to an additional two Garda stations &mdash; Henry Street, Limerick, and Millstreet, Galway &mdash; in order to increase the quantity of data generated to enable a thorough evaluation of the scheme, and preparations are currently in train for the fitting out and equipping of suitable interview rooms in both stations.</P>
    <P>The availability of a sufficient quantity of qualitative and quantitative data is critical to ensuring that the steering committee can make recommendations on a reliable evidential basis.  Originally and up until February 1997, the pilot trials had been in operation on a non-statutory basis only.  However, due to a low percentage take-up rate of suspects agreeing to have their interviews recorded, the steering committee advised that it would be impossible to reach definitive conclusions, given those circumstances.  As a consequence, and on the basis of a recommendation by the committee, the Criminal Justice, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 were made making it mandatory that interviews in pilot trial stations be recorded, subject to the Garda having discretion to discontinue electronic recording where a suspect objected to continued recording.</P>
    <P>With the regulations now in place for the pilot trial stations, I understand the pilot scheme has begun to produce the data on which a proper evaluation of its operation may be based.  In this regard, the services of a research consultant have been engaged for the purpose of carrying out the necessary statistical analysis of the data emanating from each of the pilot scheme stations.  Unfortunately, because the operation of the trials on a voluntary basis proved unsatisfactory, the time needed to compile data and evaluate results will be greater than originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to attempt to introduce a generalised system for the audio-video recording of interviews before the pilot scheme is brought to a conclusion.  Once the scheme is concluded and the steering committee submits its report to me, I will act with the utmost speed in implementing its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>There were 291 convicted sex offenders in custody in prisons and places of detention as of Friday, 20 November 1998.  Forty two sex offenders were released in 1997 and 81 have been released so far in 1998 on full completion of their sentences.</P>
      <P>There are currently ten offenders undergoing the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison in addition to 42 offenders undergoing one-to-one counselling provided by my Department's clinical psychology service and the probation and welfare service.  Of the 48 offenders who have successfully completed the sex offender treatment programme, 23 were released in 1997 and to date in 1998.  It is understood that a considerable number of those released would also have received one-to-one counselling.</P>
      <P>Offenders who have completed their sentences cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the probation and welfare service.  There are however 96 sex offenders under mandatory supervision by the probation and welfare service on foot of court orders.</P>
      <P>All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are found to be suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the next programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>
      <P>All sex offenders are encouraged to avail of treatment.  They cannot, however, be compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.  One hears suggestions from time to time that all sex offenders should be compelled to avail of treatment and that it is not good enough to confine treatment to those who volunteer.  The professional advice given to me is that while it is valid to encourage offenders to participate, compulsory treatment would not work.  There would be no point &mdash; it would be dangerous &mdash; in giving the impression that an offender about to be released was reasonably safe because he had been forced through a treatment programme.</P>
      <P>I am keen to increase the number of group treatment places available for sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is actively examining the possibility of locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh place of detention.  In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme it is taking some time to put a new programme in place.  Any prisoner currently there may apply to participate in the dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new non-therapeutic programme for <Col N="832" /> offenders, the thinking skills training programme, was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison earlier this year.  A significant number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill have commenced this new programme. A similar programme has also been introduced in Cork Prison.</P>
    <P>The issue of post-release supervision and support of sex offenders was among the matters addressed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published last May.  An analysis of the submissions received on the entirety of the discussion paper is being undertaken in my Department.  Once that analysis has been completed, consideration will be given to the question of the preparation of proposals for legislative change.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned the clinical psychology department at University College Dublin to conduct a detailed evaluation of the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill.  This will take a number of years to complete and should eventually provide empirical data that demonstrates the efficacy of treatment, as measured by reduced recidivism among treated offenders compared to an untreated group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any basis in reality for the suggestion that a legislative logjam has developed in my Department.  On the contrary, any objective analysis would show that my Department in the last 18 months or so has produced an unprecedented amount of legislation on both the criminal and civil sides.  This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that, since my appointment as Minister, 18 Bills for which I had responsibility have been enacted.</P>
      <P>While it is undoubtedly the case that the programme of law reform which I and the Government have set for the Department over the lifetime of the Government is both wide ranging and formidable, all the evidence so far indicates clearly that the programme will be delivered successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the question refers to a Minister with full Cabinet responsibility for law reform, it is the case that I am the Minister with responsibility for the areas of law reform which fall within my Department's remit.  I can safely say that I have delivered on that responsibility.  If the Deputy's question is intended to suggest that this area of law reform might be better advanced by <Col N="834" /> the establishment of a separate Department devoted exclusively to it, experience to date does not provide evidence which would support that proposition.  The amalgamation of the former Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform, and the sharing of resources and expertise which that brought about, have proved beneficial.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House in response to a similar question in October last year, it is in the nature of advancing as comprehensive a legislative programme as that being undertaken in my Department that the Bills in question, having regard to such matters as size, complexity and the need to consult with Departments and interest groups, are at various stages of preparation.  It is inevitable that some Bills can be delivered and processed more quickly than others.  It is also worth mentioning that factors outside the direct control of my Department &mdash; such as the allocation of parliamentary time &mdash; can influence the progress made in relation to particular legislative proposals.  I shall, however, continue to implement the full legislative programme for which I have responsibility as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 35, 135 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1998 my Department sought tenders from persons interested in establishing and maintaining an independent refugee legal service to provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers in connection with their asylum applications.  Five tenders were received and following the detailed evaluation process conducted by officials of my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the UNHCR it was recommended <Col N="835" /> that the tender be abandoned and no contract awarded.  I accepted this recommendation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that agreement has been reached with the Legal Aid Board on arrangements for the provision of a comprehensive legal service for asylum seekers.  The refugee legal service will be independent of the Department and will provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers.  It will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure.</P>
    <P>As part of the service, the board will arrange for translation services to be made available on a contract basis.  In addition, the board will be responsible for managing a documentation facility to provide up-to-date background information on countries of origin.</P>
    <P>The new legal service will be provided based at the one-stop-shop centre for asylum seekers at Lower Mount Street.  It is my intention that it will be available by end February 1999.</P>
    <P>The staff for the service will be provided from the existing staff of the board and new staff to be recruited specially for this service.  I wish to emphasise that replacements for any existing staff transferring to the new service will be in place in law centres before staff are released to take up their new duties in the dedicated centre for the refugee legal service.</P>
    <P>The recruitment process will commence immediately and arrangements have been made for initial training to take place in the new year for all staff involved in the provision of this service. The services provided by the Legal Aid Board will include a substantial element of private practitioner input.</P>
    <P>The refugee legal service will be ring-fenced in terms of funding and resources from the existing law centre service and will not interfere with the existing commitments of the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <Quest>the number of offenders on temporary early release under supervision; the number unsupervised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a total of 426 prisoners on temporary release at unlock on Friday 20 November 1998.  The number of prisoners under supervision by the probation and welfare service while on temporary release can vary from day to day.  I am not, therefore, in a position to give a current figure.  For October, the latest month for which figures are available, there were a total of 69 prisoners on temporary release under supervision by the probation and welfare service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of early temporary release is always subject to conditions.  The vast majority of these prisoners were granted renewable temporary <Col N="836" /> release and, therefore, required to report back to the prison from which they were released weekly.  It is also a condition of renewable temporary release that offenders report to their local Garda station daily.</P>
    <P>The granting of temporary or early release &mdash; called parole in other jurisdictions &mdash; is a feature of prisons systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  Temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</P>
    <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours, for example to attend a funeral; early temporary release which must be renewed weekly or on full temporary release in the last weeks of their sentences.</P>
    <P>In addition, in a substantial number of cases the granting of temporary release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation, in other words, prisoners may be released earlier than planned due to overcrowding.  This has been the case for several years.  It would be wrong to suggest, however, that serious offenders are being released because of accommodation problems and without reference to other criteria.</P>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served, and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration.  The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public.  Persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as sex offences, importation or supply of drugs, armed robbery and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of temporary release except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, 70 spaces have been provided in Limerick Prison with 152 at the new prison in Castlerea.  My Department's prison building programme is on target to make available 995 additional prison places by end 1999.  These additional spaces will help eliminate the problem of overcrowding and thereby tackle the need to grant related temporary release.  The number of offenders on temporary release, taken as a proportion of the total number serving sentences, has already dropped significantly from 19 per cent in November 1997 to 13 per cent in November 1998.</P>

At the same time, work is continuing in the establishment group to put the necessary arrangements in place, in accordance with the Government decision of 27 July 1998, for the transfer of the functions of the National Rehabilitation Board from the Department of Health and Children to each of the Departments concerned under the new arrangements to be introduced in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 46 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Under the British-Irish Agreement the Government has undertaken to further strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction.  In this regard, my Department has been assigned the lead role.  Arising from this, I established a new human rights division with responsibility for formulating proposals in regard to the Government's commitments in the human rights area as enumerated in the section entitled &ldquo;Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity&rdquo; in the agreement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, has been appointed to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place, in this jurisdiction, to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.  This review is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our law is concerned, the matter is to be examined in depth by a small group of experts from the main Departments involved.  In this way it is hoped to examine the range of options that are open to us in this regard, particularly with regard to the legal policy issues and technicalities that inevitably will be involved in this complex area.  I envisage that the work of the group should proceed as a matter of priority.  It will, of course, have to take into account the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution as well as the recommendations of the Constitution Review Group contained in its 1996 report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the establishment of a human rights commission, with a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the proposed human rights commission in Northern Ireland, is continuing.  As indicated <Col N="839" /> in my reply to a question on 20 October 1998, I hope to be in a position to bring heads of a Bill to Government in the near future.  It is my intention to have the Bill published as soon as possible thereafter and to have the commission established in the first half of 1999.  With regard to the matter of a full debate on the Bill, the Deputies will recall my assurance in that regard in my reply on 20 October 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March of this year, I obtained the approval of the Government for the drafting of legislation which will radically reform the law on fraud and dishonesty.  The Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill is currently being drafted and I intend to bring it before the Oireachtas in the first half of 1999.  The Bill will create a new offence of theft to replace the existing common law offence of larceny, numerous statutory offences of larceny and the statutory offences of embezzlement, fraudulent conversion and obtaining by false pretences; create new offences to deal with dishonest behaviour not properly covered by existing legislation; create new offences of forgery to replace the existing law of 1913; create new offences of counterfeiting to replace the existing law of 1861; provide a new power for the Garda Síochána to obtain search warrants for documentary evidence of offences of fraud and dishonesty; contain provisions to enable Ireland to adopt an important EU Convention on Fraud (the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, and three protocols to that convention); and bring together in one consolidated statute the main offences of fraud and dishonesty.</P>
      <P>This Bill will amount to a fundamental root and branch overhaul of the State's fraud laws &mdash; many of which are in place since the beginning of the century.  The Bill, when enacted, will put the criminal justice system in a much stronger position to tackle the issue of white collar crime, with appropriate laws containing severe penalties, including long prison sentences, to back them up. Let there be no doubt about it, this legislation will demonstrate in the strongest possible terms that this Government is not soft on white collar crime.</P>

The refugee legal service will be independent of the Department and will provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers.  It will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure.</P>
      <P>The new legal service will be based at the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; centre for asylum seekers at Lower Mount Street.  It is my intention that it will be available by end February 1999.  The staff for the service will be provided from the existing staff of the board and new staff to be recruited specially for this service.  The recruitment process will commence immediately and arrangements have been made for initial training to take place in the new year for all staff involved in the provision of this service.  The refugee legal service will be ring fenced in terms of funding and resources from the existing law centre service and will not interfere with the existing commitments of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>In relation to the granting of work permits, it must be borne in mind that asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. The Refugee Act, 1996, actually provides that asylum applicants &ldquo;shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of his or her application.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers are people seeking refugee status on the basis that they are escaping from persecution.  Giving applicants early access to employment without establishing whether, in fact, they are escaping persecution, would inevitably <Col N="841" /> involve abuse in that persons who would otherwise be refused permission to enter the State to work and who are in no sense genuine refugees could by-pass the regulatory regime by claiming asylum.  Deputies will agree that we should not, as a matter of policy, facilitate abuse of refugee status.  Allowing asylum seekers to work could also suit traffickers in illegal immigrants because it would create the disposable income from which they, the traffickers, could be paid.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons put forward for allowing asylum seekers to work is the length of time taken to process their applications.  One of the positive aspects of the new procedures for processing asylum claims which have been introduced, including the allocation of increased resources for this work, will be that the processing of applications should be considerably speeded up.  The comparative study between Irish and EU member states refugee legislation is due to be completed by the end of the year.  This study, together with the experience gained in my Department in the operation of the new procedures, will be an important component in the review of the Refugee Act, 1996.  It is intended that the study will be published.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to each member state of the OECD is not readily available, and could only be obtained by the use of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.  I would advise the Deputy, however, that there are difficulties in making precise comparisons between countries because of differing legal systems, traditions, definitions, reporting and recording practices. These factors combine to influence the situation. Statistics for the USA and EU member states are, however, contained at pages 43 and 44 of the annual report of An Garda Síochána for 1997, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  It is apparent from the data that Ireland's position compares very favourably with our European partners, and that our crime rates are significantly below those in the USA.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 31 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> Earlier this year I appointed an expert group under the distinguished chairmanship of Mr. Eamon Leahy, S.C., to consider changes in the criminal law recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána with particular reference to the constitutional and European Convention on Human Rights implications and having regard to the critical balance referred to in the report between the rights of the individual and that of the common good.  The group's report was submitted to me last July and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the group for the excellent work which they have done.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I submitted the text of the report to Government asking it to note it and indicating my intention to submit legislative proposals in relation to the matters contained in the report as soon as possible when my consideration of the report was completed.  Obviously in advance of that process I cannot give the House details of the precise approach which the Government will take to these matters.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I arranged for a copy of the report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas together with a summary, prepared in my Department, of the recommendations which it contains. I also arranged to provide copies of this documentation to the Opposition spokespersons on Justice as well as other Deputies who have put questions down about this matter in recent days. The report was also circulated to the media and copies of it are available from my Department.  It is also being placed on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>While it is the case that I will accord priority to the drafting of legislative proposals arising from the report, the House will appreciate that this represents just one component of the major programme of law reform which is under way in my Department at present.  In these circumstances there is no question of this proposed measure having adverse implications for the Human Rights Commission Bill or, <i>vice-versa.</i></P>
    <P>I might mention also that while it is the case, particularly as a result of the policies which the Government has been successfully pursuing, that the crime rate is falling, there are clearly no grounds for complacency in this regard.  In this context I can assure the House that the Government will continue to bring forward legislative measures which it regards as balanced and appropriate in the fight against crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994, a pilot childcare initiative was designed and was continued in each subsequent year, up to and including 1997.  The initiative was intended to assist projects for the establishment, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to undertake education, training, re-training and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do, in the absence of a childcare facility. It was a condition of the initiative that grants were confined to groups in disadvantaged areas which were defined as those areas in which there were area based partnerships-local community groups.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot childcare initiative at the end of the first two years of its operation, 1994 and 1995, showed that, <i>inter alia</i>, the initiative was instrumental in bringing about a radical transformation in the childcare projects which benefited from its funding and in the related communities. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I sought and obtained Government approval for the conversion of the pilot childcare initiative into an equal opportunity childcare programme. This programme is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have childcare responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment.  It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those in low pay who cannot access training, education and employment opportunities due to lack of affordable good quality childcare.  In July of this year I announced expenditure of £5.2 million on this programme, including EU funding, over the 1998-99 period.</P>
      <P>This funding is being provided to the following three initiatives:</P>
      <P>Capital Infrastructure</P>
      <P>Money is being targeted at community childcare projects to enable them to upgrade/enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need childcare while they are at work or availing of training (90 community projects in receipt of funding).</P>
      <P>Core Funding</P>
      <P>This fund is being used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for full-time senior childcare works in community childcare projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage (25 flagship projects in receipt of funding).</P>
      <P>Employer Demonstration Childcare Initiative</P>
      <P>This is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity childcare facilities (21 companies, forming eight consortiums, in receipt of funding).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU element of the funding is 1 million ECUs with the decision in principle to provide a further <Col N="845" /> 1 million ECUs.  A list of the projects being funded under the equal opportunities childcare programme will be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>A childcare database is being established by my Department in conjunction with Area Development Management Limited to document and quantify the range and extent of childcare provision and training being supported under the community support framework &mdash; EU Regional and Social Funds &mdash; and to establish baseline data on other facilities-services in childcare being supported by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that I am fully committed to many of the concepts of restorative justice and measures as alternatives to custody in cases where the court decides that a sentence of imprisonment is not appropriate. New Zealand has been for a few decades to the forefront in the development of a restorative philosophy for youthful offenders under 17 years of age.  The Families Act, 1989 involves the holding of a family group conference to which offenders and their families, victims and their supporters, the police and other specialists are invited to participate. Guided by a mediator, an apology is sought from the offender and time given to hear explanations as to the reasons for the offence and the effects it had on the victims, and what reparations would be undertaken to repair the damage done.  Consensus is sought and recommendations are made to the Youth Court.  If all the conditions of the recommendations are completed within a stated time, no conviction is recorded.</P>
      <P>The juvenile liaison office scheme operated by the Garda Síochána embraces some of the key principles of restorative justice and this will be enhanced if the Children Bill becomes law.  There will be a section in the Bill which will extend the family conference to the courts with features similar to the position in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Mediation is very much part of the concept of restorative justice, and the probation and welfare service will shortly be putting proposals to my Department on the establishment of a mediation programme.  Discussions are ongoing with the Tallaght mediation service and the local District Court judge is receptive to the concept.  It should also be noted that community service has elements of restorative justice in the community and to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dissatisfaction with the existing system and the lack of concern for crime victims in a number of countries, prompted the search for alternative models of justice.  The restorative model which has emerged appears to resolve these issues using <Col N="846" /> techniques which centrally involve the victim and the community.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Irish Penal Trust and Extern Northern Ireland have received funding from the Combat Poverty Agency with a view to establishing a restorative justice network in Ireland.  They propose to jointly host a conference in Dublin in April, 1999.  Also, the working group on a courts commission in its fifth report regarding the drug courts has recommended the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences, is a key feature of the Government's programme to combat the drugs problem.  The goals of the drug courts would include: to reduce drug usage among defendants; to increase community functioning of the participants e.g., training, employment, birth of drug free babies, more effectively than the traditional adjudication process; to reduce recidivism; to reduce social disfunction; to reduce the overall cost to the State of the individuals; and to reduce the cost to the State of the prison service. The Government is fully committed to progressing the implementation of the drug courts pilot project in the District Court.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of alternatives to custody already in place.  On average, on a daily basis, there are approximately 4,400 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. One alternative to custody is community service. In 1997, over 1,100 offenders were required to perform community service by the Courts.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983 has been in operation since 5 December 1984.  It provides criminal courts with this additional sanction which they may apply in appropriate cases, that is, where a person is convicted of an offence for which the court considers that the appropriate penalty would be a custodial sentence, excluding offences where the penalty is fixed by law, such as murder.</P>
    <P>A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision.  This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision.  Participants on supervision orders from the courts may be referred to this scheme in place of a substantial custodial sentence &mdash; two years or more.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's policy to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment and towards this end funding is provided to over 40 hostels, day-centres and workshops in various parts of the country.  These projects are operated by a number of voluntary, community and business groups in association with the probation and welfare service and are working to intervene with young people at risk of offending and to reduce re-offending among those who already are involved with criminal behaviour and on supervision to the service.  The financial assistance available to these bodies in 1997 was £4.2 million. <Col N="847" /> The 1998 budget allocation is £5.06 million for current plus capital costs.</P>
    <P>In November 1997, I approved the establishment of an expert group to examine the probation and welfare service.  The group has submitted its first report which I have recently published.  I agree with the group's &ldquo;belief that there is significant scope for strengthening the existing non-custodial sanctions available to courts to increase their options when determining the appropriate penalty for offenders who do not present a serious threat to the safety of the community and who do not need to be committed to custody to protect the community&rdquo;.  The group will be setting out the factors which should be changed to bring about a new improved service in its next report which I expect to have in the first half of 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, there is a total of 2,793 prison places available in the State, this represents approximately 77 places per 100,000 head of population.  It should, however, be understood that the above stated number of places includes a significant number arising from &lsquo;doubling up&rsquo; of single cells, a practice which cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>In the period since I took up office, the Government approved prisons building programme in place at my Department has already produced an additional 212 places at Castlerea and Limerick prisons.  That building programme is on target to complete a further 480 places by early next year at the new remand prison at Cloverhill and the new Women's Prison beside Mountjoy, and, thereafter, before the end of 1999, an additional 515 places at the new Midlands Prison, Portlaoise.  Thus, a total of 995 new prison places will be completed between now and the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the inevitable loss of existing places arising from reduction of doubling up in our prisons and from the closure of some cell accommodation for a major refurbishment-modernisation project commencing at Mountjoy Prison in 1999, it is projected that a total of approximately 3,500 prison places will be available for use at the end of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's request for comparative statistics for other States, I am informed that OECD does not compile such statistics. However, comparative statistics for prisoner numbers per head of population are available from the Council of Europe.  I will arrange to forward <Col N="848" /> a copy of the Council's most recent statistics (1996) to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in answer to Question No. 256 on the 11th of this month, the Garda authorities have informed me that the conduct of formal identification parades was the subject of a review by them with the DPP recently.  The procedure was updated to allow a witness to identify a suspect by means of pointing to the suspect's position in the parade and stating his or her position or stating the number which has been assigned to the suspect.  It is no longer necessary for a witness to approach and place his or her hand on the suspect's shoulder.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the revised procedure does not provide for identification to be made through two-way mirrors and, accordingly, there are no plans for their introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 41, 56, 62 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.  I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase, notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources to the board.  I will have circulated with the Official Report a table showing the waiting times and number of applicants for legal services, that is, legal aid and advice, at the board's law centres as at the end of October 1998.</P>
      <P>The increase in waiting times at the board's law centres is attributable to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  In the calendar year of 1997, the Legal Aid Board provided legal services to 13,805 people.  In that year the number of legally aided cases, that is, cases requiring representation in court, increased from 4,460 to 6,021, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year.  This was the seventh successive year in which there was an increase in the level of service provided by the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>The number of people awaiting the services of the Legal Aid Board as of the 31 October 1998 is 4,338, while the number who sought the services of the board during the period 1 January to 31 October 1998 was 10,127.  This figure included 1,659 people who were given priority status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1 January to 31 October 1998, 7,530 people were offered first appointments with a solicitor by the board, while in the same period 2,343 people were issued with legal aid certificates for cases other than District Court ones.  Information on District Court cases is collated annually by the board when preparing statistical returns for the board's annual report and, therefore, is not available in respect of the period to date in 1998.  However, in 1997, the latest period <Col N="850" /> for which these returns are available, 3,176 people were issued with legal aid certificates for District Court actions.</P>
    <P>Information is not available to the board concerning the number of active cases being dealt with in its law centres this year to date and an analysis of these figures to provide the requested breakdown would require the allocation of a disproportionate amount of the board's administrative resources.</P>
    <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and when, for whatever reason, they become excessive, appropriate remedial action is taken where possible.  The board has a number of vacancies for solicitor staff.  A competition for the recruitment of solicitors for its law centres was held recently by the Legal Aid Board and some appointments have already been made.  Further solicitor appointments will be made as the successful candidates become available.</P>
    <P>On 25 June 1998 when responding to a Priority Question by Deputy O'Sullivan concerning waiting times I said that I was optimistic that further resources would be secured for the Legal Aid Board to enable it to respond to the ever increasing demands on its services.  Subsequently, in July 1998 I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board.  Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for the law centres to help deal with the extended waiting lists at some of the law centres.  In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff in the law centres, three relief solicitors and three clerical officers, and the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.  The new solicitor posts will be allocated to the board's law centres at Cork, Pope's Quay; Cork, South Mall; Galway; Wicklow; and Sligo.</P>
    <P>The board is independent in the exercise of its functions and, therefore, is responsible for determining policy in relation to processing of applications, waiting and consultation time. Nonetheless, at all times I have been determined to ensure that the Legal Aid Board has the capacity to respond quickly to meet particular needs.  In this regard I am happy to say that the board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction.  A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis. For example, 148 of the 729 appointments offered in law centres in October 1998 were for priority matters.  None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the additional financial resources allocated to the board for 1999, together with the additional staff being recruited by the Legal Aid Board will impact significantly on waiting times at the board's law centres.  I will, however, continue to monitor the waiting times at the law centres and at all times provide assistance to the board in fulfilling its mandate subject to budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware from previous statements in this House that amendments to the licensing laws are being considered in my Department. This follows the publication of the report of 18 June 1988 on liquor licensing laws by the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, and the subsequent invitation, by way of advertisements placed by my Department in the national and local press on 4 August 1998, for comments on the report.  The closing date for such contributions was 30 September 1998.  In excess of 60 submissions have been received and these are in the course of being examined as part of the consultative process which I engaged in, with a view <Col N="852" /> to a careful and in-depth examination of the question of amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the subsequent interim study on the liquor licensing laws published by the Competition Authority in September has provided further significant commentary on our existing laws.  The recommendations contained in that report are also receiving attention in my Department.</P>
    <P>My officials are proceeding with examination of the question of legislative proposals.  It is my intention to bring forward proposals for the Government's consideration in the early part of the new year.  In this context, however, it is worthy to note that the Oireachtas committee saw no necessity to recommend any changes in the existing provisions covering the Christmas period. The details of any decisions made will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused.  Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties.  While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand that they hold similar meetings.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £50,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training.  I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission. Action has already been taken on a number of its recommendations &mdash; for example, the Criminal Law Act, 1997, abolished the penalties of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour.  The Law Reform Commission report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  Other recommendations contained in the report are being considered at present.  Any proposals which may emerge from this examination will be announced in the usual way.  Finally, the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among members of the Commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report, which <Col N="854" /> tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Commission on the Family proposed the introduction of an early years opportunities subsidy which aims to make quality pre-school services accessible to children from age three to school age at a cost of £1,000 per child.</P>
      <P>This is a very general recommendation and would need detailed analysis in relation to how such a scheme could be implemented.  It also relies on sufficient availability of pre-school places in quality childcare services.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of childcare services in Ireland.  In July of this year I announced a substantial increase in my Department's budget for the equal opportunities childcare programme.  A budget of £5.2 million has been secured for the 1998-99 period, which includes part-funding from the EU.</P>
      <P>This programme includes funding support for the establishment and development of childcare facilities and funding to 25 community based childcare facilities for the purpose of engaging qualified and trained personnel in order to improve the quality and sustainability of the projects.</P>
      <P>We also established the expert working group on childcare in July 1997, to devise a national framework for the development of quality childcare services in Ireland.  This group is considering the benefits, limitations and implications of a range of policies which would support the demand and supply sides of childcare bearing in mind the diversity of the needs of parents and childcare providers.</P>
      <P>A copy of the executive summary of the report of the Commission on the Family has been circulated to the members of the group.</P>

      <P>The operation of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board is governed by the Garda Siochana (Complaints) Act, 1986, which also provides for the board to keep under review the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and for the reporting <Col N="855" /> to myself on these matters every three years.  The last such triennial report proposed certain changes which should, in the opinion of the board, be made to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.  These proposals are of both a procedural and legislative nature, and further details may be found in the report itself, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Also, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment &mdash; the CPT &mdash; in a 1994 report to the Government on its visit to Ireland in 1993, made certain recommendations in relation to the composition of the complaints board and of the tribunals appointed by it.</P>
      <P>A review of the complaints Act is ongoing on foot of these recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May 1997.  It gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution which provides for the refusal of bail in certain circumstances.  Section 13 of the Bail Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the full implementation of the Bail Act is not yet possible because existing <Col N="856" /> prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all members of the House would agree that we need to avoid a situation, where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.  I have also indicated to the House that I am keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present and in particular the provision of a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield which is expected to be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>As a result of the continuous review to which I have already referred the provisions of the Act have been implemented in part.  Thus section 10 of the Act was brought into operation with effect from 2 June 1998.  That section amends section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 4 of the Act, which deal with the power of the court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person, were brought into operation with effect from 4 September 1998 in respect of persons appearing before the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>As to the full implementation of the Act, I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing it into operation generally as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 51, 65 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women estimated that in 1992, 17 per cent of ministerial-Government appointments to State <Col N="857" /> boards were women and 15 per cent of overall appointments were women.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision in March 1993 in relation to minimum representation of 40 per cent of both sexes on State boards my Department undertook to monitor the position of women on State boards on a quarterly basis</P>
    <P>At 1 June 1997, women constituted 28 per cent of total membership and 36 per cent of ministerial-Government nominees on State boards At end September 1998, women constituted 28.1 per cent of total membership of State boards and 34.4 per cent of ministerial-Government nominees.  Tabular statements showing the breakdown of membership of boards in each Department follow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> I intend to continue the policy objective of gender balance on State boards, with a minimum target of 40 per cent of women and men in direct appointments.  I will also continue to encourage nominating bodies to adopt a similar policy.  It is also Government policy that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies.</P>
    <P>Given the improvement in women's representation from 15 per cent and 17 per cent in 1992 to the current figures of 28 per cent and 34.4 per cent, I do not see any necessity to introduce legislation at this stage.  Each Minister is responsible for implementation of the Governments gender balance policy in his or her own area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The question of separate legal representation for complainants in rape cases is one of the issues addressed in the Discussion Paper on the Law on Sexual Offences which I published in May of this year.  An analysis of the submissions received on the entirety of the discussion paper is currently being undertaken in my Department.  Once that analysis has been completed the question of the preparation of proposals for any changes to the law on sexual offences that are identified will arise.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month the authors of the study entitled The Legal Process and Victims of Rape formally requested that their study be considered by my Department as constituting a submission on the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  The study is being dealt with on that basis.</P>

      <P>Records are not maintained in a way which would allow the provision of the information sought by the Deputy.  The indications from an expert sociological study conducted in 1996 on the Mountjoy Prison population is that the rate of recidivism amongst our prisoners is high.  The study showed, for example, that about 77 per cent of the prisoner sample profiled had previously served a custodial sentence.</P>
      <P>Following contact with the OECD and the Council of Europe I have been informed that such information is not available from them in relation to member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recidivism is a recognised phenomenon in modern society in Ireland and throughout the <Col N="861" /> world.  It is very much associated with dysfunctional personalities &mdash; substance abusers, homeless persons and persons with a disordered social background.  Recidivism is also, of course, associated with so-called professional criminals such as bank robbers and fraudsters who commit crime as a way of life and seem quite prepared to accept the associated risks of detection and punishment.</P>
    <P>Measures which are in place to address recidivism include the provision of a wide range of training and educational facilities relating to both academic and practical and vocational subjects where inmates are concerned and the availability of non-custodial options, particularly for potential young offenders through the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The juvenile liaison officer scheme has been particularly successful, with a four fold increase in the numbers cautioned over the last six years.  More importantly, 89 per cent of these have not re-offended within their two year supervisory period.</P>
    <P>The courts are, in addition, increasingly availing of alternatives to custody such a community service orders and probation.  Both of these options involve a substantial commitment from the probation and welfare service, which operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>One must be cautious when comparing the success from a recidivism point of view of non-custodial options with prison.  It is obvious that individuals least likely to re-offend will benefit from a non-custodial approach whether it is through the JLO scheme or by way of probation or community service order.  It should not be a surprise, therefore, that those who continue to offend notwithstanding the use of non-custodial sanctions will end up being committed to prison by the courts.  The expert sociological study referred to earlier showed that 78 per cent of the sample of prisoners in Mountjoy received a non-custodial sanction on their first conviction, while 25 per cent of the sample benefited from four or more alternative sanctions.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that recidivism is likely to remain a feature of behaviour amongst those inclined towards criminal activity but I am committed to take any action necessary in order to minimise its impact both on the individuals concerned and on society as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 152, 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>As I have said on many occasions in the past, I believe that the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation. To this end, as the Deputy will be aware, there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.  Not all of our penal institutions have a significant drugs problem.  The majority of offenders with such problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>Treatment for drug addicted prisoners is currently available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation is supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling.  It is however unfortunately the case that many offenders refuse to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.</P>
      <P>During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison received the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.</P>
      <P>More intensive treatment is available at the drug treatment unit which has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's Health Care Unit since July 1996.  The unit is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  One hundred and fifty six inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit since it opened.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the unit.  Individual counselling is also available on request from the probation service and voluntary organisations such as Anna Liffey, Coolmine Therapeutic Community and the Merchant's Quay Project who visit the prison regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of options available where <Col N="863" /> inmates have completed the detoxification programme in the drug treatment unit.  They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population; if they are considered suitable they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they may transfer to the drug free unit at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy Prison.  This unit provides a sympathetic, yet closely monitored setting in which those prisoners who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug-free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs.  The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.</P>
    <P>The drug treatment unit has proven to be a success. The successful completion rate of the programme during the first twelve months of operation was 98 per cent.  Of the 88 patients accepted into the programme in the first year, 36 had returned to drug use at the time of the review.  A review of the first two years of its operation has proven that prisoners who are motivated and who are given an opportunity to engage in a structured detox and rehabilitation programme and whose environment is made drug free through strict regulation of visits will successfully stay off illicit drugs.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to ascertain the number of addicts who continue treatment on their release from prison, although, as I have already said, many are referred on to community based courses on release.</P>
    <P>I accept that the number of places available in dedicated drug treatment facilities in our prisons is insufficient.  It is my intention to have a medical treatment programme and a secure drug free unit in every closed institution where it is considered necessary, as soon as this is possible.  My Department has an agreed policy on substance abuse with the Eastern Health Board.  A plan is being drawn up at present to implement this policy.  In addition to examining the feasibility of providing a drug free area in each prison and increased detoxification facilities, it is intended to consider the development of further educational and training courses suitable for addicts and which could be devised in conjunction with an aftercare programme. Progress in developing drug treatment programmes and drug free areas is greatly hampered by overcrowding in the committal prisons. However, this obstacle will be removed as the prison building programme progresses.  The opening of the new women's prison at Mountjoy, a new male remand centre at Cloverhill and a new male prison in Portlaoise in 1999 will help alleviate this problem.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission has presented its fifth report on the establishment of drugs courts.  It is expected that the establishment of drugs courts will lead to a reduction in <Col N="864" /> the number of treatment places needed in prisons as drug abusing offenders convicted for minor offences may be steered towards non-prison treatment options rather than be committed to prison in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to both the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual inmates who have the motivation to deal with their addiction. I recognise, however, that more needs to be done and, as I have indicated, I am currently examining options to improve the level of services available to drug addicted offenders.</P>

      <P>During the period 1 January to 30 September 1997, my Department provided financial assistance to the Irish Refugee Council for a legal project which provided advice to asylum seekers at the first stage of the asylum process. The Irish Refugee Council withdrew from the scheme with effect from the 1 October 1997.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Irish Refugee Council has appointed an independent consultant to carry out a strategy review of the council and to identify the unique focus which is appropriate to its future work.  I further understand that the Irish Refugee Council hopes to have the full report by the end of the month.</P>
      <P>An application for funding based on the preliminary findings of the review has been submitted to my Department.  However, having regard to the extremely preliminary nature of the findings, I think it would be premature to consider the application pending completion of that review.</P>
      <P>A total of 12 failed asylum seekers have been deported between January and end October 1998. In addition, 22 persons have been removed under the Dublin Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refugee legal service will provide a comprehensive legal service, including legal advice <Col N="865" /> and legal aid, for asylum seekers.  The new legal services will also be available in the courts in relation to asylum applications and other matters.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a disciplinary investigation in the case in question, under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, is nearing completion. When the report is available, it will be submitted to the Garda authorities for consideration of the appropriate action to be taken.</P>
      <P>So far as the introduction of non-statutory guidelines on sentencing is concerned, the House will, of course, be aware that the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>This year, I made £50,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training.  I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.  In addition, I understand that the benches of the various courts hold meetings to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties.</P>
      <P>I might also say that under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused.  Our system of recruitment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission. Action has already been taken on a number of its recommendations &mdash; for example, the Criminal Law Act, 1997, abolished the penalties of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour.  The Law Reform Commission report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  Other recommendations contained in the report are being considered at present.  Any proposals which may emerge from this examination will be announced in the usual way.  Finally, the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the Prison Service cost review team are as recommended in the report of the Prison Service operating cost review group, that is &ldquo;that a staffing review project be initiated and a small team of practitioners recruited to undertake an assessment of the man-hours to deliver the agreed regime activities and services and to recommend associated systems of attendance and deployment practices&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The objective of the project, in accordance with the terms of reference, is to assess the current staffing and operational procedures of the various institutions and the Prison Service as a whole and to make general and specific recommendations as to how the work of the service might be carried out in a more effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The team is in a training phase.  The report of the team will, in fact, consist of up to 18 reports on individual institutions facilities and an overall Prison Service report.  The projected timescale for the entire assessment is in the region of 12 months but, given the size of the task, this will become clearer as the actual assessment phase progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of overtime earned by the officer referred to by the Deputy equates to approximately 36 basic hours extra per week.

    <P>Other steps currently being taken to address costs in the prison system, especially overtime, include the examination of ways of reducing the incidence of escorts to court, the implementation of cost-saving measures under the PCW agreement, implementation of IT systems which will support control of costs, the reduction in the level of sick leave and the allocation of overtime budgets to governors.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the increase in sexual assaults and it concerns me greatly, especially when the crime trend is, in general, in a downward direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is addressing the issue of violence against women through the establishment of the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department.  The committee is looking at ways of providing a multi-disciplinary response to victims of all forms of violence which will include rape and sexual assault.  The steering committee has established regional committees in each of the eight health board areas.  The committees are facilitating greater communication and co-operation <Col N="870" /> between the service providers and I am confident they will lead to the development of a more comprehensive service and a better response to victims of sexual crime.</P>
    <P>The national steering committee is currently working on the development of an overall publicity strategy with a view to generating a structured debate on the subject of violence against women, in all its forms.  The primary aim of the campaign will be to generate debate in a range of media which would reach all strata of society.  A secondary aim of the campaign will be to inform and help shape the next phase of the publicity process which will include an advertising campaign in early 1999.  It is also proposed to have some attitudinal surveys on violence against women between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am confident the work of the national steering committee will educate people about the extent of the problem and will inform perpetrators that society abhors violence against women and that there is no acceptable level of violence against women.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I published a discussion document on the law on sexual offences, the issues identified in which are some of the most complex and sensitive public policy issues facing Irish society as we head into the next century.  They include the law relating to the protection of women and children from sexual offences.</P>

      <P>The job initiative is a pilot programme designed to provide temporary full-time jobs for persons who have been unemployed for five years or more and who, in consequence, experience particular difficulty in obtaining a job in the open labour market.  There are, at present, 2000 places on the programme.</P>
      <P>Job initiative workers are paid a rate for the job.  They have the same conditions in terms of holidays, sick leave, grievance/disciplinary procedures and taxation as in an open labour market job.</P>
      <P>Like employees in the open labour market, they keep an entitlement to a medical card for three years and are also eligible to qualify for family income supplement.  As the rate of pay of job initiative workers varies from job to job and the question of a Christmas bonus does not arise, the resources required to collate the projected cost of providing a Christmas bonus cannot be justified.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the retention of secondary benefits on FÁS training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retention of secondary benefits while on FÁS training courses is subject to the respective means tests for the benefits and, therefore, retention is <Col N="872" /> not guaranteed.  Persons taking up training opportunities may have their secondary benefit entitlements reduced where allowances, including travel and other expense allowances, are regarded as means.</P>
    <P>The overall matter of the retention of secondary benefits on transition from unemployment to work, or to labour market programmes including training programmes, is a complex issue and is currently under consideration as part of a wide ranging review of the impact of secondary benefits on the incentive to work or to participate on programmes.  My Department is represented on the interdepartmental steering group, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which is at present considering these issues.</P>
    <P>I am very mindful of the importance of incentivising participation by the long-term unemployed in active labour market programmes, particularly in programmes with the best progression outcomes.  To this end, I have included in my Departments Estimate for next year provision for a substantial increase in the training allowance to £25 per week.  This will now be available to all long-term unemployed persons participating in training.  This will assist in improving the incentive for long-term unemployed persons to take up training, as opposed to other labour market programmes.</P>

      <P>Boats used on a commercial basis to take anglers to sea must hold a loadline certificate under the Merchant Shipping Loadline Rules, 1968, which were made under the Loadline Act, 1968.  In order to qualify for such a certificate a boat must be surveyed by a marine surveyor, meet specific construction standards, carry a specified range of safety equipment, and undergo annual surveys during the period of validity of the certificate, usually five years.</P>
      <P>Such boats are, however, exempted from the requirement to hold a loadline certificate under the 1968 rules if they do not carry cargo, do not carry more than 12 people, and do not travel more than three miles from land and more than 15 miles from the point of departure.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued non-statutory guidelines on recommended lifesaving and fire-fighting appliances and other safety requirements for sea-angling boats qualifying for loadline exemption certificates.</P>

      <P>The three non-quota species referred to are of very limited commercial importance to Irish fishermen.  Although small quantities are caught as a by-catch there are no directed conger eel, shark or common skate fisheries. In relation to catches by recreational sea anglers, a voluntary tagging programme of skate, blue shark and tope &mdash; a species of shark &mdash; is promoted by the Central Fisheries Board which maintains a data bank of results.  A voluntary code of practice to protect and conserve skate has been put in place by anglers and fish caught are returned to the sea.</P>
      <P>Conservation policy for fish stocks is generally set and regulated at EU level.  EU regulations, while focusing on the conservation of the main commercial fish stocks, are also increasingly aimed at the protection of all marine biological resources.  Minimum mesh sizes are laid down for all fish stocks and gear types.</P>
      <P>At international level, a plan of action is being advanced at FAO for the conservation and management of shark, i.e. all species of shark, skate, ray and chimaera.  My Department is monitoring developments in this forum.</P>

      <P>Based on available data sources at our disposal, we have estimated that approximately one million metric tonnes of fish are caught annually in the Irish zone with a first sale value of some £700 million.  The value of the Irish fleet catch as a component of this is over £150 million.</P>
      <P>The Irish fisheries zone is not currently used as a basis for fisheries statistics, catch data or stock assessments.  The data is compiled by individual member states, including Ireland, for their own fleets by reference to the ICES fishery zones rather than national zones.</P>
      <P>The basis for firm estimates of total catches and the value of these catches in Irish waters by other member states is not therefore currently available. Improved data on all catches in Irish waters is an essential requirement and in that regard the EU Commission accepts the need to develop a reliable common data base on all aspects of EU fisheries, including stocks, catches, landings and sales.  This management information would be particularly critical for Ireland as a coastal State with a high level of fishing activity by other member states in our waters.</P>
      <P>In addition to supporting the development of a common data base by the Commission in co-operation with member states, the Department is working with the Marine Institute and BIM to review available data and develop methodologies which would more reliably quantify existing estimates of catches in the Irish zone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The position as regards lamb imports, is that as a member of the European Union, Ireland is part of a free trade area in which it is not possible to legally prohibit, restrict or inhibit the trade of lambs from another member state.  Imported animals must be accompanied by appropriate health certification.  Under bilateral arrangements trade to and from Northern Ireland does not, however, require health certification.</P>
      <P>All sheep presented for slaughter at an export approved plant are subject to the supervision and control of the Department veterinary office staff. I have satisfied myself that the veterinary inspectorate at the plants are fully discharging their responsibilities in this regard and that all the legal requirements regarding the health status and freedom from disease of these animals are being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as being a significant exporter of beef and dairy products, Ireland exports three out of every four lambs produced in this country.  Therefore it would not be in our long-term interest to <Col N="880" /> attempt to impose any unilateral measures to restrict trade in any agricultural commodity.  At the same time, experience has shown the need for, and the value of, long-term supply arrangement between producers and processors where emphasis on regular supply and quality of product should be of benefit to the sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>As far as the level of imports is concerned, it is not possible to give a precise estimate of the number of lambs imported from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  However it would appear on the basis of ewe numbers and lamb output in this country that imports account for less than 5 per cent of total slaughterings for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The herd of the person referred to was included in the brucellosis contiguous programme and scheduled for test on 12 September 1998 to be completed before 12 October 1998.  As this test was not completed, the herd was restricted and a 14 day notice was served on the herdowner on 16 November 1998.  However, it subsequently transpired that the contiguous land in question belonged to the son of the person referred to, who has the same name, and the herd was accordingly derestricted for brucellosis on 18 November 1998 and removed from the contiguous programme.</P>
      <P>An annual TB and brucellosis round test was due to have been carried out on this herd by 25 October last but this has not been done.  Effectively, therefore, the herd is again restricted due to the animal identity cards being out of date.</P>

      <P>The person's REPS application includes commonage land and the revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for each commonage.  The preparation of the framework <Col N="883" /> plans will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  The national plan involves a 30 per cent reduction for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, including Sligo.  This means that the farmers concerned who are already in REPS or who join, on the basis of the national framework plan, can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.  This higher payment is designed to compensate for, <i>inter alia</i>, stock reductions.</P>
      <P>Any individual plan drawn up under the interim measure will be reviewed when the commonage framework plan is available and sheep numbers will be adjusted in line with the sustainable stocking levels set out in that framework plan.</P>

I had indicated in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 384 <Col N="884" /> and 385 on Wednesday, 30 September 1998 that gains in speculative transactions in the exchange market are already taxed in Ireland under the capital gains tax or income tax or corporation tax code, depending on whether the gain arises in the course of a financial trade or not, or whether it accrues to an individual or a company.  Losses on speculative transactions are also of course treated as allowable deductions for tax purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The company advises me that only a small percentage of its agents, nationally, are part of multiple chains.  It further informs me that the present number of agents selling lottery tickets is based on the level of population and is in accordance with international norms for sales of this <Col N="885" /> nature.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any taxation proposals in the run up to the forthcoming budget.  However, I am glad to point out that there has been no falling off this year in Exchequer receipts from betting.  The receipts to end of October 1998 are £44.5 million, which is an increase of 16.2 per cent over the same period last year.</P>

    <P>The average in-patient length of stay for cataract surgery from the time of admission to discharge is three days.  The Deputy will note from the above figures that there has been a significant increase in the level of day case cataract activity in recent years.  I anticipate that this trend will continue in future years.  The precise level of funding to be allocated to this service in 1999 will be a matter for individual agencies to consider as part of the overall service planning process.  As a matter of practice, I have been encouraging agencies to avail of alternatives to traditional in-patient treatment where this is consistent with high-quality patient care.</P>

      <Quest>the decisions, if any, he has made in view of the Nursing Commission's report to improve the position of student nurses in accord with that report and the shortages and difficulties in recruitment of student nurses due to the unsatisfactory conditions afforded to them.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A key recommendation of the Commission on Nursing in the area of pre-registration nursing education and training relates to the establishment of a representative forum involving the third level institutions, schools of nursing, health service providers and An Bord Altranais with the objective of preparing the ground for replacing the three year diploma programme with a four year degree programme.  I am currently in the process of establishing this forum.</P>
      <P>I would point out that nursing students participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students.  Each student receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  This grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum of which is £1,652 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf.  The average annual fee is about £1,300.  A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 is also provided for each student commencing the programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions. In addition, I introduced a new allowance of £20 per week earlier this year to assist students undertaking external clinical placements. This is payable where it is necessary for <Col N="889" /> the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement.  Students undertaking such placements who do not require accommodation receive a weekly travel pass.  The average annual total value of these supports is some £6,000 per nursing student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    <P>My Department recently issued a circular to all health agencies involved in the nursing registration-diploma programmes setting out revised arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants and third level fees in respect of nursing students who are required to repeat elements of the programme.  Where such cases arise, the third level fees will be paid in respect of the academic year which the student is required to repeat.  In addition, the student will receive a maintenance grant of up to 50 per cent of the value of the annual maintenance grant in respect of the repeat year.  These arrangements, which are in respect of a single repeat year only, will ensure that those nursing students who are required to repeat elements of the nursing registration-diploma programme will be enabled to do so without suffering financial hardship.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in recruiting general nursing students, as is reflected in the successful outcome to this year's competition.  The ratio of applicants to available training places was 4: 1. This demonstrates that there continues to be considerable interest among school leavers in general nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately the case, however, that there is a lower level of interest in psychiatric and mental handicap nursing.  There is clearly a need to raise the profile of both disciplines among school leaving students.  With this objective in mind, my Department is making funding available to all of the schools of nursing concerned for a local marketing campaign aimed at second level schools in their respective catchment areas.</P>
    <P>At a national level, my Department is currently engaged in discussions with An Bord Altranais in relation to the board undertaking a recruitment campaign to attract more entrants to nursing training generally.  It is intended that the board will produce videos and promotional literature to underpin such a campaign.  My Department has also recently completed negotiations with An Bord Altranais for the board to assume responsibility from 1999 onwards for the Nursing Applications Centre.  This is in accordance with the enhanced role recommended by the Commission on Nursing for the board in the area of pre-registration nursing education.</P>

      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA rate less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The limits are set by the health board using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>Health boards must satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within these limits and, in that regard, they take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents concerning average rents charged in the area.</P>

In addition, if a tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The rent limits in operation in the Eastern Health Board (EHB) were applied with effect from 1 January 1998.  The EHB is currently reviewing these limits and will be proposing increases with effect from 1 January 1999.</P>

      <P>I understand that the proposed digital terrestrial television (DTT) infrastructure would be capable of supporting the type of service which seems to be envisaged by the Deputy.  For example, if Departments considered it practical or feasible they could enter into commercial arrangements with operators or broadcasters to use the infrastructure to have information about their services provided to viewers.  However, such a service would seem to be more of an Internet-like information service which while accessible via a television set would not actually be a television broadcasting service. In these circumstances the question of allocating a specific television channel would not seem to arise.</P>

      <P>Ireland fully lives up to its international obligations in the asylum area. People entitled under international law to protection are given protection.  The basic criteria for establishing who is entitled to be granted refugee status is the definition set out at section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a refugee is someone who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a social <Col N="898" /> group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.  Each application is considered on its own merits and where the above definition is met the person is granted refugee status.</P>
      <P>The situation in the country of origin of asylum seekers is, of course, a most important factor in the determination process, it is essential that such information is researched in detail.  For this purpose, my Department obtains information from, <i>inter alia,</i> the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the media and other EU member states.</P>
      <P>There are occasions where the criteria for granting refugee status are not met but good reasons exist where the person in question should not be returned to his or her country of origin at the time.  In such an instance, consideration is given to allowing the person temporary permission to remain in the State.  I will continue to exercise my discretion in such circumstances in keeping with our international reputation and humanitarian traditions in this regard.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter <Col N="901" /> for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the current strength of Carbury Garda station is one sergeant and one Garda.  I understand, however, that the assigned sergeant is, at present, on temporary transfer to Naas since 2 November 1998 but is expected to return to Carbury in the very near future.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that the local divisional officer is satisfied with the present level of policing in Carbury sub-district.  I understand in this regard that regular patrols by mobile units from Newbridge and Kildare Garda stations and also the divisional traffic corps in Naas augment local patrolling.</P>

      <P>During the period 1 November 1997 to 31 October 1998, 2,816 people were refused leave to land in the State.  Of these, 759 sought asylum and were admitted on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds under which a person may be refused leave to land in the State are set out in Article 5 (2) of the Aliens Order 1946 as inserted by Article 3 of the Aliens (Amendment) Order 1975, S.I. No. 128 of 1975.  The principal grounds are as follows: (1) the person is not in a position to support her/himself and any accompanying <Col N="902" /> dependants; (2) although wishing to take up employment in the State, the person is not in possession of a valid work permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; (3) the person is suffering from a specified disease or disability; (4) the person has been convicted (whether in the State or otherwise) of an offence punishable under the law of the place of conviction by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least one year; (5) the person being a national of a State subject to visa controls is not the holder of a valid Irish visa; (6) the person is the subject of a deportation order; (7) the person has been prohibited from landing by order of the Minister under the Aliens Act; (8) the person is not in possession of a valid passport or other document which (a) establishes their nationality and identity to the Immigration Officer's satisfaction, (b) was issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, and (c) does not purport to have been renewed otherwise than by or on behalf of such an authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 157 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is in the form of the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely clear as to what the Deputy has in mind in his third question.  If he is inquiring about nationalities of applicants, as I have stated previously, it has been general policy of successive Ministers not to disclose information on the nationality of asylum seekers or refugees.  This is due to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided.  Such identification could have serious implications particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin.</P>

The requirements of a District Court venue such as Kilcock include the provision of a modern courtroom, judge's chamber, family law facilities, legal practitioners' room and consultation rooms.  Of course access for people with disabilities must also be provided.</P>
      <P>My Department's courts building programme is addressing the problem of poor courts accommodation throughout the country on an ongoing basis.  While many courthouses have been refurbished under this programme there is still a considerable amount of work to be done.</P>
      <P>My Department is in consultation with Kildare County Council regarding the provision of modern court facilities in Kilcock either through the refurbishment of the existing courthouse or the establishment of a courthouse in another location in the town.  It is not possible at this stage to say when work will commence on this project irrespective of which option is chosen.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 258, 259 and 260 on 17 February 1998 I am committed to providing modern court accommodation in Youghal as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with Cork County Council it is clear that this Department's requirements in relation to the court, district court offices and ancillary facilities cannot be met within the existing courthouse site.  Recently my Department became aware of plans for the development of a site to the rear of the courthouse. The acquisition of part of the ground floor of the proposed development is under negotiation at present.  It is expected that this additional accommodation will be available towards the end of next year subject to the successful completion of lease arrangements.  This will enable the refurbishment of the courthouse and the fit out of the new offices for the Youghal District Court, While planning for the refurbishment of the courthouse will commence early next year it is unlikely that there will be substantial expenditure on the refurbishment of the courthouse in 1999. The only cost arising will relate to the design team fees.  It is difficult at this stage to say when refurbishment work will commence but I expect that work on Youghal Courthouse will begin in late 1999 or early in the year 2000 at which time the necessary funding will be made available.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there were no educational referrals in the Waterford area for psychological assessment in the 1997-8 school year; the proposals, if any, he has to rectify the absence of any educational psychological service in Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>An educational psychological service is provided to second level schools in the city and county of Waterford.  Each of these schools is assigned to one of two psychologists employed by my Department.  During, the 1997-8 school year, 40 referrals for psychological assessment for mainly educational reasons were made to them.</P>
      <P>However, my Department is, as yet, not providing an educational psychological service to primary schools in County Waterford.  This explains the fact that no educational referrals were made by primary schools to my Department's psychological service during the school year in question.  However, it is possible that such referrals may have been made to psychologists employed by the South-Eastern Health Board or by other agencies.</P>
      <P>One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels.  On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced.  Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in 1999.  It is my intention that there will be an educational psychological service available to all schools by the end of the five-year implementation phase.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are inevitably many schools in the country which do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service, including some with considerable numbers of disadvantaged pupils.  Attention will be paid to the needs of such priority areas as the psychological service is expanded.</P>

      <P>I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes should be improved.  In this regard, a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs carried out an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  Towards the end of last year I received the preliminary report of this working group and following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, our officials are undertaking a more detailed review.  This review will involve the participation of interested parties.  I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>
      <P>I brought the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities to a current year basis in 1997, which improved the timeliness of payments to students.  In this regard, I understand that all local authorities paid the first instalment of the maintenance grant to both new awardees and renewals by the end of October 1998.</P>

      <Col N="912" /> During 1998, my Department gave approval for construction work to commence on the following major projects in the institute of technology sector: Carlow, new library and catering building; Dún Laoghaire, major extension; Tallaght, second phase of development; Waterford, new library and information resource centre.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, within the framework of the scientific and technological education investment fund, a number of other projects in the sector are at an early planning stage.  The capital allocation in relation to these projects will be determined by my Department when the planning process has reached a more advanced stage.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional national schools.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.  The breaking the cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <Quest>the likely range within which the cost of school books will fall for junior and senior pupils at primary level and junior and senior cycle pupils at secondary level based on standard curricula.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">

      <P>At primary level, decisions on which <Col N="913" /> books to use are taken at school level.  Similarly, at second level, apart from a small number of prescribed texts, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which books to use are also taken at school level.  School authorities have been advised regularly that textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.  Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents.  Textbooks require to be changed periodically, however, to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that context and methodology are kept up to date.</P>
      <P>A report by Cooney-Carey Consultants in 1993, commissioned by my Department estimated that the costs of books only for primary school pupils average £38.32 per head for pupils in standards I-VI and £11.19 per head for pupils in infant classes.  When the cost of workbooks for infant classes are included it is estimated that the cost of books for infants averages at £17 per head. The report also found that the median bills faced by parents for new books was £150 at both junior certificate and leaving certificate levels.  The report concluded that book rental schemes offer the most practical method of curtailing the cost of school books to parents at primary and post primary levels.</P>
      <P>In regard to the cost to parents of textbooks, my Department makes provision for the payment of assistance towards the cost of textbooks in the case of necessitous pupils at both primary and second level.  In addition, school authorities are being encouraged and supported to introduce textbook loan-rental schemes.</P>

      <P>Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education primary teaching in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate colleges of education now follow a course module on special education.  This module covers the broad range of issues in special education, including specific learning disabilities.  In the case of the pre-service courses in the Froebel, Marino and Church of Ireland colleges, particular attention is paid to the skills and abilities involved in learning to read and to reading difficulties, including dyslexia, and their remediation.</P>
      <P>In the university sector this particular issue is primarily addressed in units taught as part of the higher diploma in education.  The topic is covered in the area of psychology and elements of it are dealt with in relation to the study of issues of social disadvantage.  This matter is specifically addressed at UCD in the higher diploma in compensatory and remedial education and is also explored in other universities in such programmes as the masters in education, the higher diploma in educational management and the higher diploma in guidance and counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national remedial education training programme of my Department currently supports post-graduate courses for teachers from primary and post primary schools in six colleges and universities. Each course includes a module on specific learning disabilities which has a focus on diagnosis and appropriate pedagogy.  In this academic year, 99 primary teachers and 64 post primary teachers are attending these courses.  The in career development unit of my Department also supports financially the many short courses, seminars and conferences for remedial teachers and other interested teachers in the area of specific learning disabilities.  These courses are generally organised and delivered by the Network of Education <Col N="915" /> Centres, teacher organisations and other providers.</P>

      <P>My Department's general policy in terms of identifying children with specific learning disability, dyslexia, is in line with the report of the special education review committee.  The criteria which are used consist of assessment by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence, which places general intellectual ability within the average range or above, and performance in basic literacy skills using objective criteria, such as standardised tests, at a very low level.  It would be expected that not more than some 2 per cent of the overall pupil population would be found in this category.</P>
      <P>There are four special schools and six special classes in ordinary primary schools currently catering for children with specific learning disability. Special classes are established where an assessed level of need has been identified and on foot of an application by a school for a special class for children with specific learning disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced a major initiative in respect of education services for children with special needs.  The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
      <P>The measures will deliver extra teaching and child care services to all special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings. Under the arrangements, there will be a formalised system of special teaching support for all children, including those with specific learning disability, attending schools on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs.</P>

The programme of increased expenditure includes a £7 increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant payable to voluntary secondary schools bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant to £184 with <i>pro rata</i> increases for schools in the other sectors at second-level.</P>
      <P>At primary level, there will be a <i>per capita</i> increase of £10 in the standard rate of capitation in 1999, bringing the total grant per pupil to £60. This represents an increase of 20 per cent which will be the largest ever increase in capitation funding for primary education.  In addition provision has been made for additional equipment grants.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for the application of these provisions will be announced following the upcoming budget.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the points differential for access to the Bachelor of Education course for students from the Gaeltacht compared to other students; the reason for this differential which stems from a regulation of his Department; and his views on whether advantages for Gaeltacht students are already in place within the leaving certificate and should not be in the entry requirements to particular courses.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the points differential in question.  The background to this issue is that, in accordance with the long-standing policy in support of the Gaeltacht and Irish language, supported by all Governments, there is a provision whereby up to 10 per cent of the teacher training places in the colleges of education may be reserved for Gaeltacht applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaeltacht applicants compete separately from other applicants for those places, and, given the fewer numbers of such applicants, this can mean that the points of some Gaeltacht applicants who are offered places are lower than otherwise required.  It is important to point out that not all <Col N="921" /> Gaeltacht applicants who secure places necessarily have lower points than other successful applicants.  In addition, competence in the Irish language is a particular entry requirement for primary teacher training.  The operation of the provision relating to Gaeltacht applicants is kept under continuous review in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the commission on the points system in 1997 met a commitment in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to appoint a high-powered group to examine the points system.  The commission issued a consultative process &mdash; background document in early 1998, which analyses the submissions made and outlines the research undertaken on behalf of the commission as well as examining international experience.  The issues raised by the Deputy are among the issues that have been raised in the debate around the work of the commission.  The commission is aiming to report in late spring-summer 1999.</P>

      <P>An application has been received for the provision of a PE hall at Christian Brothers secondary school, James Street, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at this school can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case.</P>
      <P>This application will continue to be reviewed in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The question of providing a gymnasium at Loreto secondary school, Kilkenny can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes generally and priority must be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  As a result of the <Col N="922" /> great demand for classroom accommodation throughout the country at present, I am not in a position to state when planning can commence for the provision of a gymnasium in this particular case.  However, the application will continue to be reviewed in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in the 1997-8 school year was 460,845.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 allocation in respect of capitation grants to primary schools was £27,040,000.  This included an in the increase in the standard rate <Col N="923" /> of grant of £5 and brought the standard grant to £50 per pupil.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have provided for a further £10 increase in the standard capitation grant in the 1999 Estimates, which will result in a standard <Col N="924" /> grant in 1999 of £60 per pupil.  This will be the largest ever increase in capitation funding for primary education and, taken with the increase in 1998, represents a 33 per cent increase in capitation funding in primary level since I assumed office.</P>
