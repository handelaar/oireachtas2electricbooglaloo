    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7c, the motion on the Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1997, Nos. 7d to 7f, inclusive, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, Financial Resolutions, No. 3, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 1, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Second and Remaining Stages.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 7c shall be decided without debate, Nos. 7d to 7f, inclusive, shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair, that proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance, that Second and Remaining Stages of No. 1 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down and accepted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and that the Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until Tuesday, 26 May 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to provide time today for statements to restore confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service in light of the fact that we have to import blood from Holland <Col N="202" /> to meet critical operational needs in our hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to have questions, although Members may table questions in the normal way if they wish to raise this issue. The Blood Transfusion Service Board is making a determined effort to ensure its stocks of blood increase and is appealing to the public.  I support the appeal to the public which has always been generous in its support of the Blood Transfusion Board and should show its support again.  It is not unusual, although it is not satisfactory, that we have had to use stocks of blood from other countries as has happened many times over the years. The campaign being launched by the Blood Transfusion Service Board deserves our support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach if he had any legislative proposals to address the threat by the Garda Síochána to the commencement of the Tour de France.  In the light of the escalation of that threat, will the Taosieach assure the House that contingency arrangements will be put in place by the relevant Government authorities to ensure this event&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that legislation had not been promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation may be necessary and the Government will need time to prepare it. That is the reason I ask the question now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>As legislation has not been promised, this question is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it has not been promised and I do not wish to dispute with you, but is it possible that in the light of the escalation of this threat, the Government intends to bring forward legislation to deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation will not resolve this matter.  I hope in the future, and as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pointed out at meetings in recent days, the effort to bring people back to the table and to get the GRA to negotiate with the Government and those who have been negotiating with it will be successful. If that is not successful, the operational requirements of ensuring that event goes ahead will have to be put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to bring forward the promised legislation to terminate ground rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Constitutional matters are still under consideration in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is dealing with <Col N="203" /> this matter.  It will be some time before they are resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in Fianna Fáil's 1977 manifesto.  It is manifest nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of upcoming finance and social welfare legislation, will the Taoiseach give assurances on the question of taxation of social welfare payments as regards the children of widows?  The Taoiseach will be aware of the Supreme Court decision yesterday which decreed that child dependant allowance payable for children of widows is liable to taxation.  Will the Taoiseach accept that is unfair, particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not develop the matter now.  Is there promised legislation on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowances in respect of other children are not taxable.  Will the Taoiseach consider that matter with a view to finding a fair solution to the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The judgment will be considered. Yesterday's Supreme Court decision concerns the taxation of child dependant allowance which is in addition to the social welfare widow's contributory pension.  The Supreme Court upheld current practice that a widow is liable to income tax in respect of increases in the weekly rate of widow's contributory pension paid to her in respect of each qualifying child resident with her.  It is important to note that the Supreme Court decision will not change the current tax treatment.  The impression is given that it will, but that is not the case.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to raise the matter again, but the judgment is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that £17 per week is a small amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter may not be debated now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there should not be a claw-back on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point that is misinterpreted. It is not the £8 that is taxed but the additional income.  If that was the only allowance the person had there would be no question of taxation. The tax is levied on the additional money, and that is current law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government plans to introduce legislation to place a total ban on tobacco advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation, but <Col N="204" /> under an EU decision of this week that matter will have to be dealt with within two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways of raising this matter.  It does not involve promised legislation and, therefore, it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree this is an extremely serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business on Tuesday I asked the Taoiseach to indicate to the House at a convenient date the residual legislative programme between now and the summer recess.  Given that the Dáil, on rising today, will not resume until 26 May, when will the Taoiseach communicate to the House or the Whips the legislative programme between now and the end of June?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1)(b), lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;not be authorised&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be authorised at the standard rate of income tax&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a number of measures to dampen demand in the housing market. His analysis of the Bacon report appears to be that in the past 12 months or so a disproportionate number of houses have been bought by investors rather than owner occupiers.  It is suggested that in the first quarter of this year 30 per cent of all purchases of new houses was for investment purposes.  In an attempt to dampen demand the Minister has targeted the investor market.</P>
      <P>He has taken two measures in respect of persons who invest in rental accommodation.  He has subjected new houses which are not owner occupied to stamp duty at the new rates.  This is a measure I do not oppose.  To date there was no stamp duty on new houses but there was on second hand houses.  As part of the changes the Minister is imposing stamp duty on new houses purchased for rental purposes.  It is hoped that will diminish demand.  The Minister has decided to abolish interest relief in respect of mortgages on houses which are being rented.  This is the second element of dampening demand in the investor market.</P>
      <P>Rather than dampening demand on the investor side the Minister's measures will eliminate demand.  He should consider the figures involved in the difference between the purchase price and the overall repayments for investing in rental accommodation, taking into account the payment of stamp duty and the lack of interest relief.  In this context it is no longer a question of levelling the pitch or dampening down the market.  Rather it is a matter of eliminating for a period of years investment in rental accommodation in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on the Minister's statement that his intention is to dampen demand rather than to eliminate it and that he seeks a level playing field, so to speak, I propose this amendment to allow interest relief to be applied in respect of rental accommodation at the standard rate.  Prior to the Minister's statement on 23 April an owner occupier got tax relief at the standard rate up to limit of £3,200 but an investor got relief at the marginal rate without a cap.  That did not constitute a level <Col N="209" /> playing field and gave an advantage to those purchasing for rental purposes.  Rather than eliminating demand I suggest that tax relief be retained at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in attempting genuinely to solve the problem of overheating in the housing market, the Minister will create another problem and eliminate rental accommodation.  There are categories of people who are not in a position to purchase or who do not wish to purchase their own homes.  They are happy because of their place in society or their age to live in rental accommodation.  It is a large and increasing percentage of the population.  About 10 per cent of the population of Limerick are students and they seek rental accommodation.  They do not and cannot be expected to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that by advantaging the owner occupier and levelling the playing field along the lines the Minister suggests, persons who now rent will purchase accommodation.  However, that will not happen because they are not in the purchasing classes.  They are mainly young mobile people who seek rental accommodation.  The Bacon report refers to the net immigration of 15,000 people.  On a yearly basis about 45,000 people return to the country.  Many of them are in the house purchasing age groups but there are many who have no option, at least for a time, but to seek rental accommodation.  The young workers in modern industry are highly mobile.  It is a byproduct of mobility that people rent rather than purchase property.  This is an increasing feature of society.  Many of those employed in the financial services in Dublin and the IT industries in west Dublin are young and mobile.  They may spend a couple of years working there and then move on.  Regardless of how level the playing field may be, they will not generally purchase houses and sell them on when moving.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister is making a genuine attempt to solve one problem but there is a danger he will create another.  I ask him to agree to the amendment and to allow tax relief at the standard rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I represent a suburban area and am aware of the large scarcity of rental accommodation. I accept the Minister is making a genuine attempt to solve a difficult problem, particularly for young couples. However, rented accommodation is scarce.  If restrictions are imposed which further reduce the stock of rented accommodation what remains will become more expensive.  In parts of Dublin the price of rental accommodation is becoming ridiculous, never mind the price of purchasing houses.  Let me give an example.  In my constituency a deserted wife lives with her daughter in a rented house.  She receives a subvention from the health board and is now facing eviction because the rent, which was £400 a month, has been <Col N="210" /> increased to £800 a month.  That is the going rate in the area in question.  The health board will not increase the subvention.  This mother and daughter are now facing eviction into a market where there is nothing else available.  On top of that, the local authority has a huge waiting list of people looking for housing.  People have to use bed and breakfast accommodation.  I was in contact with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council yesterday and was informed that apart from the housing priority list there are between 70 and 100 people on a special homeless persons' list in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  These are people who have been evicted or forced out of their properties into bed and breakfast accommodation by landlords looking for higher rents. When they get up in the morning with their young children they have to leave the bed and breakfast and are not allowed back until late at night.  They have to walk the streets.</P>
      <P>We must do everything possible to assist young couples trying to purchase their first home.  The increase in the cost of property is appalling and we must try to do something about it, but in solving one problem let us not add to another massive problem which already exists.  Whether we like it or not, if we stop further rented accommodation becoming available in the marketplace, what is there will become more expensive and what I have outlined in terms of people being evicted because of rent increases which they cannot afford will get worse.  If the Minister has another solution to the problem I would like to hear it, but the reality is that if something is scarce and we make it more scarce, the normal marketplace will dictate the price people have to pay and the rents will go up.  That will not solve any problems. Therefore, I support Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support Deputy Noonan's amendment.  The current provision will cause severe pressure in the rental sector.  In Dublin the vast majority of students have to pay between £50 and £60 a week for accommodation for part of the year.  If Deputy Noonan's amendment is not accepted there will be further pressures on that market.  Young people are finding it hard to survive. Maintenance grants, for those lucky enough to have them, barely cover their accommodation costs, especially in Dublin.  There is a huge shortage of adequate accommodation.  Dublin is the city I have most experience of but it is the same in Cork, Limerick and other parts of the country. There is a proposal by the Department of Education to increase the number of places at colleges in the coming academic year.  Given the shortage of accommodation and its high cost, if we introduce more young people into the third level education sector, further pressures will be put on them and on their families.  Students will be sleeping rough on the streets or in derelict houses.  It happened in the past and it could happen in the future if this Bill is not amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are serious problems with regard to the <Col N="211" /> health subvention, particularly in Dublin, but one does not need to go to Dublin to see the problems. Even in County Roscommon, the most rural county in the country, there are serious problems because the health board subvention does not nearly cover the cost of accommodation. There is a huge demand for housing and a large number of people using bed and breakfast accommodation. This Bill will only compound the problem. The Minister should accept this amendment, which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate yesterday I raised some of the problems that would arise because of the removal of interest relief from mortgage interest relating to rental accommodation.  Let me repeat those today because it seems that in addressing this issue the Department has used a very blunt stick and has failed to come to terms with the different social circumstances in which accommodation is rented.</P>
      <P>This measure has been proposed on the basis that it will reduce the cost of houses for young married couples or perhaps stem the heat in the secondhand house market.  That is a complete shibboleth in the context of a number of areas, and Deputy Noonan's proposal should be supported.</P>
      <P>Let me describe the types of social situations in which rental accommodation arises.  It does not all arise from people simply purchasing a property for investment purposes, not that that is a bad thing.  There are people who purchase one or two investment properties in addition to their own family home simply for pension purposes. They are acting in a socially responsible way in setting out an investment strategy for themselves for the future, and it is only financially viable for them to do that in the context of interest relief on borrowings raised.  This policy actively discourages people from making their own independent pension plans for their retirement.  I would have thought it would be a social objective of Government to encourage people to make such plans.  Is it the objective of Government to direct them always towards the main insurance companies for pension policies in respect of which people are often given inflated views of the likely value of the policies taken out?  That is an area in which there are huge and growing difficulties.  Should it not be the role of Government to encourage people to use their own finances wisely and to invest in that context?  That is one area that has not been addressed in the context of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects that I see, wearing my other hat as a lawyer dealing with family problems &mdash; for example, a deserted wife or a wife who is being inadequately supported by her husband. A husband who has been deserted by his wife, who is living in the family home and bringing up young children and who wishes to retain the family home but does not have the financial wherewithal to meet all the outgoings and discharge <Col N="212" /> mortgage repayments might have the facility, by doing minor construction work, to turn a portion of the family home into an apartment from which an income could be derived.  Does that turn the family home into an investment property, and would that deprive the deserted husband or wife of a potential income source? Would they find, if they got that rental income, that they would lose their mortgage income relief?  It is a very specific issue, and a very real issue for many people.  In the wake of the constitutional change people are entering into second marriages.</P>
    <P>A wife who is divorced may own her original family home.  If she marries someone who also has a family home, are we saying that she cannot rent her first home and get some income from it, even though she may feel that having been through a difficult marriage she wants the security of knowing her original home is there if things do not work out?  It is only viable for many people to do that if mortgage interest relief is set off against rental income.  Will we force wives in those circumstances to leave their homes vacant, which is not financially viable, or to sell them?  Is it not a valid social objective that people who have been through difficult marriages should be allowed to keep their first home and use it for income generating purposes?  The social impact of this provision will force many people to sell such homes.</P>
    <P>What is the position if one takes in boarders? One may not formally physically separate a portion of the house, but if students are taken in and pay rent for nine months of the year how will this measure impact on mortgage interest relief?  To retain such relief, will one be forced into the black economy and not declare this income because that is the only way to make one's situation financially viable?  Will this encourage people who take people into their houses on a temporary basis as boarders to conceal their income in the black economy?  A series of issues, other than the basic one, arise to which the Bill has given no consideration.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, based on my knowledge of Dublin and my involvement in investment properties, &mdash; and I hope I have always dealt with people in a decent and civilised way &mdash; that the Minister's measure in this context will result in a huge rise in rents in Dublin over the next 12 to 18 months because he will create a shortage.  He will not solve the housing problem nor will it result in a large number of new houses coming on the market at affordable prices.  When we review this in 12 months, we will discover the price of new houses in Dublin city and county will have continued to rise.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably take a few potential apartment blocks out of the market that developers would have constructed for investment purposes and which, without investors, would have very few owner occupiers.  In the larger housing estates around Dublin, including those in my constituency, prices are being artificially increased by <Col N="213" /> developers who are deliberately building small numbers of houses and releasing them in small blocks on the market, fuelling demand and charging exorbitant prices.  Immoral profiteering is being carried on in those areas.</P>
    <P>This measure will not solve that problem.  It will not only vastly increase rents, particularly around Dublin, but will make rental property a great deal scarcer for young couples not in a financial position to purchase their own houses.  It will increase the burden on local authorities at the end of the day, which currently cannot cope with the demands made on them.  Irrespective of the other measures in the Bill, this one will be reversed in 12 months by the Minister.  In terms of social policy in the short term, it will create a series of detrimental impacts on a wide variety of people, many of which were not addressed or even considered in the Bacon report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree the Bacon report dealt with house sales and his brief did not include the rental market.  If it had, he could have possibly come up with a totally different set of recommendations.  Listening to people, such as Deputy Shatter, who have a close knowledge of what is happening in Dublin, it appears these measures will exacerbate the problem rather than solve it.  Deputy Noonan's amendment would restore balance and it is a simple one which could be accepted by the Minister.  He should consider it seriously with his officials.</P>
      <P>His measures have rocked the market and I have never seen more people concerned.  It has had more of an effect than measures introduced in the past for the housing market.  I agree it will increase rents beyond the reach of students, nurses, civil servants, bankers and many low paid workers in multinationals who live in Dublin.  It will create major difficulties for them and Deputy Noonan's amendment tries to restore balance and give an incentive to the first time buyer and the taxpayer in order to encourage investment.  Will the Minister consider the amendment and weigh up its advantages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be careful about any measure that will make it more difficult for young couples to acquire houses because they may be forced into the rental sector.  This measure will make it more difficult, particularly for first time buyers.  Although an attempt was made as a result of the acceptance of recommendations in the Bacon report to alleviate stamp duty for first time buyers on second-hand houses it did not go far enough, despite having some effect. For houses valued at £60,000 stamp duty was abolished but that was only a paper exercise because in Galway one would not buy a house at that price; one would not get a good henhouse in Galway for £60,000.  That measure will not help young couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stamp duty on houses worth £100,000, which is at the low end of the scale for second-hand houses in Galway, has been reduced from 6 per cent to <Col N="214" /> 4 per cent.  The scale has not been correctly examined. If stamp duty is reduced by 2 per cent, the person who can afford a £400,000 house will save £8,000 in stamp duty while the first time buyer who is most likely to be the customer for houses valued between £60,000 and £100,000 will save only £2,000.  We have not gone far enough to protect people who wish to buy their own homes. Many first time buyers are buying second-hand houses, because of the cost of new houses, some of which are in need of considerable repair and this is an added cost.  Any measure that would make it more difficult for first time buyers must be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the Bacon Report, section 1 provides for the total withdrawal of relief for interest on borrowings used in connection with rented residential property.  Deputy Noonan's amendment proposes a half way measure by seeking to retain the relief, but at a reduced level, to allow relief at the standard rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Second Stage debate, the Bill is designed to restore a balance to the housing sector &mdash; a balance between supply and demand, between investors and first time purchasers and between tax concessions and removal of reliefs.  The overall policy goals being pursued &mdash; which I presume find agreement on all sides of the House &mdash; are to increase the supply of serviced land, to reduce excess investor demand and to assist ordinary house purchasers, thus defusing the house price spiral and increasing the affordability of housing.</P>
      <P>Even with the total removal of interest deductibility there will still be a basic and strong demand for residential accommodation and the house building sector seems to accept that this will be the case.  The deductibility of interest for tax purposes against rental income played its part in stimulating demand and reviving the property market when it was flat.  However, the case for continued relief &mdash; even at a reduced level &mdash; at the time of a property boom is far less convincing. The Bacon study indicates:</P>
      <P>.there is evidence that changing patterns of housing demand are sufficient to support a growing and more diversified rented sector, for example, rental values appear to be well underpinned. What is in doubt is the need to encourage this demand by means of fiscal incentives, especially when the revenue foregone in this direction could be focused better towards increasing supply and choice to first time buyers who are facing affordability strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out in the report, the main effect of the proposed measures would be to remove fiscal supports to residential investment demand, at a time when underlying demand is extremely strong.  The benefits from moving in this direction would be, among other things, to provide a more level playing field between investors and home owners and to allow investment in residential <Col N="215" /> property to be determined by underlying market forces for additional rented accommodation, at a time when economic and social changes are leading to an increase in the depth and breadth of demand for such accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied the half way measure proposed by Deputy Noonan would be an appropriate or effective response to the problems with which the proposals in the Bill &mdash; which constitute a coherent overall package &mdash; are designed to deal.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept his amendment.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised by the Deputies were considered by Dr. Bacon and when drafting the Bill. As I stated in the brief contributions we made on the financial resolution on stamp duty some weeks ago, the Bacon report considered affordability of housing for first time buyers.  I stated on a number of occasions &mdash; I am not sure what I said in the House &mdash; that the withdrawal of interest relief will give a sharp shock to the market, but that is what it is designed to do.  There is no point in fooling ourselves about what we are trying to achieve.  What the Bacon report recommended, and the Government adopted, is designed to give a sharp shock to the market.  The measure is designed to distort demand to achieve a balance between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report addressed many of the underlying reasons for the increased demand in the housing market, which include the supply of serviced land, the economic boom, etc.  Deputy Noonan referred to the numbers of people coming back into the economy.  I concur with his view that those who leave the country are young while those who return are in the house buying age bracket and thus push up demand.  I have told people at race meetings and elsewhere &mdash; people in the building industry are vociferous in making their views known &mdash; that the measure is designed to distort the market.  I have also stated this at parliamentary party meetings.  Up to now the investor was competing to the exclusion of all others.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this matter in the Department in the run up to the Finance Bill, I readily accepted this measure would have the greatest psychological effect on the market.  When people become aware of the demands on the rental sector in the next few months, it may encourage them to stay in the market, but the measure is definitely helping first time buyers.  A heading in the Property supplement of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states &ldquo;First-time buyers back in force as 35 homes sell out&rdquo;.  The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>With investors now out of the residential investment market, first-time buyers bought all 35 houses released in a new scheme near Lucan last weekend.</P>
    <P>I knew the Bill would have that effect, but that is what it is designed to do.  I considered the question of a standard rate of income tax in the leadup to the Bill.  I accept the legitimacy of the views <Col N="216" /> put forward by many of the Deputies opposite. Deputy Shatter outlined what will happen in certain areas.  Having considered all those matters, I concluded that to achieve a dramatic effect, as recommended by Dr. Bacon, the measure I proposed was the only way forward.  The anomalies outlined by the Deputies will have to be considered on another occasion.  The rationale behind Dr. Bacon's recommendation and the Government's response is to distort the market and it is strong enough to ensure builders will have enough demand for their houses.  The measure is designed to stop the ferocious escalation of house prices because investors were buying up half of some schemes and the downward pressure on interest rates also encouraged more people into the market.  I am willing to discuss the anomalies which Deputy Shatter believes the measure will create on another occasion. However, nobody should be in any doubt that I am trying to distort the market and the measure is achieving that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said the measure may create problems in the market for apartments and flats for students, young couples and transient workers.  From an economist's viewpoint, if greater returns can be made in the rental sector, it will encourage more people to get involved.  As an economist, Deputy Dukes, said yesterday he disagreed with some of the theories put forward by Dr. Bacon, but that is what economists tend to do.</P>
    <P>There are eight eminent people on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which was set up by the Chancellor, Mr. Gordon Brown, to decide on interest rates.  The minutes of that committee show a four against four split; one group wants to raise interest rates, the other wants to lower them.  People in the markets make money because there are different views.  I am not offended, and neither should Dr. Bacon be, that Deputy Dukes disagrees with some of his analysis as an economist.  When speaking on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in response to Deputy Noonan's amendments concerning stamp duty, I put on record my views on the effect of changes to stamp duty &mdash; I believe the difference often goes into the seller's pocket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, more rational views were not taken on board at that time and I was one of those expressing them.  As I said on the Financial Resolutions, the sum of Dr. Bacon's proposals should achieve what it sets out to do.  I could argue with many of the individual contentions but I think they will be effective taken together, which is why the Government decided to go along with the report and not to cherry pick.  We made slight changes with regard to stamp duty because the balance we put forward was somewhat better. As to section 23, the changes in this year's Finance Bill allows the Minister to pick and choose, <Col N="217" /> which was not possible before.  That is the appropriate response in that area and the section itself will remain.  However, I recognise that people have other views.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter said people buy houses for pension purposes and I readily acknowledge that.  I come from the end of the political spectrum which believes in the free market and that people should be encouraged to make provision for themselves and should not be reliant on the State at all times.  I have no difficulty subscribing to the Deputy's philosophy.  However, that is not what the Bacon report and the Government's response is trying to do &mdash; we are attempting to distort the market to achieve a social objective, and the social objective on housing, shared by successive Administrations, has been to encourage people to own their homes.  That continues to be the policy of this Administration.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Barrett was going to buy a house in April but decided it was not worth his while because the interest is non-deductible, that would have been an economic decision because he had worked out the figures.  If, however, the house gets a better rent he will decide to buy it anyway because it will suit him economically.  That brings in a new player on the demand side and will force down prices, because that is what happens in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned letting out rooms in a person's home.  There are two answers to his question.  I will outline what should be done by people who have boarders in their houses but I <Col N="218" /> am sure this is not abided by in all cases.  The first case involves a person who has owned and lived in his house for many years.  If this person lets a room in the house, he or she may offset part of the mortgage interest against the rental income and claim part of this as a normal mortgage credit against personal income tax.  In this case the mortgage interest applicable to the let part of the house is determined on a just and reasonable basis.  In this context, &ldquo;just and reasonable&rdquo; could be determined by the floor area or the number of rooms let.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his proposals on rented accommodation, which is that interest on borrowings cannot be offset against rent received.  Young people from my constituency must travel to the university cities for an education and this proposal will put a severe burden on parents who are trying to provide them with accommodation.  What will now happen is that landlords will substantially increase their rents, making it well-nigh impossible to rent accommodation.  The driving force behind the success of this economy is the adaptability of our <Col N="219" /> young people and their standard of education, which will be severely curtailed by the proposal. It is also important to ensure the quality of the accommodation.  Before these proposals, a landlord could offset the interest on his borrowings to upgrade his accommodation; what will happen now is that poor quality accommodation will become the norm, young people will be pushed into it, and that will have a detrimental effect.</P>
      <P>This is the only issue I wish to raise with the Minister.  It was brought to my attention by a number of parents who are extremely concerned about it.  The Minister comes from the outskirts of Maynooth so he would be well aware of the demand for accommodation and perhaps he could take this on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> That is the only picture I can draw.  Supply and demand is trotted out as the main source of the problem as if, by magic, supply and demand shoots up prices by £10,000 per week in the housing market.  Deputy Shatter put his finger on the problem when he spoke about immoral profiteering in the marketplace by builders and developers and manipulation of the marketplace in the way developments were phased and let out in order to create a sense of <Col N="220" /> scarcity and hysteria among people desperate to buy a home.  That is true.  We should not fool around with a few percentage points of interest relief, but meet the problem head on.  We must take on the people responsible for this immoral profiteering and manipulation.  As I have amendments to that effect, I will not go further into that matter.</P>
      <P>Two measures should be considered that would resolve this problem if the Minister were not so hidebound by his enslavement to the market. First, in all the major centres, students occupy thousands of units of accommodation.  If a State or semi-State agency built thousands of units of accommodation, both on and off campus, specifically for students, as happens widely in France, that would make their lives easier at a stroke in that they would have affordable accommodation, and it would free up thousands of rental units in every major centre in the country.</P>
      <P>Second, there is enormous pressure on rental accommodation because of the ever-growing local authority housing lists.  One only has to examine the vast subvention by the Eastern Health Board to put people suffering on the housing lists into private accommodation.  If the State set aside emergency provision to end the local authority housing lists within a period of, say, three years, that would free up thousands more places which would be a major contribution to addressing this problem.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister and the Deputies begin to think in this way rather than tick-tacking around with minor modifications that will not go any way towards solving this major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House when time is limited as we have a great deal of work to do.  The net point is that the Minister, in attempting to dampen demand for houses, may have caused another problem in the rental market. To suggest rents will go up as a result of this measure and that, consequently, new investors will come into the market who do not need interest relief or any fiscal incentives, supply further demand thereby resulting in the market reaching a new equilibrium, is the kind of economic theory which caused the famine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental misunderstanding about economic demand.  Economic demand means demand from people who have the money to pay.  There is a confusion between economic demand and social demand in many debates both inside and outside this House.  There is little point in telling the person who does not have the rent that a new equilibrium will be found and that there will be a plentiful supply of accommodation. There will only be a plentiful supply of accommodation when it is affordable.  If people cannot afford it, they will continue to be in boxes on the side of the street or housed by the Eastern Health Board and other health boards.  There could be empty flats and apartments throughout the city, but supply will not meet demand unless <Col N="221" /> it is money demand and there will not be any money demand if rents are increased.</P>
    <P>To put it bluntly, in attempting to correct the hook the Minister will develop the slice and the last problem will be worse than the first.  There is no point in my repeating the argument.  I am pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boylan made a point about students in his constituency and those in mine.  It must be understood that people who owned and let houses before 23 April will not be affected by this measure, but new entrants into the market will be affected.  The interest allowability will continue to exist for people who were in the market prior to 23 April.  There are transitional arrangements to address the problem of people who had entered into contracts but were not in a position to conclude them before 23 April and who can conclude them by 31 December.  They will also be entitled to interest allowability.</P>
      <P>We had a debate this morning and on other occasions about the new entrants.  Deputy Noonan and other Deputies put forward some suggestions and mine are in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was delighted with the contribution from Deputy Joe Higgins, particularly in l998, because I was a student in UCD in l968.  I am sorry he did not use phrases like &ldquo;the bourgeoisie&rdquo; and &ldquo;the proletariat&rdquo;, but he went some way down that road when he talked about slaves to the capitalist market.  I was in UCD at the time of the gentle revolution in Earlsfort Terrace, which I enjoyed, and those speeches were made all the time by some very prominent people.  I remember a speech by the current Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn.  The late John Feeney was involved in that attempted coup.  Kevin Myers was also a leader of that group and Deputy McManus was part of it, although I do not remember her so well.  I believe Deputy Higgins attended another educational establishment at the time and I am glad to note that 30 years later he is still singing the same tune, which is a tribute to him.  Even though he comes from County Kerry, he held on to the faith longer than anybody else.</P>

I believe he was in St. Patrick's College. I now know what my good friend, Deputy Spring, had to listen to when Deputy Higgins was a member of the Labour Party.  I understand Deputy Spring's tolerance level is not as high as Deputy Quinn's and I can understand the reason moves had to be made against Deputy Higgins. His view of how the economy should work is totally at odds with mine.  That would not be a national secret.</P>

      <P>As someone who believes in the market and that supply and demand regulates itself over a period, to introduce measures such as this is somewhat against my general view of the market rule.  I have always said that the job of the Government of the day is to make changes at particular times in a wide variety of areas.  In the longer term, however, the market usually regulates itself and it is difficult to buck the market, to quote a politician from across the water.</P>
      <P>I do not have any objection from an ideological or philosophical viewpoint about making specific changes in policy areas to overcome particular problems.  The sharp shock we have administered with this measure is having an effect.  I am not deaf to the concerns of Deputy Noonan and others about what might possibly occur in future.  The fundamental thesis of the Bacon report and the Government's response is to get the investors out of the market now.  There is no point in the Government or any other Deputy saying anything else in defending the Bacon report.  It is designed to get the investor out of the market. These measures will have the effect of doing that and consequently I am not in a position to accept Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Tellers: Tá, Deputies S. Brennan and Power; Níl, Deputies Barrett and Sheehan.</P>
    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(b), line 4, after &ldquo;writing&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or in pursuance of a deposit paid&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter on Second Stage the Minister said he would consider it, but this is not reflected in any of his proposed amendments. When he made his announcement on 23 April, transitional arrangements were made to cater for persons who are in the process of buying a property. Initially, the Minister announced these would fall into two categories.  First, if a written binding contract was in place prior to 23 April such a property would not be caught by the new fiscal restrictions.  Second, if the full purchase price had been paid by September, this property would not be caught by the restrictive provisions either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has given rise to difficulties which I outlined on Second Stage.  For example, if a bona fide buyer has made a booking deposit before 23 April, has obtained the agreement of a lending agency to provide the money, the mortgage is in writing, the solicitors for both vendor and purchaser are in the process of drawing up the contract but it is not completed, he or she is caught by the terms of the Bill and will be unable to avail of interest relief if purchasing an investment <Col N="225" /> property.  That is unfair on those who can prove they were bona fide purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has moved to meet the second problem, where people buy apartments or houses from the plans and sign the contract.  This is especially prevalent in Dublin.  However, the construction and conveyancing would not be completed and the money would not be paid by the proposed deadline of next September.  I thank the Minister for moving the deadline to the end of the year.  I am aware many people wanted it extended by a further 12 months but a limit must be put on these matters.  The end of the year is a reasonable concession.</P>
    <P>However, a concession should be made to the genuine purchaser.  It is too restrictive not to include a process which has reached the signing of the written contract and the payment of the normal 10 per cent deposit.  I know the Minister is concerned that looser provisions could be abused. However, it is possible for him to introduce an arrangement where, perhaps, a requirement could be made to produce a receipt for a deposit and a letter from a lending agency and solicitor. It is not beyond the regulators in his Department to produce a series of provisions which would put the case beyond doubt.  It is very unfair that transactions involving willing buyers and sellers, arranged prices which are not subject to gazumping and paid deposits should be caught by the provisions.  That is unfair.  The amendment attempts to solve the problem by inserting the words &ldquo;or in pursuance of a deposit paid&rdquo;.  If a deposit is paid along the lines I have suggested, that should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the situation reflected in the court case, the outcome of which was debated by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy on the Adjournment earlier this week, where the vendor decided to raise the asking price after a deposit had been paid.  In this instance, I am talking about somebody who paid a deposit prior to 23 April and a situation where there is no difficulty between purchaser and vendor.  Following the Minister's announcement, that person will lose interest relief on which they had based their calculations. It is a net point which I have raised with the Minister before.  I ask him to look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has merit.  It is my experience that people looking to buy a house put down a deposit in good faith.  I have rarely, if ever, come across a case where somebody deliberately puts down a deposit, notwithstanding the fact that it does not bring into play a binding contract, knowing they might pull out at a later stage. It is reasonable to accept that people who have placed a deposit are bona fide.  Unless the Minister has evidence that this is not the case, the case made by Deputy Noonan is persuasive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The effective decision to buy is made at the point at which the deposit is paid.  As we are all aware, <Col N="226" /> because of the lead-in times involved in terms of construction and conveyancing, contracts are not signed for some time after the effective decision to purchase has been made.  I do not want to get involved in the wider debate about the problems which have arisen, confirmed by the recent court judgment, in relation to the payment of a deposit which does not commit the vendor to hold the price but it is an issue on which legislation is required.  Acceptance of the amendment would be an indication of the Government's intention to go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 1 is to remove the deductibility of interest on borrowings used on or after 23 April last for the purchase, improvement or repair of rented residential properties.  However, to avoid hardship to persons who prior to that date were well advanced in their plans to purchase such properties, there are transitional arrangements for persons who were contractually committed to doing so at 23 April.  Deputy Noonan's proposal is that these arrangements should be extended to cover cases where there is no contractual commitment but a booking deposit has been paid.</P>
      <P>As with all transitional arrangements, some line has to be drawn.  Generally, when existing tax reliefs are being restricted, that line is fixed at the point where there is an obligation to complete the transaction.  If persons are obliged, because of contractual obligations entered into before the cut-off date, to go through with a purchase of rental property after that date, it is reasonable that they should come within the transitional provisions because they would have entered into the contract and arranged a loan on the basis that tax relief or interest would be available.  However, a booking deposit is, generally, not an obligation. Legally, it is no more than an expression of interest.</P>
      <P>As witnessed in the recent Durkan case, both parties can walk away from a booking deposit arrangement.  While that case rightly raises concerns about the unfortunate plight of the house purchaser faced with gazumping by builders in a rising market, those concerns are not entirely relevant in the case of transitional arrangements under the tax code.  That is a different matter.  I see no reason to depart from the normal transitional provisions in implementing the new interest restriction for rental residential property. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entering the area of contract law on which Deputy McDowell might give us some advice.  To regard a booking deposit as being the same as a written contract would be a major departure.  The purpose of the Government's package is to take the investor out of the market and allow first time buyers an opportunity to purchase. If the amendment is accepted, the only people who will benefit are those who have bought properties for investment purposes.  A booking deposit is no more than an expression of interest.  I am more interested in helping the first <Col N="227" /> time buyer than the investor.  The cut-off date for the completion of conveyancing has been altered from 30 September to 31 December in the sections dealing with interest deductibility and stamp duty.  That is a reasonable compromise in the circumstances.  I cannot move any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's decision to alter the cut-off date for the completion of conveyancing from 30 September to 31 December is welcome but I am speaking about the person who not only has paid a deposit but also incurred costs, including surveyor's fees, having entered into arrangements with a building society or bank.  Following the Minister's announcement, they have been cut off half way in their legal arrangements.  In one case which has been brought to my intention the contract had been signed by the purchaser and forwarded to the vendor's solicitor to be countersigned but the person concerned was caught because the vendor had not signed it.  I could cite several examples where arrangements have been made with building societies and expenses incurred.  I have been asked if a receipt for the deposit with a solicitor's letter attached is a contract.  It is not.  The Minister is taking an onerous view.</P>
      <P>The number of people involved is so small that the Minister's theory of supply and demand in damping down the market would not be affected. Allowing them to fall on the right side of the line would not negative the Minister's intention.  I accept there is a need for documentary evidence to avoid backdating but a letter from a solicitor or bank or building society stating that the transaction is bona fide and nearing finality should be sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners.  They should take a view that is lenient towards the person in the middle of a transaction.  This would not establish a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget night if one is caught on the wrong side of a tax increase, it is a case of tough luck, <Col N="228" /> but this is different.  There is an intervention to distort the market in favour of the owner-occupier rather than the investor.  We all go along with the general theory and are trying to fine-tune the relevant provisions but the Minister should be fair to those who are half way through a bona fide transaction and have not exchanged final contracts.  They should be included, otherwise it will be arbitrary.  Frequently, the only difference between the person who has paid a deposit and the person who has paid 10 per cent of the purchase price is the efficacy of the individual's solicitor. It often comes down to pressure of work in the solicitor's office and the availability of staff to sign documents.  The Minister should make a further concession.  He should request his officials to table a short amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment. The Deputy mentioned that costs have been incurred.  In relation to auctions, I know of hundreds of people who have incurred considerable costs in having houses surveyed and so on. As only one person can end up owning a house, the rest of the money is lost.  That is a normal business decision.</P>
      <P>The Deputy gave an example of where an individual signed a contract but the seller did not sign it.  I am advised this should not be necessarily interpreted as falling outside the scope of the provision and that the transaction may be covered.  It depends on the circumstances but the person should take up the matter with the Revenue Commissioners because it may not fall outside the scope of the transitional arrangements.</P>
      <P>If I started to interfere with contract law in terms of stating what are or are not contracts, I would be taking a route which I do not wish to take.  I cannot accept the amendment because I do not want to open up other areas.  The traditional arrangements are reasonable and I cannot go any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(b), to delete lines 40 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) in the purchase, improvement or repair of any premises, other than premises to which paragraph (c) applies, the site of which is wholly within a a qualifying rural area within the meaning of Chapter 8 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, or</P>
      <P>(e) in the purchase, improvement or repair of premises, other han premises to which paragraphs (c) and (d) apply, where&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates mainly to the non-application of interest restrictions in section 1 of the Bill to rented residential accommodation in qualifying rural areas.  As currently drafted, the exclusion in section 1(1)(d) is confined to section 23 type rental accommodation.  The amendment widens the scope of the exclusion to ensure that interest restrictions will also not apply to non-section 23 type rented accommodation.  Such accommodation could include, for example, properties not let for the full ten years required under section 23 rules.  It also includes rental property exceeding the maximum floor area of 125 square metres under section 23 rules.  The amendment will provide an additional incentive to invest in rural areas covered by the pilot rural renewal scheme.  That scheme covers parts of counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo as well as all Leitrim and Longford.  The amendment also includes a technical change to section 1(1)(e), clarifying that the exemptions for premises in that paragraph excludes premises already exempt under paragraphs (c) and (i).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>1.  After &ldquo;1997&rdquo; in the last line of paragraph (d) to insert &ldquo;or any other area in the County of Roscommon,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes overturning an unfair and discriminatory part of this Bill.  While the Minister was correct in designating the qualifying areas for rural renewal, he should have included all Roscommon, not just part of it, in his original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current proposals mean north Roscommon will have special incentives, and Roscommon, Athlone and Ballinasloe are set to be approved for urban renewal.  This will move investment out <Col N="231" /> of the rural areas of south Roscommon and destroy communities there, which is the direct opposite of the objective of the scheme.  A number of projects in the area have been frozen due to the current proposals.</P>
    <P>South Roscommon has a pressing need for new investment incentives.  The rural heartland of this area has experienced economic decline, depopulation, loss of services and lack of investment.  It has an underdeveloped tourist base, a high dependency on the declining agricultural sector, poor infrastructure, inadequate employment opportunities and an ageing population.  The exclusion of south Roscommon is also inconsistent, given that the county is designated as disadvantaged under the local development programme and included in the catchment area of the Western Development Commission, which aims to counteract the population decline in the region.  Fragmentation of the county by the Department of Finance for this scheme will create unnecessary inequity and division.  The incentives to encourage investment in Counties Longford, Leitrim, west Cavan, north Roscommon and Sligo will absorb mobile investment from adjacent areas, thus worsening the position for south Roscommon even further.  Furthermore, the areas of Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo included in this scheme already qualify for additional support under the support programme for peace and reconciliation, the INTERREG programme and the International Fund for Ireland.  The villages and small towns of south Roscommon will also lose out as they are too small to qualify under the new urban renewal scheme.  Evidence from recent censuses back up the case for the inclusion of the mid and south Roscommon areas.</P>
    <P>If we remove two DEDs around Athlone and two DEDs of Roscommon town, we would see that the overall population of that part of the county did not change between 1991 and 1996. Included in the scheme are DEDs with a population drop of approximately 3 per cent, yet parts of the county with a population drop of nearly 7 per cent are excluded.  Those statistics were submitted to the Minister in early March.  It is, therefore, logical and in the interests of equitable economic development within the Shannon basin that all County Roscommon should receive special status.</P>
    <P>That area is the only part of Connaught, bordering the river Shannon, which has been excluded from the scheme.  It is also the only part of the constituency of Longford-Roscommon which has been excluded and it begs the question as to the motives behind this proposal.  As the Government has not yet submitted the scheme for EU approval, there is still time for the Minister to reconsider his decision.  In the interests of fair play and the need for this scheme to be seen as such, I urge the Minister, in the strongest possible terms, to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Naughten's <Col N="232" /> amendment.  I want to point out the unique position of part of the constituency I represent. Leitrim comes under this area, but the Minister should consider including Ballintrillig, part of the Kinlough-Glenade parish in County Sligo, in the scheme because people from that area suffer the same socio-economic disadvantage as people who live across the road from them in the same parish. Difficulties concerning exclusion always arise when lines are drawn on maps and that area represents such a difficulty.  There are other areas in south Sligo which have sought inclusion in the scheme, but the parish of Kinlough, Glenade and Ballintrillig is unique and the Minister should consider including it and accept Deputy Naughten's amendment.</P>
      <P>I emphasise a point I made during yesterday's Second Stage debate.  I welcome the provision in section 23 for residential property, but a major difficulty with the rural renewal scheme is it will not give people an incentive to return to live in the counties from which they come.  County Leitrim which I represent, lacks population which is its major disadvantage.  If a scheme of tax incentives was introduced similar to the Greek example to which I referred on Second Stage, it would be of major benefit to this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Deputy Naughten's amendment.  What is the point in dividing County Roscommon in terms of this scheme?  All of the county I represent is included in it.  There was a rumour that County Longford would be divided in terms of inclusion in the scheme and I asked the Minister to ensure Longford was included in it.  I asked him then what had he against Longford and I now ask him what he has against Roscommon. There is much talk of bringing people together to live in harmony, but the Minister has drawn a line through County Roscommon and I ask him to change that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister outlined these proposals in his budget speech I was surprised he decided to include only the upper Shannon area in the scheme.  I thought he would have included all the areas along the Shannon in the scheme. The constituency I represent covers a large area of the Shannon stretching from Shannon Bridge down to Banagher.  Part of the Shannon Bridge electoral area has suffered a 15 per cent population decline.  That is a major loss.  It has given rise to problems in parishes with a decline in the numbers attending schools, threatened the viability of shops, post offices and other businesses that provide a service and resulted in job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have extended the scheme to include other areas further down the Shannon as all those areas will be affected.  A rural renewal scheme has been approved and given that there will also be a good deal of urban renewal, the area of County Offaly through which the Shannon flows should have been included in the scheme.  I am surprised and disappointed it has <Col N="233" /> not been and I ask the Minister to reconsider including it.  The Minister will be submitting his application for European Union approval.  When he examines the statistics for those areas and notes their population decline, he will realise, as I do, that there is no reason all the area of Ferbane and the Birr electoral area, which border the other areas along the Shannon, should not be included in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Naughten and Noonan have proposed a further amendment to amendment No. 3, which would have the effect of redrawing the boundaries of the existing rural renewal areas to exclude rental residential properties located anywhere in County Roscommon &mdash; not just in the designated areas in that county &mdash; from the scope of the interest restriction.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Bill debate earlier this year I dealt with a number of amendments which sought to extend the pilot scheme to a large number of counties, including Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo, Westmeath, Wicklow as well as parts of Cork, Waterford and Sligo.  It was inevitable that when particular areas were selected in the 1988 Finance Bill, there would be calls to have the scheme extended to cover other parts of the counties concerned and other counties.  I said at the time this was a pilot scheme and it would only work if the geographical scope of the measure was not too wide, otherwise its impact would be diluted.  I still hold that view and, therefore, I am not prepared on this occasion to make an exception in the case of Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a technical point.  Deputies are anxious that the pilot rural renewal scheme, rather than the area covered, should be extended, but the amendment tabled by Deputy Naughten would only extend the interest exemption to that part of Roscommon not in the rural renewal area. I know what he is trying to achieve.  There was a long debate on extending the rural renewal scheme on the Committee and Report Stages of the earlier Finance Bill.  When I put forward this proposal to the departmental officials, their reaction was we would not be able to control it.  The problem with such schemes is that there is a difficulty controlling them and sticking to the lines initially drawn in respect of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It reminds me of an experience concerning the seaside resort scheme.  I was Minister for Tourism and Trade in 1993 and I nearly secured agreement with the Department of Finance to introduce a pilot seaside resort renewal scheme before the 1994 budget.  I was not able to get agreement on that and I was going to confine such a scheme to a small number of areas.  By the following year we had more or less concluded negotiations and I said in the House subsequently that six or seven areas would be included in such a scheme. Unhappily differences arose between ourselves and the Labour Party and we were turfed out on the street in December 1994.  Deputy Kenny became Minister for Trade and Tourism and <Col N="234" /> Deputy Quinn introduced the Finance Bill, which included six or seven seaside resort renewal areas on lines of the scheme which I had brought forward. In fairness to Deputies Quinn and Kenny, they gave me the credit for coming up with the initial idea.  Before the Finance Bill passed through the Houses, it was extended to 15 resorts. I remember Deputy Quinn and I had an interesting exchange when I said I was disappointed it had not been extended to Naas.  At least Naas is situated on the River Liffey which flows into the sea and could be designated for seaside resort renewal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made up my mind to introduce the rural renewal scheme in an area, I picked one and stuck to it through thick and thin. Apart from representations from the other side of the House, I was bogged down by representations from members of my party.  I congratulate Opposition Deputies who tabled amendments which happened to include places like Donegal, Wicklow and parts of Kerry.  I was surprised by this, given the decision of the electorate at the last election and the number of TDs these areas elected to the House.  I resisted all thoughts of moving the lines.</P>
      <P>If we extend tax designation too widely, it is not worth anything.  If I extended tax designation to County Kildare, everyone would want to locate in Naas or Newbridge, for example, and it would be no good to places like Monasterevin and Athy. The reason I picked the Upper Shannon region was to have one contiguous area.  The other alternative for the rural renewal scheme was to pick areas of the country which met a certain criteria. That would have led to difficulties.  This was designed as a pilot scheme to see how it would work in this part of the country.</P>
      <P>I thought of County Offaly, which is located next to my county, more than any other.  A large part of County Offaly could do with investment and more activity.  Bord na Móna was the main industry there.  I accept what Deputy Enright said about parts of County Offaly but to extend the scheme to this area, I would have had to skip over other areas and I was not prepared to do so.</P>
      <P>Parts of County Mayo, which I visited recently and which I know well from spending much time there on business over the past 30 years, could do with being included but I applied the same principles.  I cannot pick an area because I would be inundated with requests.  There are areas to which an incentivisation scheme would be of benefit but I resisted extending it to these areas. I want to see how the scheme works in Leitrim, Longford, west Cavan, much of Sligo and north Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing against the people of County Roscommon and have happy memories of going there.  I had forgotten about the strange behaviour <Col N="235" /> of the electorate there in various elections, such as 1957, 1973 and 1989, and have even forgiven it for its aberrations on those occasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made the case for the inclusion of all County Longford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ensure the scheme was tightly drawn, there was the option to split the county.  However, I accepted what the Deputy said and I included the entire county.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to extend the rural renewal scheme or accept Deputy Naughten's amendment to give interest relief to all County Roscommon.  We will see how this pilot rural renewal scheme works.  The amendment I tabled and announced in a press release yesterday says that, as and from 1 June, the section 23 incentive can apply in this area because it does not need EU approval, unlike the rest of the package which needs Commission approval.</P>
      <P>I will be interested to see how this pilot scheme works.  Successive Ministers for Finance were asked to introduce rural renewal schemes, but they shied away from it because of the pressure of trying to keep it to a confined area.  I took my political life in my hands by introducing it on this occasion.  I am not in a position to extend the scheme for the reasons I outlined when the Finance (No. 1) Bill, 1998, passed through the House and I cannot accept Deputy Naughten's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point in relation to extending it to other areas, but County Roscommon has already been approved for this scheme.  The part of the county to which I refer has the same economic problems as the area which has been included.  The Minister is creating a new border within County Roscommon at a time when we are trying to break down borders in this country and in the EU.  This decision will be a huge disincentive to investment.  The south and mid-Roscommon areas have lost many young people, this move will cement that loss and encourage more young people to leave rural areas.  There will be a further flight from the land.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 3 put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(b), line 20 after &ldquo;year&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a condition that the premises shall be used only as a holiday home and should remain available for short-term holiday lettings.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment of the Minister for Finance to the Finance Bill, 1996, had been accepted, an additional seaside resort, Bray, would have been <Col N="236" /> included.  Unfortunately, the Minister's amendment was not accepted.</P>
    <P>The reason I tabled this amendment is that the section which relates to it mentions planning conditions and uses exact phraseology.  It states that a holiday home should not be used by any person for residential use in excess of two consecutive calendar months.  Some local authorities include a similar condition in planning but may not use the wording in the Bill.  The reason I tabled the amendment is to cover such eventualities.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made this point in his Second Stage contribution and we considered it overnight.  I am glad he raised this point which will result in a satisfactory outcome.  As part of the transitional arrangements, holiday cottages and other self-catering accommodation are excluded from the scope of the interest restriction if they meet certain conditions.  The premises in question are those in respect of which an application for planning permission was received by a local authority before 23 April 1998 and whether planning permission, when received, includes a condition that the premises cannot be let for more than two consecutive months to any one person and such a condition is still in force in the tax year in which rents are received.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the two months condition was to ensure that such premises would only qualify for the transitional arrangements when they were genuinely holiday-type or tourist related accommodation and not available for long-term residential use.  Deputy Timmins's amendment seeks to extend the exemption to cover cases where planning permission requires that the premises be used only as a holiday home and remain available for short-term holiday lettings.  The difficulty with the definition of &ldquo;short-term&rdquo; in these circumstances is that local authorities tend to use different wordings in opposing what is essentially the same condition in planning permissions.  The Deputy may have in mind a holiday cottage development in County Wicklow which received planning permission subject to the condition that the units should not be permanently occupied and should be available for tourist rental.  While there is no specific mention of two months in the permission, the Revenue Commissioners will not take a literal interpretation of the two month rule and will allow exemption in any case where the use of the premises is clearly confined, as part of the planning permission, to short-term lettings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as drafted refers to two consecutive calendar months.  We recognise that some planning authorities do not put that exact wording in their planning permissions.  In the example given by the Deputy in County Wicklow, the purpose is to have short-term lettings, but because there is no mention of the two consecutive calendar months the Deputy is concerned that it would not qualify for the exemption.  The Revenue Commissioners will not take a literal interpretation of <Col N="237" /> the section as drafted when the purpose is clearly, as in the example given, to have short-term lettings for holiday cottages.  There is no need, therefore, to press the amendment.  The holiday cottage scheme in west Wicklow is quite safe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for replying to Deputy Timmins' request, but would it not be better if the discretion exercised by the Revenue Commissioners was founded in law?  Consequently, would it not be better to accept the amendment so that there would be a legal basis for the Revenue Commissioners in exercising their discretion and it would not be challenged subsequently for being tied into a two-month provision, which the Minister has suggested they will ignore?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with Deputy Timmins' amendment is that technically it would not work as drafted.  The purpose of the section is to allow this type of interest deductibility in these circumstances and that will continue to apply.  If there is any difficulty in that &mdash; I am sure there will not be &mdash; I would be willing to draft a suitable amendment for the next Finance Bill.  I thank Deputy Timmins for bringing the matter to our attention because it was necessary to put on record what I have just said and if there is a query in future it can be stated that the Minister said this in the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(b), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) in the purchase of a premises which, on the 23rd day of April, 1998 and at all times during the 12 month period ending on that day, was subdivided into individual units for the purposes of rental accommodation provided that the premises continues to be subdivided in such a manner and complies with all relevant regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the changes in respect of interest relief on mortgages on rental property.  In the present property market in Dublin a number of houses which were divided into bedsitters or flats, particularly in the south inner city, are being restored to owner-occupancy.  That is a trend of which many people approve, but it has the effect of taking much rental accommodation out of the market.  As soon as a large house in Leinster Road or lower Rathgar, which is divided into a multiplicity of bedsitters, goes back to owner-occupancy, many tenants will have <Col N="238" /> to seek accommodation elsewhere.  Under the new arrangements this trend could magnify.</P>
    <P>If a property that is subdivided into individual units comes on the market, because the owner-occupier will be able to avail of interest relief while the potential investor will not, the market will be skewed in favour of the owner-occupier and those properties will return to owner-occupancy. As a result, a significant amount of rental capacity available in the south inner city will be taken out of the market.  That underlines some of the difficulties I pointed out.  Dr. Bacon and the Minister are overdoing it with this measure.  In an attempt to rectify a difficulty in the market, a major rental difficulty will be created in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Finding a new equilibrium in the rental market in the medium term is not a solution that will satisfy the needs of prospective tenants.  Many of those houses will go out of commission.  The Minister is a great believer in the market, as I am, but where a house in Ranelagh, Rathgar or Rathmines goes up for auction and it is a contest between somebody who wants to keep it in flats and bedsitters and somebody who wants to use it as an owner-occupier residence, the arithmetic favours the owner-occupier because they will get mortgage interest relief whereas the investor will not.  I am not making a point in favour of the investor or the owner-occupier, but a quantum of rental accommodation will be taken out of the market.  That trend is there already and these provisions will reinforce it.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment, if a premises that is subdivided for rental purposes into a number of individual units is sold, the purchaser of the premises would be able to avail of mortgage relief on the borrowing needed to purchase the premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">

      <P>This is a question that must be addressed and the Bill addresses it.  The purpose of the Bill is to skew the market in favour of the first time buyer.  Some rental accommodation will be taken out of the marketplace, but there is no gain without pain.  The Minister is ensuring the price of accommodation generally for first time house buyers will be reduced to an affordable level.  Multi-unit properties have been converted to single residential units.  There will now be a reluctance on the part of owners of multi-unit dwellings to put them on the market because they believe they will get a lower price than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the purpose of this Bill has been served over a period of years the question of the residential property market and rent payable will have to be addressed.  At present the price of houses is totally out of the reach of first time house buyers. Even where two people are working in a family unit it is practically impossible to buy a house. That applies to houses not only in the inner city but in other areas such as Tallaght where the house prices have increased to £165,000.  In Lucan the price of a house is at least that which applies <Col N="239" /> in Tallaght.  There must be a reduction in house prices.</P>
    <P>The 12-unit house may be purchased by a person who will not continue to rent it.  It might be an opportunity to convert that house into self-contained units which could come on the market as a product which first time buyers could purchase. That would help first time buyers to purchase a reasonably priced unit.  As multi-unit property is purchased and converted to single unit use, houses lower in the market are freed up and property becomes available for first time buyers.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to multi-unit property and lower priced accommodation in the city.  However, the severity of the problem is less than Deputy Noonan makes out.  Taking into account the purpose of the Bill to skew the market in favour of first time buyers I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment seeks to exclude from the restriction on interest on borrowed money being imposed by section 1 the purchase at any time after 23 April of rented premises which in the 12 months prior to 23 April was subdivided into accommodation units.  The rationale for the exclusion is that in the absence of interest relief investors will be discouraged from purchasing such properties which will then revert to owner occupier use with a consequent loss of rental accommodation.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to amendment No. 1 the Bill is designed to balance the housing market more in favour of the home owner than the investor. The analysis of the Bacon report is that the Bill should not undermine the rental sector where demand is strong and growing with rental values well underpinned.  The properties which the Deputy has in mind should continue to be a good investment for landlords, notwithstanding the non-availability of interest relief.  Existing owners of such properties will retain the right to an interest deduction and this should be a positive incentive to improve and refurbish their properties. In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has made a strong case on the issue of rental accommodation.  Before these proposals were made many of the houses in the areas he mentioned were becoming owner occupied houses because the market was moving in that direction.  These measures will encourage that move.  As Deputy Ardagh pointed out, the Government seeks to achieve a distorting effect to give less incentive to the investor.  The measures are severe but they are deliberate.</P>
      <P>I cannot give a firm commitment that I will revisit the subject matter of the amendment in the near future.  I want to gauge the effect of the package of measures introduced with this Bill and those being taken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On budget day I pointed out the difficulties that were emerging in the Dublin housing market but I got little support.  My position on this issue is strong.  For a long time I have been calling for a package of measures along the lines proposed in the Bacon report.  Supply and demand in Dublin needs to be regulated and the housing market needs to be dampened down.  The Minister has moved to do that and there are measures in the Bill of which I approve and others of which I do not.  In the course of this debate I have tried to illustrate that there will be a crisis in rental accommodation in Dublin within a year to 18 months.  I can see it coming as clearly as I saw the crisis in the owner occupied sector of the market.</P>
      <P>When these measures are being analysed it should be on the basis of what is being proposed. The Minister has not departed from the text of the proposals but Deputy Ardagh did so.  He suggested that the measures are being introduced to skew the market in favour of first time buyers. There is not a single provision directed exclusively at first time buyers.  The Bill does nothing for first time buyers as distinct from other buyers. The measures are directed at the generality of buyers.  The skewing of the market is against the investor in rental accommodation in favour of owner occupation.</P>
      <P>We can pledge ourselves to maintain the up to 85 per cent level of owner occupancy.  However, many of us are of the view that despite our best efforts to skew the market this country will go the way of other European countries and there will be an increase in the rental sector.  The House will soon have to address the issue of protecting tenants through long leases, proper rent reviews and security of tenure.  We must examine how we can arrive at a point where the rigours of the market, which the Minister praises so much, do not come down on the heads of tenants who will find themselves on the street seeking to be housed by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There is not a single measure directed exclusively at first time buyers.  It is a fallacy to think there is.  I have tabled amendments on stamp duty directed specifically at first time buyers.  On the basis of this legislation first time buyers will be the last people who will buy houses on Leinster Road, take out the bedsit units and restore them to prestige residences.  For town planning and environmental reasons we applaud the reconversion of such houses.  However, it will not be first time buyers who purchase them as prestige residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This package is designed deliberately to skew the market and the Minister is quite up-front about it.  However, it is not being done to help first time buyers.  There may be provisions for first time buyers in the measures being adopted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  If supply is increased and many new houses are built all owner occupiers will be helped.  The difficulty about supply and demand is that they are not separate issues but are inextricably <Col N="241" /> linked.  If demand is dampened down builders and developers will adjust supply to meet demand and there will be an equilibrium at a lower level.</P>
    <P>People think that demand is always economic demand backed by cash.  There is a wider social demand for housing beyond that which is represented by the local authority housing lists.  It is a fundamental error to think that supply and demand are totally separate.  They are always tied together.  If demand is dampened down the people who are putting up money to provide the supply to meet the demand will wind it down to meet it at a new equilibrium point.  That is how the market operates.  As a proponent of the market the Minister knows that better than anyone.</P>
    <P>I hope the measures being introduced will work.  I have serious doubts about some aspects of them, particularly about what will happen to the rental market.  A crisis in that sector could occur very soon.  It is a crisis that will not have as rapid a political effect as the owner-occupier problem.  That is because the category of mobile people who rent are not as well organised.  Many do not vote and are not even on the voters' register. The crisis might be there for six months before the Minister realised it, and then all hell would break loose.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made a commitment to keep a very close eye on this and that he has taken on board, at least on an intellectual level, the arguments I am putting forward, because if it goes out of control there will be a difficulty.  In the meantime the Minister should set people in the Department the task of working out how we will organise an increasing rental market and give the lease arrangements and security of tenure that people have in other jurisdictions, for example, France.  There ordinary middle class people live in Paris in apartments and would not hope to own their own homes, and they are quite happy with that arrangement because there is a developed rental market, security, fair rents and proper reviews.  In this situation people find they are not dedicating as high a proportion of their income to housing themselves as they would here. That needs to be looked at because the property market is indivisible, and it is not possible to pull a string at one end of it without affecting it elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I regret that the crucial points Deputy Noonan has just touched on in regard to the first time buyer have not been at the centre of this debate for the past two hours, largely because Deputy Noonan's party concentrated on marginal issues rather than getting to the meat of the problem which is the terrible plight of people attempting to put a roof over their heads for the first time, those on the housing lists and those who cannot afford rented accommodation as it obtains at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we are almost at the end of the debate the Minister should say what he intends to do about the person on the average industrial wage <Col N="242" /> of £15,000 for whom house prices have gone out of reach.  While the Minister's proposals may slow down the rate of increase, they will not bring those prices down within the reach of the person on the average industrial wage.  What does the Minister propose to do to rectify that?  The shared ownership scheme, which was a way for low to middle income people to provide a home, is paralysed. I welcome the increase of the ceiling limit to £20,000, but that does not help the person on £15,000 or less.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must therefore come forward rapidly with more proposals, from a major change in the share ownership scheme to a restructuring, so that the average house in Dublin and other areas can be purchased or part purchased by the person on the low to average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The weakness in the Bacon report, and it is also a weakness in this Bill, is that the house price horse has gone through the roof, and the Minister for Finance haplessly fumbling at the stable door does not resolve the issue.  That is the nub of the problem.  I and my constituents, and ordinary working people generally, want to know what the Minister intends to do, and this relates also to the thousands on local authority housing lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a difficult morning. In my relatively short time in this House, five or six years, I have rarely come across a situation where on such an important Bill we have got through just two or three amendments, a relatively small fraction of what was to be discussed. It means, for example, that the reduction in capital gains tax will not be visited, and that is an appalling state of affairs.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 1, the Labour Party supported the Government, for the first time during the tenure of the current Government.  This is a matter of demand and supply and although we have not got around to discussing issues of supply we will not do so at this stage.  However, in so far as there is a single most important demand issue, it is the issue that is dealt with in section 1.  The measure which the Government has taken to skew demand in a particular way is by far the most important measure on that side of the equation that has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we require a significant shift, a brutal shift, from what is currently happening in the market to what we want to see happening, and that will be largely to the benefit of first time buyers.  Currently the new house and new apartment market is largely a competition between investors and first time buyers, and over the past year or so first time buyers have been rapidly losing the battle.  We needed to redress the balance, and the measure proposed in section 1 will do that.  I do not exclude the possibility of coming back to that in two or three years' time, but in the current state of the market it was absolutely necessary to do it.  I hope this also has the effect of stabilising the price particularly of apartments but also of houses.  It may even reduce the <Col N="243" /> price of some apartments in this city and elsewhere. That would be a good thing and to the benefit of first time buyers.  It was for that reason that my party supported the Government this morning.  It is an appropriate measure at this time.  It is not appropriate that the taxpayer should give incentives to investors to price first time buyers out of the market.  It is appropriate that we should make this correction.  We may have to come back to it in two or three years' time but I believe the measure will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a dreadful miscalculation &mdash; for which I take my share of the blame &mdash; that we have only discussed one substantial issue relating to a major social problem.  There has been no other forum in which to discuss it. Nothing of any significance has been forthcoming from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that would have enabled us to have a discussion on this.  We have now dealt with one question only and are obliged to guillotine the debate.</P>
      <P>It is a cruel deception for the word to go abroad, if intelligent back bench Deputies like Deputy Ardagh seriously believe it, that this Bill will do something for first time buyers.  Whatever else it does, it does not do that.  Whatever the merit of Deputy Noonan's amendments so far today, this Bill does nothing for first time buyers. When the Minister, on the more substantial question of capital gains tax, shelters behind Dr. Bacon, it should be pointed out to him that the one recommendation Dr. Bacon made that would help first time buyers was on the question of stamp duty, and that is the one that the Minister resiled from.  It should not therefore be allowed to go abroad that this Bill is for first time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in the circumstances of this Bill, it is a disgraceful surrender to the development lobby that the Minister decided to cut capital gains tax on development land from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Already owners of development land are gaining enormous windfall profits.  There is a very strong argument for a windfall tax to control the situation, but instead of a windfall tax on profit <Col N="244" /> with a factor of 20, the Minister is giving an additional bonus by cutting capital gains tax liability in half.  That is a disgraceful surrender to a lobby that has given the Minister a very hot time since he decided to cut capital gains tax in the budget, which fuelled the problem we are discussing now.  It is particularly regrettable that we have not been able to deal with that.  Anybody who thinks that any new government, from whichever side of the House, will impose a rate of 60 per cent after 2002 on developers who release land for development in an expanding city is not living in the real world.  Nobody would believe in that kind of carrot and stick approach. This is all carrot for people who do not need it. There is very little in this Bill for those who do need it.</P>
    <P>There is no time to discuss the question of the provision of social housing, in terms of the joint ownership scheme and the limits that apply in respect of local authority and other loan facilities that are available at the moment, for the numbers of people that are being put on to the housing list who, in normal circumstances, could have expected to own their own homes.  This is a bad day's work and we will have to call a vote on the Bill because it is regrettable that we only had the opportunity to deal with one of the substantive issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill is a major improvement in the law protecting the marine environment.  It will significantly improve the compensation available for pollution caused by tanker spills.  Specifically, it will increase the maximum compensation available for tanker spills threefold; extend the scope of application of existing international conventions to include unladen tankers and seagoing vessels which were adapted for the carriage of oil in bulk; provide for compensation for measures taken in anticipation of an oil spill; provide for compensation for clean-up operations where the source of pollution cannot be identified; oblige ship owners to have adequate insurance cover; extend our jurisdiction for oil pollution purposes from 12 miles to 200 miles; and ensure that liability for compensation rests primarily with ship owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's geographical location at the apex of some of the busiest shipping routes in the world leaves us vulnerable to the threat of serious pollution incidents.  Deputies will recall the <i>Sea Empress</i> accident in Milford Haven in 1996 which led to a spillage of about 72,000 tonnes of oil, the effects of which were felt as far away as Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford and Cork.  Our coastline, stretching for some 7,800 kilometres, is one of our great natural resources.  It is vital that it is protected <Col N="247" /> from the devastating effects that such massive releases of oil can cause.</P>
    <P>The legislation will bring Irish law governing compensation for oil pollution damage into line with the highest international standards.  It will provide strong safeguards for our seas and coastal communities in the event of damage to our beaches and other shoreline amenities.  Its benefit will be felt by fishermen, fish farmers, tourism interests and all those who depend on the sea for their livelihoods.  As Minister responsible for the marine resource, I am committed to a cleaner marine environment.  The legislation is evidence of that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988 gives effect in Irish law to two international conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and to their 1976 protocols, namely, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, commonly known as the Civil Liability Convention, and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, commonly known as the Fund Convention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the 1988 Act in order to give effect in Irish law to two further protocols amending these conventions, both of which were adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in 1992.  The measures proposed provide for an increase in the maximum compensation payable in respect of any one incident from £58 million to £130.5 million and, in circumstances where there are at least three adherent states to the revised conventions with combined crude and fuel oil imports of at least 600 million tonnes, up to £195 million.</P>
    <P>The new measures also provide for much wider scope in the application of the conventions.  Seagoing vessels which are adapted for the carriage of oil in bulk as cargo will now be covered, whereas only vessels specifically constructed for this purpose are covered under existing measures. Pollution damage caused by spills of oil from unladen tankers will be covered, whereas only laden tankers are covered at present.  The measures will extend our jurisdiction for oil pollution purposes from the present 12 miles limit to a distance of 200 miles.  Also, compensation will be payable for pre-spill preventative measures taken to avert an imminent danger of pollution damage, which is important to this country.</P>
    <P>The Civil Liability Convention obliges owners of tankers with an oil cargo capacity of more than 2,000 tonnes to maintain insurance cover for their liability for oil pollution damage.  Tankers must carry on board a certificate issued by their flag administration attesting to the insurance cover of the ship.  Under existing arrangements the limit of a shipowner's liability is about £13.6 million irrespective of the size of the ship; under the new measures proposed in the Bill this limit is being raised to £58 million for a ship exceeding 140,000 tons.  A new limit of about £2.9 million will apply <Col N="248" /> to small ships of less than 5,000 tons and ships between 5,000 and 140,000 tons will be liable for pollution damage for amounts between £2.9 million and £55 million, depending on their actual tonnage.</P>
    <P>The International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, known as the IOPC Fund, operates within the framework of the conventions, establishing a legal regime for supplementary compensation for pollution damage.  The IOPC Fund was established by the International Maritime Organisation to supplement the level of compensation available from shipowners under the Civil Liability Convention.  Under existing arrangements the shipowner can apply to the IOPC Fund for indemnification for part of his liability.  This facility has proved to be a cause of delays and the cost of processing claims has taken a significant share of the fund's resources.  Indemnification by the fund is now withdrawn, so that shipowners will have to pay their full liability as assessed in each case.  This change is the application of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle to which I am fully committed. The resources thus saved by the IOPC Fund will provide for the proposed increased levels of compensation for pollution damage, while at the same time keeping the levels of payment of the fund contributors under control.</P>
    <P>There are at present 76 member states, including Ireland, participating under the Civil Liability and Fund Conventions.  On 16 May next, 24 of these states, including Ireland, will become members of the new regime to which the 1992 protocols give effect and which is commonly referred to as the 1992 fund.  I regard it as vitally important that Ireland is in a position to apply the new arrangements by 16 May and ask for the co-operation of Deputies in progressing this Bill as speedily as possible.  I thank those Deputies who have given assurances in this regard.</P>
    <P>The 1992 fund will be viable and able to meet all obligations of the new measures because the membership, while still small, includes most of the large industrial states of the world, who are the largest contributors to the IOPC Fund. Annual contributions to the international compensation fund are levied by the fund administration on oil importers in member states who have imported, by sea, more than 150,000 tonnes of oil in the previous calendar year.  There will be no change in this system under the new regime.</P>
    <P>There are three importers in Ireland liable for contributions to the fund: the ESB, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Aughinish Alumina.  The size of annual contributions will vary according to the amount of oil eligible for levy and the number and size of claims settled in any one year.  The total annual contribution made by the Irish importers up to now is in the region of £80,000.  While it is not possible to estimate accurately the effects of the new regime on current levels of contributions, it is likely that current levels will not be greatly exceeded.</P>
    <P>I have examined the sections of the 1988 Act not being amended by the Bill and found them <Col N="249" /> adequate and operating satisfactorily.  Two sets of regulations are in force under sections 16 and 19 relating to insurance certification for Irish registered ships and returns and contributions by Irish contributors to the IOPC Fund, respectively. Since the 1992 protocols do not amend these sections substantially, amending the regulations will involve little more than a change in title. Likewise, section 40, which provides for penalties for offences with regard to these regulations, as well as the provisions for the detention of ships under section 13 and the powers of inspectors and harbour masters under sections 32 and 33, are adequate and in no need of change.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to table any amendments on Committee Stage.  I will, however, ask the Clerk of the Dáil under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle to make a correction of a verbal nature to sections 2 and 9 in accordance with Standing Order 126.  In section 2, line 23, there should be no reference to section 3(2) and the reference to section 3(1) in lines 27 and 32 respectively, all on page 3 of the Bill, should refer instead to section 3.  In section 3, line 4 of page 4, the number &ldquo;(1)&rdquo; should be deleted.  Section 9(b) refers to the &ldquo;International Regulations of the Fund&rdquo;&mdash; this should be the &ldquo;Internal Regulations of the Fund&rdquo;.  The error arose during the drafting of a Committee Stage amendment introduced in the Seanad.  The text of the Bill as initiated refers correctly to the &ldquo;Internal Regulations of the Fund&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Proper management and protection of our marine environment must be achieved through a blend of strong legislative control, comprehensive research and the provision of a solid infrastructure to deal with potential emergencies.  This Bill is only one of a number of important measures for the protection of the marine environment which have been introduced recently or are currently in preparation.  Last month the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the north-east Atlantic, known as the OSPAR Convention, came into operation.  Fifteen European states, including Ireland, are party to this convention, which consolidates the original Oslo and Paris conventions and takes account of developments since they were signed in the early 1970s.  The new convention places particular emphasis on the need to increase our knowledge of the state of the marine environment.  To this end Ireland is actively participating in the preparation of a quality status report for the north-east Atlantic which will be completed in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>In July I will be representing Ireland at the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission in Lisbon.  This will be the first ministerial meeting of the commission to take place under the new convention and will provide the political impetus for future action to ensure a sustainable marine environment in the north-east Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Last December I updated the regulations made under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which give effect to the International Maritime Organisation's Convention for the Prevention of Pollution <Col N="250" /> from Ships, known as the MARPOL Convention. The updated regulations provide for the control and prevention of pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances carried by tankers and garbage. At the same time I introduced a new set of MARPOL regulations for the control of the carriage at sea of harmful substances in packaged form.  I have also signed new port state control regulations providing for systematic inspections of a minimum of 25 per cent of all vessels calling at our ports with a view to confirming that they comply with the various internationally agreed conventions in relation to safety and pollution prevention.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to taking all possible steps to protect the public from dangers associated with the nuclear industry, and I will refer to two important initiatives I have taken since becoming Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  Last November, I travelled to London to address the 20th Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation on the subject of the INF code, which governs the transport by sea of irradiated nuclear fuels.  I pressed the assembly to agree that the code be adopted as a mandatory binding code by all IMO states and I am pleased that agreement was reached on making the code mandatory.  I regard this as a significant step forward in improving the conditions under which nuclear materials are transported by sea, but I assure the House that I will continue my efforts to bring about further improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>Last year, I established a Task Force on Radioactive Dumping in the wake of revelations by the UK authorities that nuclear waste had been dumped in the Beaufort Dyke, between Scotland and Northern Ireland, and at a number of other locations around the coast of the UK during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  The Government viewed these revelations with great concern and I immediately travelled to London to discuss the matter with the UK Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP.  I am pleased that I have received the fullest co-operation from the UK authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>The task force was asked to review and assess the information becoming available on the dumping of radioactive materials and, based on this review, to advise on survey, monitoring and management measures to ensure maximum protection for our marine resources and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment. I expect to receive the report of the task force shortly and I intend to publish it in due course.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sellafield, I welcome the commitment given by the UK Government to cut discharges into the Irish Sea.  The risks to the Irish public and to the environment posed by discharges from Sellafield are wholly unacceptable. The Government is committed to continuing its campaign against Sellafield and has established a ministerial committee on Sellafield and on radio-logical protection generally, on which my Department <Col N="251" /> is represented by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Byrne.</P>
    <P>I will shortly implement another measure which is closely related to the measures proposed in this Bill.  This is the Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention, 1990, known as the OPRC convention, which is designed to ensure that proper arrangements are in place in each member state to deal with emergency situations arising from spillages of oil at sea.  It calls for member states to have a major national emergency plan ready to deal with major spillages and to co-operate with IMO and adjoining states in planning for and dealing with oil pollution incidents.  Amendment of the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which is required to provide for this measure in Irish law, is already in hand.  In the meantime, while waiting for our accession to the OPRC convention, the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department is already implementing its important features.</P>
    <P>I also intend to give effect in law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996, which is commonly known as the HNS convention.  This is along similar lines to the regime for oil pollution damage, which is the object of this Bill, and will be a welcome addition to our marine environment protection measures. Primary legislation, which is required for our accession to the HNS convention, is in the course of being drafted and I expect to be in a position to introduce a Bill later this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will no doubt be struck by the range of international agreements in the area of environmental protection.  The protection of our marine environment is an international issue and it is only through international agreement that real progress can be achieved.  Ireland is committed to participating in the work of organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation, OSPAR and the European Union to ensure that the highest possible standards of environmental protection are agreed and implemented.</P>
    <P>I have ordered a thorough assessment of the risk from large tankers approaching or passing our coast which become disabled.  The danger of massive pollution damage in these cases can be reduced or eliminated by using sufficiently powerful specialised towing vessels which keep potential pollutants in a disabled vessel, and the vessel, afloat.  Vessels which are a danger to our marine and coastal environment can be stopped in their tracks and diverted from our coasts and valuable fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>I have mandated the marine advisory emergency group, under the chairmanship of the Irish Marine Emergency Service, to investigate the need for emergency towing vessels as a potent force for pollution prevention in marine emergencies. Currently we rely solely on the availability and capability of commercial vessels.  We should at least have one of these vessels under our own <Col N="252" /> control, even in the interim, and use the commercial facilities in addition to that vessel.  That is another aspect of the approach we are taking.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important new measure to deal with oil pollution.  It will bring Ireland into line with the highest international standards.  It will substantially increase the protection of our marine resource.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as its primary objective is to protect our coastline and coastal communities from the ravages that an oil spillage can inflict.  I am aware that a fund is currently maintained by the oil importers, namely, Aughinish Alumina Limited, the ESB and the INPC.  The reason the fund is restricted to those companies is that it only applies to importers who imported by sea more than 150,000 tonnes in the previous year.  I understand the total annual contribution is in the region of £80,000.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that compensation payment is being increased from £58 million to £130.5 million for a single incident.  The Bill is important because it strengthens the compensation likely to be paid in the event of damage inflicted by oil on fish farming, tourism interests, fishermen and local authorities.</P>
      <P>In the past, only purpose built tankers were covered by legislation but now seagoing vessels which have been adapted for transporting oil will be covered.  I also welcome the fact that unladen tankers will be covered under the new legislation. The extension of the jurisdiction for oil pollution damage from 12 to 200 miles is welcome.</P>
      <P>While generally welcoming the Bill, I am concerned about the statement in it that no liability for pollution damage shall attach to the owners of a floundered ship if it can be proved that the damage is the result of negligence on the part of a Government or an agency responsible for the maintenance of navigational aids.  As the charting of our waters was carried out by the British Admiralty more than 150 years ago, how can the Minister be confident we are protected if a ship flounders due to out of date chart data and faulty navigational aids?  When does the Minister intend to proceed with a proper hydrographic survey of our waters, which is long overdue, to protect us against this eventuality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the introduction of legislation of this nature is desirable and laudable, we must ensure we do not leave ourselves open to a court challenge as a result of not having our own house in order. In 1996, we watched on our television screens the serious damage done to the Welsh coastline by an oil spillage when the <i>Sea Empress</i> ran aground.  The effect of that oil spillage was felt along our southern and eastern coastlines and were it not for favourable weather conditions at the time, the effect might have been much more serious.  In 1993, the <i>MV Braer</i> broke up off the Shetland Islands and spilled 84,000 tonnes of oil into the sea.  The reopening of the Whiddy oil terminal recently, with the arrival of the <i>MV Prospect Bay</i>, reminded us of the horrible tragedy that <Col N="253" /> occurred 20 years ago when the <i>MV Betelgeuse</i> exploded with the tragic loss of 51 lives.</P>
    <P>In regard to coastal erosion, it is a source of major disappointment that just over £5 million was negotiated under the Operation Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99.  An allocation of £1 million per year to combat coastal erosion was derisory and did not reflect reality when one considers the scope of the problem.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out in 1992 by the national coastal erosion committee of the County and City Engineers' Association, it was estimated that 5,800 kilometres of coastline was at risk from erosion and that at least £125 million would be required to address the coastal areas at risk.  I remind the Minister that the figure of £125 million was based on evidence obtained in 1992.</P>
    <P>The firm of consultants Brady, Shipman and Martin were paid £131,000 recently to prepare a response on coastal zone management.  They estimated that coastal erosion causes a loss of land of between 160 and 300 hectares a year.  Unless a serious attempt is made to provide proper funding under the next operational programme, large parts of our coastline will be lost to the sea.</P>
    <P>As a result of revelations by the UK authorities that nuclear waste was being dumped in the Beaufort Dyke between Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Minister decided to set up a task force.  The Bill is restricted to tankers.  What sanctions, if any, apply to merchant ships and bunker oil spillages?  Many of the large merchant vessels carry more oil than a great deal of the smaller tankers.  Given the volume of merchant ships that operate in and out of Irish ports, there is a necessity to introduce safeguards in this area and compensation mechanisms because of the inherent oil pollution risks.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's urgency in expediting the legislation as he is most anxious to expedite the Bill before 16 May, with 23 other countries.  I welcome the Bill and see it as a progressive step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this Bill.  As the Minister said we have agreed to co-operate fully with him because we appreciate the urgency in having the Bill enacted.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for some much needed increases in penalties so that parties who have been on the receiving end of damage caused by oil pollution can be compensated adequately.  It also makes provision for shipping companies to have sufficient insurance to cover liability and it extends Ireland's jurisdiction for oil pollution purposes.  In particular, I welcome the extension of the 12 mile limit to 200 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coastline is one of our most valuable resources, providing a stable economy for many communities involved in the fishing and tourism industries.  It also provides a home for wildlife unique to Ireland and is vital in the management of water supply and waste disposal.  Our coastline is not just important to us as a nation, our surrounding waters provide one of the busiest shipping <Col N="254" /> routes in the world and the transportation of oil accounts for a substantial proportion of this shipping.  It is, therefore, vital to provide as many safeguards against pollution as possible while also ensuring our economy is not devastated in the event of a major spillage.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers a mechanism to prevent huge financial losses in the event of an oil spillage but in terms of making provision to prevent a major disaster the Bill is lacking.  While I welcome the Bill I do not believe it can stand alone as a measure to prevent and deal with oil pollution. We need to learn the lessons from major oil spillage disasters that have occurred not far from here.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate not to have had any major disaster due to oil pollution.  However, in many ways, we have been lucky to have escaped the effects of disasters such as the grounding of the <i>Sea Empress</i> in Milford Haven in 1989 and the breaking up of the <i>Braer</i> off the Shetland Islands in 1987, when 84,000 tonnes of oil were spilt.</P>
    <P>In response to the Milford Haven disaster, a major initiative was launched in Wales to ensure against further disasters and to generally improve the quality of the Welsh coastal environment. This initiative involves a range of interest groups comprising local authorities, the Welsh Tourist Board and representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors who have a vested interest in the Welsh coastline.  They work to ensure the Welsh waters are clean and that the beaches are of the highest quality.  Similar initiatives in Ireland would lead to a greater awareness of the importance of our coastline and the need to maintain high standards.</P>
    <P>Developments in the shipping of cargo have changed dramatically in recent decades.  Cost factors have, in many instances, resulted in the employment of cheap labour and low cost crews to operate ships.  Many of these crews do not receive sufficient training and would be unable to deal with an emergency and employ safety procedures in the case of a major oil spillage.  To this end, we need more stringent policing at an international level to ensure all safety standards are adhered to and that a benchmark for training standards is established and applied to all those entering the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>The capacity of ships has increased substantially in recent years.  Bulk carriers threaten our sea to such an extent that they could wipe out masses of fish stocks and destroy wildlife habitats.</P>
    <P>The compensation provisions in the Bill would not adequately cover the costs incurred from damage resulting from a major oil spillage.  Given the increasing level of shipping traffic and the actual capacity of these ships, we will be obliged to revisit this Bill in four or five years' time.</P>
    <P>I was going to ask the Minister how we can be sure that ships have adequate cover but he said they would have to carry a certificate to establish same.  How can we establish the correct tonnage? I assume a mechanism is built into the convention <Col N="255" /> to achieve that.  It is not just shipping companies that must ensure all is safe and well, there is an obligation on Government to ensure that harbours and estuaries are capable of accommodating ships for docking in a safe way.  Dredging and regular safety inspections are essential to the safety of our harbours and estuaries.</P>
    <P>An integrated approach to coastal management is necessary to plan for the future of our maritime economy.  Coastal erosion, pollution caused by industry and in particular from Sellafield and the threat of oil spillages, all pose huge risks to the future of our maritime economy.  I am not convinced that local authorities are equipped to deal effectively, quickly and expertly with a major oil spillage.  I look forward to the Minister's views on that matter.</P>
    <P>On Sellafield and in particular the Minister's discussions with the UK Minister, Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP, regarding the nuclear waste dumped between Northern Ireland and Scotland in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, will he outline in greater detail the outcome of those discussions and the guarantees received from Dr. Cunningham?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a step forward but it is only that, a step that needs to be built upon.  The Labour Party fully supports the measure.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil An Bille um Ola-Thruailliú na Farraige (Dliteanas Sibhialta agus Cúiteamh) (Leasú), 1998, a phlé. This Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is an attempt to update Irish law and conform with our international obligations in this area and is welcome. Many of the worst ecological disasters in the world in recent years have been as a result of oil spills.  To a large extent this country has avoided the worst effects of devastation through oil pollution.  However, when oil spills occurred they have been dealt with complacently, which should concern us in the event of a disaster here on the proportion of, say, the infamous <i>Exxon Valdez</i> spill off the coast of Alaska.  To that extent we have been fortunate because as an island nation, living in close proximity to some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and aware of the standards of shipping maintenance that prevail, it could be argued that a major oil spillage in this region is just waiting to happen.  If it were to happen what could be anticipated in terms of appropriate action from the Government and relevant authorities?  The experience of last year's oil spillage from the Irish National Petroleum Company's refinery in Whitegate in Cork Harbour does not inspire confidence.  First, there was a delay in finding and then admitting to the leak.  This was followed by persistent disinformation about the size of the spill.  Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency took a slap on the wrist attitude in taking the INPC to the lowest court, the District Court.  It imposed the minimum <Col N="256" /> fine of £2,000, which was nothing less than a gross insult.</P>
      <P>The levels of fines and penalties imposed in this Bill are impressive.  However, while high fines have been approved in previous environmental protection legislation there has been an unwillingness to levy them.  It is of no practical use enacting legislation which makes us feel good about ourselves and implies we are taking care of the environment if the culture of taking strong action in seeking to protect the environment is missing.  The need to levy heavy penalties only comes into effect when environmental damage has been caused.  Legislation of this kind fails to address the preventative measures and the Government consequently operates in a vacuum because little or nothing appears to be done about these.</P>
      <P>The risk of oil pollution can ultimately be reduced by being less dependent on oil as our primary energy source.  Despite green sounding noises from successive Governments, there is little indication that such a policy is being promulgated or advanced with any degree of enthusiasm. Indeed, we are more dependent on imported fossil fuel than previously, which is a cause of concern to the ESB and others who consider this to be untenable.</P>
      <P>While we continue to depend on oil we need to examine the procedures which apply to the carriage of oil and oil products in international and, more specifically, Irish territorial waters.  International maritime law continues to be flawed in this area.  The onus should be on the Government, through this country's membership of the Paris and Oslo conventions, to seek necessary changes.  If there is reluctance from other Governments to help bring about such changes, the Government should be prepared to act unilaterally, if it is willing or able to do so on any issue.</P>
      <P>The condition and safety of many ships on the world seas is frightening and should be an issue of pressing international concern.  The situation is made worse by ships constantly availing of flags of convenience for tax avoidance purposes, the minimisation of labour costs and the circumventing of labour rights by ship owners in hiring crews which in many cases cannot even communicate with their officers in the same language.</P>
      <P>International debate on the transport of oil by ship is centred on the question of carriage by single hull vessels or compulsion that all oil carrying ships should be double hulled.  Statistics appear to indicate that double hulled vessels are involved in fewer accidents.  Even where they are involved, they have a greater potential to help alleviate possible damage.  Recent oil spillages, such as from the <i>Sea Empress</i> in the Irish sea, which thankfully had little impact on the Irish coast line, and from the <i>Braer</i> in the North Sea, have occurred in single hull vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the safe disposal of oil rigs located in the North Sea has generated one of the more high profile environmental controversies of recent years.  The <i>Brent Spar</i> controversy raised <Col N="257" /> serious questions about the extent to which we have used the sea as a repository for much of what we do not want to know about.  We should know by now that out of sight, out of mind approaches have a habit of rebounding on us.  Nor should we think that the <i>Brent Spar</i> debate is of little relevance to this country.  The coastline is littered with exploratory rigs.</P>
    <P>The Kinsale gas field is due to expire in a few years.  There is no indication of the Government's policy on the safe disposal of this infrastructure. We could presume that a team of consultants will be appointed, to be followed by another team, to be followed by rejection of the latter's recommendations and the Government's promotion of a response, possibly in ten years, that bears no relation to the original question.  However, I hope the Luas saga will not be repeated on the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Despite legislation, the risk of oil pollution remains large.  Another <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> may be ready to disperse its unwanted cargo.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation, perhaps in the light of its recent Whitegate experience, has allocated a contingency fund of £1 million to pay to the mussel farmers and fishermen of Bantry Bay should the newly reopened Whiddy Island oil terminal bring in its wake unacceptable incidents of pollution.  For many who depend on Bantry Bay for their livelihoods &mdash; it is an area of outstanding natural beauty &mdash; the possibility of oil pollution is not a question of if but more a matter of when and to what extent.  Until the fear of oil pollution moves in public perception from being an inevitability to being a remote improbability the Government and Government agencies continue to have work to do.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister agree there is a major discrepancy in that, while there is a precise method of assessing blood alcohol levels, there is no precise method for measuring or gauging the level of drugs in the system?

      <P>Under the law, where a garda is of the opinion that a person has consumed intoxicating liquor, that person may be required to provide a breath specimen.  There is no provision in the Road Traffic Acts for the breath testing of drivers for evidence of drugs. Any changes in that respect would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. The advice of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is that there is no test apparatus available equivalent to the breathalyser in testing for evidence of drugs.  Research is ongoing in the United Kingdom and elsewhere into the possibility of introducing a saliva test.  This research is at an early stage.  Because of the wide variety of drugs available and having regard to the various methods of consumption, a saliva test may not prove conclusive.  It is an offence to drive while under the influence of drugs.  It is sometimes mistakenly believed that it is only an offence to drive while under the influence of alcohol but that is not the case.  The Deputy is correct, the methods utilised in obtaining evidence in regard to the consumption of alcohol are far more sophisticated in that a breathalyser test is available than in testing for evidence of drugs.  When samples <Col N="259" /> are taken there is a method whereby traces of controlled substances can be identified.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister agree the position is unsatisfactory in that it is difficult to prove that a person who is footless, incoherent and manifestly incapable of driving having consumed prescribed or illegal drugs, or a combination of drugs and alcohol, and whose blood alcohol level is under the permitted limit, has committed an offence?  Will the Minister agree it is unsatisfactory that samples are analysed in separate centres?  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is located at Earlsfort Terrace and the State Laboratory is in Abbotstown.  All samples should be analysed at Earlsfort Terrace.  There should be mandatory testing where there is a suspicion that a person has consumed drugs and the sample should be analysed immediately.  There is a need to determine the permitted level for drugs from the point of view of contravening the law.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995, where a garda is of the opinion that a person is attempting to drive while under the influence of an intoxicant, that person may be required to give a sample of blood or urine.  An intoxicant is defined as including alcohol, drugs or both.  An individual may be convicted for driving while under the influence of drugs.  There is, however, no on-the-spot device available such as a breathalyser to assist a garda in formulating this opinion but it is open to him or her to formulate this opinion in the same way that it was possible prior to the introduction of the breathalyser and the taking of blood and urine samples to form the opinion that an individual was incapable of driving and secure a conviction in court.  We should seek &mdash; this problem is being addressed in the United Kingdom and elsewhere &mdash; to develop a mechanism to assist a garda in coming to an opinion on the roadside.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison in need of treatment for psychiatric disorders or drug addiction; and the numbers who received treatment for these conditions in the last year for which figures are available.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11634/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision as to whether a prisoner is in need of treatment for a psychiatric disorder or a drug addiction problem is a matter for the medical personnel in our penal institutions. In the year 1997 to April 1998, 705 prisoners were referred to visiting psychiatrists by prison medical officers.  Without an examination of each individual case, it is not possible to say what treatment, if any, was subsequently recommended and provided.  Prisoners are referred to a visiting psychiatrist for a variety of reasons, <Col N="260" /> including particular situational difficulties, for example, stress due to imprisonment.  It should be noted, however, that the numbers of prisoners referred do not necessarily correlate to actual levels of psychiatric illness.  During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison entered the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison and, to date, over 120 inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit which was opened there in July 1996.</P>
      <P>The issues involved in dealing with people who have mental health and drug addiction problems and who have been committed to our penal institutions by the courts have been with us for considerable time.  Although substantial facilities to deal with these problems are available, access to specialised psychiatric treatment and to dedicated drug treatment, both medical and psychological, needs to be improved.  To this end my Department has, for some time, been involved in negotiations with the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children with a view to improving psychiatric input to the various institutions through the implementation of a service agreement and the assignment to the prisons area by the health board of a number of dedicated psychiatrists. It has been agreed by all parties involved that this is the most appropriate approach to solving the current difficulties.  The appointment of these psychiatrists is a matter for the Eastern Health Board and is awaited.</P>
      <P>The current drug treatment programme in Mountjoy Prison is under review at present.  My intention is to extend drug treatment facilities there to fully cater for all prisoners who present with a drug addiction problem.  This is hampered at present by serious overcrowding in the prison and it will obviously require the allocation of considerable resources.  I am confident that the space necessary for this expansion will become available as the prison building programme progresses.</P>

      <P>The 1996 report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee stated that 100 prisoners should be in psychiatric hospitals rather than jail at that time.  Has the position in the prison changed in the intervening period?</P>
      <P>Regarding the figures outlined by the Minister in relation to the detoxification programme, does he agree with the findings of the visiting committee's report that only nine prisoners were on a structured drug treatment programme from a total of 3,000 prisoners who were in the prison during that year?  Has there been a radical change in the services and circumstances in the jail since 1996 or are the Minister's figures another way of stating that the position has not changed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been of the view that it would not be possible to effect substantial change in the prison regime in terms of rehabilitative efforts and accommodation until there was an adequate number of prison spaces. <Col N="261" /> The prison building programme, which was promised by the Government when it came into office, is under way and on target to provide an additional 1,000 prison spaces over the next year. The Government gave a commitment that it would provide these places within two years of taking office.</P>
      <P>Castlerea Prison is now open and it is hoped that the women's prison at Mountjoy and the remand prison at Cloverhill in Dublin will be open in the autumn or at the end of the year.  I opened a new wing at Limerick Prison earlier this year and I hope to sign a contract for a new prison at Portlaoise, which will accommodate 400 prisoners, in the coming weeks.  These measures will go a considerable distance towards alleviating the problems which Deputy Upton identified.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that a proportion of prisoners in Mountjoy suffer from a mental illness. However, published figures indicate that, at most, 5 per cent of committals to Mountjoy involve people with a history of major mental illness. I am advised by the Director of the Prison Medical Service that while these individuals may have a history of mental illness, it is not necessarily the case that all of them would require hospital care.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton asked about the drug treatment services at the prison and whether they are adequate.  My view is that it is necessary to extend the drug treatment facilities in Mountjoy to cater fully for all prisoners who have a drug addiction problem.  I also intend to establish a medical treatment programme, if necessary, and a drug free unit in every enclosed institution as soon as possible.  However, the overcrowding problem places constraints on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that regard.  Nevertheless, I am acting vigorously to address all the problems that have affected the prison regime for many years and which have been accentuated by the growth of the drug problem particularly in Mountjoy.</P>

However, the Deputy should bear in mind that not only must an individual volunteer but he or she must be suitable for treatment.

I intend to extend the drug treatment facilities in Mountjoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the most recently published statistics regarding missing persons are contained in the 1996 annual report of the Garda Síochána. The statistics for 1996 show that of 1,848 persons reported missing, eight remained untraced at the end of that year.</P>
      <P>The report for 1997 will be published later this year and I understand from the Garda authorities that the provisional figures for 1997 indicate that of 1,765 persons reported missing, six remain untraced.  While more than 99 per cent of persons who are reported missing return home, I realise that for the small number of families of long-term missing persons there is considerable and ongoing heartbreak.</P>
      <P>Regarding the general issue of missing persons, the Deputy is aware that I have a special interest in the investigation of these types of cases and also in the manner in which the Garda handle the cases and liaise with the families concerned. Therefore, I wish to set out for the Deputy's information some recent developments in this area.  In my reply of 2 December last to a priority question tabled by the Deputy, I referred to the fact that officials of my Department and the Garda Síochána would be travelling to the UK to assess the potential value of a new investigative approach in operation in that jurisdiction.  The initiatives in question involved the analysis of serious crimes using sophisticated computer software, the creation of a national network of designated regional liaison officers to serve as contact points and the establishment of a central help desk for officers investigating particular types of crimes.  A senior official of my Department, with an officer from Garda Headquarters, subsequently travelled to the UK to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative and its possible application for investigating cases of missing persons in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the operation of the UK initiative is in fact similar to the approach taken by the Garda Síochána in this jurisdiction in that local officers take the lead role in a case and have all relevant expertise available to them as required.  The need for the elaborate structures which they have in the UK is principally to improve co-ordination and to facilitate information sharing among the more than 50 police forces investigating crime there.  We should also not lose sight of the fact that they have considerably more serious crime, particularly serious sexual crime involving abduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the specific aspect of the use of state of the art information technology applications, I am satisfied that the module on missing persons which is contained in the first release of PULSE, which will begin its implementation later <Col N="263" /> this year, is equal to the best available to any police force anywhere.  It should, of course, be realised that computerised crime linkage analysis systems are generally developed and deployed in countries such as Canada, the USA, Belgium and the UK which do not have a national police force. I am sure the Deputy followed the media coverage of the National Crime Forum.  I was concerned with some of the experiences which were recounted to the forum, specifically the incidents where individuals felt that there was poor follow through, albeit in a minority of cases, by the Garda when it came to dealing with those affected by crime and keeping them informed of the status of an investigation.  Because of this concern, I welcome the recent changes in the procedures for dealing with missing persons cases which the Commissioner has introduced and the renewed emphasis he has placed on the role of Garda liaison officers in these cases.  New guidelines have also been introduced by the Garda to assist and involve the reportee or family of the missing person.  Of course, it goes without saying that the question of taking any additional operational measures to investigate such cases is being kept under review by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Finally, an official of my Department met recently and will liaise with the Missing Persons Helpline to discuss its operation and to see if there is any assistance my Department can provide.</P>

      <P>It is true that I indicated my preference for a missing persons unit.  Since returning to Government I have indicated it was a possibility that should be seriously examined, particularly in the context of my plans for an officer of my Department to visit the UK and examine the system there.  As I explained, a senior Garda and a departmental official visited the UK to examine their procedures.  The PULSE programme, as it relates to this area, is of considerable importance and has assisted the gardaí greatly.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a missing persons unit is an operational decision for the Garda Commissioner that is being kept under continuous review.  I am satisfied that the arrangements put in place since this Government took office are an improvement on the previous situation.  The response to concerns expressed at the National Crime Forum will be welcomed by everybody.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Improvements or otherwise, this represents a broken promise.  Is the Minister aware that over 70 people who have gone missing since 1990 have remained untraced? There is a huge information gap.  It is an unfortunate assumption that the vast majority of these people were abducted and are dead, but the grieving period has not ended for their relatives. There are no bodies, no funerals and no grieving periods.  They have no redress.</P>
      <P>To save people from that harrowing experience in future, the Minister should set up a dedicated unit with specially trained personnel using the techniques lauded by the Minister today.  The staff of this unit would have recourse to the best equipment and knowledge.  They would exchange information with other jurisdictions which have these specialist units and which have had enormous success in dealing with abduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated my views and those of the Garda Commissioner to the Deputy.  It is true that approximately 80 of the 12,000 people who went missing between 1990 and 1997 remain missing.  Naturally this is a cause of great concern and one has the greatest sympathy with their relatives.  I share Deputy Higgins's view that it is a time of terrible distress which is accentuated by the fact that they do not know where their missing relatives are.</P>
      <P>Files on missing persons are kept open until there is a conclusion in the case, and every case is kept under continuous review.  Analysis of data on this matter on a year by year basis shows that the situation has improved.  The worst year this decade appears to have been 1990, when 16 persons went missing who are still unaccounted for. That is a statistical improvement but is little consolation to the families whose loved ones are missing.</P>
      <P>It is my intention as Minister to keep a close eye on this situation.  I regard these matters as particularly tragic requiring the most humane and vigorous response possible.</P>

      <P>Under the law prior to 1981, there was considerable latitude for evidence relating to a complainant's past sexual experience to be given in a trial for rape.  The Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, significantly modified the law by restricting the extent to which evidence could be adduced or a complainant could be cross-examined as to any sexual experience the complainant might <Col N="265" /> have had with a person other than the accused. Under section 3 of the 1981 Act, no such evidence can be given except with the leave of the judge, on application made to the judge in the absence of the jury, and only if the judge is satisfied that a refusal to give leave would be unfair to the accused.  The term &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in this context is defined, in essence, by reference to whether the effect of allowing the evidence would make a difference between a finding of guilt and an acquittal.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the 1981 Act provides for the exclusion from the court of all persons except officers of the court and persons directly concerned in the proceedings, during the hearing of an application under section 3, but this is without prejudice to the right of a parent, relative or friend of the complainant to remain in court.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, significantly amended section 3 of the 1981 Act.  Prior to 1990, the restrictions on the extent to which evidence could be permitted applied only to sexual experience with persons other than the accused.  Since the 1990 Act, the restriction applies to sexual experience with any person, including the accused.  In addition, the 1990 Act extended the provisions of section 3 of the 1981 Act to all sexual assault offences, as defined in the 1990 Act.</P>
      <P>The law in this area is one of the issues being addressed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I will publish this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that his silence on the question of separate legal representation for victims in such cases means he is not in favour of it.  I would like to press him on the issue of separate legal representation for victims having regard to the adversarial nature of our criminal legal system and with a view to ensuring criminal trials dealing with sexual offences must be made less traumatic for the victim and that criminal law in this area must become more victim-friendly than at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the 1981 and 1990 Acts and it is timely, as we approach the end of another decade, for a comprehensive review to ensure the type of harassment and intimidation which takes place in certain court cases ends. What does the Minister intend to do, if he is ruling out the concept of separate legal representation for victims?  What does he intend to do to ensure the State provides an appropriate level of support for victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan raised an important matter.  The question of separate legal representation for rape victims has been discussed in several reports in recent years with varying conclusions.  The Law Reform Commission, in its report on the law on rape, recommended against separate legal representation. The commission questioned the constitutional propriety of such a proposal stating &mdash; to use its words &mdash; that it might be constitutionally suspect <Col N="266" /> since it tilts the balance of the criminal process significantly in favour of the prosecution in a defined range of offences by permitting a dual representation hostile to the interests of the accused, thereby depriving him of one of the long-standing benefits of criminal trial conducted in due course of law.</P>
      <P>The 1993 report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women also decided separate legal representation for the complainant was not feasible. One of the terms of reference of the working party on the legal and judicial process for victims of sexual and other crimes of violence against women and children was to review past recommendations that there should not be separate legal representation.  In its 1996 report, the working party was of the view that separate legal representation for complainants in rape and sexual assault cases would provide much needed support for complainants, render the trial process considerably less traumatic for them and would contribute significantly to bringing about an increase in the reporting of rape.  The working party recommended that mechanisms for the provision of separate legal representation, including its insertion in the legal aid system, be developed and implemented.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the 1997 report of the Task Force on Violence Against Women, recommended that the issue of separate legal representation be addressed in the forthcoming discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  The discussion paper, which I intend to publish later this month, will deal with the matter in detail.  It will invite submissions on a particular approach being suggested in the paper with a view ultimately to the formulation of whatever legislative changes are deemed necessary and appropriate.</P>
      <P>I hope this indicates to Deputy Flanagan that I have not closed the door on the question of separate legal representation.  However, there is no getting away from the fact that there are constitutional constraints on what can be achieved in this area.  Apart from the constitutional difficulties which led the Law Reform Commission to recommend against separate legal representation, there has also been judicial reference to the constitutional difficulties which may arise with separate legal representation.  Having said that, I assure Deputy Flanagan and the House that I am committed to looking at the matter anew and it will be discussed in the context of the discussion paper which will be of considerable assistance when discussing our approach to the question of sexual offences into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the victims of crime.  I am committed to introducing a new charter for the victims of crime, which I intend to publish this year.  This document will also be of considerable significance and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply which I hope will be followed up with enthusiasm.  I would like to press the Minister on the question of a timeframe.  I understand <Col N="267" /> the document he is about to publish will invite further submissions but the need for a timeframe is important.  By not putting a timeframe on the Minister's deliberations and on when he proposes to bring forward such appropriate amending legislation as he might deem fit, the level of trauma and the unsatisfactory nature of the law of evidence in this regard is such that it militates against many victims coming forward to report criminal activity in a comprehensive way, complaints being made and trials taking place in accordance with the manner in which criminal trials should proceed to a prosecution.</P>

      <P>The probability is the reporting of incidents of rape would increase if we were to have separate legal representation.  I outlined the difficulties we face.  They have been underlined by the Law Reform Commission and the Judiciary in case law and all relate to the constitutionality of the provision of such separate representation.  It is difficult to give Deputy Flanagan a specific timeframe within which changes, where appropriate, would be made.  This is because a discussion paper is being presented to the public and those with an interest in the subjects addressed in the report will be asked to make their submissions.  They will be received from a wide variety of sectors and each must be closely examined.  All I can say at this point is I will pursue the matter as expeditiously as I possibly can, recognising always the grave complexity in respect of some of the matters under discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's answer to Deputy O'Flanagan, I put it to him that perhaps a timeframe would be a good idea because it is more than a year since the report of the Taskforce on Violence Against Women recommended the way forward, as proposed by Deputy Flanagan, and a number of other changes in relation to rape cases.  It would also be worthwhile because only a small percentage of those cases proceed to court.  There has been more than a year to consider this matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Minister's reply to the question tabled, despite the fact that the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended in 1990, gives victims a certain amount of protection in relation to their past sexual experience, is he satisfied the practice in law and in court cases is as intended in the legislation?  In his discussion on the issue will be consider that this law might also need to be further amended to protect victims in court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a perception the amendments introduced in the l981 and l990 rape Acts do not go far enough to alleviate the humiliation and stress suffered by victims, but it would still be extremely difficult for me to categorically give a timeframe within which possible changes would occur, for the reasons I outlined.  The question of any improvements will be discussed in <Col N="268" /> great detail in the discussion paper and I would not like to pre-empt what may be contained in it by addressing specific changes which may or may not be necessary to the 1981 and 1990 rape Acts. Suffice to say, it is my intention to ensure there will be a full discussion on the contents of the discussion paper.  Everybody concerned will be given an opportunity to contribute, including Members, and there will be opportunities in the future, following the publication of the paper, for Members to ask questions on it and, I hope, to make significant and constructive contributions to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister acknowledge that his view that the introduction of separate legal representation for rape victims would result in an increase in the number of reported rapes reflects a negative attitude given that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre confirms only 29 per cent of all sexual assault cases are reported to the Garda?  From the point of view of those who have been raped the low conviction rate, in the region of 2 per cent, is a deterrent to their coming forward because of the manner in which such cases are dealt.  Everything possible should be done to encourage, induce and assist people to report such cases and have them dealt with by the courts.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister favour a suggestion made at the crime forum recently that a greater burden of proof in rape cases should rest with the defendant? Does he agree there is an urgent need for judges to receive special training in dealing with rape and sexual assault cases given that sensitivity has not always been evident from the Bench in dealing with such cases in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last question first.  The vast majority of judges dealing with rape cases have considerable experience.  I hope there is consistency in sentencing policy.  If the Deputy knows of a particular case which he wishes to raise with me, I would be delighted to consider it.  However, we must be aware the Judiciary is independent of the Executive.  The Deputy may have misunderstood me.  I want to see an increase in the reporting of rape crimes.  It is my wish that all crimes, particularly such heinous offences, should be reported.</P>
      <P>On the question of shifting the burden of proof, at common law in our criminal justice system the burden of proof which must be discharged by the prosecution is that an individual should be found guilty by the jury being convinced he is so beyond a reasonable doubt.  That would also apply in criminal cases where a jury does not hear the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the incidence of rape as indicated by recent figures is a matter of great concern. In that respect the Garda Commissioner stated he launched an investigation into why the number of rape offences appears to be on the increase given the number being reported.  I hope his investigation will be completed in the not too <Col N="269" /> distant future.  I look forward to reading his findings to ascertain if any further measures are required which could be put in place in the perimeters within which we operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that his leisurely approach is inappropriate, given the statement by the director of the Rape Crisis Centre, which he did not mention, that the single most important change needed to improve the position for rape victims is to provide legal representation? It is one thing to have reports, discussion and consultation, but the need for political direction from the Minister on this issue is as important, if not more so.  Despite all the questioning the Minister has undergone, we are not clear about his view on the desirability and effectiveness of having legal representation for rape victims.</P>
      <P>There has been such a huge increase in the incidence of rape that the Garda has carried out research into this matter.  I am surprised it has not produced the findings of that research.  Does the Minister intend that those findings will be published? At a time when crime levels generally are dropping, he must be aware of the grave concern that crimes against women are on the increase. The lack of clear policy on how to meet the need is disturbing.  Will the Minister give some idea of his view on this matter?  Most of us are aware there is a constitutional dimension to this.  The Minister argued in the past for amendments to the Constitution on other issues.  He certainly supported an amendment on the issue of abortion. On this issue he would support rape victims if he indicated that he supports an amendment to the Constitution to ensure legal representation, if that is required.  The Minister is in the driving seat and it would be extremely helpful to those concerned with rape victims if he made that clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly favour separate legal representation for rape victims.  There is, <Col N="270" /> however, a constitutional difficulty with that.  The Law Reform Commission has said so and there is case law to suggest it is so.  Regarding the possibility of an amendment to the 1937 Constitution to address this problem, let us be clear on what we are talking about.  We are talking not only about the Constitution but about due process and the right of an individual to receive a fair trial.  In our jurisdiction an individual is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  It would not be possible to reverse that burden without causing considerable injustice.  Whether the Deputy likes it or not, the difficulties I have outlined are real.  I favour representation, but the question of how limited it must be in the context of how it is constrained by the parameters must be discussed in great detail because it is a complex matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that ten years after considerable consultation, which took place at great cost and took much time, and submissions by all interested parties before the introduction of the rape legislation, of which we are all proud, nothing has changed?  It has been borne out that the amendments introduced do not adequately meet the requirements of the Rape Crisis Centre and the women's rights committee of that time.  The Law Reform Commission and other groups would make that same point.  There is a body of evidence to suggest that we have totally failed women in terms of their having confidence in taking cases to court.  The same arguments pertain now as ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes, who has been interested in these matters for longer than most people.  The matter has dragged on.  I am trying to bring it to finality by publishing a discussion paper, which I trust will lead to legislation to deal not only with the issue of separate legal representation for victims of rape but the whole spectrum of sexual offences.  The document has not been published and I cannot give definitive answers as to what my position will be on any of these matters.  I can indicate a preference for what I would wish to see, but in so far as I would wish to see certain objectives realised, because of legal difficulties we may not be able to achieve all we desire.  That is a common feature of legislative procedure and has been since Adam was a boy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion paper on sexual offences is nearing completion.  It represents a very important stage in the evolution and evaluation <Col N="271" /> of the need for further reform of the law on sexual offences.  The question of rape will obviously be covered in the discussion paper in so far as the law relating to it is concerned.  In so far as I can assist the victims of rape, legislatively or otherwise, within the parameters I will be obliged to operate, I will do so.  For example, I ensured that the amount available for Victim Support in 1998 was increased considerably from the previous year and I know the organisation appreciated this.  I am conscious of the needs of victims of all crime and I am anxious to do what I can to alleviate the stress and trauma they have suffered and will suffer in the future.</P>

      <P>With regard to contributions transmitted by the Probation and Welfare Service, at Kilcock District Court the total amount of charitable donations made during 1995 was £4,600, during 1996 £13,280 and during 1997 charitable donations from that court transmitted through the Probation and Welfare Service totalled £98,646.  For Kells District Court the equivalent figures are £3,650 during 1995, £500 during 1996 and £11,400 during 1997.  I have arranged for a breakdown of these payments, listing the individual amounts paid to each of the charitable organisations in question, to be forwarded to the Deputy immediately.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contributions transmitted through the Garda, this information is being compiled currently by the Garda and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available. In cases where the judge ordered a direct contribution to a charitable organisation by a person who was before the court no record was kept by the court office.  This was because the contribution did not pass through the court's accounts. The defendant made the donation directly and obtained a receipt which was then produced in court.</P>

It is <Col N="272" /> an undesirable distortion of justice whereby one may do a deal with the judge and have no conviction recorded if one has the money.  What happens if a person makes a contribution by way of a cheque which bounces or is withdrawn?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to ensuring the money reaches the designated charities, the money is paid to the court poor box and processed through the court's general cash account. It is subject to normal audit procedures.  In the case of a direct donation to a charity by a defendant, the defendant must produce a receipt to the court for the donation.  In the case of donations facilitated by the Garda or the Probation and Welfare Service a defendant would produce a bank draft in court and the judge would direct the Garda or the Probation and Welfare Service to forward it to the designated charity.</P>
      <P>The Garda and the Probation and Welfare Service would keep local records of bank drafts passed to them for this purpose and of receipts from the recipient organisations.  Because such donations do not pass through the accounts of the Garda or the Probation and Welfare Service they are not subject to normal audit procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to cheques bouncing, the charity concerned provides a receipt which the convicted person produces in court.  One cannot guard against every possible eventuality in life but one would hope that the recipients would ensure, as far as possible, that they receive the requisite amount.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Upton's question, I understand that the same judge sits in Kilcock and Kells but I cannot be certain whether a temporary judge may sit in a given court at a given time.  My understanding is that they are in the same District Court area.  The poor box system is widely in use, although I am reliably informed that judges do not use it in the majority of cases. The majority of judges use it in a limited number of cases.  The Deputy is right, a considerable amount of money is collected through the system throughout the country.</P>

Those moneys which are paid on the direction of the District Justice are in the main paid to local charities and the accounts are audited by my Department's internal audit unit.  They are also open to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The interest on moneys paid into the poor box would be a matter for the District Justice.  If the District Justice ordered that the interest earned during an interregnum on moneys to be paid to a given charity were to be given to the charity concerned, then that would have to be done.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 22, 27, 42, 66 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am greatly concerned with the increase in the number of offences of rape reported to the Garda Síochána.  This increase is all the more worrying when it is seen against the backdrop of a general decrease in crime.  As I said in my reply to the House on a series of questions on 10 February 1998, while official Garda statistics have not yet been published for 1997, I understand there has been a significant increase in the number of reported rapes as compared to 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that he also shares my concern and that research which the Garda Research Unit is carrying out into the incidence of rape from 1994 to 1997 is continuing.  I await their findings with great interest.  One unfortunate aspect of the absence of basic data within the broad criminal justice system is that research is significantly less developed than in other areas, such as education and health. <Col N="275" /> I intend that the research capacity of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be developed in line with the changing role of the Department in which its work will be much more focused on policy and strategic issues than here-tofore. As part of that development my Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána and others, is currently putting the finishing touches to proposals for a research project regarding the reporting of sexual offences.  I regard that as being of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>We do not require research findings to know that it is necessary to look beyond the law and order system if we are to address the problem of sexual violence against women, or indeed against anybody.  Although the laws have been strengthened considerably over the years, it is clear they are not producing the level of deterrence which might have been anticipated.  It is equally clear, therefore, that we need to look at wider societal issues, at influences, at attitudes, at the possible role of the education system and so on, if we are to tackle this problem effectively.</P>
    <P>In my reply of 10 February I set out in some detail a number of developments of interest in this area.  I do not propose to go over them again today in detail.  However, it would be useful to give the Deputy an update, where appropriate, on a number of the developments.</P>
    <P>First, The National Steering Committee on Violence against Women, which is chaired by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Mary Wallace, is addressing the central recommendations of the task force report on violence against women.  This committee brings together key groups and agencies, both from the public and non-governmental sectors, which have a role to play in this area.  Over the coming weeks a number of regional co-ordinating committees will be launched throughout the country.  By the end of May, it is intended that a regional co-ordinating committee will be established in each health board area.  The function of each committee, in the first instance, will be to draw up an assessment of the existing services and needs in their region and then to develop a strategy for meeting these needs.  The regional committees will allow for a co-ordinated partnership approach between the voluntary, community and public sectors to ensure that women subject to violence are presented with a realistic set of coherent options. It will also ensure that women are not put through the additional trauma of having to approach several different agencies to avail of services.  With these new structures in place, I am confident we will have a major contribution to the development of an integrated response to women who become victims of violent crime.</P>
    <P>Second, I can confirm to the House that the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences will be published before the end of this month. The paper covers a wide range of issues relevant to sexual offences.  Its purpose is to stimulate the debate on the laws relating to sexual offences and <Col N="276" /> to encourage interested groups and individuals to respond with their considered views.</P>
    <P>Third, the House will be interested to know that my Department has recently finalised its response to a detailed and wide-ranging questionnaire on the legal process and victims of rape and has referred it on to the appointed research team. This is a research project which is being jointly undertaken by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Trinity College under the EU Grotius Programme. It is a study which is reviewing the legal process and victims of rape in all EU member states.  I believe the findings will be available in September.</P>
    <P>The National Crime Forum discussed the subject of violence against women on a number of occasions and received presentations from a number of agencies working in the area.  The forum is in the process of concluding its work.  I look forward to receiving its report and considering what they have to say on this important issue in due course.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister agree that it is one thing to talk tough but another to deal with victims in terms of what is being put forward as Government policy?</P>
      <P>Is he aware, for example, of a recent horrific case in Kilrush, County Clare, described in newspapers as &ldquo;Gang Sex Attackers Escape Jail Sentence&rdquo;, where a 17 year old girl was dragged across a street by four people calling themselves the &ldquo;young bulls&rdquo;, stripped to the waist, lain upon by one of the people in question as she shouted for her life and integrity, and that the State by way of a plea for mitigation of the offence said the boys were &ldquo;living up to their reputations and acting macho&ldquo;?  This was the term used by the Garda representative in court and is the Minister further aware there is a huge outcry over the trivialisation of such a serious offence?</P>

      <P>I greatly condemn any trivialisation of an issue as serious as that outlined by the Deputy.  I have made it clear there will be a discussion paper on sexual offences, which will be detailed, and submissions will be sought.  Laws will be strengthened where needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister recognises the merits of this issue and the severe stress caused to parents who, unfortunately, have severely handicapped children.  The most heartbreaking experience occurs over the first two years of the child's life when parents are at their most vulnerable, having awaited with anxiety the arrival of a new born baby only to discover, tragically, that the child is handicapped.  At that juncture parents need the assistance and help available for children aged between 2 and 16 years with whom the current scheme copes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circular 2/473 issued on 25 November 1973 regarding allowances for domiciliary care set out the terms of the scheme, which still prevail.  The parents and handicapped children should have support and assistance from the birth.  A great difficulty for parents is that having reached two years of age the State recognises that the children and they need support and attention.  Of course, these parents relieve the State of a potentially substantial financial burden by looking after their handicapped children in the home.  It makes sense and would show a great deal of humanity if parents were to get the support of the appropriate authorities in the health board.  I hope the Minister of State, a medical practitioner with firsthand knowledge of the stress and concern of parents, recognises they need this care allowance having discovered their newly born baby is handicapped. <Col N="278" /> I hope he sees the merit of the case, deals with it favourably and extends the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern and will explain the nature of this scheme.  Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they require care and attention, which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced by way of Circular No. 2/473 in 1973 and operates under section 61 of the 1970 Health Act which empowers a health board to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of a sick or infirm person or a dependant of such a person or a person, who, but for the provision of a service for him or her under the section, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to children aged between two and 16 years and only the means of the child are taken into account, for example, a child who receives a payment of compensation resulting in an income in excess of the allowance does not quality.  The current rate of the allowance is £103.60 per month.  The medical assessment is carried out by health board medical personnel. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, for example, if the child's condition improves, he-she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained in institutions.  However, where a child is at home for a continuous period of more than two months, for example, summer holidays, the allowance may be granted for that period.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not cover children under the age of two years given that they normally require constant care and attention in any event. However, there are other supports available to parents who experience difficulties in caring for a child of under two years.  For example, they may apply to their local community welfare officer for help under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Furthermore, if the child's condition requires frequent and expensive medical treatment a child may be awarded a medical card in his-her own right.  Parents may also seek advice and support from the boards in obtaining necessary aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, &ldquo;A Strategy for Quality&rdquo;, was published in November 1996.  The commission's report recommends the development of a wide range of economic and social services for people with disabilities, including health, personal support services and employment.  On publication of the report, the then Government decided to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, <Col N="279" /> their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which is being drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department is represented.  This task force is due to submit its detailed plan in the near future.</P>
    <P>The operation of schemes such as the domiciliary care allowance will be reviewed in this context. I will have the points raised by the Deputy conveyed to the task force for full consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important and sensitive issue.  I thank the Minister for Health and Children for his reply to a question I tabled regarding suicide figures for 1997.  He stated that for the first nine months of the year 306 people took their lives, seven of whom were children under the age of 15 years. It is a devastating and tragic statistic. Two children took their lives in 1996. I am extremely concerned that the trend in suicide figures, particularly among young people, is increasing.  While I appreciate that we do not have the complete figures for 1997, the overall trend for the first nine months shows an increase of 8 per cent on the 1996 figures.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately implement in full the recommendations of the National Task Force on Suicide. Irish society must deal with this serious public health issue.  Society and the State must adopt a compassionate and informed response towards those who feel suicidal.  In an effort to reduce the high levels of suicide, especially among young males, we must identify the reasons that lie behind it.  Changes in the fabric of society, levels of depression, alcohol, drug abuse, social isolation, changes in religious practice and a sense of hopelessness are some of the factors that have contributed to the increased levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our annual suicide rate can be reduced; other countries have achieved this.  Suicide prevention programmes must be devised on the basis of the recommendations of the National Task Force on Suicide.  Irish society must examine the values and norms which have placed enormous pressure on young people.  It is devastating to note that seven children under the age of 15 years committed suicide in the first nine months of 1997.  The pace of social and cultural change has not been faster. Most jobs now last less than five years, acquired skills quickly become redundant and individuals must become more adaptable.  What is seen as an opportunity for some can be a threat for others. Stress affects young men and women, although young males are tending to prove less adaptable to change in their status.  Our education system must be broadened, particularly in the case of <Col N="280" /> boys, to encompass varying modern, social and domestic conditions.</P>
    <P>While the physical health of young people today may be better compared with that of former years, the same is not true of the social and psychological pressures to which young people are exposed.  This relates in part to the increasing instability of family life, as well as changing personal and family relationships.  A special task force should be set up to examine the position of children and young people and its aims should be simple.  It should be given the task of determining the range and size of problems facing young people in modern Ireland and the best methods of addressing, from a social, recreational and educational point of view, the problems identified.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to this important social issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the National Task Force on Suicide, published in February 1998, put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.  The action recommended in the report to reverse the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide is set out in a series of recommendations outlined in the report.  These include the provision and structure of services relating to suicide and to attempted suicide, the prevention of suicide and parasuicide, intervention, aftermath and aftercare, and research and evaluation.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report, the Minister has been in contact with his ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government, with a view to implementing the recommendations of the task force and my Department has contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies, requesting that the necessary measures be put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas. My Department will follow up on this initial contact.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide.  The chief executive officers are in the process of establishing this group and I expect it to be convened shortly.  Membership of the group will include experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research.  The main responsibilities of the suicide research group will include reviewing ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinating research into suicide and making appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers.  The work of this group will be ongoing and it will report regularly to the chief executive officers</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more <Col N="281" /> accessible to the public, particularly to our young people.  Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people.  In response to these concerns, I have given priority to the further development of mental health services for older people and child and adolescent psychiatric services and resources have been made available this year to enable improvements to be made in each of these services.  It is the Minister's intention to allocate additional resources to enable these services to be further developed in the next few years.  It is also intended to increase the level of capital available for the development of mental health facilities in the community to make services more accessible to people.</P>
    <P>I trust the Deputy will accept this Government is committed to the objectives of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide to put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and to further develop our mental health services to tackle this increasing tragedy in our society.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Blood Supply Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly concerned to hear that some non-emergency operations may not proceed because the stocks of blood supply are critically low and that we have been forced to import blood products from the Netherlands to get the health service over the latest crisis in the level of blood supply.  It is evident this problem stems from the dearth of public confidence in the BTSB and the blood supply because of the fallout from the hepatitis C scandal.  The drastic reduction in the number of blood donations by members of the public must be curbed immediately. Otherwise, it will further undermine the role of the BTSB and affect the vital work carried out in our hospitals on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>It is obvious the bad publicity resulting from the hepatitis C scandal has seriously undermined the public's confidence in the work of the BTSB and, while the staff of the board are working extremely hard to try to restore that confidence, it will take a long time.  Further action needs to be taken by the Minister for Health and Children. The BTSB has a serious image problem because of the negative events with which it has been associated in recent years.  That image must be changed urgently.  The association between blood donations and assisting those who are seriously ill must be re-established urgently.  We must put considerable time and resources into updating the message the BTSB has been selling for many years.  This is particularly important because of events in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report, following the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB, Mr. Justice Finlay stated that a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence in the blood supply and blood products could be made by setting up a blood services consumer council.  Such a council would be kept informed of relevant matters concerning the supply of blood and would have the right to make representations to the BTSB and the Irish Medicines <Col N="282" /> Board on issues relating to the supply of blood.  I urge the Minister to follow through on this clear recommendation in the Finlay report on the BTSB.  It would ensure constant analysis of the levels of blood supply and help in the process of building confidence in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>As recently as the end of January the Minister for Health and Children gave assurances, in reply to a parliamentary question, that there were sufficient blood stocks at hospitals and the BTSB to meet hospital requirements.  Why did he seem so complacent a mere three months ago?  Judging by Dr. Murphy's stark warning yesterday, the problem is urgent.  Why was that not foreseen and appropriate action not taken when it first arose? During the winter months there are additional pressures and perhaps excuses can be made but undoubtedly stocks have run dangerously low in the intervening period.  It is not good enough for the Minister to take this casual approach &mdash; we need much more than an <i>ad hoc</i>, stop-start policy on blood supplies.</P>
    <P>Our hospitals and health services depend on an ample supply of quality blood.  Without adequate supplies the job of medical staff is made much more difficult and in some cases it is possible that people's lives could be put in danger.  It is vital that the Department of Health and Children and the BTSB heed Dr. Murphy's warnings.  It is imperative that the Government acts swiftly on his warning and makes funding available for a major advertising drive to recruit more blood donors in the coming weeks.  In the short term we must increase blood stocks, as this is the immediate problem facing our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Much needs to be done in the long term but we have a short-term problem.  I regret that the Minister is not here to reply but I urge him to become personally involved in the drive to recruit additional blood donors.  Perhaps he should ask leaders of trade unions, industry and the arts to highlight this need and to ask the public to contribute to the welfare of the community by donating blood to those who need it.  The issue is so urgent that it is necessary for the Minister to give a lead without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this matter.  I share her concern about the problems which have arisen with the blood supply and I assure her there is no complacency on the part of the Minister.  As she is aware, similar problems have arisen in recent years in attempting to meet the requirements of the hospital sector.  I am glad to say that the national medical director of the BTSB yesterday advised hospitals that the blood supply situation has improved and that the anticipated supplies would be back to normal early next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not satisfactory for hospitals, the BTSB and especially patients that operations should have to be postponed, even for a short time.  It causes upset to patients, affects planned theatre schedules and causes uncertainty at stressful times for patients and their families.  Understandably, <Col N="283" /> priority must be given to patients undergoing emergency surgery.  All urgent and emergency blood requirements have been and will continue to be met.</P>
    <P>In addressing the current problems it is necessary to understand the sources of the current slump in donations.  There has been a general downturn in blood donations throughout the world.  Also, bank holidays are always a slow time for donations, the three most recent ones occurred close together and this is now having a cumulative effect.  However, I have no doubt &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy would agree &mdash; that the root of the problem is the hepatitis C scandal. Since 1994 the BTSB has been the subject of enormous and sustained pressure and criticism. This has naturally taken its toll on the donor population, some of whom have given up donating as a result of the hepatitis C publicity.  In terms of numbers attending BTSB donor clinics, there were 44,000 attendances in the first quarter of this year as against 48,000 in the same period last year.  On top of this, additional precautions against the infection of the blood supply continue to be taken and donor deferrals at the BTSB are approximately 13 per cent, which is high by international standards &mdash; in other words, donations are not taken from 13 per cent of those who attend clinics, as a result of the most stringent safety measures applied by the BTSB.  These deferrals are necessary and understandable in light of the current safety requirements and standards.</P>
    <P>Donors are the single most important resource available to the BTSB and to hospitals in ensuring an adequate blood supply.  I pay special tribute to those blood donors who have continued to donate and ask them to maintain this practice.  I ask those who were regular donors in the past to consider donating again.  The BTSB is also anxious to recruit new donors.  People wishing to donate blood and who consider themselves suitable to do so should contact the BTSB and attend one of the mobile donor clinics or the donor centres in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken by the BTSB in an effort to improve the current blood supply.  First, in anticipation of the current difficulties the board conducted a media campaign over the May bank holiday weekend to attract donors.  Second, a new advertising campaign is being launched by the BTSB next week.  It will focus on patients, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of blood donations, and will involve print and media advertising at national and local level. Third, additional donor clinics have been arranged in Pelican House for 15 and 16 May. The clinic will be open tomorrow, 15 May from 9.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Saturday, 16 May from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mobile clinics are in Bray, Monaghan and Dublin Airport today and tomorrow, and in Carrigtwohill, County Cork and Garbally, County Limerick this evening.  Fourth, arrangements have been made to import approximately <Col N="284" /> 250 units of blood from the Netherlands every week for the next four weeks.  Fifth, a national donor services manager was appointed on 20 April.  He is at senior management level within the organisation and he will develop safe, efficient and cost-effective services to ensure the collection of sufficient blood and blood components to meet the requirements of the hospital sector.  He will also develop a donor care programme to meet the needs of donors.</P>
    <P>The national medical director has acknowledged that we cannot continue to rely on other countries to resolve our blood supply problems and I fully support this view.  We have a long tradition of self-sufficiency to ensure that blood and blood components used in our hospitals have been donated by donors in Ireland and we must continue to strive to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>These are the measures currently taking place to attract new donors.  The BTSB has been making and will continue to make significant efforts to ensure that sufficient blood is available to hospitals.  It is fully aware of its responsibilities in this regard but to achieve its objective it relies totally on the goodwill of the population.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Health and Children last night urged the public to respond to the BTSB's appeal for donations.  I am sure the Deputy would like to join me in adding my voice to the appeal to encourage donors to come forward.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Regional Education Boards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this serious matter.  During the Second Stage debate on the Education (No. 2) Bill, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, made two statements regarding the cost of the regional education boards proposed by his predecessor, Niamh Bhreathnach.  At the beginning of the debate, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I spent many months in opposition attempting to get the previous Government to tell the House what the boards would cost, but to no avail.  I have since discovered that a 1995 estimate stated that they could cost up to £40 million a year to run and that no credible plan was drawn up for their establishment.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the debate, the Minister stated that there are concrete actions which will make a more significant contribution than the creation of a series of £40 million ministerial quangos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was extremely concerned about the accuracy of the information supplied to the House by the Minister.  I had reached the conclusion that no substantial Estimate, like the one indicated by the Minister, existed.  I put down a parliamentary question for oral answer on 12 May asking the Minister to publish in full the 1995 Estimate to which he referred in his Second Stage contribution. The answer given by the Minister to that <Col N="285" /> question confirmed my worst suspicions.  He stated:</P>
    <P>However, it was estimated that, on the basis that in 1994 the administration costs of the vocational education system and the health boards were £14 million and £44 million approximately.  Tentative preliminary Estimates suggested that the operational costs of the regional education boards could cost up to £40 million.  As I have said on a number of occasions, I believe we could have had a more honest debate had this figure been revealed when requested.</P>
    <P>That answer confirms my suspicions.  It refers to a tentative preliminary Estimate based on totally bizarre comparisons that are so simplistic they insult the collective intelligence of the House.</P>
    <P>Effectively the Minister is stating that the £40 million cost to which he referred in the House on at least two occasions was reached by using two reference points.  First, that the administration costs of 37 vocational education committees in 1994 were £14 million and, second, that the administration costs of eight health boards, with their various duties, were £44 million in 1994. From this the Minister is suggesting that officials in his Department extrapolated that the administration costs of the ten proposed regional education boards would cost approximately £40 million.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest that this &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; type methodology can be in any way described as a departmental Estimate, as the Minister has done.  The Minister is doing a great disservice to his officials by suggesting they would produce this figure in the manner he has indicated and elevate it to the standard of a departmental Estimate.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to set the record straight on this matter once and for all.  Will the Minister provide full and accurate answers to three simple and specific questions?  Will he publish the details of the 1995 Estimate to which he referred in his Second Stage speech on the Education (No. 2) Bill, and will he make the file available for inspection?  Will the Minister clarify whether the 1995 Estimate to which he referred was prepared by officials in his Department and, if so, will he outline the guidelines used to produce this Estimate?  Will he tell the House whether this 1995 Estimate was supplied to his predecessor?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his wish to have an honest debate about this matter.  I agree there should be an honest debate but that is not possible until the Minister establishes his credibility in relation to this alleged Estimate and responds in a fully accountable and transparent manner to my three simple and specific questions. His failure to do so can only be interpreted as his having misled the House regarding this important matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to address some important points.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's proposals to establish regional education boards have been on the agenda since the publication of the White Paper in 1995.  During the debate on the White Paper in this House, Deputies repeatedly asked for details of the funding required to implement the widely trumpeted proposals.  The then Minister refused to give these details.</P>
      <P>With the production of the Education Bill at that time, as Opposition spokesperson on Education I asked for details of the costs of the proposed regional education boards, which we were all informed would revolutionise education.  I direct the House to questions tabled by various Deputies on 24 May 1995, 28 September 1995, 10 October 1996 and 17 April 1997 when information was directly refused.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office I have seen outline, best-case projections, produced in March 1995 by officials in my Department with officials in the Department of Finance, in the context of proposals contained in the White Paper.  As I said on various occasions, these best-case projections show that the boards could have cost up to £40 million.  Based on a minimum staffing of the new bodies and the transfer of some staff from the vocational education committees, it was estimated that they could cost in the region of an additional £20 million.  It was further estimated that if the vocational education committees were abolished, as envisaged, and the savings transferred to the regional education boards, they would have cost in the region of £40 million and provided a modest range of services.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there was a flaw at the very heart of these projections which means that they can only have greatly underestimated the true cost of the proposals for these regional education boards. The White Paper and the last Education Bill envisaged the new boards undertaking a range of new services such as a psychological service, a building maintenance service and a library service. A basic estimate for a psychological service of, say, 250 people indicated that this would cost over £7 million.  Similarly, other knock-on costs of the regional education boards were not included in the costings.  One example of this is the recruitment of additional inspectors, estimated at up to £4 million.</P>
      <P>In spite of this, the best-case projections assumed that the regional education boards would simply do for every school, primary and second level, what the vocational education committees currently do for their schools.  As we all know, vocational education committees represent a small minority of the totality of primary and second level schools within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing for the fact that it is three years since the best-case scenario was produced, and especially in light of pay and building cost increases, it is clear that the State would have <Col N="287" /> faced a cost for establishing these boards well in excess of £40 million.</P>
    <P>The real question concerns the reason the House was repeatedly denied basic information on which to base its discussions of fundamental legislation, and the reason a detailed study of costs was not undertaken even when legislative proposals to establish the boards were close to passage.</P>
    <P>The question of whether this Estimate was supplied to my predecessor is amazing.  Any person bringing legislation to the House proposing the establishment of a board such as this should have demanded access to such a file and should have at least inquired about the cost of my proposals in the event of the legislation being passed by the House.  It is an incredible question to be asked across the floor of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would still like the Minister to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, my predecessor, who is a member of the Deputy's party, <Col N="288" /> should be in a position to tell him.  The bottom line is that the file exists and the preliminary Estimate is there.</P>
      <P>I remain firmly convinced that expenditure of this level on a new layer of administration, which would have undermined core strengths of our education system, cannot be justified.  Resources need to be concentrated in the classroom where they are needed.  This will continue to be my policy.</P>
      <P>I will arrange for the 1995 preliminary projections to be placed in the Oireachtas Library where they can be consulted by all Deputies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 18, 28, 41, 45 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in response to media queries, the Garda Commissioner ordered an investigation into alleged surveillance of two journalists employed by RTE.  Subsequently, a further allegation of possible interference with the car of one of the journalists was made.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner that as part of this investigation a senior Garda officer interviewed both journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither journalist was able to provide direct evidence of surveillance taking place but stated that a member of the Garda Síochána had said that there was the possibility of surveillance taking place and advised of certain precautions which might be taken.  I have been informed by <Col N="290" /> the Garda authorities that the Garda advice concerned the possibility of surveillance.</P>
    <P>The Garda investigation in regard to these allegations of surveillance, etc., remains open but, so far, no evidence has come to light which would enable the Garda to submit a file to the DPP seeking directions for a prosecution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women was established as part of the Government's commitment to address the recommendations of the Task Force on Violence Against Women.  The steering committee is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The relevant Departments, State agencies and the non-governmental organisations working in this field are represented on the committee.</P>
      <P>The steering committee has a number of specific objectives which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established; developing a public awareness campaign; co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of the resources among the eight health board regions; co-ordinating and advising on ongoing development of policies; overseeing and monitoring individual agencies' written policies and guidelines; undertaking research and needs assessments nationally, promoting inter-agency training; ensuring maximum value for money from available resources; developing codes of practice for collecting statistics and monitoring responses, and publishing periodic reports.</P>
      <P>It is intended that a regional committee will be established in each of the health board areas and this development is at an advanced stage.  I understand that all of the committees will be in place by the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of establishing the regional committees is to provide a comprehensive and localised response to the problems experienced by women as a result of violence.  The partnership <Col N="291" /> between the State and the public sector is necessary if women are to be presented with a realistic set of coherent options.  It is important also to ensure that women are not put through an additional trauma of having to approach several different agencies to avail of services.</P>
    <P>The membership of the regional committees will reflect that of the national steering committee, while at the same time taking due account of specific local circumstances.  In particular, there is broad acceptance that key agencies in the voluntary sector should be represented on the regional committees, having regard to the fact that many organisations have been pioneering the issue of violence against women for many years, and have invaluable experience to bring to the development of policies.</P>
    <P>The national steering committee is currently working on the development of an awareness campaign with a view to educating people about the extent of the problem of violence against women such a campaign would send a clear and unambiguous message that our society condemns and abhors violence against women.</P>
    <P>The steering committee is also addressing the other recommendations of the task force and it is proposed to publish progress report on the implementation of these recommendations in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda Síochána policy on intervention, I am informed Garda authorities that responsibility for the implementation of that policy is the responsibility, within the command structure, of a designated assistant commissioner. I am also informed that Garda personnel have been appointed as members of the regional committees referred to earlier</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 64, 77, 80 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the most recently published statistics regarding missing persons are contained in the Annual Report of the Garda Síochána for 1996.  The statistics for 1996 show that, of 1,848 persons reported missing, eight remained untraced at the end of that year.  The report for 1997 will be published later this year and I understand from the Garda authorities that the provisional figures for 1997 indicate that of 1,765 persons reported missing in that year six remain untraced.  While more than 99 per cent of persons who are reported missing do return home, I realise that for the small number of families of long-term missing persons there is considerable and ongoing heartbreak.</P>
      <P>As regards the general issue of missing persons, the Deputies will be aware that I have a special interest in the investigation of these types of cases and also in the manner in which the gardaí handle the cases and liaise with the families concerned.  I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to set out, for the Deputies information, some recent developments in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply of 2 December last to a priority question tabled by Deputy Higgins, I referred to the fact that officials of my Department and the Garda Síochána would be travelling to the UK to assess the potential value of a new investigative approach in operation in that jurisdiction.  The initiatives in question involved the analysis of serious crimes using sophisticated computer software, the creation of a national network of designated regional liaison officers to serve as contact points and the establishment of a central help desk for officers investigating particular types of crimes.  A senior official of my Department, together with an officer from Garda headquarters, subsequently travelled to the UK to <Col N="293" /> assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative and its possible application for investigating cases of missing persons in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the operation of the UK initiative is in fact similar to the approach taken by the Garda Síochána in this jurisdiction in that local officers take the lead role in a case and have all relevant expertise available to them as required.  The need for the elaborate structures which they have in the UK is principally to improve co-ordination and to facilitate information sharing among the more than 50 police forces investigating crime there.  We should also not lose sight of the fact that they have considerably more serious crime particularly serious sexual crime involving abduction.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific aspect of the use of state of the art information technology applications, I am satisfied that the module on missing persons which is contained in the first release of PULSE, which will begin its implementation later this year, is equal to the best available to any police force anywhere.  It should be realised that computerised crime linkage analysis systems are generally developed and deployed in countries such as Canada, the USA, Belgium and the UK which do not have a national police force.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputies followed the media coverage of the National Crime Forum.  I was concerned with some of the experiences which were recounted to the forum specifically the incidents where individuals felt that there was poor follow through, albeit in a minority of cases, by the gardaí when it came to dealing with those affected by crime and keeping them informed of the status of an investigation.  Because of this concern, I welcome the recent changes in the procedures for dealing with missing persons cases which the Commissioner has introduced and on the renewed emphasis he has placed on the role of Garda liaison officers in these cases.  New guidelines have also been introduced by the gardaí to assist and involve the reportee or family of the missing person.  It goes without saying that the question of taking any additional operational measures to investigate such cases is being kept under review by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Finally, an official of my Department met recently and will liaise with the missing persons helpline to discuss the operation of the helpline and to see if there is any assistance my Department can provide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 23, 46, 58, 67 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 343 of 24 March 1998, I sought a report on this matter from the Garda Commissioner arising from media coverage which made numerous allegations concerning the original investigation in 1976.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has since reported to me on the case outlining the actions taken by the Garda since dissatisfaction about aspects of the case was first expressed by the deceased's family during the course of 1996.</P>
      <P>I cannot go into the detail of the report supplied to me by the Garda Commissioner but I can say that certain matters have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland for consideration by him.</P>
      <P>What further action might be taken by the garda in this case will depend on the outcome of this consideration.  The situation, therefore, is that I can confirm that the Garda investigation remains open and the up-to-date position is as I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 16, 34, 52, 96, 129 and 141 together.  The origins of the current Garda pay dispute predate the formation of the present Government.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Garda Representative Association concluded an agreement under the local bargaining clause of the PESP-PCW pay agreement which they accepted at the time as full and final settlement of that clause.</P>
      <P>In November 1996, the GRA lodged a pay claim at the Garda Conciliation Council.  Early in 1997, there were open meetings and protests in support of this claim.  Its demand for a special Commission on Garda pay was not accepted by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Since I have taken office, I have overseen the healing of the split in the Garda Representative Association and following intensive discussions which I and officials of my Department had with the Garda associations late last year, a mechanism was found whereby Garda pay issues could be discussed.</P>
      <P>The mechanism was related to the Government decision in late November last to set up a steering group to implement what is called the Garda SMI Report.  Mr. Declan Brennan was appointed as a member of the steering group and he was also appointed to act as an independent chairman of the discussions between official and staff representatives on issues of pay and conditions of members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Discussions commenced under the chairmanship of Mr. Brennan just before Christmas.  Following a number of meetings, the official side made an offer of a 5.5 per cent pay increase in separate discussions on 1 April 1998 with the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. Neither association was satisfied with the offer and withdrew from the talks.</P>
      <P>The independent chairman of the pay talks subsequently invited the GRA and AGSI to separate meetings to discuss developments.  Arising out of these contacts the chairman made a recommendation that the offer to the associations be increased to 7 per cent stating that he was satisfied, based on discussions to that date, that productivity discussions due to take place would yield savings that would justify, at that stage, an increase to 7 per cent.  He recommended that an offer of this amount should form the basis for resumption of talks.  His recommendation was accepted by the Minister for Finance and myself on 18 April 1998, and the substance of it was conveyed immediately to the general secretaries of both associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors returned to the negotiating table on 23 April and discussion on its pay claim has resumed but the Garda Representative Association did not return.  I met with it several times and urged it without success to return to negotiations. <Col N="297" /> As Deputies are aware, members of the GRA engaged in a day of protest on 1 May 1998 and shortly afterwards on Friday, 8 May I met with officers of the GRA to discuss the pay issue but unfortunately no progress was made.</P>
    <P>I addressed the GRA conference on 12 May 1998 and urged delegates to desist from protest action and to return to the pay discussions.  I have also pursued informal contacts with the leadership of the GRA to see if some method can be found to bring the GRA back into negotiations. These efforts are continuing and the opportunity for further discussions on pay remains open.</P>
    <P>This is a dispute essentially about pay.  It is in the nature of things that disputes of this kind are portrayed as a dispute between the Government of the day and a particular association.  The Government's only concern in this matter is the public interest.  The Government would be completely failing in its duty if it came to a settlement with one particular sector which would in reality jeopardise the economic progress which we have made.  Other public service unions have already made clear privately what they see as the inevitable implication of the Government adopting such an approach.  It is not in the long-term interests of the community, including members of the Garda themselves and their families, for the economic progress which we have made to be jeopardised in this way.  There are no easy solutions here.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the Garda rank and file feel they have a genuine grievance over pay and I am very eager to try and resolve the matter. However, the Garda pay dispute is only going to be settled in the context of pay negotiations and it is vital, therefore, that the Garda Representative Association come back to the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised concerning involvement in national wages agreement, a special mechanism for reviewing Garda pay, membership of trade unions and involvement of third party mediators.</P>
    <P>I point out, first of all, that we already have an independent chairman, Mr. Declan Brennan, formally of the Labour Court.  He was chairing discussions between the Garda Representative Association and the official side but the Garda Representative Association walked out of those discussions.  At the recent GRA conference, its president made it clear that he was not interested in any other form of third party mediator being introduced.</P>
    <P>I have told the Garda Representative Association that I am willing to have discussions to identify a mechanism to involve them in the discussions leading to agreement in the next national programme.  The essence of the current dispute is that the Garda Representative Association wants to see a higher no strings attached pay offer while the official side has made it clear that any increase on the existing offer must be linked to productivity.  I remind Deputies that the awards to nurses and prison officers all involved productivity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> My door is always open to the Garda representation and I will continue to explore how progress can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Details were sought by some Deputies on industrial action by gardaí and plans for dealing with it.  As you know, on 1 May 1998 a significant number of gardaí did not report for duty.  I am informed by the Garda authorities, that 4,586 Gardaí reported sick on that day which represents 82 per cent of the total number of gardaí rostered.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities had contingency plans and ensured that a proper policing service was available by making full use of those of Garda rank, including those on probation, who did report for duty, of student gardaí and of sergeant rank and above.  I wish to pay tribute to all those who, in the true tradition of the gardaí, did report for duty and who worked exceptionally hard to ensure that the public was not endangered.</P>
    <P>In particular, I wish to put on record my personal appreciation for the dedication to duty shown by the members of the gardaí involved in foiling the attempt to rob a Securicor van near Ashford.</P>
    <P>I am aware of reports that the Garda Representative Association is considering further industrial action including in particular the disruption of the arrangements for the Tour de France stages scheduled for Ireland in July.</P>
    <P>My priority is to get the Garda Representative Association to return to negotiations as soon as possible.  That is where the question of Garda pay will be resolved.  I sincerely hope that they will have returned to the negotiating table well before the Tour de France in July.</P>
    <P>Once again I would ask for the support of this House in encouraging the Garda Representative Association to take the path of negotiation rather than confrontation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 34.1 of the Constitution requires that justice shall be administered in public, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law.  The principles enshrined in this provision in the Constitution have been underpinned in a number of Supreme Court decisions.  The court's view is that every aspect of the administration of justice must be conducted in public save where an Act of the Oireachtas otherwise provides; there is no general judicial discretion to have proceedings heard in camera; and such power exists only where expressly conferred by Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> There are diverse statutory exceptions to the rule contained in Article 34.1, the majority of which concern the hearing of family law cases, cases involving children and proceedings involving secret manufacturing processes.  Other statutory provisions are designed to prevent prejudice to an accused which could result if the power to exclude the public was not available.  Not all of the statutory provisions come within the area of responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned I can say that the law as it operates in this area is kept under review.  A provision in the Children Act, 1908, under which the court has the power to have the court cleared while a child is giving evidence in certain cases, is already the subject of repeal and re-enactment in the Children Bill, 1996.  The discussion paper on the law on sexual offences will address the question of publicity surrounding sexual offence cases.  The recommendations for changes in the family law area contained in the report of the Law Reform Commission on Family Courts are, together with other recommendations in that report, being examined by the working group on a courts commission.</P>
    <P>Any specific proposals I may have for legislative change will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions 15, 29, 30, 40, 50, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>There were 312 sex offenders in custody in prisons and places of detention on 8 May 1998.  Of these, 280 were serving sentences with the remaining 32 in custody on remand, awaiting trial or awaiting sentencing.  This includes a large number of offenders committed for sex offences against children.  The numbers in the various institutions are as follows: Arbour Hill Prison, 98; Curragh Place of Detention, 92; Wheatfield Place of Detention, 64; Cork Prison, 18; Castlerea Place of Detention, 17; Mountjoy Prison 12; Limerick Prison 11.</P>
      <P>Within the prison system there are, at present, two forms of therapeutic intervention available to all prisoners committed for sex offences against children or adults.  Both forms of treatment are aimed at enabling such offenders gain a measure of control over their offending behaviour.</P>
      <P>The first is individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service.  This form of therapeutic intervention is available in each institution to all sex offenders who seek it, with the temporary exception of those in the Curragh Place of Detention where it will be provided at the earliest opportunity.  The number of offenders who have received this type of treatment cannot readily be quantified without a comprehensive survey my Department's clinical psychology service and the Probation and Welfare services.  However, I can say that all offenders who seek individual counselling are provided with this service.</P>
      <P>The second type of therapeutic intervention is an intensive offence focused group work programme which is available only in Arbour Hill Prison at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months <Col N="301" /> to complete.  The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies.  All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme. To date 40 prisoners have participated in this programme.</P>
    <P>One hears suggestions from time to time that all sex offenders should simply be compelled to avail themselves of treatment and that it is not good enough to confine treatment to those who volunteer.  My advice is that while it is certainly valid to strongly encourage offenders to participate, compulsory treatment simply would not work.  There would be no point &mdash; in fact it would be quite dangerous &mdash; in giving the impression that an offender about to be released was reasonably safe simply because he had been forced through a treatment programme.</P>
    <P>I am keen to expand treatment programmes for sex offenders and my Department is actively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, however, it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>
    <P>A new non-therapeutic programme for offenders, &ldquo;The Thinking Skills Training Programme&rdquo;, was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison earlier this year.  A significant number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill have commenced this new programme.  It is hoped to introduce a similar programme in Cork Prison in the near future. This programme is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders.  The programme will be run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service.  The skills in this new programme include: general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives; how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &mdash; to think before they act; how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people, and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively.</P>
    <P>Such structured interpersonal work with offenders represents a significant development of the role of the prison officer and a new and challenging development within the Prison Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 32, 49, 81, 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The 1997 report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee was received by me on Friday, 1 May 1998.  I intend to make the report public in the usual way after I have fully examined the contents.</P>
      <P>From my initial examination of the report it would appear that none of the issues raised are new and include overcrowding, poor conditions, drug abuse, medical and psychiatric services, etc. Deputies will be aware that the major issues of overcrowding and inadequate prison conditions are being addressed not only by way of extensive building and refurbishment programmes but also in terms of the ongoing development of alternatives to custody in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  I have commented extensively elsewhere on the drug problem in the prison and on efforts to deal with it by reducing both the demand and the supply.  I accept that much work remains to be done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> It is important to provide health care to offenders of an equivalent standard to that available in the general community.  The new doctor's contract has been accepted by all but three prison medical officers.  This will improve primary medical care and the proposed service agreement with the Eastern Health Board, which will lead to the assignment of a number of dedicated psychiatrists, should lead to an improvement in the level of treatment within the prison service to those inmates who suffer from psychiatric disorders or mental illness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 35, 37, 75, 87 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The decision as to whether a prisoner is in need of treatment for a psychiatric disorder is a matter for the medical personnel in our penal institutions. Such a decision can only be taken following medical assessment and diagnosis.</P>
      <P>In the year April 1997 to April 1998, 705 prisoners were referred to visiting psychiatrists by prison medical officers.  Without an examination of each individual case it is not possible to say what treatment, if any, was subsequently recommended or provided.  Prisoners are referred to a visiting psychiatrist for a variety of reasons, including particular situational difficulties and, it should be noted, the numbers of prisoners referred do not necessarily correlate to actual levels of psychiatric illness.</P>
      <P>I do not share the view expressed to the National Crime Forum that up to 10 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy suffer from a psychiatric illness.  Published research indicates that, at most, 5 per cent of committals to Mountjoy Prison had a history of major mental illness and I am advised by the Director of Prison Medical Services that, while these individuals might have had a history of mental illness, it is not necessarily the case that all of them would have required hospital care.</P>
      <P>While adequate psychiatric treatment is available within the prison system there is still room for improvement.  To this end, my Department has, for some time, been involved in negotiations with the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children with a view to improving the organisation and quantity of psychiatric input to the various institutions through the implementation of a service agreement and the assignment of a number of dedicated psychiatrists to work in the prisons area.  It has been agreed by all parties involved that this is the most appropriate approach to addressing the present difficulties and I hope that the proposed arrangements can be put in place in the near future.  In addition, I understand that the utilisation of beds in the Central Mental Hospital and their availability to prisoners, for whom it is not possible to provide appropriate care within prison, is currently under review.  This should lead to greater access to the hospital for those prisoners who require treatment in that setting.</P>

      <P>The previous Government decided against centralised monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  The approach taken was flawed.

      <P>When I took office last year I requested the Working Group on a Courts Commission to consider the issue of drug courts. It recently submitted its report to me.  Drug courts have the potential to be an effective part of a pattern of projects and activities to heal the drug problem and the social evils it creates in society.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind the drug courts is one of restorative rather than punitive justice in which the successful completion of the treatment programme replaces punishment.  The drug court concept is most advanced in the United States where early statistics are encouraging in terms of recidivism rates and cost effective treatment.  The development of a drug court system, as recommended in the working group report, would assist the Judiciary by putting in place the infrastructure to enable the judge to order treatment and to enable that treatment be carried out.</P>
      <P>The goal of such courts would be to reduce drug use among defendants, to increase the community functioning of the participants, to reduce recidivism, to reduce social dysfunction, to reduce the overall cost to the State of the individuals involved and to reduce the cost to the State of the prison service.</P>
      <P>I am sure you will agree that these proposals are without question radical and innovative.  The report is under full and active consideration in my Department at present, and I intend to bring it to the attention of the Government shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a warrant was obtained in February 1995 for the arrest of a person in connection with the death of the person referred to by the Deputy.  In March 1995 the person was charged and returned for trial.  Subsequently, in July 1996 the person in question was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  In 1994, at the time of the incident, the family of the victim were put in contact with Victim Support on the advice of the Garda officer in charge of the investigation.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the most recent published statistics available of illegal drugs seized, are for the year 1996 &mdash; details follow.  The Garda Síochána Annual Report for 1997 will be published in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the Europol National Unit based at Garda Headquarters liaises on an ongoing basis, through its liaison officer, based at Europol Headquarters, The Hague, with various law enforcement agencies throughout the European Union.  This liaison is carried out at the request of the various Garda units throughout the State, as the need arises.  The level of the liaison depends on the nature of the investigation and the inquiry(ies) to be carried out.  The inquiries relate to a broad area of criminality, within the mandate of Europol.  Due to the nature and extent of the operations in question, it is impossible to quantify the exact involvement of Europol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2,615,000 is being provided by my Department for child care in 1998.  This represents an increase of £1,793,000 on the figure for 1997.  The additional moneys will build on the Government's pilot child care initiative as an equal opportunity measure to assist women and men in disadvantaged areas to avail of work, training and education opportunities.</P>
      <P>Part of my remit as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to develop policies and schemes to assist parents in reconciling work and family responsibilities.  My Department has been working in partnership with Area Development Management Ltd.  &mdash; ADM &mdash; to deliver the pilot initiative.  ADM is an intermediary company established by the Government and the European Union to support social and economic development in 38 local area based partnerships and 33 community areas throughout Ireland. Through ADM's work with my Department, the area partnership boards have begun to advance child care as an equal opportunity measure in their areas and many of the partnerships have given &ldquo;added-value&rdquo; to the Department's child care programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Equal Opportunity Childcare Programme will have four distinct elements.  First, capital infrastructure.  Money is being targeted at community child care projects to enable them to upgrade or enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training.  Second, core funding.  This fund will be used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for full-time senior child care workers in up to 25 community childcare projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage.  Third, employer demonstration child care initiative.  This is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities.  The purpose of this initiative will be to look at employer child care support from two distinct perspectives: how support for child care might alleviate difficulties associated with the growing skills shortage currently being experienced by some companies and how support for child care might assist in the implementation of an overall strategy to improve and enhance equal opportunities in the workforce. Fourth, expert working group on child care. The expert working group was established to develop a national child care framework under Partnership 2000.  It will report to the Government <Col N="311" /> in December.  The members of the group are considering a range of child care issues, including the financial and employment implications of an integrated approach to the development of child care and are committed to a policy of equality of access and participation.  They will also be considering the resourcing and sustaining of child care within rural and urban disadvantaged areas, whilst exploring practical solutions to overcoming identified barriers.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity child care programme was designed for inclusion in the National Employment Action Plan which Ireland submitted to the EU in Brussels in April.  Following the Luxembourg Employment Summit at which equal opportunities was acknowledged as one of the four pillars of the EU, employment strategy guidelines were agreed by heads of Government, and member states undertook to take steps to increase the level of good quality child care in order to support women's and men's entry and continued participation in the labour market.  Member states are also committed to giving specific attention to women and men who want to return to the workforce, after an absence, and to eliminate obstacles in the way of their return.  For many families the lack of adequate child care is an obstacle which prevents them availing of training and work opportunities.  Member states have also agreed to promote increased employment rates for women by acting to revise the under representation of women in certain economic sectors and their over representation in others.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity child care programme will be the first of a number of supports planned by the Government to enable women and men with children to have access to training and employment opportunities.  I am firmly of the view that the strategy we are developing is an initiative of major national significance in the move towards achieving equal opportunities in Ireland.  I have succeeded in getting child care included as an equal opportunity measure in the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and I am hopeful that this will result in significant funding being made available to my Department for the development of an equal opportunity child care infrastructure in the post-1999 round of EU funding.  The reality is that the funding for child care, in the context of an equal opportunities measure, has been increased by 200 per cent in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the programme for Government I am committed to the provision of &ldquo;an extra 1,000 prison places within the first two years including a new remand prison, with 2,000 places to be provided in total&rdquo;.  This building programme is well under way and will deliver 1,092 additional places by mid-1999, which exceeds the undertaking in the programme for Government. Plans are now being drawn up for the provision of further prison places promised in the programme document.  Total capital construction costs for the 1,092 additional places, together with all the necessary supporting facilities, will amount to £90 million approximately.  This building programme for the provision of additional prison places, together with the ongoing capital refurbishment programme for the existing prisons, is being funded through the Prisons Vote.  The capital cost of the new prison at Portlaoise &mdash; 400 places &mdash; which is being procured on a private sector funding basis, is included in the £90 million figure.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that construction costs for the additional prison places, at an average of approximately £82,500 per place, represents good value for money in the very buoyant construction sector market.  This figure is significantly lower than corresponding costs incurred in the past.  In relation to the provision of the further prison places to be provided under the programme, I can assure the Deputy that the same level of careful and efficient planning, as used for the current building prison building programme, will again be employed to ensure that best value for taxpayers' money is obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two stages involved in the processing of a prosecution for a drugs related offence: the gathering of evidence by the Garda Síochána and deciding whether or not to prepare and send a file to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the decision on whether or not to prosecute which is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The decision on whether or not a prosecution will be taken summarily or on indictment is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Summary prosecutions are taken by the Garda whereas those on indictment are taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The length of time it takes to process a prosecution is dependent on the complexity of the case, the nature of the offence, the amount of evidence involved and the time taken to gather same.  Accordingly, it is not possible, to <Col N="313" /> give the Deputy an indication of the average length of time it takes to process a prosecution for a drug related offence.</P>
      <P>In general, I would like to take this opportunity to mention that the efficiency and effectiveness of the courts has been improved greatly in recent years as a result of the appointment of additional judges and staff, legislative provisions to streamline procedures, the development of case management systems by the judiciary and the continuing programme of court accommodation refurbishment.  Court delays have been significantly reduced in all courts and virtually eliminated in some venues.  In addition, the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, allows for trials to take place more quickly through the abolition of preliminary examinations.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the programme for Government contained a commitment to introduce a drug courts system.  I requested the working group on a courts commission to consider the matter and to report to me.  The working group submitted its report on 26 February 1998.  The report which contains radical and innovative proposals is currently under full and active consideration in my Department.  I intend to bring the matter to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána are pro-actively involved in a number of schemes and initiatives which feature early intervention and are designed to divert young people in trouble with the law, or at serious risk of being so, from crime.  These programmes require the interest and co-operation of families, and indeed the general community, and the Garda Síochána actively encourage this.</P>
      <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme is a non-statutory scheme designed to divert juveniles away from the judicial system, where possible.  It provides for the cautioning and supervision of young offenders of 18 years or under as an alternative to prosecution.  Under the scheme an attempt is made to see why the juvenile in question has offended and, where a problem is identified, the juvenile liaison officer refers the family to the appropriate statutory or voluntary agency with expertise in the matter.  The JLO will deal with the offender as an individual, a member of a family and a member of the community.  Even where the actions of a child do not amount to a criminal offence, parents-guardians regularly seek support and guidance from the Garda Síochána who will activate the scheme for the benefit of such children.  There are currently in excess of 90 Garda personnel of various ranks directly involved in the operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The youth diversion projects funded by my Department are targeted at specific large, high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities.  These community based, multi-agency projects have a very particular focus being directed at young people who are either involved in, or seen to be at risk of getting involved in, crime.  The projects are also used to target juveniles who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely, or are in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances.  My Department is currently funding 14 such projects at an annual cost of approximately £50,000 each and proposals for a number of further projects are under consideration.</P>
      <P>My Department is also funding the &ldquo;Copping On&rdquo; crime awareness programme which is delivered through Youthreach.  This programme provides at risk juveniles with a context in which they can challenge their offending behaviour.  The programme involves training persons who work with young people as facilitators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department is involved in, and runs, a number of community-based projects which cater <Col N="315" /> for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime. These projects include workshops and day centres where offenders are provided with training in a number of skills.  The purpose is to address offending behaviour, reduce recidivism and to assist such persons in gaining employment.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister of State with responsibility for Children, Deputy Frank Fahey, is at present examining the most appropriate way of providing a multi-agency response to juvenile offending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 90 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board operates 30 law centres around the country, one of which is located in Wicklow.  The Wicklow Law Centre has a staffing complement of two solicitors, one law clerk and two clerical staff.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware this centre, which originally operated as a one solicitor law centre, was subsequently upgraded to a two solicitor office.  Unfortunately, however, this did not bring about a permanent reduction in the number of applicants on the waiting list at the law centre.  At the end of April 1998 there were 159 people on waiting lists at Wicklow, compared to 126 at the end of October 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting lists and waiting times at each of the 30 full-time law centres as at 30 April 1998, for persons seeking the services of the Legal Aid Board, are set out in the first tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.  In three centres the waiting times was one month or less, in four centres the time was between one and two months, in seven centres the time was between two and four months, in three centres the time was between four and six months, in three centres the time was between six and eight months, in one centre the time was between eight and ten months, and in nine centres the time was in excess of ten months.  The waiting lists and waiting times at 31 January 1997 <Col N="316" /> and 31 December 1997 are set out in the second tabular statement which I also propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board continuously monitors demand in all law centres and, where appropriate, prioritises certain cases which would fall into the family law category.  An emergency service (i.e. cases in which applicants are not placed on waiting lists) is provided in cases where there is a real danger of children being taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant, and in proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, proceedings under the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 and for the defence of Child Care proceedings under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Also, I am continually monitoring the position with regard to waiting times at law centres, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board, and I am conscious of the increase in waiting times at many of the board's law centres which has been brought about by the introduction in recent years of additional Family Law legislation including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  Where, for whatever reason, the waiting times become excessive the position is examined by the board and, where possible, appropriate remedial action is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and <Col N="319" /> rehabilitation.  To this end there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.  Treatment for drug addicted offenders has been and continues to be provided as part of the general medical services available to inmates in all of our penal institutions.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation will be supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling.  It is unfortunately the case that despite the availability of this support many offenders continue to fail to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.  The majority of offenders with drugs problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison and, as such, there are more treatment facilities in place in Mountjoy than in the other institutions.</P>
    <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prisons system, is co-ordinated by the Director of Prison Medical Services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community. Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.  I am pleased to note that there has been an ongoing high degree of co-operation between the Eastern Health Board, including the agencies under its aegis, and my Department.  An example is the assistance received in the context of the provision of the necessary professional services for a drug treatment facility in Mountjoy Prison which was established some time ago.  I hope that this co-operation between the prisons and the Eastern Health Board, in the interest of tackling this community-wide problem, will continue and, where feasible, expand.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already the institution with the biggest drug problem is Mountjoy Prison.  The drug treatment facility has been in operation there for some time now at the prison's health care unit.  This facility provides chemical detoxification and a therapy programme.  This unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State and it is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  My Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available to prisoners.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options open where inmates have completed the detoxification programme. They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population; if they are considered suitable they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they can opt for a transfer to the Drug Free Unit.</P>
    <P>The drug free unit is in operation at the training unit, which is adjacent to but separate from <Col N="320" /> the main Mountjoy Prison and has accommodation for 96 prisoners.  This facility enables the prison authorities to accommodate in a totally drug-free and secure environment within the prison system those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse.  It also provides a sympathetic, yet closely monitored setting in which those prisoners who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug-free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs in the general prison population.  The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of gainful work and training related activities in order to assist in the rehabilitation process.</P>
    <P>Prisoners in both the Mountjoy treatment facility and the drug free unit are closely monitored by regular and random urine testing.  This testing is done on a voluntary basis but if samples are refused negative conclusions are drawn.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to female prisoners is, however, unsatisfactory.  This is due, to a large extent, to the extreme overcrowding which exists in the Mountjoy women's prison.  This issue is under continuous review between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board.  I am hopeful that some interim solution will emerge. In any event I am satisfied that this issue can be resolved in the context of the move to the new purpose built women's prison which will be ready towards the end of this year.</P>

      <P>In November 1997, the Government announced its intention to establish a national disability authority, NDA, and a disability support service, DSS.  It also announced the formation of an establishment group chaired by an assistant secretary at my Department, tasked with the preparation of detailed proposals for setting up the NDA, the future location of departmental responsibility for training and employment of people with disabilities and other related issues, and the reallocation of staff and resources to meet the requirements of the new authority for submission to Government within six months.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to anticipate the recommendations of the establishment group.  The Government will make its decisions known following the receipt of the report from the establishment group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the establishment group, which has been meeting since last December, is <Col N="321" /> expected to complete its task within the given six month time frame.</P>

      <P>During European Year Against Racism, 1997 the co-ordinating committee for the year, which operated under the aegis of my Department, was provided with an allocation of £100,000 to implement its programme. The committee was representative of non-governmental organisations, State agencies, social partners and Government Departments.  It progressed several racism themes including the media, gender, education, travellers, racism in the workplace and Government initiatives such as the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the strategic management initiatives.  The  programme implemented for the year addressed racism experienced by nationals and non-nationals, and by black and minority ethnic groups and the traveller community.</P>
      <P>I consider that this committee offers a good model for further work in this area.  I therefore recently announced the establishment of an advisory committee on racism and interculturalism which will build on the work already done to address racism and promote interculturalism. I am providing an allocation of £20,000 to the new committee.</P>
      <P>On 16 December last I moved an all-party motion on racism which clearly rejected racism in all its forms.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my contribution to the debate on the Asylum Seekers (Regularisation of Status)(No. 2) Bill 1998, one of the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee which was set up to examine asylum and related issues was that all appropriate assistance should be given by the relevant public bodies to facilitate the integration into Irish society of persons recognised as refugees or given leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.  The Government accepted this recommendation and it is now included as one of the elements of my Department's strategy statement for the three year period to the end of the year 2000.  In implementing this objective, I hope to create a situation in which those granted refugee status will be able to participate fully in Irish society to their own benefit and that of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, which is currently before this House and the revised equal status legislation which will be published later this year will prohibit discrimination on a range of grounds including race.  The enactment of the equality legislation is necessary for Ireland to fulfil <Col N="322" /> its obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Once these two measures are in place, we will take the necessary steps for ratification of the convention.</P>

      <P>Crime statistics and information regarding detection rates are published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The most recently published report is in respect of 1996, during which there was a decrease of 2 per cent in the number of indictable offences recorded as compared to 1995.  The detection rate increased from 30 per cent in 1995 to 41 per cent in 1996.  The report contains information on a national, regional and divisional basis.  The annual report for 1997 will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>I should of course explain that, as a matter of ongoing practice, my Department is regularly provided with up-to-date provisional crime figures by the Garda Síochána.  While these are provisional figures, it is fair to say that, by and large, they compare very closely with the final figures which eventually find their way into the published crime reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest provisional figures available to me suggest that, in the 12 month period up to the end March 1998, overall crime fell by 14 per cent with total crime in the Dublin Metropolitan Area down by over 20 per cent.  Regrettably the number of reported rapes continues to increase.  I am also advised that, at a national level, there has <Col N="323" /> also been a substantial decrease in burglaries and larcenies, both from the person and from vehicles during that time.</P>
    <P>The assessment of trends in crime and the development of local strategies to prevent and detect crime are, of course, important operational matters.  The Garda Síochána hold regular conferences at regional, divisional and district level, as appropriate, to share information, to develop strategies and to provide for effective operational management and co-ordination of service.</P>

      <P>The management within the prisons division of my Department in conjunction with local prison management carry out continual reviews of medium and long-term projections of the number of prison places required.</P>
      <P>The following is the basis of the management reviews: (1) ongoing review of prison place requirements; (a) the number of prisoners being committed; (b) the length of sentence; (c) offences for which prisoners are committed; (d) special requirements regarding security, medical requirements, etc.  and (2) review of the impact on accommodation requirements of the implementation of the constitutional referendum on bail.</P>
      <P>In 1997 an independent study was carried out for my Department by Mr Paul O'Mahony, Ph.  D. The study titled &ldquo;Mountjoy Prisoners, A Sociological and Criminological Profile&rdquo;, contains statistical and other information which assists management with their ongoing review.  The cost of commissioning this report was £26,500 plus VAT.</P>
      <P>A tender competition was recently held with a view to upgrading the prisons computer systems. One of the benefits of this new system will be the availability of extensive management information on prisoners, which will further assist in the projecting of prisoner numbers.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to sound a note of caution in regard to projections of this kind.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that it is extremely difficult to produce reliable prison population projections.</P>

I would point out, however, that in the past two years 95 per cent of all applicants for refugee status applied directly to my Department and not at their point of entry into the State.</P>
      <P>All applicants for refugee status are given an information leaflet, which briefly outlines the asylum process.  Where possible this leaflet is in a language that the applicants understand.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 155 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Garda Síochána have in place a policy document, in the form of broad guidelines, covering the installation, management and operation of CCTV systems.  However, I am <Col N="325" /> informed that this policy applies only to systems installed in Garda stations and does not cover CCTV being used by commercial or community groups.</P>
    <P>I understand that a training programme is currently being developed, at the Garda College in Templemore, to train prospective members in charge of the CCTV systems operated from Garda stations.  This course will be full and comprehensive and guidelines for use by the Garda members as described, will be drafted and issued to them.  These guidelines have not been finalised. The Garda authorities have informed me that there are no regulations in place governing the use of CCTV systems run by commercial groups. I understand from the Garda authorities that the National Crime Prevention Office is actively engaged in promoting the use of CCTV as a crime prevention technique.  The cost of CCTV equipment has been greatly reduced in recent years and it is now not as cost prohibitive for small businesses and shops.  The Garda authorities further report that feedback from investigators and the staff of the &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; identified the poor quality of recordings from CCTV systems. The injured parties with recordings of crimes did not appreciate the system's limitations or the system itself did not reach the injured parties expectations.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the Garda authorities that the National Crime Prevention Office initiated a programme of training and information dissemination on the use of CCTV.  This commenced in March 1996, with a seminar in the Garda College on operational requirements issued by the police scientific development branch of the home office.  This procedure is aimed at encouraging clients when purchasing a CCTV system to identify what they require from the system.  All personnel from the National Crime Prevention Office and the crime prevention officers from the divisions attended this seminar. The Garda authorities report that this seminar was followed up in October 1997, with a week long course for all crime prevention officers on all aspects of CCTV.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Crime Prevention Officers in the Garda Síochána are highly trained in the use and specification of CCTV.  I understand from them that personnel from the National Crime Prevention Office have spoken on the subject to various groups including: (i) retail security managers at the &ldquo;Threat of Terrorist Attack&rdquo; Seminar; (ii) the National Association of Petrol Retailers; (iii) Forum for Computer Security; (iv) the Hardware Association; (v) the United States Overseas Security Advisory Council; (vi) the International Forum for University Chief Security Officers; (vii) the League of Credit Unions; and (viii) those involved in the transport of high value goods.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities further report that there are six crime prevention officers attached to the National Crime Prevention Office at Harcourt Square and there is one crime prevention officer <Col N="326" /> attached to each Garda division.  These members give advice on all aspects of crime prevention including intruder alarms, access control and operational requirement of a CCTV system.  I understand that the use of CCTV is included in the Garda Síochána's publication &ldquo;A Guide to Retail Security&rdquo; which has been distributed to RGDATA, the Hardware Association and other retail organisations.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda CCTV systems the Deputy may already be aware that town centre CCTV systems have been installed in the Temple Bar and O'Connell Street areas of Dublin city centre.  Work is currently in progress on cameras for Tralee town centre and is expected to be completed shortly.  The Garda Commissioner has established an advisory group on CCTV comprising higher officers in the force and a representative from my Department to examine the future of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing. While their main objective is to evaluate the potential crime prevention capacity of each of the applications received, they are also required to evaluate each application from a technical and telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business-community sources.</P>
    <P>Having considered the recommendations of the advisory group I have drawn up a priority list of locations for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. They are as follows : &mdash; Bray, Cork, Dublin (South Central), Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. Other locations will be added to the priority list in due course.  However, I must emphasise that resources are limited and that the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other locations will depend on the level of commitment and support from local commercial-community interests for these systems.  It has always been the policy of my Department to fund Garda CCTV systems on a shared basis with local commercial-community groups and I intend to maintain that policy for all future Garda CCTV systems.</P>

      <P>Certain changes are necessary in our domestic law before Ireland would be in a position to ratify the convention referred to by the Deputy.  The necessary legislation forms part of the extensive legislative programme which I have under way in my Department at present. Work on the preparation of the legislation within my Department is well advanced and, while I am not in a position to give a definite timescale for completion of the legislation in question, I hope <Col N="327" /> to advance it further as quickly as possible, subject to other legislative priorities.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government made a number of commitments on the reform of the prison service including the establishment of an independent prisons' authority to administer the country's prison system, the appointment of a prisons' inspectorate and the establishment of an independent parole and remission board.</P>
      <P>Under the strategic management initiative process the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with local management of the prison service, has been working on the administrative arrangements to allow the authority to be set up.  This transition work will involve such matters as putting in place appropriate systems, such as IT systems, financial management systems, support for management development and, of course, ongoing consultation with staff associations.  The necessary legislation will be prepared in due course in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This legislation may also address the two other important commitments on the reform of the prison service mentioned above, though, if necessary, the parole board and the prisons inspectorate could be dealt with in separate legislation.</P>
      <P>Early in December I announced I had received Government approval to proceed with the appointment of an interim board to drive forward the intensive preparations required to effect the transition to the authority, pending the enactment of legislation to establish the new structure on a statutory basis.  There are some detailed matters surrounding accountability for the prison service and I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly to address these matters.  It is expected that the interim board will be appointed in the near future.  Legislation will be brought before Government following the establishment of the interim board.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have no function in relation to local authorities.

The forum is in the process of finalising its report and I will ensure that copies are circulated widely when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for refugee status lodged in the first four months of 1998 was 1,785.</P>
      <P>In the same period a total of 33 deportation orders were made.  Nineteen were made in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Convention and 11 persons have been removed on foot of these orders: a further three persons left the State voluntarily.  Fourteen orders have been made in respect of persons who have had full recourse to the asylum procedure and these have resulted in one person being removed from the State.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 53, 84, 96 and 120 on 10 February 1998, having given careful consideration to the matter, I have decided not to proceed with the implementation of the remaining sections of the Refugee Act, 1996 at present.  My reasons are as set out in that reply.

      <P>The Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations recognises that a resolution of the decommissioning issue is an indispensable part of the process and commits the participants to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  The participants have also confirmed their intention to work constructively and in good faith to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within a period of two years following endorsement of the Agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.</P>
      <P>The Agreement also recognises the progress made by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the two Governments in developing workable schemes for decommissioning.</P>
      <P>Both Governments have given a commitment to take all necessary steps to facilitate the decommissioning process to include bringing the relevant schemes into force by the end of June.  In fulfilment of that commitment, I will make the necessary regulations and orders, under the Decommissioning Act, 1997, at the appropriate time.  This will ensure that complementary schemes will be in place in both jurisdictions which will enable decommissioning to take place in both parts of Ireland.  Both Governments will also ensure that the Commission will continue to receive whatever resources it requires in order to fulfil its mandate.</P>
      <P>The Government has long stressed the importance of securing the decommissioning of illegally held arms in both jurisdictions and wants to see decommissioning achieved as quickly as possible. The Government also sees decommissioning as an essential part of the multi-party Agreement. Progress in this area will play a very important role in building up the trust which will be vital to ensuring the institutions and arrangements provided for in the Agreement can work effectively for the good of all the people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The harbour at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council, which is responsible for its repair and maintenance.  Accordingly, it is a matter for the local authority in the first instance to determine what works may be required at the harbour.</P>
      <P>Last year, Cork County Council was notified by my Department that a grant assistance of £52,500 was being made available towards a silt dredging scheme at Ballycotton.  The county council was unable to carry out this scheme during 1997 and, at the local authority's own request, my Department re-allocated the 1997 grant to facilitate the completion of a new pier extension at Courtmacsherry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I understand that the county council has completed the tendering process for the project and that it has made an application to my Department under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996 for a permit for the disposal of the dredge spoil which will arise from the works.  I understand also that the county council is likely to approach my Department again on the question of grant aid for the project.  Any such application will have to be considered within the framework of overall fishery harbour development.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the Multi-Party Agreement which was signed on Good Friday.  The Agreement is based on partnership, equality and mutual respect for the different traditions.  The Government regards its commitment to demonstrate its continued respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland as an important aspect of the Agreement and will be working actively to fulfil it.</P>
      <P>I have established an interdepartmental committee on the development of the Battle of the Boyne site.  The committee, whose second meeting was held in the Boyne area last Thursday, is making good progress in bringing forward firm proposals for this important and historic project. The committee will liaise closely with local community groups, whose important contribution I greatly appreciate.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the decision of the Government to contribute financially towards the First World War Memorial in Messines in Belgium.</P>
      <P>The Government will be examining the potential for further measures in this area in a positive and constructive spirit.</P>

      <P>Article 4(g) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2066/92 states that the total number of animals qualifying for special beef premium and the suckler cow premium is limited by the application of a stocking density on the holding.</P>
      <P>The stocking density limit for 1997 was two livestock units per hectare and as the person named declared a forage area of 12.56 hectares on his 1997 area aid application form he can only qualify for premium on 25.12 livestock units.  He applied for premium on 353 animals under the 1997 ewe premium scheme and had 352 quota rights.  Since each ewe constitutes 0.15 livestock units and by regulation all ewes applied on up to the quota limit must be counted for stocking density, the person named exceeded the stocking density restriction for 1997 under his ewe premium application alone.</P>
      <P>He subsequently applied for grants on 15 animals under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme and as the stocking density restriction had already been exceeded the person named is not entitled to any premium under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

By regulation, animals must be retained for two calendar months starting on the day after an application is received <Col N="333" /> in the Department.

      <P>The Commission's proposals for reform of the beef regime under Agenda 2000 provide as part of a wider package for the introduction of a regional ceiling on suckler cow quotas and for the extension of the lower national special beef premium quota which was adopted in the context of the October 1996 reform of the beef regime. There is no legal impediment to the adoption of these proposals provided that they are supported by a qualified majority in the Agriculture Council. These proposals are designed to reduce beef production in the EU in order to rebalance the market following the fall in beef consumption as a result of the BSE scare in 1996.  However, it is not necessary to reduce beef production through action on the premium quotas in a situation where it is also proposed to reduce beef prices by 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my objections to the Commission proposals in the Agriculture Council, and as the negotiations proceed will continue to press for an overall conclusion that is more acceptable to Irish producers.</P>

      <P>More than 7,200 farmers applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1998 national reserve.  In all, only 4,200 premium rights were available for distribution but more than 50,000 would be required to satisfy the demand. Having regard to the limited amount of quota available relative to the demand and in accordance with the recommendations of the quota review group, priority was given to herdowners with low livestock units.  This resulted in all the available quota being allocated to those with less than 5.8 livestock units.</P>
      <P>The livestock unit level is derived from the applicants permanent suckler cow, ewe premium and milk quota, if any, and the number of livestock units on which the special beef premium scheme was applied for in 1997.  As the person named has 8.6 livestock units, (suckler cow quota of 3.9, special beef premium of 2.8 and ewe premium quota of 1.9), there was insufficient quota in the reserve to allow an allocation to be made to her.</P>

      <P>The pilot early retirement scheme for nurses was introduced as part of the agreement on conditions and pay for nurses under the PCW.  The scheme is open to nurses aged 55 years or over who have 35 years or more wholetime reckonable service for pension purposes on or after 28 February 1997.  Only nurses who meet the eligibility criteria may participate in the scheme.  The operation of the scheme is a matter in the first instance for the health agency involved.  All applications from eligible nurses are considered by the nurses' employer and applications are approved or otherwise by that employer.  In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the nurse concerned first approached the hospital where she was employed with a view to applying for the pilot early retirement scheme in July 1997. The nurse was informed at that stage that she did not satisfy the terms of the scheme.  Staff representatives requested that the hospital put forward a case to my Department for granting the nurse early retirement on the basis that she was the only employee at the hospital who had expressed interest in the scheme.  The hospital has informed my Department that at no time did it give a guarantee that the nurse would be granted early retirement under the pilot scheme.  Only employees who are eligible for the scheme may be granted early retirement, and the Department of Finance has confirmed to my Department that the requirement of 35 years service is essential.</P>

I have no function unless and until an appeal is made to me in relation to the failure or refusal of the local authority to grant a superannuation award or in relation to the amount of an award.  Since the person concerned is not yet retiring, a decision by the local authority in relation to his superannuation entitlements does not arise at this time.  Consequently, the question of an appeal does not arise.</P>

    <P>There is no provision in our public service pension schemes which would allow for the reckoning of public service given in another country. However, such service might well qualify for a <Col N="342" /> superannuation entitlement from that country and I would suggest that the person concerned might investigate this possibility with the relevant authorities in that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare secondary benefits, comprising the Christmas bonus, butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only in conjunction with long-term social welfare payments, reflecting the fact that the recipients of such payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Class A PRSI for community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, was designed to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other Class A workers.</P>
      <P>Since former community employment workers who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit after their period of community employment finishes are in receipt of a short-term payment, they are, accordingly, ineligible for the social welfare secondary benefits.  Statistics are not available on the number of former community employment workers who would be affected.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs of extending entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits to claimants of unemployment benefit, since there is no way of knowing whether such people would satisfy the other conditions for the award of the free fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>In so far as the butter vouchers scheme is concerned, the position is that the value of all cashed vouchers is recouped in full from the EU by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The question of extending the range of the scheme would be a matter for consideration by that Department in the first instance.</P>
      <P>By way of illustrating the costs involved, the extension of the Christmas bonus alone to unemployment benefit claimants in 1997 would have amounted to some £4 million.  It is important to recognise, however, that consideration of any concession along those lines would have to have equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  There would, therefore be a very high cost associated with any such concessions and they could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.</P>
      <P>At the end of last January, free travel passes have been issued in respect of about 505,000 people at an estimated annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>The operation of the free travel scheme is based on the use of spare capacity and, therefore, time restrictions have been a feature of this scheme since its inception.  They apply generally from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  These restrictions have been in operation since the inception of the scheme in 1967.</P>
      <P>There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or on suburban rail services in Dublin and Cork, or on services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country. Time restrictions are only in place on city and provincial bus routes because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to, or from, work or school in the morning and evening.  They do not, however, apply in the case of people with mental disabilities, those attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The extension of unrestricted access to urban services at peak time on a more widespread basis would cause capacity problems for CIE and would give rise to additional costs unquantifiable at this stage.  However, the Department will continue to monitor the situation in consultation with the CIE group to assess the scope for improvements having regard to the capacity and cost constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union and its member states continue to be aware of the major threat which illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs pose to its citizens, in particular, its young people.  While much has been achieved in recent years, the European Union will continue to work actively on a practical and flexible response in tackling drug trafficking, production and cultivation, preventing the use of drugs and reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse and to ensure action against drugs remains a high priority.</P>
      <P>Action against drugs has been a priority for the UK which currently holds the Presidency of the EU.  Particular attention has been given to: priorities for 1998-9 and elaboration of the key elements of a post-1999 EU drugs strategy; co-ordination of the EU input to the preparations for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs, 8-10 June 1998; further implementation of regional initiatives in Latin America-Caribbean and Central Asia.</P>
      <P>Twenty EU priorities have been identified for 1998-1999.  These priorities should: devote particular attention to emerging trends in the illicit production and abuse of synthetic drugs and support continued implementation of the Joint Action on new synthetic drugs; ratify and implement the Europol Convention; ratify the customs information system, CIS, and Naples II Conventions by end-1998 and end-1999 respectively; review of Joint Action on memoranda of understanding between customs and business; continue to run customs joint surveillance exercises and to encourage joint law enforcement projects; consider both the positive and negative impacts on drug misuse of new technology, in particular, the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of these 20 priorities will continue to be areas of priority action for the EU drugs strategy post-1999.  In addition, 12 key elements for a post-1999 <Col N="346" /> EU drugs strategy have been delineated &mdash; the post-1999 strategy should, <i>inter alia:</i> assess the effectiveness of and progress on existing strategies and activities; ensure a balanced approach between demand reduction and supply reduction, so that each reinforces the other, in an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to the drugs problem; provide support and added value to member states, efforts in preventing and tackling drug abuse and drug trafficking; acknowledge the value of, promote and support a multi-agency, multidisciplinary and partnership approach in all aspects of the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>A report on activities on drugs and drug related issues during the UK Presidency will be forwarded to the European Council in June.  This report will include the key elements of a post-1999 EU drugs strategy as an annex.</P>
    <P>An important new aspect of the EU's fight against organised crime, including drug trafficking, has been the work of the multidisciplinary group on organised crime which is taking forward the recommendations contained in the EU's action plan to combat organised crime.  A separate progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the EU action plan is also being submitted to the European Council.</P>
    <P>The EU is continuing to develop its relations with the applicant countries in the context of the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime. A particular emphasis was placed on the issues of drugs and organised crime at the first meeting of the European conference, Heads of State-Government, on 12 March 1998 which brought together EU member states and states aspiring to accede to the Union.  The conference agreed to convene a meeting of experts from all conference countries and the European Commission to consider urgently problems related to drugs and organised crime.  A first meeting of the experts group is due to be held in June 1998.  A pre-accession pact on organised crime with the countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus is to be adopted at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in May.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam is another important element in the EU's fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.  It sets out a more specific mandate for closer co-operation between police forces, customs and other law enforcement authorities in EU member states.  This co-operation will take place directly between the law enforcement agencies in member states and through Europol.  In this context, I expect the Irish electorate to vote for the necessary constitutional amendments which will enable Ireland to ratify the treaty.</P>

      <P>The Government has made a number of commitments in the area of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as part of the Agreement with a view to further strengthening the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction.  These include the commitment to bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights taking account of the work of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution and the report of the Constitution working group.  To that end the Taoiseach has asked the all-party Oireachtas committee to consider giving priority to the question of how the protection of human rights might be further strengthened in this jurisdiction against the background of the Agreement.  Work will also be taken forward in parallel by the relevant Government Departments and offices, including my Department, which will have the lead role for this purpose.  The question of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights will be examined and considered in this context.</P>
      <P>The Government has also made a commitment to establish a Human Rights Commission whose mandate and remit will extend to keeping the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices under review, making recommendations to Government as necessary, providing information and promoting awareness of human rights, considering draft legislation as required, and, in appropriate cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals doing so. Work on the establishment of a Human Rights Commission will now be taken forward in co-operation with the British Government given the link between the commitment which the Government has made in this regard and the commitment the British Government has made to establish a Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>As I announced on 27 April last I am establishing an advisory committee on racism and interculturalism.  The job of the committee will be to advise Government on matters relating to racism and responses to it.  It will reinforce and develop initiatives already commenced by the National Co-ordinating Committee for European Year Against Racism, 1997, to address racism and promote interculturalism.  I <Col N="350" /> am providing an allocation of £20,000 to the new committee.</P>
      <P>The committee will operate as a partnership between non-governmental organisations, State agencies, social partners and Government Departments and will be chaired by Dr. Anastasia Crickley of the Platform Against Racism. Details of the committee's membership, programme and working arrangements are being finalised at present.</P>

      <P>The number of individuals who may belong to, or be associated with or sympathetic towards the objectives of paramilitary organisations varies from time to time and it has not been the practice to provide Garda estimates on this.</P>
      <P>Various considerations, apart from the number of individuals involved, come into the reckoning, of course, when it comes to assessing the &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of these groups, such as their level of access to weapons and explosives, their level of expertise, organisational structure and so on.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of common knowledge and, unfortunately experience also, that there are groups who have the will and the capacity to engage in acts of terrorism.  However, it is important to know, also, that the Garda are constantly active in thwarting the efforts of these groups and important to repeat that the Government, like its predecessors, will face down any threats which groups of this kind may pose to the hopes and expectations of the vast majority, of people on this island, for peace.</P>
      <P>The activities of paramilitary bodies in Northern Ireland is a matter, in the first instance, for the authorities there, and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this matter beyond confirming that the excellent co-operation which exists between both Governments and the security forces on both sides in connection with the activities of these bodies, is and will continue to be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The abuse of drugs within the prison system is largely confined to Mountjoy prison.  As the State's main committal prison, Mountjoy has a large daily throughput of prisoners, many of whom have long histories of drug abuse which they try to maintain while in custody. Most of the other prison institutions are drug free.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of illegal drugs in the prisons.  These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing.  It is my intention to continue efforts to reduce the level of drug abuse in the prison system.</P>
      <P>Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own.  The education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders is important and to this end there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.</P>
      <P>Extensive treatment facilities are in place in Mountjoy Prison to address the drug abuse problem there.  The drug treatment facility in Mountjoy has been in operation there for two years at the prison's health care unit.  This facility provides chemical detoxification and a therapy programme.  This unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State and it is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community. My Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available to prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prisons system, is co-ordinated by the director of prison medical services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards in order try to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community. Developments in medical services for <Col N="352" /> drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.</P>

      <P>Specifically, the social studies element of the programme deals with discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping.  It includes a seminar on ethnicity, traveller culture and discrimination against the travelling community.  Pavee Point makes a presentation at this seminar.

      <P>: The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that neighbourhood gardaí are currently deployed in many urban centres.  Such deployment is generally in response to a perceived need for this type of policing service in individual areas or following a request from the public for such a service in their area and is at the discretion of the Garda authorities depending on the level of resources available for allocation at any given time.  In recent years there has been growing public recognition of the value of neighbourhood policing with a consequent growth in the numbers of gardaí assigned to such duties.</P>
      <P>While figures are not readily available for the number of gardaí engaged in community policing duties countrywide, I understand from the Garda authorities that in the Dublin Metropolitan Area alone there are approximately 450 gardaí currently engaged in community policing.  This figure comprises a core number of 223 neighbourhood gardaí plus 227 gardaí engaged in community policing duties relating to Operation Dóchas.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the deployment of community/neighbourhood gardaí is a matter which is kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>Detention is not part of the process of examining applications for asylum. This is not to say that an asylum seeker may not be detained.  It is possible under the Aliens Act, 1935, to detain non-nationals, including asylum seekers.  The particular circumstances where this may occur are set out in the Aliens Order, 1946 and the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975.  I would also point out that, while it has not yet been commenced, section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996, sets out circumstances in which an asylum seeker may be detained.  While it may be necessary, from time to time, to detain an asylum seeker, I do not, however, see this as being a regular occurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The constitutional rights to an education of children with severe or profound mental handicap are well established and widely known and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that practical effect is given to those rights.  To that end there are procedures in place in the education system for assisting parents and carers to access appropriate education and other services for the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering issues relating to the rights of children with severe or profound mental handicap, I am also obliged to have regard to the rights of their parents who, under the Constitution, are the primary educators and carers of the children and I must also have regard to the physical capacities and, sometimes, the medical needs of the children concerned.  In general, therefore, it is <Col N="362" /> a matter for the parents of each individual child to decide whether they wish to avail of the formal education service offered by my Department.  In some instances parents may choose for clinical or other reasons not to avail of a formal education service.  In the great majority of cases, in making a decision on this, parents are advised by the assessment services and other professionals in the centres which they attend.  These centres generally act on behalf of the children and their parents and my Department is in regular ongoing contact with them.</P>
    <P>A key consideration in determining and responding to the educational and other needs of such children is the individual professional assessment report on the child.  Where such reports recommend a child's participation in a formal education programme, my Department responds accordingly.</P>
    <P>In addition to procedures already in place, it is my intention to give further and explicit recognition to the education needs of children with a disability in the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  The Bill, as published, already contains statutory safeguards for the rights of children with disabilities. In particular, on the enactment of the Bill, boards of management will have a statutory duty to ensure that the educational needs of children with special needs are provided for.  Boards will be required to have, and make publicly available, their admissions policies and there will be structures for appeal by parents.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Bill, I and officials of my Department, have had consultations with a wide range of interests in education, including parents of severely and profoundly handicapped children.  I am at present considering proposals for amendment of the Bill in Committee so as to clarify areas of concern to such parents, to address, as far as practicable, their concerns and to further strengthen the rights of their children.</P>
