      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the Fine Gael Party requested the proposal the Government has just made, hence our reason for not opposing the Order of Business on this occasion.  The particular proposition put before the House to restrict the Home Purchasers (Anti-Gazumping) Bill to one week was on the basis of a request the Fine Gael Party had made to the Government which the Government incorporated in the Order of Business.  That is the reason we have taken this position.  It would be ironic to vote against a request we had made.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach incorporate in the Appropriation Bill, which is promised legislation, power to allow the Government to recoup from private individuals who may have been responsible for fines imposed upon the Government, the amount of the fine, particularly the fine imposed by the EU for breaches of the EU beef regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a question I have raised already.  Will the Taoiseach explain the position regarding the £70 million EU fine imposed on the Irish taxpayer as a result of the fraud of certain beef companies?  Will he explain why a press secretary said last night that the information given by a Minister of State to the House yesterday was wrong and why, within hours, that information was withdrawn and different information given?  Will he indicate the steps being taken to implement article 8 of European Regulation No. 729/70, which obliges the Government to recover money lost as a result of fraud in this area?  Is the Taoiseach aware that this £70 million, which is to be extracted from the taxpayer, would wipe out the hospital waiting lists more than twice over and save lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, will the Taoiseach consider making time available today to discuss this £70 million fine, the three versions of the Government's intentions available to us and the Government's legal advice on this matter? Will he explain why the Government now says that under article 8 it is not obliged to pursue the matter?  Article 8 does not state it has to recover the money, but it does state the Government has an obligation to seek the recovery of the money, even if that attempt is a failure.  The obvious result, if the Government takes no action, is that crooks and gangsters who ripped off the Irish taxpayer and the farming community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will the Tánaiste explain why her party supports a situation where the taxpayer picks up the bill for crooks in the beef industry?

      <P>I support the request made by Deputy De Rossa.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Keeffe, said yesterday in the House that it was not intended to pursue the recovery, under article 8 of the EU regulations, of the money swindled from the Irish and European taxpayer by the beef industry.  Will the Taoiseach clarify today if the position stated here yesterday by the Minister of State is the collective view of the Government?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can explain, I can prove that conclusively.  There are a number of cases involving the State versus Goodman International. There is a case involving export refunds which is ongoing.  There are cases the State has taken against Goodman International relating to irregularities at plants at Rathkeale and Shannon which are being pursued, as Deputy O'Keeffe stated yesterday.  The due legal process is being followed and the total cost is approximately £1 million.</P>
      <P>There are more serious irregularities relating to the Beef Tribunal.  The Government decided yesterday morning to continue pursuing those cases and issued ongoing papers for that case. There is also the matter of the European Court of Justice, with which Deputy De Rossa will be familiar.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has been examining the judgment in favour of the EU Commission for some time, and it made a statement on 1 October against Ireland's appeal on a disallowance by the Commission of some £50 million for inadequate control systems for intervention beef in 1990 and 1991 as well as £18 million in respect of tendering procedures in 1991 and 1992. Ireland considered these disallowances to be unfair and disproportionate at the time and failed to take adequate account of the significant control improvements made since 1991.  The control system at the time was severely strained by the unprecedented volume of intervention beef taken into storage in 1990 and 1991, when some 250,000 tonnes of intervention beef were brought in annually. These disallowances were made under article 8 of Regulation No. 729/70.  The regulation also obliges recoveries of amounts which may have been inappropriately paid under FEOGA funding arrangements.  The question of recovery was examined thoroughly by a working group which included representatives of the Attorney General's office set up when Deputy De Rossa was a Minister.  That group considered that recovery was against the beneficiaries of the funds and could not legally be sustained where the disallowance had been applied in respect of alleged control weaknesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was taken in respect of both the system faults and the multiple tendering issue.  If a legal means of recovering the allowances was <Col N="1215" /> possible, the Department of Agriculture and Food would have pursued it vigorously.  Related to this recovery issue is whether AIBP should be pursued for the non-declaration of deboning yields which, under the regulations, are the property of the intervention agency.  Evidence given by one of AIBP officers in the course of the tribunal referred to this practice and the Department of Agriculture and Food examined the matter in great depth in conjunction with legal advisers &mdash; senior counsel and the Attorney General &mdash; in the recovery group set up at the time by the Government and which reported to the Dáil.  This was the subject of our discussions yesterday and I understand summonses were served on AIBP in Ardee yesterday afternoon.  The next step in the process will be for the Department to submit a claim within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Regarding what happened in the European Court of Justice, I wish to make some further points.  Deputy Rabbitte sought to confuse the two issues yesterday and today on the airwaves. All cases taken by the State against Goodman, involving Rathkeale, Shannon and beef tribunal irregularities, are ongoing and will be pursued in the normal way.  Regarding the £70 million disallowance appealed to the Court of Justice, the Deputy asked why it was not being followed up and why nothing was happening, He may have forgotten about it, which I can understand, but it is more likely from what he said this morning that he clearly remembered it but sought to confuse the two issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies De Rossa and Rabbitte will recall when they were at the Cabinet table the recovery group examined the disallowance in great depth. The Attorney General and the legal team worked on it for a long time and they came to a conclusion on the matter.  On 27 March 1996, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, made a statement on the possibility of recovery of the disallowance and said that he had been advised on the matter by a group of senior officials from his Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General which had access to an independent legal adviser.  The advice to the Government from this group was that it was not legally possible to recover the disallowance in the form of a general levy on the meat industry or through levies on companies against which there was evidence of wrongdoing over the 1990-2 period. Where proceedings could be successfully brought against companies in the Irish courts, this was and would continue to be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case.  The last sentence is the key one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Government has proceeded precisely under the terms Deputy Yates set out.  I have no argument with him about that.  The appeal against the £70 million disallowance went against us but we have followed up all <Col N="1216" /> other irregularities the Deputy set out in his lengthy statement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore yesterday, Deputy De Rossa this morning and Deputy Rabbitte on the radio this morning sought to give the impression that the £70 million could have gone towards reducing hospital waiting lists and other matters.  The judgment has no immediate effect in budgetary terms because the transfer to the EU budget of the amount of the disallowance took place when the Commission took the clearance decision in 1996.  This means Deputy De Rossa actually agreed to the money being docked at the time and he should recall that.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 26, after &ldquo;(1993)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of 25 May 1993&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments simply seek to insert in the Bill the dates of the two UN resolutions which we are implementing.  This is in line with normal practice.  I understand the Minister did not accept the validity of this point on Committee Stage, but I ask him to reconsider what I am suggesting.</P>

      <P>The phrases used in section 2, namely, Resolution 827 (1993) and Resolution 955 (1994), is the accepted way in which UN resolutions are identified and referred to.  It is the identifying method used by the UN and other countries.  For example, the British, Australian, New Zealand and German legislation enacted to give effect to the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals identify the resolutions in this way.  Readers of the Bill interested in knowing the actual dates on which the resolutions were passed will find them in the First and Second Schedules to the Bill where the texts of the resolutions are set out.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage I have again examined whether any useful purpose would be served by inserting the dates of the resolutions.  Following that examination I have concluded that to include the dates as proposed by Deputy Upton would create an undesirable precedent and the proposed amendments are accordingly opposed.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  As there is no commencement section the Bill comes into operation <Col N="1223" /> on passing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> While the amendment may not be necessary, it has merit from the point of view of clarity.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment and the technical point it makes in regard to the difference between &lsquo;commencement&rsquo; and &lsquo;passing&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>This legislation will effectively result in the establishment of two international war crime tribunals, one to deal with the situation in Bosnia and the other with that in Rwanda.  We have witnessed appalling atrocities in Rwanda with some 800,000 people dead.  In Bosnia, 200,000 people had died before the Second Stage debate; that number had increased by Committee Stage and, in light of the Kosovo massacres, has now increased even further.  We effectively appear to be closing the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
      <P>I made the point on Committee Stage that we expected these kinds of crimes to cease after the Holocaust and the Nuremberg Trials.  Since then, we have witnessed a series of international atrocities where people like Idi Amin have effectively gone unpunished.  In regard to the Central African Republic, Emperor Bokassa, installed by the outgoing imperialists, carried out appalling atrocities but no sanctions were imposed on him. I had the pleasure of visiting Cambodia to assist in the supervision of elections there and witnessed a people with a proud and sad past still experiencing the ravages and suffering of the Pol Pot regime.</P>
      <P>An international war crimes tribunal was to be established last June in an attempt to end the <i>ad hoc</i> approach we are witnessing here with tribunals being set up after hundreds of thousands of people have been brutalised.  A permanent international war crimes tribunal was to be put in place which would deal with individual cases as they arose and also act as a deterrent to such atrocities occurring in the future.  We should be talking about the international war crimes tribunal which has effectively been agreed by the international community but has not yet been established.  If the tribunal had been in place, much of the current bloodshed and barbarism in Kosovo might have been avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlighted the situation in Algeria week after week, chronicling atrocities such as the cutting of 11 Algerians' throats.  Thousands of Algerians were physically and mentally maimed, thus destroying the spirit of a nation.  One article points out that <Col N="1224" /> in a normal country, a government would be free to resign but people in Algeria were left to suffer and die in silence.  Algerians asked why the authorities allowed massacres to occur.  One headline informs us that attackers, screaming like jackals, massacred 87 people and injured 100 others in a three hour ordeal.  Another states that attackers drilled holes in people's hands and bodies with electric drills and burned their beards.  An exarmy conscript admitted to being part of the regime which saw many villagers tortured and murdered.  Unspeakable barbarities were carried out in Algeria with babies being thrown into cauldrons and pregnant women having their entrails turned out on the desert sand.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lingering commitment to the establishment of an international war crimes tribunal.  A series of deadlines were laid down, of which last June was to be the definitive one, yet nothing tangible appears to be happening.  I welcome the establishment of these two tribunals and believe they are very important as they are beginning to bring the perpetrators of these war crimes to justice.  However, a permanent institution must be put in place to deal with problems as they arise and act as a clear deterrent to anyone who might contemplate committing such atrocities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the comments made by Deputy Higgins in regard to the necessity for a permanent international war crimes tribunal.  It is fair to say that successive Governments have campaigned for the establishment of such a tribunal.  The two current tribunals are <i>ad hoc</i> ones set up to deal with atrocities in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</P>
      <P>Since publication of the Bill, negotiations to set up a permanent international court have been successfully concluded.  The establishment of such a court has been mooted for the best part of 50 years.  In June and July, the diplomatic conference in Rome adopted a statute for the establishment of a permanent court and I am pleased to inform Deputy Higgins that it will be based in The Hague.  This is a very significant development. The statute will enter into force once it has been ratified by 60 countries.  Coincidentally, the statute is due to be signed on Ireland's behalf at a signing ceremony in Rome today.  I am confident the establishment of this independent permanent court will eliminate the need for the establishment of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals into the future. However, should such a need arise, it can be dealt with under section 37 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Higgins and the Minister in regard to the appalling atrocities which have occurred.  This Bill goes some way towards dealing with those and, while I hope it is unlikely that a large number of war criminals will turn up in Ireland, it is important we have the necessary legislation in place to deal with such an eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the position he has taken on the amendment.  I doubt the future of the world will hinge on whether he accepts it but perhaps he will do so as a gesture of goodwill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 25, after &ldquo;made,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and upon the Court being satisfied that such certificate has been presented in accordance with this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to remedy what seems to be a clear unconstitutionality in the Bill. Section 9 states that on being given a Minister's certificate the court shall make an arrest order. This seems to fly in the face of repeated court decisions on the powers of the courts and their independence, especially in regard to the Sinn Féin funds case in 1950.  In addition, the Minister's certificate may contravene the recent ruling in the case of the Employment Equality Bill.  The amendment would introduce a degree of discretion which may save the section from a finding of unconstitutionality.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister of State said the amendment was of a drafting nature.  I presume that is an oversight.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will accept that there is rather more to it than that it is of a drafting nature.  It is highly undesirable that a Minister can order arrests without the intervention of the court.  There is a very strong risk that this section will be found to be unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right when he says it is of a drafting nature.  Every amendment has an element of drafting, otherwise it would not be on the paper.  In that sense what the Minister is telling me is like telling me today is Wednesday. However, I take the point.  Sometimes, as we would all acknowledge, it is necessary to state the obvious.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this.  The risk that the section will be found unconstitutional is quite high.  Also, it is undesirable that a Minister should be able to make arrest orders without the intervention of the court.</P>

As I explained in my Second Stage speech, this Bill is modelled closely on our general extradition legislation.  Section 27(5) of the 1965 Act provides that where the judge issues a warrant for the provisional arrest of a person he shall inform the Minister who may, if he thinks fit, order the warrant to be cancelled and the person arrested under it to be released.  This is pursuant to the Minister's general power to refuse extradition and to release a person from custody contained in section 35 of the 1965 Act.  The power given to the Minister by subsection (3) of section 11 follows from the general power to release given to the Minister by section 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the power is given to the Minister is so that action to set a person free or to prevent <Col N="1227" /> him or her being arrested can be taken immediately such action is necessary where, for example, the Minister is informed by the International Tribunal that it is no longer interested in a particular individual and will not be pursuing a request for his or her surrender.  The proposed amendments are, therefore, opposed.</P>

      <P>The next amendment is amendment No. 7 in the name of the Minister.  Amendment No. 9 is consequential on it.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 13 are related.  Is it agreed to take amendments Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 13 together?  Agreed.  Recommittal is necessary in respect of this and the other related amendments as they do not arise out of committee proceedings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(b) if the warrant has been executed and the person arrested under it is in custody, require that he or she be released.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I am also accepting amendments Nos. 8 and 13 in the name of Deputy Upton.  Amendment No. 9 is consequential on these amendments.  I am accepting Deputy Upton's amendment No. 8 because the provision as it stands in conjunction with section 15 would mean that the Bill would be excluded, even in the case of persons who are only suspected of war crimes but not yet charged or convicted.  In some instances this could be seen as unacceptable in the particular circumstances of the case.  Under the provision as amended by acceptance of the proposed amendment No. 8 it will be for the High Court to decide whether the person arrested shall be detained having regard to all of the circumstances of the case, including the international obligation imposed by the tribunal Statute to co-operate with the tribunal in its investigation and the fact that the application is made on the ground of urgency with the implication that if the person is not detained he or she may flee the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of amendment No. 8 means that amendment No. 13, which is consequential on my accepting amendment No. 8, is also accepted.  My own amendments Nos. 7 and 9 arise from the acceptance of amendments Nos. 8 and 13 from Deputy Upton.  Section 11(3)(b) and section 13(2) of the Bill were drafted on the basis <Col N="1228" /> that all persons would be remanded in custody. Given that I am accepting amendments Nos. 8 and 13 this will not now be the case.  Accordingly, amendments Nos. 7 and 9 which are purely drafting amendments are necessary.</P>

While the provision for bail is now being included in the Act, and that is desirable, neither I nor anybody in the House would encourage giving bail to war criminals.  However, it is important that the provision be there to meet the constitutional requirements.  I thank the Minister for accepting the two amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 20 to 22.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, all High Court decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court, save where restricted by law.  This subsection purports to limit appeals in these important criminal custody cases, save on a point of law, which I believe is wrong.  An important issue, such as personal liberty, should always be capable of being made the subject of a full appeal.  Accordingly, I am proposing to delete section 14(5).  It is also worth noting that this provision restricts the prosecution as well as the defence and could be a major liability in years to come.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are complementary and need nothing further to be added.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed to section 14 by the deletion of subsection (5) is opposed.  If that amendment fails, the proposed amendments to sections 18 and 19 will fall as a consequence.</P>
      <P>The deletion of section 14(5) would fly in the face of established practice in extradition generally. Section 29 of the Extradition Act, 1965, provides that no appeal shall lie against the decision of the court committing a person to prison, there to await the order of the Minister for his extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to similar orders under section 14 it was decided because of the nature of the international tribunals and the serious issues which could be involved, that an appeal on a point of law should be allowed.  However, while an ordinary appeal will not be available to the person who has been committed to await his or her surrender, it will be open to that person to make a complaint under Article 44.2 of the Constitution. He or she will have been specifically informed by the High Court of his or her right to make such a complaint.  That fact, and the possibility of an appeal on a point of law, constitutes adequate <Col N="1230" /> safeguards for the person and I do not accept that anything more is needed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, if subsection (5) remains, the amendments proposed to sections 18 and 19 fall as a consequence.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment.  The Attorney General has certain prosecution functions by statute. In addition, case law has made clear that the DPP's powers are in addition to the Attorney General's powers under the Constitution.

      <P>A case might arise where the consent of the Attorney General might be required before a prosecution could be mounted but there is no need to refer to such cases.

      <P>In page 17, line 2, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that the Minister can order a garda to apply for a search warrant.  That is highly unusual and highly undesirable.  Any orders to a garda should come down through the ranks from the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister cited on Committee Stage a precedent from 1994 but it is <Col N="1231" /> a highly undesirable precedent which should be changed.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted the Garda on its attitude to this matter being included in the Bill? It allows for the Minister to some extent to politicise the Garda, which is highly undesirable.  I am not suggesting for a minute that this is a serious risk, given the type of matter about which we are talking, but there is an important matter of principle involved.  It is very undesirable for the Minister to take upon himself powers to engage in day to day Garda functions which are rightly within the control, and at the discretion, of the Garda Commissioner and the various officers down the line from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On face value, Deputy Upton might be thought to have an argument but he does not have one.  The provision that search warrants may be applied for only after a direction by the Minister follows from the fact that it is to the Minister that the international tribunal will address any requests for assistance and co-operation or any requests for surrender or provisional arrest of persons sought by it.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that the Minister, the representative of the Government on whom the statutes of the tribunal impose the obligation of co-operation with the tribunals, should have a general supervisory role over action taken in aid of the tribunals.  If difficulties arise in connection with any requests for assistance from a tribunal, or if there is a need for further information or clarification, the Minister of the day should be the one to deal with the tribunals.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the provision is not new.  There is a similar provision in section 55 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  This deals with search warrants in regard to materials sought in connection with investigations arising out of criminal proceedings in other states with which we have judicial co-operation agreements.  In section 55, as in section 30 of this Bill, applications for search warrants can be made only after a direction by the Minister given in response to a request for assistance from a foreign government.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Upton's query, I did not consult the Garda on this section.  There was no need to do so and I trust my explanation fully outlines why that was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the technical reasons put forward by the Minister &mdash; they are plausible when stated in the context he mentioned. However, it would have been desirable to obtain the views of the Garda on this matter.  There is an important principle at stake here in relation to the power given to the Minister to direct the Garda, which is highly undesirable.  I will not press the amendment but it would have been desirable to have found some way around the difficulty rather than leaving the power with the Minister to direct the Garda in what one might call operational matters.</P>

We propose that the Attorney General's scheme of legal aid should be amended to cover this Act. Perhaps the Minister can clear the ambiguity and let us know the exact position on this.

      <P>At face value I was not sure what the amendment sought to achieve but Deputy Upton has elaborated on that.  The Attorney General's scheme of legal aid is nonstatutory and it would be inappropriate to refer to it in this statute, as the amendment proposes. The principle of providing legal aid is wellestablished and I assure the Deputy that an appropriate scheme of legal aid will be put in place to deal with applications under this Bill. Pending a policy decision on the appropriate scheme for this purpose <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements will have to apply.  The amendment is opposed for the reasons outlined.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment designed to reflect that a tribunal may be set up by an organ of the United Nations &mdash; for example, the Security Council &mdash; rather than the UN as a whole.

      <P>The addition proposed by this amendment is not considered appropriate.  I <Col N="1233" /> am not clear what &ldquo;any organ thereof&rdquo; means in this context.  The Bill envisages that the Minister may make regulations declaring any tribunal and court established by the United Nations to be an international tribunal for the purposes of the Act. The two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals we are dealing with were established by resolutions of the Security Council and if further <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals are established it will presumably be through the Security Council also.  They will clearly come within the phrase &ldquo;established by the United Nations&rdquo; and nothing more is needed.  In those circumstances the amendment is opposed.</P>

      <P>This amendment removes the Minister's power to amend the Bill by regulation.  Even though the regulations would have to be approved by the Oireachtas I believe this is a highly dubious and undesirable power.

That is the purpose of section 37(1)(b) which the proposed amendment would delete.  This provision can be found in other legislation; for example section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 has a similar provision to that in this Bill, and no question was or has been raised about that.  Any regulations made under section 37(1)(b) would have to be approved by both Houses before they could take effect.  This is a safeguard against any unduly wide exercise of the regulation-making power.  I believe this is a useful provision which should be retained.  The amendment is opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The Bill is primarily a consolidating measure which amalgamates the Jurisdiction of Courts and <Col N="1234" /> Enforcement of Court Judgments Acts.  It also involves consequential adjustments to the Maintenance Act, 1994.  A further element which attaches to it is that it will enable the State to ratify a convention of 1996 on the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Convention and Protocol on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, signed at Brussels in 1968.  Apart from a minor procedural amendment to the existing legislation, the only other adjustments being made arise as a result of technical changes required by the 1996 Accession Convention.</P>
      <P>The Acts of 1998 and 1993 gave the force of law in the State to the 1968 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments as amended by the various conventions covering the accession of new member states.  The 1968 convention was of far reaching importance, providing and setting up procedures for the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments of the various member states of the European Communities, now termed the European Union. The Acts also gave the force of law to the 1971 Protocol on the Interpretation of the Convention by the European Court of Justice, and the 1993 Act made provision for the Lugano Convention of 1988 and its Protocol to have the force of law in the State.  The Lugano Convention runs parallel to the 1968 Judgments Convention and provides for similar recognition and enforcement procedures as are contained in the 1968 convention. However, it is only concerned with the enforcement of judgments as between EU member states and states which are members of the European Free Trade Association, EFTA.</P>
      <P>Before outlining, in a general way, the main features of the measure we are discussing, I should like first to deal with the background to the 1968 convention and to the Lugano Convention and to touch upon some of the key provisions in those instruments.  These conventions provide speedy and informal procedures for enabling judgments given in one participating State to be recognised and enforced in each of the other participating States.  More fundamentally, the conventions prescribe jurisdictional rules which determine the court in each State which is competent to rule on an action.  Normally, a defendant is to be sued in his or her country of domicile, which, in this context, usually means the country in which he or she ordinarily resides.  However, in certain cases, a person can take proceedings in his or her own country against a person domiciled in another contracting State, instead of having to sue that person in the country in which they reside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of both conventions, Article 1 sets out their scope.  They apply in civil or commercial matters, whatever the nature of the court or tribunal. However, they do not extend to criminal matters.  They do not apply to revenue, customs or administrative matters.  Excluded too are wills and succession, bankruptcy, social security and arbitration.  Furthermore, the conventions do not <Col N="1235" /> apply to the status or legal capacity of natural persons, to actions such as divorce, for example, nor do they extend to rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am pleased that, along with the other EU member states, on 28 May 1998 Ireland signed a convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters, following negotiations over a number of years at EU level.  That convention is concerned with judgments in the area of divorce, legal separation and annulment, as well as custody and access matters.  When finally adopted by Ireland, a process which will require legislation, judgments given in accordance with its jurisdiction rules will be entitled to recognition and enforcement in all EU member states.  There is an associated protocol to the convention providing for its interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which has also been signed by the State.</P>
    <P>Returning to the 1968 convention and to the Lugano Convention, Titles II &mdash; Articles 2 to 24 &mdash; contain, for the most part, jurisdictional criteria. These articles specify comprehensive rules which serve to determine the court vested with jurisdiction.  The importance of this is that, with a few exceptions, an enforcing court in another member state is obliged to accept the jurisdictional competence of the court which gave the original judgment.  Because of this, enforcement of a judgment given in one member state is virtually automatic in each of the other member states.</P>
    <P>Domicile is the connecting factor under the conventions to link a person with a contracting state for purposes of grounding jurisdiction.  In this context, however, the term does not have the strict legal meaning which it normally has under Irish law.  Instead, for convention purposes, domicile is equated with ordinary residence.  The provisions of the Ninth Schedule to the Bill deal with this matter.  I will refer further to this when I outline the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of exceptions to the general rule providing that a person domiciled in a state is to be sued in the courts of that state.  For instance, in matters relating to a contract, a person may be sued in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question, and in matters relating to a tort, for example, defamation, a person may be sued in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.</P>
    <P>Under the conventions, there are a small number of grounds on which a judgment may not be recognised.  They include, where recognition would be contrary to public policy in the state where such recognition is sought, or where the judgment is irreconcilable with one given in a dispute between the same parties in that state.</P>
    <P>The origins of the 1968 convention are to be found in the Treaty of Rome.  Under Article 220 of the treaty, member states were asked to secure &ldquo;the simplification of formalities governing the <Col N="1236" /> reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals&rdquo;.  This reflects the fact that respect for the law in society depends to no small extent on the existence of effective means of enforcement.  While this has particular resonance in the area of criminal law, it also applies in the civil law arena where, for example, the ability to enforce money judgments may be of crucial importance to the survival of a business or enterprise.</P>
    <P>One very useful aspect of the conventions which strengthens enforcement mechanisms is the provision which allows recourse to the courts of any of the contracting states to seek provisional or protective measures, although the substance of the case falls to be heard by the courts of a different contracting state.  For example, a plaintiff in Germany who is taking proceedings against a defendant in Germany under the conventions could apply for an injunction in the courts of another contracting state which would have the effect of freezing any assets that defendant might have in that state.  In consequence when judgment was given, the German plaintiff could secure effective enforcement in the other state, if the defendant had insufficient assets in Germany to meet the judgment.</P>
    <P>The criteria to be applied in deciding whether to grant such reliefs are a matter for a state's internal law.  In addition, the legislation here provides that a court need not grant such measures if it considers it inexpedient to do so.  The conventions also provide that a person is automatically entitled to obtain protective measures once a court has authorised the enforcement of a judgment.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that at the heart of the conventions lies a very simple concept.  It is the provision of speedy and informal procedures to allow judgments in one participating state to be enforced in another participating state.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is a technical one, the enforcement of judgments does have increasing relevance to the lives of people in the state and it will have an ever increasing relevance as there is greater mobility of people and greater commercial interaction between this State and other states which are parties to the conventions.  From time to time, people will find the need to bring legal proceedings outside the state or if they bring them in our own courts, they may need to seek to enforce judgments granted by those courts in other states.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the details of the Bill. Part 1, sections 1, 2 and 3, sets out the short title, commencement and standard interpretation provisions, as well as the Schedules to the Bill.  The Bill will be brought into force by ministerial order and section 1 makes provision for different parts to be brought into operation at different times. As the primary purpose of this measure is to enable us to ratify the 1996 Accession Convention in respect of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the commencement order will not be made until Ireland has ratified that convention.  As of now, <Col N="1237" /> three countries, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands, have ratified the Accession Convention and it is due to come into force on 1 December of this year in respect of those countries. It is my intention that Ireland will proceed with the ratification process as quickly as is feasible and that the Bill will be commenced with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>The interpretation provisions relevant to the 1968 convention as amended are contained in section 4.  The only new element here is that there is provision for an extended definition of &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; in the context of the conventions, to include authentic instruments and court settlements, and also arrangements relating to maintenance obligations as referred to in Article 10 of the 1996 Accession Convention.  Authentic instruments are a feature of certain continental countries and usually provide for the enforcement of financial obligations without the need to have recourse to the courts.  The reference to arrangements relating to maintenance obligations concluded with administrative authorities was inserted pursuant to the 1996 Accession Convention, and such arrangements are quite common in Scandinavian jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the extended definition will be that all these instruments and measures can in future be enforced via the Master of the High Court, rather than by way of application to the High Court itself.  This is the only procedural change which is being brought forward under the Bill.  The remaining sections in Part II do not differ in substance from equivalent provisions which were contained in the 1988 and 1993 Acts.</P>
    <P>Part III essentially makes the relevant provisions of Part II applicable to the Lugano Convention, which, as I said, governs enforcement of judgments as between EU and EFTA states.  That convention mirrors the provisions of the 1968 conventions as amended by the subsequent Accession Conventions.  Part IV makes certain amendments to the Maintenance Act, 1994, which are required as a consequence of this Bill and repeals the Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993.</P>
    <P>The nine Schedules to the Bill contain the texts of the 1968 convention, as amended, and the Protocol on interpretation by the European Court of Justice; the key provisions of the four accession conventions, and the text of the Lugano Convention and Protocol.  I draw Deputies attention, in particular, to the First and Second Schedules which are consolidated versions of the texts of the convention and Protocol and, therefore, incorporate amendments made thereto by the various accession conventions. They are the 1978 accession convention in respect of Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom; the 1982 convention which concerns Greece; the 1989 convention covering the Spanish and Portuguese accession and the most recent instrument of accession which involved Austria, Finland and Sweden in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the importance of the 1968 convention that Article 63 thereof recognises the <Col N="1238" /> fact that any State joining the European Community is required to accept it as a basis for negotiations on this subject and, on becoming members of the EU, Austria, Finland and Sweden undertook, subject to necessary adjustment, to accede to this convention and its associated Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a technical measure.  However, I hope its passage through the House will help to develop awareness among the public of the practical importance of the conventions to all of us. The fact that the legislation in this area has now been consolidated should make it more accessible to practitioners and anyone else who needs to have recourse to the enforcement machinery of the conventions.  I am especially pleased to bring forward this legislation, which is at the core of judicial co-operation in the civil sphere, in the aftermath of the successful referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant recent development in economic terms is the globalisation of products and markets.  Increased international competition and the growth in telecommunications and other new technologies mean that measures providing for jurisdiction and enforcement across national boundaries become more necessary and contracts drawn up in one country for enforcement in another become a routine part of life.  In this context a system which guarantees the virtually automatic enforcement of foreign judgments in 18 states is an important and practical tool for anyone doing business across national boundaries.</P>
    <P>The progressive elimination of barriers to trade, including the development of the Single Market, means that now, more than ever, predictability and certainty are vital in the area of business and commercial relationships within Europe and beyond.  Individuals and corporate entities need to be sure that they can readily enforce contracts and secure enforcement of judgments for large sums of money.</P>
    <P>Ireland's rate of export growth has expanded dramatically in recent years and the value of our exports in 1997 was £35 billion, an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year.  While this figure covers countries other than the EU and EFTA group which are subject to the convention, it should be noted that the most recent figures available indicate that almost 70 per cent of our trade is with EU countries and a further 3 per cent with the EFTA states.  I mention these figures in order to show the practical importance of the system of recognition and enforcement of judgments under the conventions.</P>
    <P>Work is under way at the Hague Conference on Private International Law on developing a worldwide convention providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial areas.  This emphasises the fact that there is a great deal of potential for expansion and development in the sphere of judicial co-operation in Europe and beyond.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Consolidating legislation is welcome as it seeks to merge, rationalise and make more comprehensible a series of Acts which have been introduced in regard to the same or related issues over a period of time.  There is an urgent need to introduce such legislation across a range of areas in all Departments, but particularly in the justice sphere.</P>
      <P>All one has to do is look at intoxicating liquor licensing.  The licensing trade is regulated by a myriad of Acts which date back as far as the 1830s.  A series of Acts also deals with road traffic, which badly needs to be brought together under one umbrella.  In the area of criminal justice, not alone do we have the annual Criminal Justice Act, but in recent years there has been a plethora of legislation dealing with virtually every aspect of criminal activity, including drugs, laundering of criminal assets, offences against the person, etc.</P>
      <P>It must be extremely difficult for the Garda, in enforcing the law, and the courts, in interpreting and administering it, to keep up to speed with legislative change and the complexities of the new measures and requirements.  It must be particularly difficult when one Act supersedes, amends or embraces previous legislation, in part or in whole.  It is a major and daunting task to undertake consolidation of legislation, but in the interests of clarity and certainty each Department should have a section working on consolidation of previous Acts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and while we might pat ourselves on the back because we are among the first EU member states to ratify the accession convention of Austria, Finland and Sweden, there is a general tardiness on the part of all European states &mdash; and we are no exception &mdash; in ratifying and implementing European conventions and regulations.  This Bill enables us, as the Minister stated, to ratify a convention which was put in place in 1996.  Why has it taken two years to reach this stage?  The 1968 EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments on Civil and Commercial Matters was only ratified by the Dáil through the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988, while we are among the first in the queue on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Generally, Ireland has a tendency to merrily sign conventions and then allow two years and in some cases eight or ten years or more to elapse before it does anything about them.  This is a serious issue because we are talking about people's rights and entitlements.  They are entitled to expect that when Ireland, through its Minister or Ambassador, appends a signature on their behalf to any convention or agreement, then that convention or agreement should be given legal effect as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of this legislation is underlined by the fact that it helps to consolidate and clarify definite international rules in the area of civil and commercial law.  The importance of the Brussels Convention is put very much in its context when <Col N="1240" /> one considers that the combined population of the contracting states is greater than 372 million. Every year 80,000 people die and 40 million are injured in these contracting states in accidents involving consumer goods.  More than 300,000 are left with a permanent disability annually.</P>
    <P>Many of these statistics give rise to transnational legal actions.  This reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments by courts and tribunals in civil and commercial law areas is fundamental to the operation of good commercial practice. Speedy and informal procedures for the recognition of judgments from one member state to another and their enforcement is welcome and fundamental.  The simplification of complex legal formalities is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, generally, harmonisation of law has been slow in terms of drafting and implementation and this is unfortunate.  There has been a major growth in trade between member states.  In Ireland's case, the change in trading business between our overdependency on trade with the UK to our very successful diversification into the newly opened EU markets has brought the need for mutually acceptable rules and regulations very much into focus.  The measures in this legislation apply only to our fellow EU partners and EFTA countries.  Admittedly, approximately 80 per cent of our trade and commerce is carried out with those countries.  However, we should also endeavour to establish similar reciprocal arrangements with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand because we do a good deal of business with those countries.  It is in their interest as well as ours to have as much harmonisation and cohesion as possible.  Those democracies have highly developed legal and commercial systems. From the point of view of establishing internationally accepted norms across a wider geographical area, will the Minister indicate if the EU is contemplating a further extension of these international arrangements?  Have talks commenced or have they been instigated with a view to broadening the scope of mutually accepted commercial law?</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult to implement internationally applicable laws for non-democratic countries.  We need only recall the topical export credit insurance which has been the protective mechanism for our trading operations with such countries, to compensate for the fact that one has no other legal redress in the event of payment defaults by them.</P>
    <P>The legal framework set down in this legislation, whereby judgments made in one country are legally enforceable in another, is extremely important from the point of view of trade and commerce, particularly given the major expansion of world commerce in recent years.  Every day new barriers are being broken down, new markets are being opened and new opportunities are presenting themselves.  As an economy, whose commercial success is recognised world-wide, it is particularly important that we adopt best practice while ensuring a successful legal <Col N="1241" /> framework is put in place to protect trade from breach of contract, default and so on, and that an effective mutually enforceable regime is in place.</P>
    <P>We should lead by example in this area and be the first on every occasion to ratify, adopt and embrace the provisions of international conventions. We should encourage other countries in Europe, through the European Union, to speed up the adoption and ratification process.  We should continually reinforce the point that a simple, coherent legal system, which transcends national boundaries, is in everybody's interest, not only to provide important protection but also to ensure international trade operates as smoothly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Maintenance Act, l994, provided for the setting up a central authority to ensure responsibilities were met in full and that maintenance orders could be enforced in another country where the person responsible for the debt, although living in another jurisdiction, could be forced to discharge his or her responsibility.  That was a crucial mechanism for dealing with husbands who had deserted their families and fled to foreign climes to start a new life while leaving their wives and children penniless at home.  I welcome the change signalled by the Minister in this legislation in that regard.  Anything that helps to simplify or to make more effective the enforcement of maintenance orders made by an Irish court has to be welcomed.  The central authority has done excellent work on behalf of many people who succeeded in getting maintenance orders, but they were effectively rendered useless because people did not have the know-how, confidence or resources to pursue the orders successfully.</P>
    <P>A major weakness in ascertaining the effectiveness of the convention is that lawyers and litigants in prosecuting or defending civil and commercial litigation have not had recourse to any central database.  The Centralised EU Convention Casebook and Judgment Registry Database is a welcome development.  The intention is that it will provide online access to key information relating to convention actions during their progress through the courts in the various contracting States.  This will be invaluable to lawyers, litigants and investors.  Investors will be able to check on the database whether the company in which they propose to invest has been a defendant under the convention.  In a product liability action a litigant will be able to check if other litigants are bringing the same action against the same defendant in another contracting State.</P>
    <P>While the legislation will certainly help to streamline activities in the commercial and civil sphere, there is an urgent need to extend the scope of such co-operation into the criminal area. There is an urgent need also to give legal effect to the spirit and aspirations of the Amsterdam Treaty in relation to effective international combating of crime even though we have the Europol Bill and co-operation at that level.  Rather than a one page set of laudable aspirations in the <Col N="1242" /> Amsterdam Treaty, what is needed is more cohesion, co-operation and an exchange of vital data in the fight against crime.  While extradition treaties are effective in returning offenders to the country of the origin of the crime, the degree of data exchange in certain areas is not good.</P>
    <P>There is particular concern at the manner in which known sex offenders and paedophiles are able to move easily from one jurisdiction to another with little if any awareness in the new host country of their criminal track record.  A good example of this is the manner in which high profile swimming coaches, with a frightening list of sex offences against children and young swimmers in their care, were able to move unimpeded to Scotland and get similar employment there and further afield to the United States and take up important coaching positions and prey on others.  A Brussels type convention in the criminal sphere is long overdue. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and note its origins date back to when the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, was in office.  He drew up the heads of this legislation when he was Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  It has taken the Government a long time to bring this legislation before the House given that the heads of the Bill were ready 15 months ago, but it is important that we are debating it now.  The delay in its introduction may have a good deal to do with the inability of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to cope with the volume of outstanding legislation.  My party and I believe it was unwise to merge the Department of Justice and Equality and Law Reform.  I call on the Government to reinstitute the Department of Equality and Law Reform, particularly as there are more than 30 Bills under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform either before the House or on the list of promised legislation.  That points to the need to reconsider the decision to merge the two Departments.  Under EU law we are required to introduce the Data Protection Bill, which is awaited.  Last week I asked when the Equal Status Bill, which was promised for the autumn, would be introduced, but I gather it will not be ready until 1999.  The delay in introducing those Bills highlight the importance of giving proper emphasis to legislation related to equality and law reform.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill may seem to be procedural given its main function is to consolidate law governing civil cases taken outside the jurisdiction of the State.  However, the Bill is of major significance in that it will make the law more accessible to those who might have taken cases outside the State in the past if they had the money to do so.  It will facilitate the taking of a wide variety of cases, including those relating to maintenance and business, to which Deputy Higgins referred.  This legislation will be most important in both those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> It is particularly important in the case of maintenance orders and legal cases relating to accidents or crimes which occurred abroad.  As people move more freely across the EU, the need for this legislation becomes greater.  We are all aware of the huge increase in the movement of people between EU states for short and long-term work purposes.  Inevitably, the need for such legislation has increased because of the greater interaction between EU states in terms of civil law.</P>
    <P>Although more recent legislation in this area has helped people to take civil cases abroad, the Bill will make that process much easier.  It will also assist in speeding up civil cases taken against an individual or a collective in another EU state. The Minister referred to trade and commerce and to the point that the survival of a business may depend on the ability to enforce money judgments.  In many cases such judgments refer to business done outside the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the current level of exports from Ireland to the EU.  On the basis of the 1997 figures and the percentage of business within the EU, I estimate that Ireland's export trade is worth approximately £20 billion.  Therefore, a sizeable amount of the legislation businesses use relates to other jurisdictions within the EU.  In that context, the economic survival and development of many companies will depend on their ability to enforce judgments in other EU jurisdictions.  I support Deputy Higgins's comments about the possibility of using the legislation to enforce judgments outside the EU.  I am sure this would involve many difficulties, but it would afford protection to companies which have large amounts of trade outside the EU.</P>
    <P>It is expected that one of the biggest Bills ever in terms of the number of sections, the Bill relating to copyright and relevant matters, will come before the House in the near future.  The issue of copyright has become very important to creators of all types of work, particularly that which appears on the Internet and in print.  Usually a breach of copyright outside the state of origin would be dismissed as not worth challenging under our current legislation.  It is in such instances that the Bill will be of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has made some headway in ensuring that parents are fulfilling their responsibilities in terms of providing maintenance for their families.  However, many fathers and some mothers have deserted their families to travel and settle abroad.  All Members are aware of cases where it has been extremely difficult to follow up maintenance orders when the parent has left the jurisdiction of the State.  People have had great difficulty in getting such maintenance orders implemented and getting enough money to keep their families going.  The legislation will be very effective in this regard and bring much relief to many individual families who have had difficulty in pursuing these orders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> I am sure all Members have read harrowing stories about deserted families who have tried desperately to find the deserting parent to give maintenance towards providing for family needs. This was very difficult in the past.  Despite the fact that the Maintenance Act, 1994, was in place, people still encountered huge amounts of red tape and expense in pursuing maintenance orders outside the jurisdiction.  In many cases, families cannot afford the expense and have great difficulty pursuing their rights as a result.  I welcome that the Bill will ease the burden for such families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the use of databases and information technology in criminal law. This is a good point.  There have been so many advances in this area that it should be much easier now to trace information relating to legislation in various European countries and cases which cross European divides.  Undoubtedly, there is room for more efficiency and effectiveness with regard the use of databases.  I hope they will be used for the good of people involved in cases.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill is passed, Ireland will be the second EU country to have fulfilled its obligations under the Judgments Convention.  I am glad we are making headway at last because, for too long, Ireland has been too slow in passing and enforcing required legislation.  An example of this is the parental leave legislation which was discussed in the last session.  Although this will be implemented in December, Ireland had to seek extra time to introduce the measure because we had not fulfilled our duties in that regard. Another example is the Bill relating to data protection. However, Ireland will be among the first to introduce legislation to implement the Judgments Convention and this is welcome.  I hope it is a pattern for the future, but I am not sure that will be the case given my comments earlier about the need for a separate Department to deal with equality and law reform issues. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that Ireland is in good time in this case.</P>
    <P>In an effort to make the Bill more useful and relevant, the Labour Party has proposed a number of amendments which are centred on correcting errors and speeding up the ratification process.  I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage in relation to the Convention on the Legalisation of Documents.  This has been signed but the statutory instruments have not yet been introduced and this is creating a cost for businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  While it is a relatively dry Bill, its effect will be most important in terms of the increase in business within the EU and the area of maintenance and other civil matters where people are having much difficulty enforcing decisions.  The Minister outlined a number of exceptions which are acceptable and make sense, for example, where recognition would be contrary to public policy in the state where such recognition is sought or where the judgment is irreconcilable with one given in a dispute <Col N="1245" /> between the same parties in that state.  They are logical exceptions and should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's contribution was most interesting, but I question the logic of her suggestion that splitting the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform into two separate Departments would be an effective and efficient way of using the limited resources available in the joint Department at present.  This subject has arisen on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As a student of public administration, it interests me.  However, the debate is based on a false premise.  A matter which Deputy O'Sullivan and others may wish to examine is the manner and disposition of staff in the public service over the past 25 years.  One of the indisputable realities is that Departments which have been split have become less rather than more efficient.  I have sympathy with the view that a small focused Department should be more efficient and I have argued that thesis generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the reality has been otherwise.  Provided the joint Department retains all its staff and specialist expertise, the current disposition of staff is probably a more efficient way of achieving the objectives which the Deputy and I share.</P>

      <P>My visit to China, from 14 to 18 September, had two main objectives: to strengthen bilateral political relations between our two countries and to promote Irish exports and business contacts in China.  The visit was highly successful in both respects.</P>
      <P>During my visit I met Premier Zhu Rongji on Monday, 14 September; President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday, 15 September; Mr. Xu Kuangdi, the Mayor of Shanghai, on Wednesday, 16 September; and Mr. Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Government, on Friday, 18 September.</P>
      <P>In addition to these meetings, I had a series of trade related meetings with a number of Chinese Ministers and with members of the Irish business community in China.  I also had a brief meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, on Monday, 14 September. The Commissioner took the opportunity to brief me on her visit to China and, particularly, her visit to Tibet and subsequent meeting with President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>I discussed a number of issues during my lengthy meeting with Premier Zhu on 14 September, including Sino-Irish economic relations, China's application to accede to the World Trade Organisation, Ireland's candidature for the UN Security Council, the Northern Ireland peace process and the human rights situation in China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to human rights, the main points I raised with Premier Zhu and President Jiang are best outlined in a speech I gave to the Foreign Service College in Beijing, copies of which have been laid before the House.  I expressed my satisfaction at the progress being made in the context of EU-China human rights dialogue and urged the Chinese Government to proceed as quickly as possible with the ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and sign and ratify the International <Col N="1247" /> Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I am delighted the Chinese Government signed this covenant yesterday without reservation.  I also reiterated the willingness of the Government and our partners in Europe to assist China in whatever way we can to build and develop new structures to assist in the democratisation of Chinese society and the application of the rule of law.</P>
    <P>With regard to Tibet, I referred to my deep concern at the reported human rights abuses and proposed to the Chinese authorities that they should be willing to talk directly to the Dalai Lama as a means of resolving the issue.  I mentioned the deep interest of Members of the Oireachtas and the public in the situation in Tibet.  I drew parallels with what had been achieved in the Northern Ireland peace process as a result of the willingness of all the participants to talk to, and negotiate with, all parties involved in the dispute.</P>
    <P>China's support for our candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2001 was also raised and received positively by the Chinese side.  Although there was no discussion on the EU's common foreign and security policy, I confirmed to Premier Zhu that the basic objective of the European Union is the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the UN charter.  This has always been and remains a core objective of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>From a trade perspective, the purpose of my visit was to open the door for Irish companies to do increased business and to seek support at the highest political level for greater trade between Ireland and China.  I was accompanied during my visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has responsibility for international trade, and by a large delegation representing 26 Irish companies drawn from the software, telecommunications, educational services and agrifood sectors. In addition, a number of State companies, Aer Rianta, Bord Bia and BIM, participated.  There were more than 100 individual company to company meetings and I led business discussions with the Ministers for Information Technology, Agriculture and Education.  I am pleased to announce that during my visit the Minister of State signed an air transport agreement on behalf of the Government.  Irish companies in the aviation sector have enjoyed considerable success in China and I hope this agreement will facilitate further development of Sino-Irish relations in this area.</P>
    <P>It is clear from subsequent discussions with members of the trade delegation that many companies received valuable and substantial exposure to potential Chinese clients and partners. They are satisfied with the access they gained to key buyers in both Chinese ministries and state companies.  I am confident that, as a result of my visit, there will be a greater recognition within China of Ireland as a potential trading partner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> During my meeting with Premier Zhu I emphasised Ireland's commitment to develop trade relations over the long term.  Premier Zhu indicated that he attached great importance to developing bilateral trade with Ireland.  I am particularly pleased that the Chinese Government confirmed during my visit that it will send a trade delegation to Ireland within the next year and a large delegation to the 1999 world meat conference in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The visit to China has reaffirmed the potential of this market for Irish goods and services.  It is important that we now have a co-ordinated follow-up to the visit so that the progress we have made towards developing new business can be built upon.  It is for this reason that I have asked for an Asia strategy group to be established to advise the Government on a coherent long-term market development strategy for the Asian region.  By means of this strategy, through ongoing EU dialogue and future political level contact, our excellent Sino-Irish relations &mdash; political, economic and cultural &mdash; can be even further developed to the mutual benefit of both our peoples.</P>

      <P>It seems the Taoiseach's visit was a success.  Did the Chinese authorities indicate support for Ireland's bid to secure a place on the Security Council of the United Nations?  The Taoiseach indicated that their response was positive.  Does that mean they will definitely support Ireland's bid?  On human rights, did the Taoiseach raise the question of the use of the death penalty in China and highlight the fact that Ireland and many other European countries regard it as a barbaric method of dealing with breaches of the law?  Did he raise the questions of freedom of speech and the right of groups to organise opposition parties in China?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Premier Zhu assured me that China would give our candidature serious and positive consideration.  That cannot be taken as a definite &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as it has been the practice of the five permanent members of the Security Council not to state their position formally.  Before leaving for China I met a number of organisations, including NGOs and the Tibet Support Group, and promised them I would raise the issues to which the Deputy referred.  I raised numerous cases brought to my attention concerning the death penalty, the large number of people who disappear, poor conditions of detention and several other matters.  Premier Zhu, in reply, did not deny any of those matters.  He outlined to me the progress made and what they were attempting to achieve in these areas.  I expressed strongly my own concern and that of the Government about these issues.  While I was in China I could see that many of these problems continually occur, including house arrests and people disappearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which gives some freedom to the press as well as the right of assembly, was a major issue <Col N="1249" /> in all the newspapers both in Beijing and Shanghai. The Chinese authorities signed that covenant yesterday but there continues to be a difficulty in regard to people having the right of assembly or being involved in protest organisations.  To give any other impression would be wrong.  It remains to be seen whether the covenant will have the desired effect, although the people involved in the human rights area believe it will.  They urged me to press China to sign the covenant along with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  It will be a matter for the EU and all of us to continue to monitor this issue as we go forward.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will remember there was a considerable problem some years ago about the condition of children in orphanages in China, particularly girls.  Did the Taoiseach raise this matter and will he give an indication of how matters have progressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That problem was mentioned to me also.  I was told that the problem had improved substantially but had not been resolved. I raised the matter again and asked that the problem be addressed and the response was that some years ago there was no regulatory system of any kind.  I understand the authorities are trying to put in place such a system.  When I met Premier Zhu at the ASEM Summit in April and again on this visit he appeared to be endeavouring to press forward on all these human rights issues.  My impression is that in some regions these issues have been regulated successfully but that may not be the case in others.</P>
      <P>The Premier emphasised that he believed this was a long-term process and said that until 1990 they had spent 1,000 years trying to move towards a particular position.  His generation accepts democracy and the Premier appeared to be doing his utmost to implement changes.  This is being done province by province and it is only fair to reflect that.  It would be an impossible task to implement such changes throughout the entire country with a population of 1.3 billion, but one gets the impression that substantial progress is being made in some provinces.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach or the Chinese authorities raise the issue of the economic turmoil in Asia, the impact of that on China and its efforts to modernise its society by way of producing food and clothing for its massive population? Did the Chinese authorities request the Taoiseach to use Irish influence within the international fora of which we are members as a means of aiding China to overcome the current economic turmoil affecting virtually all countries in that area of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had many discussions on this issue, not so much with the President but with the Premier, the Mayor of Shanghai and people in the stock exchange.  It is their primary consideration <Col N="1250" /> because there are problems with all the Asian economies.  Japan is considered to be in its sixth year of recession and Korea is currently experiencing a major problem.  Singapore appears to be the only country with which they are operating whose problems have diminished somewhat. It does not have the same difficulty because of its strong position.</P>
      <P>The major question for the financial markets is whether to devalue, which would create enormous difficulty not only for the economy in that area but also for the United States and other countries which have pressed China to protect its currency.  The Premier knew I would be meeting members of the financial press in Hong Kong and I felt he wanted to signal clearly to me that they had no intention of devaluing in the short or medium term.  Nobody can speak about the long-term but that was his position.  That has been a costly strategy but the Chinese see it as their policy of stability for the entire region.</P>
      <P>In regard to food and clothing, since the land was given back to the people a co-operative system has been in operation.  There is a levy on what people produce so if they over-produce, which is what they all do, they can make a profit. That is a total change from the previous system. The agricultural population, which is approximately 900 million people, works extremely hard so there is an over-supply of food.  Feeding its 1.3 billion people is no longer a problem for China.  Its problem is trying to get markets for the surplus.  This issue upsets them greatly because they believe that until the World Trade Organisation and Neil Kinnock, who represents the EU in this matter and with whom I had discussions before I travelled to China, resolve these problems, they will continue to experience difficulties although they do not deny it is a two-way process.  These issues will be addressed again this autumn by Commissioner Kinnock and others.</P>

Did the Taoiseach not feel a deep sense of shame that he was being feted by the same Stalinist regime in the same square controlled by the same military which, only nine years ago, butchered thousands of students and workers campaigning for the most basic democratic rights?

        <i>(Dublin West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;the short end of the stick every time.  Did the Taoiseach not feel he should have sought to lay a wreath in Tiananmen Square in memory of the martyrs?  What kind of signal does the Taoiseach think is sent to the Chinese authorities by high powered deputations from European states like Ireland going cap in hand to China for trade benefits and commercial gains while appalling human rights abuses continue?  The Chinese authorities might take the message that such deputations are there for commercial gain despite the fact that democratic rights are denied across the board in China, and that such gain means more to the deputations than the democratic rights of the Chinese people. Does the Taoiseach agree this is a serious question that should be asked by state representatives like himself before visiting China?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Countries did not send delegations to China in the years after the Tianamen Square and other human rights incidents, but that did not improve human rights issues there by one iota.  Since 1986 there has been an improvement in relations between the EU and China and the Chinese Administration has made significant advances, particularly under Zhu Rongji, to improve the situation in Tibet and elsewhere. There are many regions where there have been deplorable human rights abuses in the past, but progress has been made, covenants have been signed and people have been released, though there is still a long way to go.</P>
      <P>The Chinese represent 23 per cent of mankind. The civilised world believes it should have relations with them and should try to convince them of the error of their ways, moving with them in the advancement of progressive democratic policies and proper human rights.  The President of the United States did so recently, and the United Kingdom Prime Minister is doing that this week.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that China is selling missiles and missile technology to a number of countries and that some of these countries are acquiring nuclear weapons?  The combination of long range missile capacity and nuclear power is potentially lethal for mankind.  Did the Taoiseach raise the matter of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction with the Chinese leadership? This weaponry could be turned in any direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I raised this issue.  While doing so I referred to a long discussion the Minister for Foreign Affairs had earlier this year with the Chinese on the same topic.  I cannot be as certain about their future policy as I was on other issues; there may be contractual links involved. The President of the United States has been pressing the Chinese strongly on this matter and the British Prime Minister is to discuss it today. I am not sure what the Chinese will do in the future.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that while it is undesirable that any country has weapons of mass destruction, there is some chance of controlling the situation if the number of countries with such weapons is small?  However, if a large number of countries have weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the situation; it is like multi-dimensional chess.  Does the Taoiseach agree that Europe should take this matter seriously because Europe is potentially threatened given the advances in long range missile technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that this development is such a threat.  From EU briefings I understand the technology has advanced apace in the 1990s and that large proportions of these countries' budgets are being invested in the development of missiles.  They then have to find outlets for what they have made.  This has been discussed at the General Affairs Council on numerous occasions and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised this whenever he gets an opportunity because of his long opposition to this threat.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In fulfillment of a provision in Partnership 2000, I attended the last plenary meeting in Dublin Castle on 28 July.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance also attended.  The matters discussed were wide-ranging but focussed mainly on social inclusion and equality and the modernisation of the public service.  Obviously, matters relating to tax reform were raised and I emphasised in particular the Government's commitment to focus in a special way on the low paid and those most marginalised in our society.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, I firmly believe the best way to ensure a successor to Partnership 2000 is to fully implement the terms of the current agreement.  My Department, along with the social partners, is overseeing the implementation of all outstanding commitments.  The agreement has still more than one year to run, which is certainly adequate to ensure full implementation.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, the Government is already putting in place the necessary logistical and analytical structures to secure a successor to Partnership 2000.  Principal amongst these are the restructuring of the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.  The NESC will continue to provide strategic analysis through its reports and will thus develop the framework within which discussions on future national programmes will take place, while the NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership, especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment.  The National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000 to facilitate partnership at the level of the enterprise in both the public and private sectors, has been working with the social partners and with individual organisations in embedding partnership and this work will be built on in future social partnership arrangements.</P>
      <P>A decision on what, if any, additional organisations will be represented in the negotiations on a successor agreement will be made closer to their commencement.</P>

The legislation on the NESC and NESF will be dealt with this session; if not I will tell the Deputy when it will be introduced.  The nurses' dispute was not discussed.  Public service pay issues were discussed generally, and I outlined how I believe public service pay should be dealt with in future. I invited other parties to discuss this in future meetings.  I stated that we needed a new and more imaginative approach to ensure that public servants' incomes should reflect performance more clearly.  We have already identified the need for restructuring and the importance of performance management in delivering the full potential of the strategic management initiative reforms.  We must consider how public pay policy can be more closely related to performance as part of that. The aspirations of public servants must be met on one side while unavoidable limits on public spending must be maintained on the other.</P>

Where such practices have been successful in Irish business, it has tried to transfer them to other companies.  It has held presentations and roadshows.  It took it a year to get up and running, but I met with the people involved before the summer recess and they feel they have been effective in the past six months. Their aim is to determine best practice in partnership in the public and private sectors and to implement that in as many industries and organisations as possible.</P>

      <P>Is there any evidence that firms are increasing their financial commitment to the training of their employees at a time of very high profits and when money is available to reinvest in employees?  Is the Taoiseach aware that Irish enterprises have historically been decidedly unenterprising in investing their own money, as distinct from the State's, in training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that, historically, little money was put into training by Irish companies and that was highlighted many <Col N="1256" /> years ago by the Galvin report on training.  Now there is an increase in the level of training by employers because, if they do not do so, they will lose people.  I am not sure they would have done so had the situation been otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The incentive is there in that unskilled people who are anxious to work will be loyal to a firm which trains them.  There is an increased commitment now, especially in apprenticeships. Deputy Bruton will remember that a major issue in the House a decade ago was the impossibility of getting construction firms to do anything about apprenticeships.  Consequently, FÁS, or AnCO as it was known then, had to train people for the first year and, even then, they could not gain employment.  There has been a significant improvement in the area since.</P>

Regarding the minimum wage being tax free, does the Taoiseach agree that it does not make sense to establish a minimum wage and then tax it since it is the minimum income upon which a person needs to live?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach, as part of the analytical and logistical structure for partnership, put in place updated information in quantified form on the actual financial commitment individual firms are making to training?  Will he ensure that is collected centrally so that it is a subject which can be negotiated upon and discussed in the forthcoming partnership negotiations? Does the Taoiseach agree that the experience of modern life is that, as far as many analysts are concerned, if something cannot be counted, it does not exist and that only the quantifiable has reality for many people?  Does he agree that we need to quantify what is being done as far as training is concerned?</P>

The Taoiseach is a man of the people and I ask him to give a specific commitment, or at least a more positive response, to the almost half million senior citizens that their case will be examined favourably.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13 together.</P>
      <P>I visited Paris on 12 and 13 of July.  During the course of my visit I met the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, and the President of the French National Assembly, Mr. Laurent Fabius.</P>
      <P>My discussions with Prime Minister Jospin covered a wide range of European issues, including the Agenda 2000 negotiations and the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty.  In particular, we discussed the issues surrounding institutional reform in advance of the special informal Heads of State and Government summit, HOSG, in Austria in October.  As regards Agenda 2000, I outlined Ireland's position on the Commission's current proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I also took the opportunity to brief the Prime Minister on the British-Irish agreement and thanked him for the ongoing support of France for the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my meeting with Mr. Fabius, we discussed Franco-Irish relations in the context of 1798, historical cultural links and EU support for the British-Irish Agreement.  I also briefed him on the performance of the Irish economy over the past decade and the nature of the social partnership process, <Col N="1258" /> a subject on which he expressed a particular interest.  In addition, we discussed the question of institutional reform and Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>I sent a message of congratulations to Gerhard Schröder on his election victory and that of his party last Sunday in Germany.  I have also sent a message of appreciation and best wishes for the future to Helmut Kohl.  I would like to speak with the incoming German Chancellor at the earliest opportunity.  Due to his schedule of negotiations for the formation of a new government, a meeting in advance of the next summit would seem unlikely.</P>
    <P>Between now and the end of 1998 I plan to visit Austria on 24-25 October for an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission.  I will also visit Edinburgh on 29 October to deliver the Lothian European lecture at the invitation of the Scottish Secretary of State and I will attend the European Council meeting in Vienna on 11-12 December.</P>
    <P>In terms of incoming visits to Ireland by Heads of State or Government, I will meet with Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima on Monday, 12 October when he visits Ireland as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the informal Austrian meeting. I will also be meeting Polish Prime Minister Buzek on 16 November and Prime Minister Blair in late November when he visits this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Government's view of the proposals tabled at the European Commission today to the effect that member states will have to undertake a largely increased share of the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy expenditures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen any of the proposals put forward today.  I have no information on those proposals other than the reports that have been in the public domain for some weeks. From an Irish perspective, we stated in March when the CAP reforms and Agenda 2000 discussions commenced that we will argue against many of these reforms as they fundamentally change the position.  I am glad that other countries have also taken that view over the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the idea that a common European policy should be financially met by member states and not by the common European budget is an exercise in power without responsibility and is wrong?  It should not occur, particularly at a time when we are trying to build a common currency which requires a common budgetary policy.  The idea of renationalising part of the existing common policies is entirely contrary to the idea of a common single currency and a common economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I make my remarks pending sight of the proposals.  In the broader context, the Deputy is arguing for a continuation of what some member states have been arguing concerning the 1.27 per cent budget figure.  They want to <Col N="1259" /> cap that figure and reduce it and to see enlargement take a greater share of that percentage. Some proposals argue that this objective can be funded from own resources.  However, that would not be in line with the Common Agricultural Policy, as I have strongly stated at a number of European meetings and in statements since last March. It goes against the principle which has worked successfully for the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The renationalisation approach is favoured by Britain, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden.  If the Government is to be successful in stopping this insidious proposal from a European point of view, it will have to build an alliance with those countries who share Ireland's basic interest in this matter, such as France, Spain, Portugal and Italy.  This cannot be left until the last minute next March when the decision has to be taken.  The Taoiseach should consider a tour of European capitals before Christmas to deal with these crucial Agenda 2000 issues.  These issues are not only crucial for farmers; they are also crucial to the success of the common currency and the common European economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of what the Deputy said is correct.  However, I have answered questions on the first part of his question.  These are the very issues I have been discussing with the French, the Portuguese, the Finns and others where we have sought support.  I have gone to each of these countries over the past few months and had discussions on Agenda 2000, particularly as it concerns agricultural issues.  The Deputy will have seen some helpful remarks by the French President on these issues during the past weekend. We will build a consensus wherever possible.</P>
      <P>At this stage these are proposals which I will examine.  Our campaign, and those of countries who share our views, will continue to put forward the best negotiating position possible.  These will be tough proposals.  The House will be aware that the Spanish and Portuguese have not agreed any strategy on these proposals because of their fundamental objections to them.  We have been able to go some way towards an agreement but not on any of these issues.</P>
      <P>The 1.27 per cent figure is not agreed by some countries but my view is that it will remain.  We saw the position taken by Prime Minister Wim Kok in the Dutch general election earlier this year and by Gerhard Schröder in the recent German election.  These issues will lead to robust and intensive negotiations this winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach stressed the absolute necessity to raise the proposed budget level from 1.27 per cent with the Commission and our European partners in view of the fact that we are planning to take in a number of countries which will need Structural and Social Fund support?  The EU is likely to disintegrate <Col N="1260" /> unless this is done, particularly if it is also in the process of renationalising common policies.  Solidarity and cohesion are the basis of the EU.  If we move away from that all we will have is a single market in which the weakest will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be able to say to the Deputy that I think we can move away from the 1.27 per cent figure but that would be to mislead the House.  I have visited about ten countries so far and have spoken to others at meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg.  On the basis of the discussions on the next round between now and next March, it would be a misrepresentation of the situation for me to say that I can see the 1.27 per cent figure being breached. I do not think that is going to happen.</P>
      <P>The positive side is that it appears from what the Commission is saying that enlargement is unlikely to remove dramatic resources out of the budget for the next negotiating period.  Enlargement may not be as big a problem as we imagine. It will be an argument for holding onto the 1.27 per cent.  That will be achieved because some countries will say they want refunds.  The Germans had been saying that prior to the election and they will certainly continue to say it now.  An examination of the figures shows that 1.27 per cent is adequate and we must ensure it is not reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the budget is running at about 1.1 per cent of GDP?  Will the Taoiseach agree, in view of the dramatic income crisis in farming in Ireland and also in other EU countries, there is room for the EU to assist the farming community in an acute income crisis? What is the Government doing to ensure something is done at national and international level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is correct.  The figure is slightly over 1.1 per cent of GDP and will remain at that level for the remainder of the year and next year.  While there is no enlargement there will be no pressure.  The point made by Deputy Bruton was made very strongly at the Agriculture Council meeting last week and the previous week where the Minister, Deputy Walsh, achieved some ease on a number of fronts in the agricultural budget.  He will continue to pursue it in the difficult period ahead for Irish farmers.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons in receipt of carer's allowance; the percentage of those who receive the allowance at the maximum rate; if his attention has been drawn to the commitment and care given by these carers on a 24 hour basis; the plans, if any, his Department has to make a special payment to carers to enable them to provide alternative care for a short period, annually, to the person being cared for.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  There were 11,138 persons in receipt of carer's allowance at the end of September 1998, of whom 9,052, 81 per cent were in receipt of a payment at the maximum rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure more carers can get the benefit, and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance <Col N="1262" /> has been completed, which I launched this morning &mdash; Deputies probably received it in their pigeonholes this morning.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals put forward in the review concerns an additional flat-rate payment, to be made once a year, as part of the carer's allowance. This payment recognises the need for respite care, although the manner in which the money is spent will be the choice of the carers. This proposal and the other proposals contained in the review will be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the publication of the review of the carer's allowance which is worthwhile.  I got it about an hour ago and have not had an opportunity to read it but it seems impressive.  Will the Minister agree the review suggests there are about 50,000 carers in the country?  There are 11,000 persons, or 20 per cent of carers, in receipt of carer's allowance. Will he agree there is need for a radical overhaul of the carer's allowance to facilitate the other 40,000 who are not in receipt of payments for this worthwhile work?  Will he agree that caring, which is a 24 hour job, seven days a week, is a very difficult job and that there is need for respite care?  The proposal in the review to give a lump sum payment to the carer, to be spent at their discretion, whether for a break, a holiday or for the person to go into a nursing home, is very good.  Will the Minister expand on what is contained in the review?  I realise he did not have an opportunity to consider it fully but his Department will be aware the payment of a lump sum was on the cards and will have had some discussion on how it will work.  What are the proposals in that regard?</P>

I wanted to have it launched and out in the open as quickly as possible.  I had been exhorted by a number of lobby groups to launch it and today was the best day to do so.

      <P>I was about to say that.  There are 40,000 over the age of 16 and about 9,000 between the ages of two and 16.  I instituted this review on the basis that the carer's allowance needed to be looked at.  It was acknowledged that there were considerably more people providing care and attention than were receiving the allowance. While all the proposals in the review are costly, they will have to be prioritised in the overall budgetary context.  I acknowledge that people who assist others to stay in the home rather than go into institutional care deserve recognition and help from the State.  That has always been the <Col N="1263" /> policy of my party and of this Government and will continue to be so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the review refers to the inadequacy of respite care and will he agree that about 12,000 carers could benefit from the respite proposal, which would cost only £1 million?  Given the budget for the Minister's Department this is a small amount in the context of the number of people involved. Will the Minister agree this should be one of his priorities?</P>

The review is clear on how these will affect people if changed and obviously we will look at costs in the overall situation.</P>

      <P>The question of fixing pension rates to a percentage of average industrial earnings was one of the recommendations in the report, Securing Retirement Income, arising out of the National Pensions Policy Initiative which the Pensions Board presented to me earlier this year.  In response to the main recommendations of that report, I issued a four page document, Action on Pensions, which was circulated to all Deputies along with the report.  For the first time in the history of the State, this document sets out a clear Government plan to secure the future of our older people.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Pensions Board involve the development of strong first pillar social welfare pensions based on social insurance and major improvements in our second pillar, occupational and personal, pensions.  The Government has noted the board's recommendation that the social welfare pension should be increased over a five to ten year period to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings and considers that any such increase in pension rates and the PRSI financing implications of such increases would have to be considered in the context of the overall budgetary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key priority of the Government's action programme for older people is a strong social welfare pension based on social insurance, including the achievement of an old age pension of £100 per week over a five year period, i.e. by 2002.  An important step towards achieving this objective was taken through the £5 per week increase granted in the 1998 budget.  Setting this goal <Col N="1264" /> shows the Government's distinct commitment to older people and is recognition of the special place of older people and of their contribution to the economy over the years.  It recognises older people's contribution, through their endeavours and sacrifices, to the current favourable economic climate.</P>

      <P>The Minister's pension review group and the pre-budget submission of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, a group of pensioners who meet to discuss problems affecting them, recommended that this should happen. Does the Minister agree that pensions have slipped behind in recent times in terms of the buying power?  There has been quite substantial slippage over the past ten years in comparison to average industrial earnings.  Does the Minister agree that linking pensions to average industrial earnings would remove the lottery element of budgets year after year?  Pensioners are not sure how they will benefit from each budget.  Changes such as the £5 increase this year &mdash; in some cases the increase did not amount to £5 &mdash; are at the discretion of the Minister.  Does he feel we owe it to pensioners to guarantee their income by linking it to average industrial earnings?</P>

      <P>This issue has been examined time and again.  The increase in the last budget was well ahead of the rate of inflation.  I accept that over the years old age pensions have fallen behind.  Because of this, one of our key policies on coming into Government was to significantly increase old age pensions.  Our policy in relation to a rate of £100 is very significant and will assist old age pensioners in catching up in terms of the difficult situation they have experienced over the years.</P>

      <P>This issue has been examined time and again by the Pensions Board, the National Pensions Policy Initiative and in various studies which have been undertaken over the years.  It is far more preferable for Governments to provide substantial increases in times when the economy is performing well.  If pensions were linked to earnings, recipients would not have benefited to the same extent in the last budget.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who are unable to get summer jobs and who are debarred from claiming unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,567 sponsors were approved to participate in this year's scheme and they offered 29,400 jobs.  A total of 20,930 applications from students were received and 16,100 of those were approved to participate.  It is not possible at this stage to say precisely how many of these places were taken up by students as the scheme finished only last week.  This information will be available when all sponsors have submitted claims for reimbursement to my Department.  However, it is estimated that about 14,000 students participated in this year's scheme.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,386 applicants were refused on the grounds of their means exceeding the qualifying limit.  Students not in receipt of educational grants are not, <i>per se</i>, excluded from the scheme.  To qualify under the scheme students must establish a minimum entitlement to unemployment assistance. This is to maintain the primary focus of the scheme which is to provide work opportunities for less well off students who are unable to find employment otherwise.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Does the Minister agree this scheme is even worse than the cure and that while it has one small bright spot it caused more havoc for students who felt they were entitled to take part in it?  Only 14,000 or less than half of the 29,000 places were filled. Many students were very anxious to take part in the scheme.  How can the Department distinguish between a student from a middle income family whose parents are paying third level fees, etc., and somebody whose parents are not doing so when the amount of money students have to spend is very similar?  Given that only half the places were filled, will the Minister review the scheme for next year and allow students from families which have barely over the income limit to participate in it?</P>

      <P>The number of students who were unsuccessful in getting on to this year's <Col N="1266" /> scheme amounted to 4,326.  Of these, 1,386 were refused on the grounds of means.  Therefore, while many more jobs might have been offered, that a great deal fewer took up jobs has more to do with the fairly dramatic turn around in the economic climate.  Over the past two years there has been a drop in the number of students available. I have much anecdotal evidence suggesting that many community groups and other voluntary bodies which used the student summer jobs scheme over the summer had difficulty employing people.  The Deputy may have noticed that groups were advertising for people.  Much of this is related to the economic upturn.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I readily accept what the Minister says and am delighted by the economic up-turn and that students are in a position to get other jobs.  However, does the Minister not consider this to be an argument in favour of including people who would willingly take up jobs?  I had contact with a scheme which offered 12 jobs and which received five applicants, only three of whom took up places.  People also rang me complaining that their sons and daughters could not get on the scheme.  Would it not be far better to have those who were refused places participating on the scheme than leaving positions unfilled?  Students on the schemes can do useful work &mdash; there would be no point in employing them otherwise.  Will the Minister consider reviewing the scheme to ensure those who currently do not qualify will be considered in future?</P>

      <P>The scheme was initiated to address a difficulty for low income families.  This is one reason the associated means test was geared towards unemployment assistance.  It is not a function of the Department to provide jobs through the scheme for all the community groups in the country.  The scheme was designed for a purpose I think it has met over the years but demand for the scheme has reduced over the past two years.</P>

In this context it might be no harm to review the scheme given that there are positions available to be filled.</P>

Access to the live register itself is available to men and women who satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or who are entitled to sign for unemployment credited contributions.  There are, however, programmes available for which attachment to the live register is not a requirement and female participation rates in these courses have increased significantly over the years.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000, a working group has been established to review the question of access to labour market opportunities with a view to increasing gender equity.

Women who work in the home, whose husbands go out to work, are being discriminated against because of their husbands' incomes.  They are not entitled to sign on for many of the available courses as the overall household income may be in excess of the amount which would give them the opportunity to sign on for UA or UB.

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  The relevant legislation provides that a person may be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement only if the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the health board, the claimant was in a position to meet the repayments.</P>
      <P>Cases where a guarantor or parent is attached to the mortgage to give a greater loan than would normally be allowed are assessed on an individual basis.  If the health board was satisfied the person taking out the mortgage could meet the repayments at the time the loan agreement was entered into, a mortgage interest supplement may be payable. However, if the amount of the mortgage is substantially higher than would normally be provided to a person at that income level and if there are no grounds to justify this other than the fact they had a guarantor, a mortgage interest supplement would not be payable on the grounds they were not in a position to meet the repayments in their own right at the time the loan agreement was entered into.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  What exactly does &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; mean? In the case which has been brought to my attention, the health board's position is the same as that outlined by the Minister.  Is the Minister aware that, in view of rising house prices, many people are experiencing difficulty in securing a mortgage?  In many cases, they may be able to secure only an £80,000 loan for a house costing £100,000 and may need to ask their parents to act as guarantors.  It is not intended that the parents would have any legal interest in the house.  Their guarantee is simply a device used to help people to secure a mortgage and it would be a couple's intention to pay the full mortgage themselves. However, if one of the couple loses his or her job, the health board takes the view that at the time the mortgage was granted, the couple was not in a position to pay the full mortgage.  Is the Minister aware of the increasing practice whereby people ask their parents or another third party to act as guarantors?  There must be a change in policy to address the new cases coming before us.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he should bring it to my attention and we could examine it.  The health board would have considered the income of a person or a couple at the time a mortgage was taken out.  Building societies or banks should not give people a loan greater than that determined under the normal rules, namely, two and a half times a person's salary.  Taking on a guarantor should not mean people are given a higher mortgage as that would ultimately cause difficulties. The health board would not allow itself to be led into a situation where it would be asked to meet substantial mortgage interest repayments based on mortgages which people should not have taken out in the first instance. Strict criteria apply to the lending of money for mortgages.  I will examine any particular case with the Deputy.</P>

One such case has been brought to my attention.  Should the job situation deteriorate, there will be hundreds of such cases.  It is now common for people to have a guarantor in order to get a mortgage.  I ask that the Department consider this matter.  It may be only a handful of cases now, but there is a danger of the practice snowballing.  If, after consideration, the Department and the health boards adopt a harsh attitude to this, people should be warned about getting their granny or their parents to go guarantor for their mortgage.  People think this gets them over a problem, but that will not be the case.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this because there may be a flood of such applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of income support in respect of children plays a crucial role in combating the incidence of child poverty.  There is widespread agreement that child benefit is one of the more effective mechanisms for the provision of child income support.  It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment nor assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards and so on, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages. Substantial increases to the monthly rates of payment in recent budgets established the growing importance of child benefit within the overall child income support system, with a particular focus on the needs of larger families.  The increases provided for in the 1998 budget are targeted especially at larger families, who are at greater risk of poverty.  With effect from last month, the rates of child benefit were increased by £1.50 for the first two children and by £3.00 for the third and subsequent children.  This brings the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.00. A family with four children, for example, will now receive monthly payments of £147 or almost £37 per week.</P>
      <P>This year's budget also made provision for the introduction of a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins.</P>
      <P>In addition, family income supplement plays a significant role in assisting low income families through the payment of a regular weekly supplement to parents on low pay.  The scheme is now calculated on a net income basis which will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Research has shown repeatedly that unemployment is a key factor in producing poor households, and this is particularly true for households containing children.  For this reason, the continuing fall in the level of unemployment, allied with the significant rise in employment, will have a positive impact on the level of poverty among Irish children.</P>
      <P>The introduction, under the national anti-poverty strategy, of a system &mdash; referred to as poverty proofing &mdash; of assessing the poverty implications of significant policy proposals will also ensure that the needs of poor children &mdash; and other groups experiencing or at risk of falling into poverty &mdash; are addressed at policy design stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continued development of the NAPS will ensure that further initiatives under the five key themes of &mdash; unemployment, income adequacy, educational disadvantage, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty &mdash; all in themselves contributors <Col N="1272" /> to the perpetuation of the poverty cycle throughout generations of families &mdash; will assist in producing a society that lifts the burden of poverty from Irish children.</P>
    <P>The problems of poverty and social exclusion in rural areas are being addressed as part of the overall NAPS strategy.  Actions under the NAPS in relation to addressing the underlying causes of unemployment, income adequacy and educational disadvantage apply equally to urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to rural poverty, the Combat Poverty Agency is conducting a study on farm income support policy.  As this is an area of particular interest to me, in my first meeting with the agency on coming into office I requested them to put particular emphasis on rural poverty when developing their proposals for this study.  I am looking forward to receiving the results of the study early next year.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Agriculture and Food is currently preparing a White Paper on Rural Development which will deal with the economic and social development of rural areas and will include a particular focus on issues relating to poverty and social exclusion.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Would he agree that it is ironic, and even obscene, that so many politicians are publicly congratulating and preening themselves on the &ldquo;success&rdquo; of the Irish economy while one third of children live in want, and almost 60,000 adults, probably more, receive weekly incomes that 12 years ago were found to be less than adequate?  In the light of that stark comparison, would the Minister agree that Government policy as it is structured means that children all too often fall between the stools of different Government Departments?  Has the Minister any proposals to remedy this, given that the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, deals with children under the heading of child care, the Department of Education and Science deals with children under another heading but in the area of play facilities for children no Minister takes responsibility? As Minister with responsibility for the family, would the Minister agree that children are suffering because of this lack of cohesion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that there is lack of cohesion.  The issue of poverty and other issues relating to children are cross-departmental and have always been so.  It is like many issues which come to the fore &mdash; they do not necessarily rest in one Department.  I would not necessarily agree it should be that way.  Having said that, the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion and drugs, which has met seven or eight times since the formation of the Government, has spent a great deal of time on the issue of children and the co-ordination of policies in relation to children.  It is one of the issues on which the Government is very focused. <Col N="1273" /> The issue of income adequacy is one of the reasons this and previous Governments targeted the increase in child benefit.  It was accepted by all experts in this area that that would be the best way to assist families, particularly larger ones, with the difficulties of income adequacy.</P>

      <P>The issue of smallholder's dole was brought up by the farming representatives when I met them recently.  I indicated to them that 7,000 to 8,000 people qualify for smallholder's dole, which costs £33 million a year.  I indicated to the farmers' representatives &mdash; it was subsequently communicated in a statement issued by the Minister, Deputy Walsh &mdash; that we would look at the issue of smallholder's dole to see how farmers could be assisted because we believe the take-up of smallholder's dole could increase if people were further assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to say the issue of FIS for farmers did not just drop out of the sky &mdash; this question has been tabled here many times. FIS was introduced in 1984.  A figure was calculated in 1994 for the cost of extending it to the <Col N="1275" /> self-employed, including farmers.  I asked for that figure to be updated, as I undertook to do at a previous Question Time when this issue was raised.  I am told the figure could be as high as £80 million.  Many changes have taken place since 1994 when the figure of £30 million was calculated.</P>
      <P>The only commitment in Partnership 2000 for FIS was that it would be calculated on a net rather than gross income basis, which we fulfilled in last year's budget.  Due to that and other changing circumstances, it has been indicated to me that the figure could be as high as £80 million &mdash; it may not be that high but it will be much more than the existing figure of £30 million.</P>
      <P>Many people accept FIS is not the way to solve the farmers' present difficulties.  The issue of FIS has been around for some time.  It is quite illustrating that when Deputy De Rossa was Minister he said it would be extremely difficult to police an extension of the family income supplement scheme to the self-employed.  He said that self-employed persons make their own returns with regard to income tax and, by and large, they have self-assessment.  He went on to say he would not hold out any expectation that he would be in a position to extend FIS to the self-employed.  That is what Deputy De Rossa said in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only that, Fine Gael had a Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare at that time who said in 1997 on the Social Welfare Bill that, given the estimated cost of such an extension of the FIS scheme and the then Government's priority of achieving the commitment in Partnership 2000 to reform the assessment of FIS, they had no plans to extend it to the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to this, as I said in the Dáil. I specifically asked the Combat Poverty Agency when I met it to give its attention to the issue of rural poverty because I, like many Members across the House, accept these are difficult times in farming.  The Government addressed the immediate problem with a package.  However, <Col N="1276" /> there is also the medium to long-term issue of decreasing incomes and the decreasing prevalence of small family farms.  That is a broader issue which warrants greater research in conjunction with the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and other matters.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to looking after farmers as best it can.  If my Department has its way it will do it, and I will not be found wanting. However, we must be realistic; we are looking at protecting farmers on low income and we regard the smallholders' dole as a vehicle for looking after people who are struggling to put bread on the table.  My Department will endeavour to get as many farmers as possible to apply for the smallholders' dole, so they can comply with the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I regret that this issue has been diverted into another debate on family income supplement, because that is not the key to solving poverty either in rural areas, among farmers or the self-employed.  The statistics show that rural poverty is not farm family poverty &mdash; that is part of the problem but it is not the bulk of it.</P>
      <P>On the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, what proofing mechanism is in place for the proposals coming through the Minister's and other Departments for the December budget?  Will it be used to proof proposals for all Departments?  Does the Minister agree that the delivery of support for child care in whatever form &mdash; whether the hiring of child care assistants, paying for cre ches or helping to rear a child &mdash; should be through child benefit and not through tax relief?  Child benefit delivers support in a fair way across the board to every child regardless of the parents' income, and any attempt to switch resources to tax relief for child care would be a mistaken approach to take to child poverty and child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive set of guidelines to assist in the proofing of significant policy proposals for their impact on the poor has been drawn up by the NAPS unit in my Department. The Government made a decision on poverty proofing in July this year.  As to identifying particular groups, a framework paper was agreed by the social partners earlier this year, which identifies social groups, including children, which are at the greatest risk of experiencing poverty. Those groups will receive particular attention in the policy design process to ensure the impact of the proposals on these groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One only had to watch last night's &ldquo;Nine O'clock News&rdquo; to see two diametrically opposed views on child care.  The review is due shortly and the Government will then have to make decisions on the issue.  It is accepted that many people would not benefit from a child care tax allowance. The Deputy found this when he was Minister &mdash; he announced a scheme for security for old <Col N="1277" /> people but it was pointed out that a large proportion of that section of the population did not pay tax, so tax relief would be no good to them. He then had to introduce an alternative community support scheme.  Similarly, anyone making a policy decision on child care would have to take into account those who are not in the tax net and would not benefit from tax relief.  That is another issue and is not specifically in my area, although child benefit is.  It is the view of this Government that increases in child benefit should be examined continually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister believes the Government's policy on children is cohesive and cites the interdepartmental approach to drugs.

Does he take on board suggestions from people working in the child care area, who are interested in children and the family, that it is necessary to look at preventing problems?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 53, 60, 62, 115 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget provided for a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions. These increases marked a considerable first step in meeting the commitment in the Government's programme to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by the year 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Partnership 2000 agreement contains a commitment that the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, or CSW, will be implemented before the end of the Partnership, that is, 1999.  Substantial progress has already been made in this.  In addition to the £5 increase for pensioners, the 1998 budget provided for a general increase of £3 per week in all rates of payment for those aged under 66 years.  This means that payments to more than 797,900 recipients, or 93.5 per cent of all recipients, are about <Col N="1279" /> or above the minimum CSW recommended rates, while payments to a further 57,000 recipients of short-term social assistance, or 6.5 per cent of the total, are still about 3 per cent below the target rate.  In addition, qualified adult allowances were increased by 3 per cent in general, giving actual increases of between £1.20 and £1.50. As a result of these increases, the qualified adult allowance rates now range between 56 per cent and 69 per cent of the respective personal rates.</P>
    <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including the level of increases for old age pensioners, widows, widowers and qualified adults, is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the greatest poverty and potential hardship is for a surviving partner?  When one partner passes on the remaining partner is left with one pension less an adult dependant allowance, whichever the case may be.  The same household costs and outgoings still apply.  The only reduction in the household budget is in terms of food.  In those circumstances, a substantial increase is required not only for the first five to six weeks after the bereavement but continuously to cater for those running costs.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  This year's budget was not a repeat of previous years and we gave widowers over the age of 66 years a substantial increase of between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent which was ahead of the inflation rate.  The Minister for Finance also brought forward considerable relief in the tax allowances available to widows so that was a package addressed to the issue of widows.  I accept, and it is acknowledged, that widows and widowers have a difficulty when their partner passes on.  The full year cost of increasing contributory and non contributory widows and widowers pension by 50 per cent would be in the region of £220 million.  To increase old age pensions by 50 per cent in the case of a surviving pensioners without qualified adults would cost in the region of £380 million.  It is a substantial amount totalling £600 million.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I made the point, which arose from a very interesting contribution by Deputy O'Sullivan, that I would take a rather different view from hers on the issue of the administration of justice, equality and law reform. I take the view that there is no violence to the objectives of equality and law reform in the present administrative arrangements.  I suggested to Deputy O'Sullivan and others that it would be detrimental to good administration to start breaking up the Department again.  I have, however, sympathy with the general principle Deputy O'Sullivan sought to highlight that there is a clear and obvious need for the issues of equality and law reform to be kept very much to the fore in political and administrative terms.  I also share her view that certainly in the past the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not always acquitted itself well on that issue.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us is quite complex but does not require a lengthy debate.  There are two specific objectives, both of which are of considerable interest.  The first objective is to ratify the Accession Convention for the three most recent additional member states in the Community.  The only question which arises is, although these three states have been full members of the Community for some time, why has it taken us a long time to get around to the process of ratification. I make the point to the Minister that it is not the fault of this or the previous Administration but it highlights a problem in Europe which is the very complexity of what we could call, broadly speaking, the constitution of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Community has grown larger in terms of numbers and more complex we have a heterogeneous group of documentation which passes as a constitution, ranging from the original Treaty of Rome, the merger treaty, the new accession treaties, the SEA, the Maastricht Treaty on European union and the Amsterdam Treaty.  We have an extraordinary array of documents, a small library.  It strikes me as rather bizarre that for something so fundamental to the creation of a true Common Market as the enforcement of judgments, there should be a time detail in its implementation.  It is not the fault of this or any previous Administration but rather the way business is done in the EU.  It seems a little odd that there is a time lapse in this regard.  The time lapse arises because of the manner in which the EU is <Col N="1282" /> instituted and because the EU has failed to put in place a consolidation treaty which would replace the collection of conventions, accession treaties, the original treaties and the amending treaties which we regard, in effect, as the constitution of Europe.</P>
    <P>The primary objective is, in many ways, to provide a set of legal provisions for the speedy and formal recognition by member states of judgments handed down by the courts of other member states, which is particularly welcome. The convention to which the Bill refers means, as other speakers said, that there is now a European-wide system of enforcement of judgments in the civil and commercial spheres, which must be welcomed.  It is extraordinary if one considers the situation which has pertained until recent years. While we have a common market and free movement of goods, trades and services, we have a deficiency on the legal side in that if a person, party or parties to a contract wishes to avoid their responsibilities, they have effectively been able to avoid those responsibilities because of the complex and non-uniform nature of European law. The conventions, the legislation before us and all that is intended in that regard is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I am, however, concerned that we should see access to all aspects of the thorny issue of judgment enforcement dealt with.  There is some confusion as to the true intent of the Bill because I had to do a double take having listened to some of the earlier contributions.  Having read the legislation and the Minister's speech on Second Stage in the Seanad, I was strongly of the view that it was focused directly, specifically and solely at commercial law, but having listened to earlier contributions I thought it also applied to issues of private law, particularly matrimonial issues and those which arise from marital breakdown.  That is not the case and the confusion which exists in the debate on this Bill well illustrates the point that there is a major lacuna in European law.  The Minister rightly said in his speech that on 28 May Ireland signed a convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial and other matters.</P>
    <P>While I compliment the Minister on coming to the House early with this legislation, I had hoped when we reached this stage we would also see the legislation which necessarily flows from that.  The Minister will share my concern that there should be uniformity in the issue of court judgments enforced across borders in the Community.  It appears Europe has a challenge to meet in terms of emphasis and focus, particularly on the harmonisation of law.  There are two issues on which I fault Europe.  The original Article 220 proposed that there would be progressive harmonisation throughout the Community and that proposition was included in the Treaty of Rome.  However, while the measures in this legislation and the conventions are welcome, it has taken us 40 years to create a degree of harmony and, therefore, a degree of justice in the issue of jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> It is complex and difficult for a corporate company to argue its case, but it is even more difficult for a private citizen of the EU to do so.  While I welcome the fact that a convention on this issue was signed in May 1998, I had hoped that when we saw the next convention on the cross border enforcement of judgments, we would have dealt with the totality of the enforcement of judgments. Europe has suffered from this major lacuna and it is an issue that goes to the very heart of the public perception of what Europe is about.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in Ireland, and in other member states where there is more cynicism about Europe, that Europe is about corporate bodies and is not focused enough on non-commercial issues.  It does not have a human face. This has meant, for example, that judgments in areas such as divorce, bankruptcy, succession and a variety of other private matters have not been given sufficient urgency.  It is regrettable that this convention focuses on the commercial aspect of the enforcement of judgments only.  That sends out the wrong message.</P>
    <P>A consequence of the complexity of European law is that a person can still, with absolute impunity, escape across an EU border and fail to fulfil his or her responsibilities.  However, the intent of the Bill is welcome.  It is a little delayed, but we can hardly blame the current Minister for that, although he has broad shoulders and takes a great deal of blame for everything else.  Neither can we blame him for the 40 years it has taken to implement the objectives of Article 220.  The Bill contains a number of weaknesses.  We are not discussing the totality and enforcement of judgments in ordinary civil cases, particularly those dealing with matrimony, separation and inheritance. There is a lacuna in the law in this area because there has been too much emphasis in Europe on the commercial and economic sector and too little on the individual.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long overdue because corporations can avoid their responsibilities by hiding behind the complexities which arise from the heterogeneous nature of the body of corporate law which applies across member states.  I have taken issue with this for a long time.  There is an urgent need in Europe for a strong effort to consolidate the massive amount of European law that exists. The students to whom I lecture are continually dismayed by how there can be so many primary documents, accession treaties and amending treaties.  Now that Amsterdam is out of the way we are working on another succession of treaties and will get ourselves into more difficulty.  It is time the people who direct our feet at European level gave some thought to this issue.  Cynicism is growing about Europe because people believe it has more to do with business than individuals.</P>
    <P>I am an ardent supporter of Europe as it allows men and women from all member states to come together and share commonality.  The greatest aspect of the Maastricht Treaty was the creation of a common European citizenship, a sense that <Col N="1284" /> we belong to a single grouping.  That is simply so much paper until we get on with the harmonisation and consolidation that is needed across the board.  I compliment the Minister and compliments are also due to his predecessors.</P>
    <P>We can rightly be proud that at least on this occasion we are very much to the fore in enacting the necessary legislating and allowing the legal instruments of the State to give effect to these provisions.  However, the caveat remains and I am still waiting for the detail to flow from the convention signed on 28 May 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roche made a number of valid points.  However, I do not agree with his initial response to Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, even though he should be right in what he said.  However, the evidence is clear that he is not right in this regard.  A previous Taoiseach was quoted as saying &ldquo;We know it works in practice but does it work in theory?&rdquo; The theory is correct, that a large Department with resources should be more effective and able to deliver the goods in terms of legislation, but when there was a Department of Equality and Law Reform and even though the system was fragmented, it delivered the goods.  The record is there for all to see.</P>
      <P>I was critical of the budget when that Department was set up.  Its budget was smaller than that for an average sized UDC, but it produced difficult legislation that was needed.  The lesson to be learnt is that while we can argue for a streamlining in departmental responsibility, we must also have at its core the political will to do the business. I am highly critical of the Government for putting equality issues on the back burner and unnecessarily concentrating a tremendous amount of resources on dealing with sledgehammer legislation and providing prison places that are inappropriate for current needs.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome the Bill as it will enable the State to ratify the convention on the accession of Austria, Sweden and Finland and sets out to consolidate the provisions of the Jurisdictions of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  While it is a lengthy Bill, its purpose is to simplify the procedures whereby the public can have redress in the courts when necessary on a transnational basis.  It is probably of more interest to lawyers than the general public, but it is an important step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the globalisation of economic activity, the legal framework within which it takes place must be strengthened and streamlined.  The internationalisation of law enforcement should automatically follow the internationalisation of trade, but it does not necessarily follow speedily enough and its framework is not well understood. We need only recall our recent experience in regard to the referenda on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties when the public were mystified about the choice they were asked to make.  It was not an informed judgment that led people to <Col N="1285" /> vote in those referenda.  This is a matter we need to address not only at European level but in this House.  The conventions to which we subscribe and the EU directives are not examined sufficiently by Members for us to be satisfied we can provide an accountable system for the public. That raises issues about how to deal with the deficit.</P>
    <P>Arguments were put forward by the constitutional committee that we should enable and require the Seanad to adopt a new role whereby it would examine such conventions and thereby create a bridge between what happens here and what happens in Europe.  There are valid arguments for creating new roles for the Seanad to enable this type of debate and scrutiny to take place.  It is not acceptable or desirable that wide-ranging changes are being agreed at European level while the system here is not able to plug in to what is being proposed at international level and, more importantly for us, at EU level.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was taken in the Bill to make applications to the Master of the High Court rather than the High Court.  We recognise the suitability of that approach because the High Court route is cumbersome and slow.  Only two or three cases at most are taken in the High Court in a day while the Master can process 30 or 40 cases a day.  While that arrangement would be more efficient procedurally, it raises questions, particularly about the operation of the Office of the Master of the High Court.  According to the Bill this arrangement would have financial or staffing implications, but I question that assertion. How does the Minister intend to address the need for additional staff in the Office of the Master of the High Court?  I hope he will reply to that question. There is considerable documentation in transnational procedures and it is impossible to streamline the system in the way proposed without raising the issue of the need to provide additional resources and staff.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the issue of maintenance orders.  I appreciate this is not a central issue in this Bill, but we need to refer to it because too many men believe they can evade their responsibilities to maintain their families. Many women and children are totally dependent on payments on foot of maintenance orders, yet they may have great difficulty tracking down a reneging husband.  That applies here as well as transnationally.  I know of one poignant case where a wife has a legitimate order against her husband for maintenance, but he told her that if she serves it he will leave the country.  She therefore faces the dilemma of whether to ensure her children continue to know their father, albeit at one remove, or to serve the order and avail of her right to maintenance as a result of which her children will lose out because they will not have access to their father.  Women are faced with that dilemma all too often in marital breakown cases. However, we must remember that legal action can and does produce the goods.</P>
    <P>I am aware of another case where $200,000 in <Col N="1286" /> maintenance payments was recovered in the District Court as a result of an action taken by the Central Authority.  That body was set up under the Maintenance Act, which was a very important development.  Obviously attitudes take longer to change than the law and errant husbands will continue to do their best to avoid their responsibilities in respect of maintenance payments.  Anything we can do to ensure they meet their responsibilities is important and worth noting.</P>
    <P>There are a number of references to domicile in the Bill.  Having regard to how slowly attitudes change and the importance of legislation in changing them, it is not very long ago since the domicile of a husband was automatically the domicile of his wife.  In other words, if a man lived in Timbuktu and his wife lived in Tralee her domicile was Timbuktu.  That is an indication of how we can bring about legal change which can help change attitudes and assist in the development of equality.</P>
    <P>As there is already an overload of work in the Office of the Master of the High Court, will the Minister clarify the arrangements that will be made for dealing with additional work?  When payments on foot of maintenance orders or judgments are made in foreign currencies, account must be taken of fluctuations in currency values.  A review mechanism must be sufficiently flexible to take account of such fluctuations.  Will the Minister clarify that position?  If co-operation in this area is to be effective, we must ensure there are reciprocal arrangements and that all countries will play their part.</P>
    <P>Speakers here and in the Seanad spoke about extending this type of co-operation into the area of criminal law.  Serious crimes have been committed against Irish nationals abroad and the families of the victims have encountered great difficulty in gaining access to the police and the judicial system which may operate in a radically different way from ours.  I am mindful of cases of young British and Irish nationals who were murdered in France and the great distress and difficulties encountered by their families in trying to work their way through the judicial system which is radically different from ours.  It is important that proper reciprocal arrangements are put in place.  To ensure that, we need to put in place a monitoring system at EU level to judge how this will work in practice.  It may work in theory, but it must also work in practice.  Such a monitoring system must examine the functioning of this legislation. We should learn from that and ensure it works for those for whom it is designed.  They must have confidence in a system which is very often at one remove because of its transnational character.  In general I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis a ghlacadh labhairt ar an ábhar seo.  In ainneoin gur bille teicniúil é féachaim air mar chéim ar aghaidh eile in aontas na hEorpa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Baineann an Bille le trádáil agus gluaiseacht idir tíortha na hEorpa agus de réir mar atá sin ag <Col N="1287" /> méadú caithfimid cosaint a thabhairt do daoine.  Ba chóir duinn cosaint a thabhairt do ghnó agus do lucht ghnó.</P>
    <P>This Bill can properly be described as a necessary consequence of the increasing success Ireland has achieved in foreign trade.  Its provisions relate to the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, a necessary by-product of international trade, and to the mechanisms by which such judgments can be enforced in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Our role is to foster, in so far as it lies within our power, a climate where the conduct of international trade can be facilitated.  This role was recognised by the six original members of the European Community who, in 1968, enacted a convention which provided for simple procedures to enable judgments obtained in one member country to be enforced in the others.  The enlargement of the European Community required periodic updating of that convention to extend its provisions to new member states.  Therefore, in 1978 and 1982, the convention was amended to make provision for the entry of Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Greece.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the amendment of the convention was enacted in domestic law in the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  The convention was again amended in 1989 to extend its application to two new member states, Spain and Portugal.  This new development was in turn enacted in Irish law by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1993, which also gave effect to the Lugano Convention in domestic law.  This latter development had the effect of bringing Austria, Finland and Sweden &mdash; the European Free Trade Association countries &mdash; within the net of nations covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to update our domestic law to keep abreast of developments on the European stage.  In addition to this essential role, it also has commendable features for simplifying the Irish procedures required to enforce foreign judgments.  Many of the complexities of the Bill are necessitated by the different legal systems which operate in different European countries.</P>
    <P>Many European countries with which Ireland now enjoys substantial commercial links have legal systems which utilise procedures and instruments which are unknown to our constitutional common law legal system.  Authentic instruments and settlements which are common in Europe are unknown in Ireland.  This can cause difficulties for Irish individuals and companies which seek to enforce those creatures of the civil code system in our courts.  One of the chief provisions of the Bill is to provide for the enforcement of these instruments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 6, which will enable the necessary application to be made to the Master of the High Court rather than the court itself, should result in a speedy and cost <Col N="1288" /> effective method of implementation.  The fact that in the future these provisions will also apply to maintenance obligations concluded with or authenticated by administrative authorities is particularly welcome.  Arising from the Bill, Community judgments shall be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court.  A more effective enforcement is ensured by the Master of the High Court who can make declarations in relation to periodic and lump sum payments.  This is particularly important where the debtor does not reside but has assets in the State.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill relates largely to commerce and trade, section 9 relates to matters of concern to the wider community in so far as it relates to maintenance orders for spouses and children. Strict procedures and protections are given to families where maintenance orders are made in this country, which in themselves have been difficult to enforce, but often there have been severe difficulties in enforcing orders made in another country against persons domiciled in Ireland.  The Bill will protect women and children who are dependent on those payments but who have had difficulty having their order enforced.  Ireland no longer will be a safe place of escape for maintenance defaulters.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not cover a number of issues, including criminal matters and issues in relation to revenue, customs or administration.  It does not cover wills and succession or relate to divorce or legal separation.  Many of these are dealt with elsewhere and many of them have been and I hope will continue to be, because there is a need for them, the subject of other protocols, agreements and legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is still relevant in an era where we have more mobility and commercial interaction. It is relevant in the practical enforcement of the treaties on which we voted in Ireland, including the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is relevant in so far as it takes us on our next step of co-operation within the European Union of which we are a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to this informative debate.  In general the observations made by Members were useful and constructive.  However, I reject emphatically the assertions of Deputy McManus and Deputy O'Sullivan that joining the Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform has in any way lessened the effectiveness of the Department. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was established in late June 1997, the equality and law reform section has been responsible for more legislation than at any other time since its inception.  The legislation drafted by that section of the Department since the Government came into office includes the Employment Equality Bill, the Parental Leave Bill, the Arbitration Bill, the Children Bill and two tribunal Bills.  In addition, the Solicitors' Bill and the Family <Col N="1289" /> Law (Protection of Children) Bill have been published, although they have not yet been debated.  By any standards this is a tremendous performance and I am very grateful to the excellent staff.</P>
    <P>If one compares the number of Bills enacted by the previous Administration over a much longer period, it can be seen that the amount of legislation emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform compares more than favourably.  For example, in 1996, the Civil Liability Bill, the Births Registration Bill, the Family Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Family Law (Divorce) Bill and the Domestic Violence Bill were introduced.  In other years less legislation than the current amount was produced. The allegation is entirely spurious and was made merely for political purposes.  It has no basis. However, on this of all days, the House will forgive the Labour Party and Democratic Left for making spurious allegations because they have been suffering all morning and yesterday afternoon from collective and selective amnesia from which I hope they recover at an early date.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Higgins's comments regarding consolidation, but we have at least made a start with this Bill.  In addition to responding to certain points raised by Deputies during the debate, I will refer to a number of other issues which may help put the measure in context.  On the face of it, the Bill is technical in nature.  However, it is primarily a consolidating measure.  It repeals and re-enacts the Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993, as well as amending certain sections of the Maintenance Act, 1994, which have been absorbed into the consolidated text.  It will also enable the State to ratify the 1996 Accession Convention dealing with the accession of three new member states to the Judgments Convention.</P>
    <P>The impetus behind the Brussels Convention as drawn up originally in 1968 was to give meaningful effect to Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  That Article called on member states to secure &ldquo;the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals&rdquo;.  While the convention, because of its technical nature, may be more familiar to the legal profession than the public, the fundamental aim is to simplify legal formalities in the civil and commercial areas so that the relevant judgments are subject to almost automatic enforcement.  While the Bill is a technical measure, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, the Brussels and Lugano conventions have the capacity to impact in a practical way on people's daily lives, whether they be consumers or producers of goods and services.  This is particularly the case where contractual obligations exist between two or more parties and where the legal action they are taking has a transnational dimension. If an Irish consumer purchases goods in another member state and those goods turn out to be faulty or are not delivered, the conventions enable them to bring an action before the Irish <Col N="1290" /> courts should they so wish.  Similarly, if business and commercial relationships are to function with maximum efficiency, those engaging in contractual relationships across national boundaries must be assured that the full range of enforcement remedies are available to them, notwithstanding that the parties may be based in different EU or EFTA member states.</P>
    <P>We are among the first of our EU partners to take steps to ratify the accession convention for Austria, Finland and Sweden.  Only three other states have ratified this convention and it is scheduled to come into force for these countries on 1 December.  I do not intend that there should be tardiness attached to our ratification process and once the Bill is enacted the process will begin immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned the need to minimise the delay between signature and ratification of a convention.  It is well recognised that in most member states the practical work of giving effect to a convention only begins once it has been signed.  Since legislation is often required and parliamentary procedures within member states vary in their complexity, it is not surprising that a certain amount of time can elapse before final ratification.</P>
    <P>Since the Brussels and Lugano conventions came into operation in 1968 and 1988, respectively, the international environment and the needs of the various interests and sectors covered by their scope, in particular those involved in cross-border trade within the European Union and the European free trade area, have, as Deputy Roche said, changed dramatically.  To ensure both conventions deal effectively with this changing environment and the growing challenges it imposes they are undergoing a comprehensive review by a joint working group of EU and EFTA member states.  The aim of the review, which commenced in Brussels in January and which is expected to conclude before the end of June 1999, is, as far as is possible and practicable, to update, streamline and simplify the conventions in the case of their jurisdictional rules and the procedures they contain for the cross-frontier recognition and enforcement of judgments.  This will allow them to operate more efficiently and effectively and to be better geared to meet the needs of the European society they serve.  All EU and EFTA member states are participating in these discussions and all aspects of the conventions are covered by the review exercise.  It will take into account not only suggestions for change and improvements made by individual contracting states participating in the discussions, but also developments in the large body of jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice which has built up during the years on the Brussels convention which applies to the circulation of judgments between EU member states whereas the parallel Lugano convention applies between EU and EFTA member states.</P>
    <P>Under the Lugano convention it is possible for a state which is not yet a member of the European <Col N="1291" /> Union or the European Free Trade Association to accede to the convention provided it is sponsored by a member state and all signatory and contracting states agree unanimously to such accession.  An application by Poland to accede to the Lugano convention has received the approval of all signatory states and its accession is expected to come into effect by the middle of 1999 following the expected deposit of its instrument of accession later this year or early in 1999.  The net effect of Polish accession will be that Polish judgments which are in conformity with the jurisdiction rules of the Lugano convention will be entitled to recognition and enforcement in EU and EFTA member states, including Ireland, as will equivalent judgments from those states in Poland.  Other applications of this kind are pending. In this context I refer to a point made by Deputy Higgins concerning the need to extend further the net of countries covered by the Brussels convention.  The work which is ongoing in The Hague has some significance.</P>
    <P>In addition to the review of the Brussels and Lugano conventions, civil judicial co-operation in general under Title VI of the EU treaty is progressing at a steady pace.  Two conventions in the civil area have been negotiated under the Title VI arrangements.  The convention on the service in the member states of the European Union of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters was signed in May 1997.  A convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters was signed on 28 May 1998.  The Brussels II convention, as it is known, will when adopted by all EU member states, provide a system whereby a judgment given in one member state relating to matrimonial proceedings, namely, annulment, divorce or legal separation, will be entitled to recognition in all other member states.  The adoption of this convention by Ireland will require legislation.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam also provides for enhanced judicial co-operation in civil matters between EU member states.  Such co-operation is part of the process whereby the objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice can be achieved.  I hope it will result in simplification of the convoluted procedures to which Deputy Roche alluded and a coherent body of law.</P>
    <P>The areas covered by the proposed co-operation, in addition to recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, include improvement and simplification of the system for serving legal documents; co-operation in taking evidence, and measures aimed at the elimination of obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings generally.  An important element of the treaty is that measures falling within the area of EU co-operation will become a Union responsibility.  What the new treaty provisions do is move judicial co-operation in civil matters closer to the centre of EU activity.  This <Col N="1292" /> recognises that the Union has the possibility to be a judicial space as well as an economic power and that compatability within our legal systems can be a force which will impact favourably on our citizens.  Against that background, the judgments' convention may assume even greater importance than it has and may be utilised more intensively than at present.  I hope this Bill will help to make people more conscious that their legal rights have a genuine European and extra-territorial dimension.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to Deputies on all sides of the House for participating in what has been a most constructive and useful debate.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The purpose of the Bill is to put in place the legislative framework to enable Ireland become a <Col N="1293" /> contracting party to the ADR &mdash; the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road.  The Bill will also provide the framework for bringing into Irish law two important and related European Union directives.  The first and most important of those directives is Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road.  Essentially the purpose of this directive is to apply the technical provisions of the ADR to the national or domestic transport of dangerous goods of each member state.</P>
      <P>The second directive referred to is Directive 95/50 of 6 October 1995 on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road.  The objective of the directive, as its name implies, is to ensure that member states check a representative proportion of consignments of dangerous goods being transported by road within their territories.  The purpose of the checks is to ensure that road movements of dangerous goods are in compliance with the laws of the state and thereby with the detailed provisions of the ADR.</P>
      <P>Members will appreciate that these three initiatives constitute a comprehensive response to ensuring that dangerous goods in transit on the roads both domestically and internationally adhere to the highest standards and are seen to do so.</P>
      <P>I will now describe in a little more detail each of the three main elements with which the Bill deals.  The first is the European agreement concerning the international carriage of goods by road.  As the name implies, the agreement regulates the transport of dangerous goods by road across borders in Europe.  The agreement was drawn up in 1957 and came into force on 29 July 1968.  There are now 33 signatories to the agreement and Ireland is the only member state of the European Union that is not a signatory.</P>
      <P>The agreement is short and relatively simple.  It consists of 15 articles which define the scope and method of operation of the agreement.  A key article is Article 2 which effectively paves the way for the carriage of dangerous goods by road between the territories of the contracting parties. Article 3 specifies that such dangerous goods may be moved internationally in road vehicles provided that the packaging and labelling are in accordance with technical Annex A of the agreement, and the vehicle construction, equipment and operation are in accordance with technical Annex B to the agreement.</P>
      <P>Article 1 defines the terms used in the agreement. Article 2 lays down the conditions under which dangerous goods are to be carried, that is in compliance with the annexes to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 3 states that annexes A and B to the agreement form an integral part thereof.  Annex A specifies the dangerous goods which are permitted to be carried internationally by road and the conditions to be complied with in such carriage, <Col N="1294" /> including packaging and labelling requirements. It also specifies goods that are prohibited from such carriage.</P>
    <P>Annex B specifies conditions as regards the construction, use, testing and approval of transport equipment intended for use in the carriage of dangerous goods by road and the training and certification of drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>Article 4 allows contracting parties to regulate or prohibit, for reasons other than safety during carriage, the entry of dangerous goods into their territory.  It also provides for circumstances where contracting parties, by virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreements with other contracting parties, can allow the carriage of certain prohibited dangerous goods under special conditions.</P>
    <P>Article 5 provides that transport operations under this agreement remain subject to national and international regulations applicable in general to road traffic, international road transport and international trade.</P>
    <P>Articles 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the ADR are housekeeping articles related to such matters as accession, the effective date of the agreement, ceasing to become a contracting party and territories of contracting parties.</P>
    <P>Articles 11 and 12 are concerned with the procedure for settlement of a dispute between two or more contracting parties concerning the interpretation or application of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 13 deals with the procedure for reviewing the text of the agreement while Article 14 is concerned with the procedure for the amendment of the annexes to this agreement.</P>
    <P>Articles 15, 16 and 17 deal with the protocols of signature and ratification of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The real substance of the ADR is contained in the annexes to which I referred earlier.  The annexes specify the technical requirements which must be met when transporting dangerous goods internationally by road.  Annex A to the agreement lists the dangerous goods that may be carried and deals with the classification of those goods, packaging, labelling and documentary requirements.  These issues are of concern to the consignor of the load.  Annex B deals with the vehicle and tank construction requirements and the rules for operation which are the responsibilities of the carrier, the operator and the driver of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The system of classification of dangerous goods under ADR follows as closely as possible the Recommendations of the Transport of Dangerous Goods, drawn up by the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. This system is designed to apply world-wide to all transport modes.  Dangerous goods are divided into nine different classes according to the main type of danger they could present in transport, for example, explosion or toxicity.</P>
    <P>Annex A classifies dangerous goods as follows: class 1 &mdash; explosive substances and articles; class 2 &mdash; gases; class 3 &mdash; flammable liquids; class 4 &mdash;<Col N="1295" /> flammable solids, substances liable to spontaneous combustion and substances which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases; class 5 &mdash; oxidising substances and organic peroxides; class 6 &mdash; toxic and infectious substances; class 7 &mdash; radioactive material; class 8 &mdash; corrosive substances; class 9 &mdash; miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles.</P>
    <P>The technical annexes lay down detailed and comprehensive requirements for each of the nine classes of dangerous goods.  The movement of dangerous goods is in some special cases exempt from the rules of the ADR, for example, where the goods are carried by a private individual for their own use, inside machines for their operational function, in limited quantities by an enterprise in support of its main activity, such as deliveries by a construction firm to a building site, or in emergency service or recovery vehicles.</P>
    <P>If part of an ADR journey comes under other international rules such as the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, for a sea crossing, those rules also apply and replace the equivalent ADR rules for that part of the journey.  This is particularly relevant for multi-modal operations. If an ADR journey precedes and follows carriage by sea or air, the goods shall be accepted for carriage under ADR even if the packages and containers are labelled in accordance with the sea or air mode rather than with the ADR.</P>
    <P>The second instrument the Bill makes provision for is European Directive 94/55 of 21 November, 1994, on the approximation of laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of that directive is to apply the detailed and comprehensive rules contained in the annexes to the ADR to national transport of dangerous goods by road.  Thus, all transport of dangerous goods either entering the State, leaving the State for an international destination or on a journey from point A to point B within the State are comprehended by the rules. The stringent international rules for the transport of dangerous goods between countries will apply to domestic transport of dangerous goods under the new regime.  The directive was introduced in the interest of uniformity and free trading across the European Union.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that the ADR, being an international agreement, cannot always be adapted to national transport conditions and requirements, the directive contains a number of articles which provide for the granting of derogations from the full requirements of the ADR. The derogation facility in the directive has been availed of by Ireland in a number of instances where local conditions merited such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of important derogations. Vehicles engaged in the transport of dangerous goods at 31 December 1996, can continue in use <Col N="1296" /> provided they meet national requirements in place at the time.  Tanks engaged in transport of dangerous goods can continue in use under similar conditions and new tanks can continue to be constructed up to 1 January 1999 under existing construction requirements.  Reference temperatures which determine the shell thickness of LPG tanks suitable to our climatic conditions have been accepted, as thicker shells are required in hotter regions of southern Europe and there is also a derogation relating to explosives which allows for such transport here associated with the continued security arrangements.  Ireland has also negotiated derogations to cover the transport of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, dispensing gases carried on the same vehicle as beverages, transport of low level radioactive material to hospitals and transport of clinical waste.</P>
    <P>The directive provides the right to prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within a territory for reasons other than safety during transport, for example, national security or environmental protection.  The directive also prohibits the introduction of more stringent regulations for national transport.  However, if existing safety provisions are found, through incident or accident, to be insufficient and urgent action is required, member states may implement increased measures following consultation with the Commission.</P>
    <P>The final element of the package concerns Directive 95/50/EEC on uniform procedures and levels of enforcement relating to the checking of compliance with Directive 94/55/EEC.  The main purpose of Directive 95/50/EEC is to ensure member states carry out checks on a representative number of dangerous goods journeys in the State.</P>
    <P>The types of checks to be carried out are detailed in the directive and must be carried out at different places, at any time of the day and cover a sufficiently extensive portion of the road network to make checkpoints difficult to avoid. The checks must ascertain if the correct documents are being carried in the vehicle, if the goods being transported are permitted under the regulations and, if so, that they are being transported in the correct containers or packages and that the equipment is in proper working order and is free from leaks or faults.  These checks may not be carried out as frontier checks at the internal frontiers of the Community, but as part of normal checks without discrimination.  Checks may also be carried out at premises.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that accession to the ADR and the bringing into law of the two directives constitutes a comprehensive body of legislation relating to the carriage of dangerous goods.  The signing of the regulations now in preparation will complete the final pillar of the regime.  With that legislation in place Ireland will be on a par with the highest standards of domestic as well as international transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that all the legislative elements we are in the process of putting in place <Col N="1297" /> does not mean that carriage of dangerous goods by road in Ireland at present is not meeting high standards.  A range of statutory instruments, made pursuant to the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, already cover the conveyance of all dangerous substances with the exception of class 1, explosives, and class 7, radioactive materials.  The carriage of explosives is covered under by-laws and rules made under the Explosives Act, 1875, and the transport of radioactive materials is covered by an order made under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  One of the values of the new regime is it brings together all provisions relating to carriage of dangerous goods by road in one set of regulations backed up with the detailed ADR annexes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that driver training and certification have been in place in Ireland since 1992.  Further, by virtue of a statutory instrument introduced in 1997, the more rigorous requirements of the ADR specification for driver training are in place.  A number of providers of driver training courses have been approved by the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Under the regulations, my Department arranges for the examination of drivers as soon as possible after they have completed the course.  The examination consists of a written and oral test set by the Health and Safety Authority.  Approximately 5,000 Irish drivers have the necessary certificate at this stage which has ensured that transport of dangerous goods by road has continued uninterrupted. The training course teaches drivers the necessary requirements concerning handling, loading and unloading, documentation, equipment marking, emergency procedures and protective clothing.  Drivers successful at the examination receive the necessary certificate, but it does not stop there.  Each driver must attend a refresher course every five years to ensure he or she remains fully trained and <i>au fait</i> with up to date developments in the carriage of dangerous goods.  This process will continue under the proposed new regulations to be made pursuant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail on each section of the Bill.  Deputies have a comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum which provides a detailed commentary on the provisions of the Bill as well as a general background. However, there are some significant elements of the Bill which deserve mention.  It is essentially an enabling Bill and the objective is the establishment of a framework for applying the detailed and comprehensive technical requirements set out in the annexes to the ADR. In accordance with section 17, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is empowered to make regulations from time to time for the purposes of specifying the requirements concerning the carriage of dangerous goods by road as they evolve.  The Bill proposes that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will <Col N="1298" /> make the necessary regulations while the Minister for Public Enterprise promotes the Bill.</P>
    <P>The ADR was drawn up in 1957 and came into force in 1961.  In the absence of steps to ratify it elsewhere, the drafting of the necessary legislation was taken on board by the old Department of Transport as accession to the ADR would have been of assistance to Irish hauliers engaged in international haulage of dangerous goods by road.  In endeavouring to bring forward the necessary legislation and have the ADR ratified in Ireland, my Department always intended to transfer responsibility back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, where responsibility properly lies.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has overall responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority which will be the principal enforcement body and which will also enforce regulations for the handling and storing of dangerous goods generally. It is thought that it would be confusing for the public and industry if responsibility for the handling and storing of dangerous goods in a factory lay with one Minister while responsibility for their transportation lay with another.</P>
    <P>Considerable work has already been carried out on the necessary regulations, which the Minister is enabled to make pursuant to section 17. Preparation of the regulations is proceeding apace through the work of an interdepartmental committee comprising representatives from a number of Departments and State agencies.  Bodies represented on this committee include the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my own Department of Public Enterprise, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The regulations have the very important value of bringing all the elements associated with the carriage of dangerous goods by road together in one document or set of statutory regulations.  These regulations, when read in conjunction with the annexes to the ADR, will be invaluable to industry, haulage concerns and drivers alike.  For the first time, it will bring together in one place the laws and technical requirements necessary to inform persons engaged in the transport of all dangerous substances, including explosives and radioactive materials.</P>
    <P>A second significant element is the need to ensure that comprehensive and representative numbers of checks are carried out and breaches dealt with in a non-discriminatory fashion.  This is prompted by the requirements of Directive 95/50/EC of 6 October 1995 on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road.  Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for adequate sanction against national and international hauliers.  To this end, section 9 is designed to ensure breaches of the Bill or regulations made thereunder can be prosecuted <Col N="1299" /> against out of state carriers in the course of a journey carrying dangerous goods within the State.  This will be achieved by arresting any driver who a garda has reason to believe is committing or has committed an offence and, in the opinion of the garda, has not given a satisfactory address for service of summons.  The Bill defines a satisfactory address as one at which the person will be for a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to serve him or her with a summons, or an address of some other specified person who will accept a summons on the first person's behalf.  In such cases, the address of a firm of solicitors in the State which undertakes to accept summonses on behalf of the driver will satisfy this provision.  The section is similar to a provision in the United Kingdom Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1934, which is used extensively by the UK police authorities to deal with out of state hauliers in breach of road traffic and transport legislation in Britain.</P>
    <P>In the case of a driver of a vehicle being arrested under this section, the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, come into effect.  Under the procedure the arrested driver is brought to the nearest Garda station and brought as soon as practicable before the District Court in the district in which he was arrested or released on bail to appear at the next appropriate sitting on the District Court.  Bail can be set by the station sergeant in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 and can be in the form of recognisance or a sum of money lodged in the relevant District Court to the court clerk.  If the driver fails to appear before the court at the appointed time, an application can be made under the relevant District Court rule to entreat the recognisance or to forfeit the sum of money.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in this area is the proposal in section 18 to introduce on the spot fines in respect of offences under the regulations made pursuant to section 17.  This section is an enabling one and it will be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prescribe the class of offences which will be dealt with under the section.  An inspector who has reasonable grounds for believing a person is committing an offence under the regulations may issue a notice to that person stating he or she is alleged to have committed the offence, that he or she may make a payment of £150 without delay to the inspector and that a prosecution will not be pursued if the payment is made to the inspector without delay.  This provision is significantly different from existing on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>The current system is an invitation to pay a certain amount of money within 21 days.  Prosecution will not ensure payment is made.  The system proposed in the Bill is an invitation to pay £150 without delay to an enforcing inspector.  If the driver refuses to pay, or does not have a satisfactory address for service of summons, the provisions <Col N="1300" /> of section 9 come into play.  If the driver has a satisfactory address for summons and does not pay the fine, he can be prosecuted in the normal manner.  The fine is currently set at £150. However, the Minister may vary this amount by way of regulations at any time to take account of inflation, if it is felt a fine set at this level is not a sufficient deterrent or if the offences demand greater fines.  Flexibility is provided in the Bill as to the currencies and the methods of payment which will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling or framework Bill in that the bulk of the technical detail of the legislation will be implemented by way of secondary legislation. This proposed statutory instrument will implement the technical requirements of the ADR and the directives.  Essentially this is the content of the annexes of the ADR as described earlier.  These annexes are revised by technical experts from the contracting parties to keep pace with the technological improvements in the areas of vehicle and equipment construction and in safety matters.</P>
    <P>The annexes are updated at least every two years and include such amendments as valve design, thickness of tank walls and detailed elements of equipment construction, volumes of goods and articles which can be transported and the specification of packaging to be used.  It is considered these technical changes would be more appropriate to secondary legislation.  The House should be aware that, in accordance with section 19 of the Bill, each regulation and amendment to a regulation will be laid before the Dáil and the Seanad.  Deputies and Senators may debate the regulations if they wish at that stage.</P>
    <P>The regulations to be introduced will cover the following areas: the carriage of dangerous goods within the State or into the State, or from the State into the territory of another contracting party; the type, approval, examination, testing, certification, marking and labelling of transport equipment to be used in the carriage of dangerous goods; the approval of training courses for drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods by road, the examination of such drivers who have undertaken approved training and the granting of training certificates to those drivers who have passed an approved examination after such training; the recognition of tests, certificates or approvals undertaken or granted by a competent authority of another contracting party; the revocation of any approval or certificate issued by a competent authority; equipment to be provided on vehicles carrying dangerous goods by road; transport documents to be carried on vehicles carrying dangerous goods by road; the notification of accidents or dangerous occurrences arising from the carriage of dangerous goods by road; and the supervision and monitoring of competent authorities, bodies or persons in respect of any tasks or functions assigned to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may make consequential, supplementary and ancillary provisions as are necessary <Col N="1301" /> for the purposes of the regulations.  The regulations may amend or revoke statutory instruments made under the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972-1979, the Explosives Act, 1875, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and the European Communities Act, 1972, in so far as they relate to the carriage of dangerous goods by road.  It is the intention that all provisions and requirements relating to the carriage of dangerous goods by road will be set out in one comprehensive set of regulations to be made pursuant to this Act.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is overdue but it will be supported by Fine Gael.  I have some memoranda relating to the last Government covering the period 1995.  I would have thought this Bill was more advanced at that time and should have been enacted earlier this year.</P>
      <P>There are grave problems in the road haulage sector for which the Minister of State has responsibility.  He attended the conference of the IRHA.  There are major problems of illegal haulage and poor enforcement of existing legislation, not to speak of new legislation.  I wish to focus on enforcement which is the key issue of this debate. There is still no legislation on consignor liability. I have a copy of a Bill published by the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, on 25 March 1997.  This was an uncontroversial Bill, but it has never seen the light of day.</P>

For the benefit of the House, consignor liability would ensure the industry using the haulage sector bears some responsibility for breaches of regulations, rather than having the poor driver bear the brunt of every misdemeanour.  This is a critical issue for the industry and I regret the constipation in the Department of Public Enterprise in failing to come forward with relevant legislation.  I have spoken repeatedly about the 1932 Act.  We are in a time warp when it comes to road and bus transport and we are way behind our European neighbours and obligations.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the chronic problem for the haulage industry whereby people are going out of business and there are no stable rates.  One of the Government's tactics is to announce a review whenever there is a thorny issue which needs political action.  It kicks to touch to buy time, peace and consensus.  The review produces a report which gathers dust.  Then there is a change of Government and nothing really changes.  The Minister of State will be judged by his actions not by his reviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been upheavals in Dublin Port. <Col N="1302" /> There have also been problems caused by the French drivers' strike and the blockages of beef at English and Welsh ports which have added to the tale of woe and attrition to which the Irish haulage industry has been subjected.  In its budgetary policy or elsewhere, I do not detect any sign that the Government has an understanding of the difficulties faced by the haulage sector. This industry is vital to our competitiveness given that we are an island which exports 80 per cent of what we produce.  With 3.5 million people we cannot live off our own consumption.  The haulage industry needs a lot more than compliance with conventions signed in 1994.  We need real action and proactive policies to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>There was a clever line in the Minister of State's speech which roughly stated that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would take responsibility for this matter as it has responsibility for chemicals and dangerous substances in factories.  People will say that that is plausible.  However, from my experience as a Minister, I know Departments try to distance themselves from issues which are not sexy, which do not present Ministers with photo opportunities, or which involve a lot of administration and enforcement.  All aspects of the haulage industry should come under the Department of Public Enterprise.  This is a haulage and a transport issue.  The Minister is at pains to say his Department has taken responsibility for the legislation and is complying with its obligations.  That is typical of the attitude of this Government and the Department of Public Enterprise to the key issue of enforcement.</P>
    <P>I have long believed that whether it is the tacograph, laden weights, inadequate tax or insurance or cowboy operators, there is a need for a dedicated cohort of people to enforce regulations in the haulage sector, for which this legislation is the latest layer.  There is no will whatsoever in this legislation for the Department of Public Enterprise to take its responsibility seriously in this regard, hence it wants to shift this matter as quickly as possible to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which will need more Ministers simply to keep pace, given its responsibilities for exports and a myriad of State agencies.  I do not know how the Tánaiste can memorise her list of responsibilities, not to mention doing an effective job.  We need a strong Minister for Transport, who has responsibility for traffic.</P>

      <P>The gridlock issue is fundamental. There is the question of whether freight in Dublin should be delivered at night instead of in the morning and whether heavy goods vehicles should be in the city.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, refers the matter to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, <Col N="1303" /> who in turn refers it to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, while the Minister of State with responsibility for transport has no grip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I know how busy the Deputy is in Cork at present and I wish him well, but not that well.  This legislation highlights that there is no effective enforcement of haulage legislation <i>per se</i>.  It has been my view for some time that we need a dedicated transport ministry that can deal with traffic, gridlock, illegal haulage and so on so. Members of the Garda Síochána are more interested in solving murders than operation free-flow, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>This is a crucial issue and I welcome the progress made by Dublin Corporation under Owen Keegan.  I welcome also the clamping of vehicles by a private company and getting the traffic wardens focused on all the traffic issues.  That is a step in the right direction and perhaps it could be expanded nationwide to deal with tacographs, diesel use, insurance and so on.  Quick buck merchants come in, undercut and leave a tale of woe behind.  That is what is destroying the haulage industry.  I have experience of people being left with bad debts and horrific problems.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me about this legislation is that quite an amount of dangerous substances are carried by rail.  An accident in Glasnevin last year which involved a derailment could have had serious implications.  Prior to its closure, huge convoys of chemicals were transported to Asahi by rail.  In this regard, the Minister will be aware of IFI in Cork and Arklow.  Will he clarify the representative proportion of consignments of dangerous goods being transported by rail within the territory that are being checked?  Does this convention apply to the movement of all surface dangerous substances haulage?  Given the incident at Glasnevin and the concerns that genuinely arise, this matter needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the classes of dangerous goods, one to nine, which were outlined in Annex A. It is not clear whether oil spillages are included.  If one listens to AA Roadwatch one will know that a frequent cause of road mayhem is oil spillage.  A tragic fatal accident occurred in my constituency during the summer which could have been due, in part, to an oil spillage.  I was told at the national ploughing championship last week that there was an oil spillage at New Ross bridge where there was bedlam.  A penalty of £150 is not sufficient for an oil spillage.  Of all the flammable substances transported the greatest, volume-wise and traffic journey-wise, would be oil, diesel, petroleum products and so on.  What spot-checks are taking place and where do petroleum products fit into classes one to nine of Annex A?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister referred to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.  He outlined the procedure whereby the arrested driver would be brought to the nearest Garda station, the District Court and that bail could be set.  If the driver fails to appear before the court at the appointed time, the bail can be forfeited.  The Minister of State will be aware of another fatal accident around Arklow in which an Italian driver was allegedly involved.  He was brought before the court recently.  He has returned to Italy and has promised to return here. We are now facing a situation where bail could be the end outcome in terms of its forfeiture.  What is the situation?  Are judges advised on what would be an appropriate level of bail?  Is this reflected in the legislation given that people may have no intention of returning.  While the procedure has been set out, in reality once people get bail they may not return.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.</P>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister said the objective of the directive was to ensure a representative proportion of consignments of dangerous goods being transported by road would be checked.  What is the present level of checking and what is the proposed future level of checking? Is it 1 per cent or 10 per cent?  Does it apply only in certain parts of the country or is it more prevalent in the Border region?  Is it the case that when a memorandum is sent to the Garda Commissioner something happens, but that most of the time nothing happens?  The principal enforcement body will be the Health and Safety Authority. What experience has that authority in dealing with haulage matters?  I understand this is the first time it has been given responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>Soon never comes.  I note the liaison with local authorities which will occur.  It is very important that local authorities are involved. <Col N="1305" /> I have no real objection to the driver training requirements referred to by the Minister, although I hope there is proper enforcement.  The fines seem very low relative to the value of the product being transported.  Perhaps they are not sufficiently high to form an effective deterrent.  I would also like the Minister of State to clarify the situation in relation to the marine and aviation freight aspects of the Bill.  In the context of ro-ro I understand there is an international maritime dangerous goods code, but is there an identical parallel between the two codes and what is contained in the legislation?</P>
      <P>It is not our intention to delay the passage of the Bill.  A memorandum from the road haulage division of the Department dated 15 May 1995 &mdash; I am sure little has changed in the division &mdash; states:</P>
      <P>at the end of 1994 the EU decided that ADR should be applied to national transport from 1 January 1997.  A revised scheme of Bill is now being prepared to take account of this development.</P>
      <P>By the date of this memorandum the parliamentary draftsman's office had completed the work.  I have already referred to the constipation which is evident.  There seems to be a total logjam in the section in terms of legislation.  Alternatively, perhaps the issue is lacking in political priority.</P>
      <P>We welcome this overdue legislation which we are obliged to enact given that we have signed the convention and in the context of our obligations under the EU directive.  I request specific clarification on the rail issue and the need to tighten up the supervision of dangerous goods.  I condemn the Government for its failure to get to grips with the importance of the haulage sector. Reviews are not the answer.  A proper livelihood with a professional structure availing of telematics and other just-in-time techniques is the way forward.  I very much regret that consignor liability legislation has not been brought forward, especially when the legislation has already been drawn up.  We might introduce it during Private Members' time if the delay continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important point is that all too often in this and other areas we are very good at ultimately enacting more statutory declarations and statutory instruments but are very poor in terms of effective enforcement.  This means that hauliers who are registered, legitimate and covered for every element of red tape have a huge cost penalty in comparison to cowboys who take a chance and decide not to comply with regulations and who are rewarded due to the lack of effective enforcement.  All the hallmarks of this problem exist in the context of this legislation, with comments being made that the issue is one for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  It is a bad attitude to take and a fundamental reappraisal of the situation, whereby a Department <Col N="1306" /> of transport would take responsibility for transport and the haulage sector and put in place an effective corps of people to police the legislation, should take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I welcome the very belated introduction of this important Bill.  The regulations it seeks to embody in Irish law have existed since 1968 and were in gestation for a decade before that.  We are the only member of the EU which did not accede to the ADr. It seems remarkable that it has taken since October 1991 to bring forward the heads of a Bill to cover this issue, something which seems to be the result of the interdepartmental and inter-agency wrangling which Deputy Yates referred to.  In saying this I am not criticising the Minister of State or objecting to the sonorous tones in which he delivered the Bill.  However, the legislation seems to have been viewed as a tar baby which various Ministers have been throwing around from one to the other over the years, determined that it would not stick. The unfortunate Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has finally got responsibility to deliver the legislation.</P>
      <P>I commend some of the comments made about the difficulties the haulage industry may have in relation to costs and I want to question the Minister about some of the derogations he mentioned. The Bill says that some of the testing and checking procedures will be effectively self-financing.  I cannot see how this could possibly be the case in the context of carrying out the remit of the ADR, its annexes and the other two directives.</P>
      <P>As the Labour Party spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment I am substituting for my colleague, Deputy Stagg, who has pressing business in the south.  It seems the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is already grossly overburdened and I cannot see, even given the recent publications of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, how this will change or how we can bring a reasonable standard to bear in terms of implementing the ADR.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was responsible for the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, the Dangerous Substances (Amendment) Act, 1979, and the original 1989 Act, but the previous Department of Labour over the years strenuously resisted the role of supervision and inspection, at least up to the past hour when such resistance was effectively ended by the Minister of State's speech.</P>
      <P>A huge range of bodies has been involved in this difficult gestation, including the Departments of Public Enterprise, Foreign Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Agriculture and Food and Health and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Children, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, local authorities, the fire authorities, Enterprise Ireland, the Radiological Protection Institution of Ireland, the Garda and health boards.  It seems particularly inappropriate that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment did not introduce the Bill if it is to be the relevant inspection authority.  I look forward to the Minister's reply and perhaps clarification regarding the confusion which seems to exist.  The Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the NAOSH and the RPII are specifically referred to in section 5 as being supervising authorities.  Clarification of their various roles should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined a number of derogations, one of which was that vehicles engaged in the transport of dangerous goods at 31 December, 1996, can continue in use provided they meet national requirements.  Does the Minister not consider such a derogation dangerous?  Tanks engaged in the transport of dangerous goods can also continue in use under similar conditions and new tanks can continue to be constructed up to 1 January 1999 under existing construction requirements. We could be well into the new millennium before the regulations referred to come into effect.  The Minister also mentioned reference temperatures which determine the shell thickness of LPG tanks suitable to our climate; thicker shells are required in hotter regions of southern Europe.  How does that derogation meet the requirements for international travel and carriage when a chemical product could be transported from our country into a southern climate?  There is also a derogation relating to explosives and security arrangements.</P>
    <P>This legislation has never been more necessary, both for the industry itself and for the general public.  Reference was made to the train derailment at Glasnevin in the middle of a high population centre.  The north side is well known for its computer and electronics industry, but there is an increasing level of chemical industry in the area, often sponsored by the IDA.  The south side of Cork is also famous for its massive concentration of chemical industry.  Because of the poor nature of our roads infrastructure, many major national routes still pass through or around small provincial towns.  The Bill is opportune given the increasing concerns many citizens have in regard to pollution and the possibility of dangerous accidents.</P>
    <P>What regulations apply to the rail service? When I was carrying out research for the purposes of this debate, I could not find any relevant directives in this regard.  The international maritime dangerous goods code covers sea transport, but what rules apply to carriage by rail, especially in the light of projected new investment for Iarnród Éireann and its possible involvement in the transport of goods, including perhaps some toxic goods?  The Minister also referred to air travel. <Col N="1308" /> I represent a constituency situated very close to our major airport.  Huge amounts of freight are being carried over centres of population, such as Portmarnock, Coolock and so on.  How can we protect those citizens?  The protection of citizens and workers must be a key concern.</P>
    <P>In general, the Labour Party welcomes the Bill and the fact it meets the requirements of the ADR and European Directives 94/55/EC and 95/50.  We welcome the adjustment of domestic law to take account of the higher requirements of ADr. Extra responsibilities have been conferred on the Garda in recent years in regard to traffic management and the blitz against dangerous criminals.  We may impose a further burden on them by asking them to enforce this legislation. The Minister may wish to address that issue.  I welcome the establishment of a comprehensive set of regulations which will ensure Irish vehicles meet the highest criteria in this industry which is vital to our economic success.</P>
    <P>I was not aware developments in the area of driver training testing had occurred as swiftly as the Minister outlined.  He referred to the new systems of training and certification which have been put in place since 1992 and to the 1997 statutory instrument.  Some 5,000 Irish drivers hold the necessary certificates at this stage.  I welcome that because in the past bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland expressed concerns about the level of ability and engineering knowledge drivers required to protect themselves and others.  High quality training is the key in this area and any further development is to be welcomed. I do not know if a specific formal training course will be available under the new regulations the Bill will introduce.  Some of the information received from the industry indicates a lack of standardisation in the level of training drivers are receiving.</P>
    <P>Annex A outlines a wide range of goods which will be tested.  Oil spillages also pose a threat.  To what extent are they covered by the Bill?  I presume it is covered in the full annexe on the file before me.</P>
    <P>On the question of the haggling over costs which has been going on in the interdepartmental committee which has met on this over a number of years, we are told there will be no costs of real significance and that perhaps 3,000 to 5,000 vehicles and drivers may be affected.  I wonder if that view can be reconciled with the current role of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  I wonder as well, if there is not a further role for Enterprise Ireland or the old Forbairt in the testing and checks which are necessary in this regard.  I understand they used to carry these out on a contract basis for various companies in relation to road vehicles and air travel. It is unbelievable, with the current crisis in health and safety administration here, that we are giving the chalice to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health because it seems that over the past year and a half the health and <Col N="1309" /> safety performance of Irish industry has seriously deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures, some of which were included in the report of the health and safety authority the other day, there appears to be a pattern developing of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment not conveying reports and information immediately to Opposition spokespersons and Deputies.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department but perhaps he might carry the matter to Government. I raised it with the Taoiseach about six months ago.  I refer particularly to the 1977 report on health and safety about which there was significant publicity last week and which still has not arrived on my desk or on Deputy Owen's desk either.  This is the fourth or fifth report we have awaited only to see it published in a sudden press release on a Sunday or not presented in a credible way.  Perhaps that does not happen in the Department of Public Enterprise.  I hope not.  It has happened in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on a very consistent basis.</P>
    <P>From the press releases and from the speeches of the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, we can see there is a serious crisis in health and safety administration here.  Between 1992 and 1997 accidents in industry increased by about 18 per cent. Since 1996 the accident rate has gone up by 14 per cent.  If one looks at the rate per 100,000 employees over the past nine years, the rate has gone from 1,268 accidents in 1996 to 719 per 100,000.  That is a very significant increase. Despite that increase the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Harney, are prepared to give only the princely total of 13 extra staff for occupational health and safety and to boost the inspection staff to something like 130 to 140, which is still a very small inspectorate.  I wonder how the extra work which the Minister is now transferring to the health and safety authority can possibly be carried out with such meagre resources.</P>
    <P>It is probably unnecessary to mention the catastrophes in the construction industry relating to a number of deaths on sites in Dublin and on small sites around the country which were raised on several occasions in this House on the Order of Business.  Our colleagues in SIPTU, particularly the secretary, Eric Fleming, have fought a courageous battle in raising this issue during the summer and early autumn and seeking fundamental extra resources.  Opposition Deputies can ask the Minister for the resources, but the only people who can allocate extra resources are Ministers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister probably knows, I hope in the next week or so to publish a health and safety Bill on behalf of the Labour Party which, since I cannot introduce a money Bill to bring in extra resources, will seek to immensely improve safety and standards in relation to the construction industry by building health and safety plans into local authority planning permissions.  In other <Col N="1310" /> words, before permission will be granted there will have to be an outline plan on how a site will be conducted.  I will also demand that the appointment of safety representatives will be compulsory.</P>
    <P>Most disappointing of all, the penalties here for non-compliance are too soft.  The spot fine of £150, which I know can be increased, seems derisory in relation to the value of loads carried on some of these giant vehicles.  The summary fine of £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment seems very little.  In my Bill I hope to introduce an unlimited fine and a jail sentence of up to ten years.  The Minister might look again at that in his Bill to see if he could bring in serious fines and penalties.  A previous Minister in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, said in one of her speeches a couple of years ago that it would not do to bring in these regulations on a wing and a prayer.  The key is enforcement, and the Government must be prepared to bear the cost of that.  I ask the Minister to look at that again.</P>
    <P>To go back to the major incident in Glasnevin, which was referred to on a couple of occasions here tonight, has the Minister considered the strategies that are necessary for local government to deal with a disaster in this area whether in relation to the carriage of dangerous substances by road, rail, air or otherwise?  I know we have a peacetime emergency plan and the Civil Defence, but I am not sure to what extent those plans have been reviewed in recent years and made more effective.  Representing a highly industrialised area on the north side of Dublin, I am concerned, as are Deputies representing the south side of Cork, to know how we will react if, despite everything we have done to make transport of these substances as safe as possible, there is an accident. Will there be any reference in the various annexes attached to this document to the kind of emergency plan that should be in existence?  We are not talking of something that is extremely unlikely to happen because in my constituency and in the neighbouring Dublin North constituency there have been a few serious accidents where insulation made of plastic went on fire or where trucks crashed and significant fires resulted, and evacuations had to be carried out.  I presume it is another Department that is responsible for this area, but it is something which we are concerned about and the Government might look at it again.</P>
    <P>At the moment all our local authorities, Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and others around the country are making new development plans for the next five years in the various counties and county boroughs.  It would be useful to have a strategic environment assessment built into those plans to take account of the routes through our constituencies and the various concentrations of industry and their relationship to housing.  I live in a highly industrialised zone with industry on three sides of the part of the constituency in which I live.  While myself and other local <Col N="1311" /> representatives, such as the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, obviously welcomed industry to such locations over the years, the sheer concentration of industry now presents its own difficulties. We should try to embody in the planning process some of the principles which the Minister is rightly imposing on the transport industry in this Bill.  Will the Minister be liaising with local authorities on this matter?  Will he ask them to embody this in the development plans for places such as Dublin city and Fingal?</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the Minister could look again at the issue of penalties.  However, in general terms, I welcome the Bill which the Labour Party will be delighted to support.  I have raised a number of issues.  It is unfortunate that the Bill's gestation and preparation was such a lengthy process and that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not in the Chamber because she will be responsible for its implementation and the cost of its enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Minister should convey to the Government the feeling on much of the Opposition benches that more resources must be spent on the health and safety area; for example, there is a cost/benefit relationship between good safety practice in business and higher output.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, mentioned recently that 16,000 or 18,000 jobs are lost through people being injured in accidents at work.  There is a clear correlation between saving some money in the long term and taking action now by investing real money in health and safety.  I hope when I have the opportunity in the coming months to present my own health and safety Bill that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the Tánaiste will not as usual throw out the Bill but will embrace it and seek to build it into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on the derogations, penalties and rail transport.</P>

It is a bit Irish to blame the Government for everything.</P>

      <P>The irony is that last Friday the Fine Gael candidate in the Cork South Central by-election and his leader, Deputy John Bruton, introduced a fantastic traffic plan for Cork which was going to solve all the problems.  However, they stole the plan of Cork Corporation and Bus Éireann which we debated in the Select Committee on Public Enterprise last Thursday.</P>
      <P>They were able to tell us we have buses which are 11 and 14 years old.  I have mentioned this in the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and sought £7.5 million for Bus Éireann in Cork.  Fine Gael came up with a fantastic plan but the 14 year old buses were 13 years old when that party was in power.  However, we refuted that and were able to solve it quite easily in the media, with the result that the corporation will not be launching its plan until well after the by-election.</P>
      <P>I welcome the EU directive and the ADR provisions which are now being encompassed in one set of regulations.  ADR also covers the carriage of petroleum chemicals and explosives.</P>
      <P>I am worried about certain sections and I hope the Minister will consider my comments in regard to them.  Matters such as the type, approval and testing of transport equipment are still outstanding for the industry generally, although the Irish petroleum industry association has introduced a scheme for vehicle testing and examination. However, there is a need &mdash; I did not see the Minister's speech before I came into the House but I note his reference to this &mdash; for a national approved scheme and the appointment of testers. We did not appoint qualified testers up to now to carry out that type of testing for such vehicles.</P>
      <P>Consignors are responsible for selecting carriers who meet all the criteria for the carriage of dangerous substances.  How can they ensure the equipment used meets the requirements if we do not have in place a proper national testing scheme, which in my opinion we have not had up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Members referred to the general shortage of trained, certified drivers and approved training course providers.  This aspect needs urgent attention and consideration should be <Col N="1313" /> given to grant aiding the industry in this regard. There are insufficient training courses available for specialised drivers and specialists in the carriage of dangerous goods.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill we will have four inspectors who will be responsible for monitoring the regulations. What criteria will be used to select those inspectors and what formal training qualifications and, more important, experience levels will they require?  Will four inspectors be enough, given there are about 30,000 goods vehicles here which are more than 3.5 gross vehicle weight, although they are not all involved in the carriage of dangerous goods?</P>
    <P>The industry has lost many experienced people through early retirement and they have not been replaced because of the need by operators to curtail expenditure.  For example, most of the petroleum companies have contracted out their haulage and no longer have the in-house trainers, inspectors or examiners which they would have if they had their own fleet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates is right that general rates for road transport give an exceptionally low return for the investment in vehicles and staff, together with the ongoing implications of legislation.  Rates are low and it will be difficult for operators to achieve proper standards with low returns on investment.  Grant aid should be available.</P>
    <P>Much work is done by transport institutes in the field of education and standards for operators but this is done on a voluntary basis by concerned people who do not get proper recognition for their efforts.  For example, the Institute of Road Transport Engineers is doing a tremendous job in Dublin and Munster in training operatives in the technical knowledge and skills required for the carriage of dangerous substances; the Chartered Institute of Transport and the Institute of Motor Industry are also carrying out very important functions.</P>
    <P>There is a wide disparity of responsibilities for an inspector under the Bill and its proposed regulations. Must that person be an inspector of road vehicles?  Must he be a road transport engineer with a mechanical or motor engineering qualification? Will he have to be qualified in chemicals, documentation and safety procedures?  Who will train him?  What structures are we putting in place to ensure the inspectors are trained and that we will have competent people to examine all relevant vehicles?  There is a need for a more specialised, managerial-type course for vehicle operators, with specific emphasis on dangerous substances.  We also need a higher qualification than the basic certificate of professional competence or CPC, which is a 12 week course administered by the CIT.  The Institute of Road Transport Engineers, of which I am a member, runs a three year course whose syllabus covers dangerous substances, which is taught through Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with vehicles with a defect notice in respect of the carriage of dangerous substances. The vehicle should carry a prohibition <Col N="1314" /> notice until the faulty equipment is repaired, replaced or removed.  The ADR certificate for the vehicle should encompass this requirement.  I hope the technical officers in the Department will look at that proposal.</P>
    <P>Section 17 covers the type, approval, testing, examination and certification of equipment; part of that is in existing legislation but the matter needs to be addressed because no one in the State is doing it yet.  Will the Minister ensure that qualified people carry out this function?  The on-the-spot fine of £150 should be more substantial, particularly for hauliers from other countries.  If they are in contravention of the regulations, they could carry up to 40 tonnes of dangerous substance and be fined only £150 on the spot.  That is not good enough and I agree with Deputy Broughan that we should re-examine the fines.  A foreign ship which contravened our laws in our fishing zone would receive a huge fine.  These goods are extremely dangerous to our citizens and we should ensure our roads are safe by imposing larger fines as a deterrent to those who might break the regulations.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of technical points of concern to the Minister and I hope he will be able to answer them.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister of State for bringing forward this comprehensive legislation which seeks to give effect to the EU Directives.  This reminds me of my time in the Department of Labour in the 1980s, when we introduced the regulations governing the carriage and control of dangerous substances.  The complex problem has existed for a long time and is at a critical stage of development.  Perhaps the Minister can respond to my points on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the streamlining of the regulations and of the organisations with responsibility in this area, as this will provide a clear cut and comprehensive set of rules.  How long will it take to put the regulations in place?  It can sometimes take ten to 15 years after enabling legislation such as this is introduced before the detailed regulations are put before the House.  I am aware this is a complex area but the safety of people on the public highways is critical, which is why I want to know what timespan is envisaged for the completion of the regulations, after consultation with the various organisations in this area.  Perhaps it could also be indicated whether the haulage associations have been in consultation with the Department in this respect.  Various Departments have had responsibility for this at different times and it is good to see the Bill now before the House and the regulations being prepared.  Judging by the Minister's speech, the regulations are on the way to being finalised but perhaps it could be indicated when it is hoped to have them completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A raft of regulations is already in place.  Where do these stand and will they be revised to bring them into conformity with the new regulations? <Col N="1315" /> There are regulations concerning size and nature of signs on vehicles and these signs can be complicated, particularly when there is an accident and people who are not professionals in the area may need to determine quickly what action is required to deal with a vehicle.  For instance, if a vehicle containing dangerous substances runs into difficulty, drivers and people using the roads should be able to see the signs and take speedy action to deal with a problem.  Sometimes, however, it is not possible to see these signs.  I regularly drive on busy roads and cannot make out signs on vehicles carrying petroleum, etc.  It is critical that this is dealt with effectively at a time when the number of accidents is increasing and people are being killed and injured on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I compliment the inspectorate which has covered this area &mdash; with small resources and limited staff they have put in place an effective regime.  They often flag down lorries on dual carriageways to check that their papers are in order with the regulations.  It is important that this be re-examined in the training of personnel not only for this work but for all those going on to the roads.  It baffles me why basic training in the rules of the road and driving instruction is not provided in secondary schools.  The new curriculum pays attention to day to day issues which people meet when they leave school or college, and one of the first things young people do is to drive cars or agricultural vehicles.  A young person aged 17 was killed in a motorcyle accident in my village last weekend.  It must be possible to give more training to people involved in this critical area, the carriage of lethal substances, because I do not think it is provided at present or that the Departments are paying as much attention to this as they should.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of controversy about this some years ago and Deputy O'Flynn will be aware of the difficulties with the carriage of dangerous substances through Cork city.  Every day, heavy vehicles carrying lethal substances travel our roads and a huge number of oil spills occur resulting in many tragic accidents.  It is important to keep our regulations and legislation up to speed with those in Europe where they are fairly well advanced.  It is equally important to make the point that the road network in Europe is, in many respects, superior to ours.  While it is important to keep our regulations and legislation up to date with EU directives, it is critically important that there is accelerated investment in the roads network, especially on roads carrying substances and vehicles such as those mentioned. It is time we examined whether lorries carrying the substances mentioned by the Minister should be permitted on roads which are not up to an appropriate standard and whether they should be assigned to roadways which meet the European standard and which would be capable of dealing with any accidents which might result.</P>
    <P>There should be no undue delay in putting the regulations together.  We should not have to wait <Col N="1316" /> four, five or six years to see these detailed regulations. An overall assessment of the existing regulations should be carried out to avoid overlap and duplication with the new ones.  We should endeavour to modernise and update safety signs and those set out in regulation, if necessary, or at least ensure they are better communicated to the public using the roads.  We should put in place a mechanism to train young drivers especially, to make them aware of their obligations and responsibilities, to make them better drivers and enable them to deal with situations so that we could avoid the tragedies we have seen on our roads in recent times.</P>

      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill. My party colleague, Deputy Yates, covered the technical end.  This is an EU agreement with which I, as a true European, believe we should go along.  One cannot help thinking about the meeting on the crisis in farming we attended where it appeared that the European Union is not as committed to applying the same rules and income base to everyone.  It is talking about taking away one quarter of funding from agriculture.</P>
      <P>The transport industry is extremely important to this country.  For my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan with a significant food industry, it is important for us to have quality transportation and regulation to enable us to get our products to European and world markets in an organised and proper fashion.  Some goods are not dangerous but others are.  The need for quick access from an island such as ours to the UK, to the Continent and further afield is essential.</P>
      <P>One cannot but mention freedom of movement. In recent years we saw delays caused by some UK farmers and by truckers in France.  I hope that when we agree to this regulation we also look at other regulations which are necessary to ensure such incidents do not happen again.  A number of previous speakers mentioned the essential training of drivers.  When one considers the number of people killed and the tragedies caused by larger vehicles, such as 40-foot containers, one realises the need for proper regulation not only in the movement of the product but also as regards the personnel, the driver behind the wheel of a lorry, which is a lethal vehicle, who should be properly trained.  The Department must look seriously at the need for proper training and a test within a reasonable period after training.  There are major delays in that regard in my area and were it not for possibilities across the Border, it might be more difficult to get drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear previous speakers mention grant aid.  For a long time I have looked for grant aid for the transport industry, especially as I live in a Border region where industry has had <Col N="1317" /> to compete with that north of the Border which has access to cheaper vehicles and has lower costs generally.  Thankfully, the diesel issue has changed recently.  The problems which our industry faced in terms of competing with Northern Ireland were significant.  The constituents I represent had no railroad and had to compete with areas which had CIE subsidised transport.  When I asked the Minister concerned about the level of funding different areas received from CIE I was told it was an independent body and I was not entitled to any information.  The Freedom of Information Act may rectify that matter.  There is a need for those involved in transport to have their own garage facilities in areas such as mine so that they may have their vehicles properly serviced at night.  Any aid towards that would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I refer to the list of dangerous substances which the Minister mentioned, including gases and flammable liquids.  My county has a large poultry industry and gas is constantly being transported to feed that industry.  The dangers of the transportation of gas in County Monaghan are more significant than in other parts of the country.  I do not apologise for mentioning the need for proper road structures.  It is all very well bringing in regulations but it is impossible to regulate for a road such as the N2 which goes around all the bends in County Monaghan from Lamoy Bridge to the County Louth border.  The N2 goes through towns such as Monaghan, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross. If a lorry transporting gas, or even straw for the mushroom industry, through Glaslough Street in Monaghan town caught fire, the damage would be enormous.</P>
    <P>Although it is not relevant to this Minister but to the Government, I use this opportunity to stress the need for a structure to allow transport such as this to go around Monaghan town rather than through it.  If something happened in Monaghan town, a fire brigade or ambulance would not be able to get to the vehicle.  God forbid that what happened in Omagh should happen in Monaghan because it would be ten times worse.  We are talking about explosives in this legislation which we, in the Border area, have lived close to for many years, although many did not appreciate that.  There is a need not only for this Bill but for proper road structures in counties such as Cavan and Monaghan whose railways were removed over 40 years ago. Successive Governments promised us that money would be re-allocated to make sure the roads were improved but this never happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This timely legislation attempts to address a problem which recently emerged as a result of an overheated property market, an unprecedented level of greed and profiteering by those in the building industry and paralysis on the part of the Government in the face of that crisis. Elements of the Bill will need to be addressed through amendments if it passes Second Stage.</P>
      <P>While a booking deposit is merely an indication of interest by a purchaser in a particular property, it is always accompanied by a verbal agreement to purchase, which is set aside by gazumping.  I accept that the motivations behind the Bill are well meaning.  I am glad to support it because I have met large numbers of home buyers, particularly young, first time buyers, who have been gazumped in the recent past.  It is nothing short of heartbreaking to see the disappointment and frustration of such buyers who invest hope and plans in a property and find they have been gazumped by a ruthless vendor.</P>
      <P>Gazumping is an unacceptable feature which has crept into our housing market.  Unscrupulous vendors are taking advantage of our housing shortage by abusing the notion of a booking deposit.  Until recently a booking deposit meant that the sale of a home was imminent and, indeed, in the past once a deposit had been placed the purchasers regularly engaged legal advice for arrangements to give notice for their current abode.  However, gazumping has broken the tradition of trust that has served the housing market well in the past.  There is need to put a safety net in place for purchasers, particularly at a time when housing is scarce.  People face huge difficulties when attempting to purchase a home. Young couples attempting to buy their first home have been driven out of the market as a result of high property prices and a housing shortage.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need to invest in new measures which will ease the pressure currently faced by first time buyers and those seeking public housing. This year the Government has a massive revenue surplus, which should be used in part to make a special allocation to local authorities.  This allocation would enable local authorities to establish land banks for housing development.  I envisage that sites could be released for the purpose of public and social housing and private development. The latter would be allowed access to the land bank on a restricted basis and only after satisfying specific conditions such as the advanced provision of amenities, compliance with safety and recreational requirements and a commitment to finish all work on the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public finds it incomprehensible that building costs and wages have risen by an amount that is only a fraction of the increase in affordable housing.  This leads to the inescapable conclusion <Col N="1319" /> that the take for those selling in the housing market is at an unacceptable level of exploitation.  It is calculated that the profit per unit since 1993 has risen from between £5,000 and £7,000 to between £25,000 and £30,000.</P>
    <P>There is also a crisis in the public and private rental sector.  There is need to devise a scheme of public and mixed development in the rental sector to provide affordable housing in response to this.  I urge the introduction of a time limit on residential zoning to relieve pressure on the housing market.  This would put an end to the practice of people who currently own such sites holding them for speculative purposes.  There should be a levy on such sites, which are abused for such purposes.</P>
    <P>There should also be a system of clawback in taxation of speculative gains.  The crisis is of such proportions that we cannot afford any wringing of hands.  While a commission to investigate every aspect of the housing problem is welcome it should not be used as an excuse for not introducing measures before the end of this year when we will have the highest revenue surplus in history. Action is required and the end of year surplus provides a unique opportunity of spending capital moneys in a way that would contribute to the relief of the housing crisis.  The advantage of such expenditure is that it would also contribute to economic growth and would be non-inflationary.</P>
    <P>The facts identified in the Bacon report are but one part of a most serious political challenge facing us.  How can we accept that two incomes are now insufficient to service a mortgage for a modest home; waiting lists for housing are heading for record levels; there is a shrinking public rental sector and a private sector that is driven by the speculation in the main housing market, raising the question of whether some rentals should be capped in line with the rise in inflation?</P>
    <P>Everybody awaits the Government response as the budget preparations and the Estimates discussions move to conclusion.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues in Government to consider the concerns and suggestions we have put before the House.  The economic boom means nothing if people cannot afford a house, something which was, in the past, considered to be part of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and compliment Deputy Hayes and his party for introducing it.  It is timely and opportune because unfortunately people who had an opportunity to regulate themselves have not done so and we must see whether it is amenable to a proposed statutory framework.  Action is needed on a number of fronts in regard to the housing crisis, which will present more difficult problems and obstacles in the years ahead.  While the Bill is undoubtedly in need of refinement &mdash; Deputy Hayes accepts that &mdash; one could not but be persuaded that its thrust is correct and that the practice of gazumping, which is prevalent, has left many young people in tears and misery.  The <Col N="1320" /> Government must realise there is a pressing need to address this problem and where voluntary selfregulation is not working the problem must be addressed and focused on by statute.</P>
      <P>I wish to address housing needs generally.  The problem is that people, even with two reasonable incomes, who could afford houses during bad times, cannot afford them now.  Many of them will be placed on the waiting lists of local authorities, which will escalate out of control.  We will then return to the bad old days when no local authority housing could be built.  There is a substantial revenue surplus this year and we have an obligation to send some of those moneys to local authorities, which are at the coalface in terms of ensuring people are provided with adequate and affordable housing.  It is opportune to make a special allocation to local authorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>I concur with the proposal put forward by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, that such an allocation should be utilised by local authorities to establish significant land banks which in turn could be utilised to make a major contribution to the supply of service sites for affordable housing.  Building costs and wages have risen by only a fraction of the increase in the selling price of houses.  One must conclude that exorbitant profiteering is taking place.  While it is recognised that risk takers are entitled to a profit, nobody is entitled to charge what they like and increases with such profit margins are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on us to explore all avenues to deal with the housing crisis and ensure young people are given the opportunity to make a start in life.  Rural depopulation and degeneration is a huge problem and I made a proposal a number of months ago which may help the overall problem. I asked the Minister for Finance to provide a once-off grant of £15,000 in the forthcoming budget to purchasers of unoccupied homes in rural Ireland.  Auctioneers were the first people to rubbish that proposal.  There are many vacant homes throughout the midlands and the west which were left by people who emigrated.  Many of them include small farms, and small farmers would be delighted to dispose of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A once-off grant of £15,000 with strings attached would be an appropriate way to deal with this.  It would bring people back to rural Ireland and eliminate planning permission problems which plague people in rural Ireland.  Everyone objects to new housing and local authorities do not want people to build in certain areas.  The houses to which I refer only need refurbishment. However, the grant should not be given to everybody because when grants were administered a number of years ago speculators built lovely houses but then disposed of them having been given a grant.  The grant should only be payable to purchasers who are committed to living in the dwelling for a minimum of seven years.  Should the property be sold within that time a proportionate sum of the grant would be repaid.  All grant applicants would be subject to income <Col N="1321" /> qualifying criteria to assess whether their need for a grant or assistance is genuine.  The rural areas, which would benefit from such a targeted scheme, would be clearly identified through an examination of the population drop between the 1991 and the 1996 Census of Population.  Such a targeted scheme would represent a positive development for rural regeneration and would arrest the slide of rural depopulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is fundamentally flawed. It has a range of constitutional and other legal defects and, if passed, it is likely it will create numerous and potentially serious practical difficulties. As the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, indicated last night, the fact that reservations were expressed by the Director of Consumer Affairs and various parties involved in the housing market about the approach proposed in the Bill is very telling.</P>
      <P>The Bill seems to represent a major incursion into the constitutionally guaranteed right to private property.  While it is valid to seek to address problems such as gazumping in the common good, there is a serious risk the courts would determine the Bill is an excessive attack on property rights, having regard to the nature of the problem.  We must remember that while occurrences of gazumping can create serious difficulties for some home buyers, it is not a widespread problem nor is it practised solely by vendors.  I have no knowledge of it happening in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the market falls, purchasers frequently engage in the practice.  The Bill displays a serious lack of balance and proportionality in failing to take due account of these facts.  This is particularly evident in the way it proposes to make the practice of gazumping a criminal offence with quite inappropriate penalties.</P>
      <P>Any genuine effort to address the issue of gazumping must also be based on a realistic understanding of the process of selling a property. The Bill displays considerable confusion in that regard.  It appears to give an impression that payment of a booking deposit is a preliminary agreement between the purchaser and the vendor whereas it is a fundamental principle of conveyancing law that a booking deposit gives a purchaser no legal interest and it does not commit the parties to a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt to impose unrealistic and artificial time limits is further evidence of the Bill's failure to take account of the realities involved in the process of the legal transfer of property.  The procedures involved in property transfer are <Col N="1322" /> designed above all to protect the interests of all parties concerned.  An ill-conceived measure which could result in short cuts being taken in investigations and in legal preparation is likely to operate to the detriment of the buyers and the sellers.  The Bill seeks to confer quasi-contractual status on the booking deposit process, but a consequence of that is the various legal and practical requirements involved in entering into a contractual relationship would also have to be satisfied at that stage.  The illogical consequence of this Bill is that the parties to a transaction would need to be in a position to make the type of legal and financial commitments at the booking deposit stage or very shortly afterwards which they are required now only to make much further down the line.</P>
    <P>The attempt in the Bill to confer unwarranted status on the booking deposit procedure is not only flawed on legal and practical grounds, but it could have the opposite effect to that intended. There is considerable danger that the Bill would result ultimately in an abandonment of the booking deposit system.  At one level it could be argued that if booking deposits were not taken, buyers would not be at the risk of being gazumped.  That is like saying if CIE did not publish a timetable, the buses would never be late.</P>
    <P>The system of booking deposits has worked quite well and has helped to provide an orderly method of property sale.  However, the fact that occurrences of gazumping arise indicates there is scope for improvement.  Two improvements could be made.  First, there is a considerable degree of misunderstanding among house buyers, especially first time buyers, about the status of booking deposits.  That is understandable given the extent of confusion about the matter in the Bill.  While it would not be a solution to the problem of gazumping, it would be helpful to provide prospective buyers with better information.  It should be made clear that payment of a booking deposit does not give the buyer a legal right to insist on completion of the transaction or any legal guarantee in relation to price.  Whether the provision of that type of information should be given statutory backing might be considered in the context of any examination by the Law Reform Commission, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy referred.</P>
    <P>A second and more important requirement is to implement arrangements to prevent abuses in the sale of houses, especially new houses, where the majority of cases of gazumping tend to occur. The approach being pursued by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to have a voluntary code of practice adopted by builders is the correct one at this stage.  This approach is appropriate given that the booking deposit procedure is informal and does not have contractual effect.  It is also appropriate having regard to the problems that would arise if we tried to impose blunt legislative measures to deal with this complex area of law.  I was encouraged by the progress report given by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on the formulation of a code of practice.  I look forward <Col N="1323" /> to such a system being in operation at an early date as it would help greatly to eliminate the problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from any specific measures to deal with gazumping, I hope we are seeing a cooling down in the housing market which should put an end to such practices.  I agree with Deputy Hayes and other Members that the level to which house prices have risen is a serious problem.  However, we have witnessed a concerted attempt to hype the issue in the run-up to the start of this Dáil session.  That was disingenuous given that most commentators in recent weeks reported a noticeable slowing down in the rate of house price increases.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my opposition to the Bill, which is ill-conceived and potentially damaging.  I support the practical measures taken by the Government to address the issue of gazumping and to restore order and balance to the housing market.</P>

      <P>The Bill represents at best a knee-jerk reaction by Fine Gael to the difficulties faced by some house purchasers in the recent overheated housing market.  As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, demonstrated last night, the Bill contains fundamental constitutional and other legal flaws.  The Bill is not legally feasible, it is unworkable in practice and it is grossly misleading for house buyers.  As the Minister pointed out, it is all hinged on the booking deposit procedure. It gives a false impression that the payment of a booking deposit gives a buyer some legal guarantee, but that is not the case.  The booking deposit is purely an informal arrangement and the attempt in the Bill to confer it with a status which it does not have is an exercise in delusion which will only compound the problems for house buyers. Fine Gael would serve house buyers far better by clarifying misconceptions in this regard, which can result in buyers being aggrieved, rather than perpetuating them by adding confusion to the legal process of house purchases.</P>
      <P>As the Minister remarked, while the practice of gazumping could hardly be categorised as a criminal offence, it is grossly unfair.  It is recognised that gazumping can become a feature of a rising property market.  There is no doubt that Ireland has a very strong and, up to recently, over-heated property market.  We need only consider what happened in Dublin last week when more than 150 apartments were sold.  When 50 were sold the remaining 100 went up by £10,000 per unit and they were purchased netting the developer £1 million.  It would serve us all far better if we were to exercise our minds and energy in trying to formulate a code of practice to address problems in this area rather than engage in a limited exercise in relation to the practice of gazumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House price inflation is not a recent phenomenon. Since 1995 house prices have risen steadily. That trend has potentially serious implications for <Col N="1324" /> the economy.  On taking office last year the Government immediately recognised there was a need for urgent action in this area and it quickly commissioned a detailed study of the problem.  A comprehensive examination of the housing market, the factors that are driving up house prices and the implications of various policy options was carried out by an independent economic consultants, Peter Bacon and Associates, who submitted an early report to the Government.  The Government's prompt response, &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo;, was published on 23 April and a special finance Bill to implement the fiscal measures was enacted shortly afterwards.  Seldom, if ever, has there been a more immediate and full response by any Government to such a report.</P>
    <P>Mr. Peter Bacon's analysis of the housing market highlighted the complex nature of the housing boom and the problems facing the Government in tackling house price inflation.  The study provided a detailed analysis of the factors behind house price inflation and a sound basis on which to formulate policies and address the situation as far as possible.</P>
    <P>A combination of economic growth, low interest rates and demographic factors are the main forces driving demand and the effect of these is being re-enforced by other factors, notably investor demand and price expectations. Added to this on the supply side, the land bank has been eroded faster than anticipated.  Infrastructural constraints in some areas were restricting developments and supply was also affected by other factors, such as relatively low Dublin densities and the effect of stamp duty levels on the second hand market.  A point was made earlier about planning permission, particularly in rural areas.  This has had a serious effect on housing and must be addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's action plan on housing contained a comprehensive package of measures to address these factors in an effective and balanced way.  The package addressed both supply and demand.  In the short-term it was essential to take immediate action to cool down excessive demand. However, the Government also recognised that this must be backed up by action to boost housing supply in the medium and long-term.  Both of these issues are provided for in the package of measures in addition to a third essential ingredient, action to improve the position of low income house buyers who have been badly hit by the cumulative effect of price rises over the preceding few years.</P>
    <P>Another area which should be examined is local authority housing lists.  These have grown in almost every constituency and much needs to be done in that area.  In the Kilkenny part of my constituency, 750 people are on the housing list but there will be only 45 house building starts this year.  This is not good enough.  In Carlow, there are 500 people on the list, but there will be only a similar number of house building starts.  This area is not being dealt with in the context of the <Col N="1325" /> efforts to solve the housing problem.  Perhaps we should start with the housing lists.</P>
    <P>The question of the affordability of housing has been correctly highlighted during the debate. Measures to assist first time buyers form a major element of the action being pursued by the Government in relation to house prices.  The package will benefit lower income buyers by helping to dampen price increases and restore better balance between supply and demand.  In addition, there are a number of specific measures in the package which are specifically designed to help improve the position of first time buyers, for example, removal of incentives for investors, stamp duty reductions and increased shared ownership limits over £20,000 for the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <P>The full effect of some of the measures will be seen only in the medium term, particularly those designed to promote housing supply.  The main indicator is trends in house prices and there are now signs that the Government's measures are having the desired effect as evidenced by views expressed by various commentators.  There has been some easing in house prices, speculative investors have been largely eliminated from the first time buyer end of the market and there are increasing numbers of second hand houses coming on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions.  This is particularly important because the single biggest factor affecting prices and the affordability of housing is the supply of houses on the market, both new and second hand.</P>
    <P>In terms of output of new houses, record levels of new house completions have been achieved in each of the past three years.  I am sure a new record will be set again this year, given the estimation of more than 40,000 units.  The proposed measures in relation to gazumping are not satisfactory in terms of the overall problem.  I support the views expressed by the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hayes is, if nothing else, eager and I am glad he introduced the Bill. It sends a certain signal to people who are concerned about gazumping, but a charitable interpretation of the Bill would be to regard it as a well intentioned if misguided effort to deal with one symptom of the problems that have arisen in the housing market in recent years.  When one considers the obvious flaws and impracticalities in the measure, one must conclude that it also bears the hallmarks of a hastily contrived publicity stunt.  This is most unfortunate because we are dealing with a real problem that some people, thankfully a small minority, have faced because of rising asset price values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hayes gave away the game last night when he said this is a political issue.  Clearly, a key motive in bringing forward the Bill is to make political capital from dramatising the problems and traumas affecting some home buyers who found themselves in the unfortunate situation of being out-bidded for a home.  The Opposition has <Col N="1326" /> tried in recent weeks to hype and politicise the issue of housing and house prices as well as the issue of infrastructure.  All these problems are related to the successful economy which successive Governments brought about.</P>
    <P>The issue of house prices is not primarily political. One only has to read the summary of the Bacon report to note that the fundamental factors are social and economic and they have been compounded by the lack of serviced land.  The lack of such land is the simple denominator which decides house prices.  Mr. Seán Lemass correctly said years ago that if serviced land is available, house prices will even out to a proper market level.</P>
    <P>If there is a political dimension to this issue, it is the failure of the previous Government to address the problem of house price escalation which grew weekly before its eyes and, in particular, its failure to do anything about the underlying supply factors.  This Government tackled that matter with the serviced land initiative soon after coming into office.  Already there are clear indications that the measures taken by the Government are having an effect in reducing the scale of price increases.  This is likely to become increasingly evident as the measures to boost supply, which have a longer timeframe, kick in.  This more than anything will help to eliminate distortions of the market that are manifested by abuses such as gazumping.  This, in conjunction with the action being pursued by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to have an effective code of practice implemented, will help to ensure that the practice of gazumping will be effectively eliminated.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, most of the issues have been covered by the Minister and the Minister of State.  It is clear from the response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that the Bill is defective on constitutional and other grounds and it is incapable of being rectified by way of amendment.  I remember a time when the Fine Gael Party could draw on a vast pool of resources in terms of lawyers and professional people to advise it.  It is surprising that the party for once has got the legal technicalities wrong.  That is deeply disappointing. Perhaps the lawyers are beginning to see sense and realise that there is not much point supporting the party.</P>
    <P>The State is constitutionally bound to protect the property rights of every citizen from unjust attack and, in the case of an injustice having been done, to vindicate those rights.  The Constitution also encompasses a guaranteed right to transfer specific items of property, such as a house or a plot of land.  The Bill would interfere with those rights.  Therefore, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and Deputy McGuinness pointed out, it is essentially constitutionally flawed.  Its purpose is political and it is unfortunate to reduce such an important issue to drama for political purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes little allowance for the fact that vendors and purchasers can have legitimate <Col N="1327" /> reasons for withdrawing from property transactions, such as changes in family or financial circumstances. It focuses on the problem of gazumping where the vendor takes advantage of a rising market to sell at a higher price to another buyer. However, when the market trend is in the opposite direction, the vendor will be in a vulnerable position.  We must be even-handed in our approach to this matter.  Buyers and sellers deserve to have their rights vindicated.</P>
    <P>All right minded people will sympathise with prospective house purchasers who find themselves gazumped.  I have received representations in my constituency on this issue and it is a deeply traumatic experience for people.  It is difficult to explain to people that a booking deposit does not equal a deposit.  This is the plain fact and there is no way to change it.  We must remember that incidents of gazumping represent only a tiny minority of sales, even in the context of the current electric sellers market.</P>
    <P>The old adage that hard cases make bad law is worth recalling during this debate.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that the most effective way of preventing the occurrence of gazumping is to remove the market conditions that allow it to happen and to implement a realistic and effective code of practice that will deal with the problem without creating a legal minefield.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that Deputy Hayes is a member of a local authority.  He and all Deputies who are members of local authorities should strongly support rezoning motions to make serviced land available to build houses.  In the past the Labour Party opposed rezoning in the city of Dublin in an almost ideological and orthodox manner.  We are now reaping the harvest of bad decision-making on its part.  It caused house prices in Dublin to escalate.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have highlighted the problems with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The housing market is strong.  In many respects we are paying for the baby boom of the 1970s. Many of that generation are now setting up their own homes, perhaps having returned from abroad.  Why did the demographic experts tell us that this would happen or we did not listen?  We were caught unprepared.</P>
      <P>This legislation would tie everybody's hands.  In some instances it is the purchaser who drags his or her feet in closing a deal and in others it is the seller.  The legislation, therefore, may not have the desired effect.  Despite what others may say, many builders are decent and members of the association.  The best approach is for the association to voluntarily set its own standards and out-law practices such as this by agreement.</P>
      <P>The housing market is in difficulty.  The measures taken by the Government following the publication of the Bacon report have been effective. From the figures produced by the Department and estate agents the problem has not got worse since May or June.  It is a question of supply and demand.  There is no doubt that insufficient serviced land was available on which to build houses.  Certain parties opposed rezoning in every instance on ideological grounds, introducing a form of social apartheid.</P>
      <P>I will not mention any names but in recent months there has been much hype on the part of estate agents.  I am not referring to the glamorous properties about which one reads on the property pages every Thursday and Friday but one estate agent has been pretending they have received bids.  They would not get away with this in normal market conditions but they have been able to cash in.  In current market conditions many people have become greedy.</P>
      <P>There is no simple solution to the problem. There are 5,000 to 6,000 refugee families in the city.  This has an effect on the private rental market. Local authority housing lists have also lengthened.  While there has been much emotive talk about young couples, they are not on local authority housing lists.  Twenty five out of 27 houses allocated to date by Dublin Corporation in a new estate have been allocated to lone parents. If I was to visit that estate next week or next month, I know I would not come across 25 houses which did not have a man in them.  We are being made look like fools.  Local authorities are not securing proper rents to maintain properties.</P>

      <P>Many people in my constituency are glad that the size of the lotto jackpot has been increased as it is the only way they will be able to afford to buy a house in Dún Laoghaire.  Even if one did manage to win the jackpot there were times in the past year when one would not have <Col N="1329" /> been able to afford to buy some of the houses on sale.  Former council houses are now selling for £120,000 putting them beyond the reach of the average couple.  An apartment of less than 930 square feet has been advertised for sale today at a price of £250,000.  I, therefore, share the concerns which have been expressed.  The numbers on the local authority list and the homeless list in Dún Laoghaire are heading towards 2,000.  Where local authority houses are vacated money should be provided from an emergency fund to finance their immediate renovation.  We should not allow them to be vandalised or fall derelict.</P>
      <P>The rent supplement does not go anywhere near facilitating those families who have to rent private accommodation for which they are being forced to pay up to £600 per month.  We are all concerned about families with young children who are seeking to build a home and community rather than invest.  While gazumping is an immoral practice, for legal and constitutional reasons we cannot accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>The banks and financial institutions are largely to blame for the spiralling costs.  The price of a house bears no relationship with the cost of the materials used or the value of the land.  In advancing large loans the banks and financial institutions are determining prices which are being hiked to unrealistic values.  The banks and financial institutions are treating young couples in the 1990s in the way they treated small farmers in the 1980s. Often the same branch offered different amounts to farmers to bid against each other for the same patch of land.  This ensured modest prices were replaced by exorbitant prices.  The banks and financial institutions are throwing outlandish sums of money at young couples, ignoring the true value of the house and their ability to repay.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the reduction of 0.5 per cent in interest rates, if the banks and financial institutions, which are holding the market to ransom, were prepared to say that a particular house was worth only £90,000, not £190,000, and that they would only advance that amount, the house would not be put up for sale at the higher price. I will not blame them for all the problems in relation to housing but it is their fault that we now have a situation where a modest semi-detached house costs the same as a small castle would have cost a decade ago.  This issue should be dealt with on a wide scale but I share the concerns expressed in Deputy Hayes's Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Hayes's Bill which I will support and I congratulate him on bringing it before the House.  The Bill is a reflection of the serious crisis that exists with regard to housing.  A number of Government speakers <Col N="1330" /> decried any suggestion that this might be a political issue.  Housing is a political issue because irrespective of the causes of the housing crisis, the Government is failing to deal with it.  The programme for Government states:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to the deeply held ideal of so many Irish people &mdash; home ownership.  We believe, and our policies reflect, our commitment to providing a suitable standard of accommodation for all our people.</P>
      <P>That is the declaration of the current Government. There is no other area of Government policy and administration which has been such an abysmal failure.  This Fianna Fáil-PD Government is presiding over and responsible for the worst housing crisis for at least 30 years.  This is the Government which is making home owner-ship a luxury.  This is the Government which is telling the young generation, whose efforts, energy and enterprise are making this economy what it is, that they will now have to rent rather than buy.</P>
      <P>Housing has now replaced unemployment as the country's worst social problem.  While the Government trumpets the country's economic successes and the property pages of the newspapers get increasingly excited about the so-called strength of the property market, more and more families and young workers are becoming increasingly frustrated and bitter about their inability to put a roof over their heads.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the history of the State, a young teacher married to a nurse cannot afford to buy a home in this city.  Unable to buy, they are confronted with rents of £600 to £700 per month for a modest flat or house.  Young workers, students and others who have traditionally rented accommodation can no longer afford the rents now being demanded for an ever-declining supply.</P>
      <P>More and more families are being pushed into applying for council housing.  There are now more than 40,000 applicants on council housing waiting lists, the largest number on such waiting lists in over 20 years.  In addition, there has been an explosion in homelessness.  More evictions are now taking place in the country's traditional flatland than occurred during the land war in Michael Davitt's time over 100 years ago.  Evicted tenants, young families forced out of their homes and returning emigrants are now clogging the health board homeless hostels and bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government seems to be almost unaware of this problem.  It certainly appears to be uncaring and paralysed as far as action is concerned. Time and again the Taoiseach, and the Minister with responsibility for housing last night in this House, replied that they are implementing the Bacon report.  Surely they know by now that the Bacon report is not the answer to the housing crisis.  It may have addressed the distortion of the market by large scale investment buying, but it is <Col N="1331" /> not a substitute for Government policy and it is unfair to Mr. Bacon and his associates to suggest that it is.  They were asked to examine a particular aspect of the market.  They did that and produced a good report, although the Government did not implement all of the recommendations in the report.  It is unfair to Mr. Bacon and his associates to attach to their report responsibility which should rest with the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government is now 15 months in office and to date it has not produced any coherent policy to address the housing crisis.  The measures taken on foot of the Bacon report have done more to help and further subsidise builders than to help home buyers or families on the waiting lists.  Urgent action is now needed.  The first action needed because of the numbers on the housing lists is to increase substantially the money available for local authority housing.  At a minimum, in this year's Estimates there should be a doubling of the starts which will take place in 1999.  There must also be reform of the shared ownership scheme and other schemes to assist people to buy a home of their own.  There should be greater flexibility in its use and a widening of eligibility designed to enable people purchase a home for the first time.</P>
    <P>We need major reform of the housing construction industry to take account of planning, land speculation and the cyclical nature of the industry. I want to nail the lie about supply of land being the problem.  An aspect of construction which has received little attention is that the construction industry in the housing area is at capacity.  It is almost impossible to get a builder or a tradesman in this city, so regardless of the amount of land a person has or where it is serviced, there seems to be a limit on what the industry can cope with.</P>
    <P>There is need for some structural reform of the industry to eliminate some of the cyclical nature of it.  In some years there is little or no activity and building workers are on the dole while in a boom period prices go through the roof.  The Government should discuss that problem with the construction industry and devise methods of intervention to ensure a stable housing construction industry and a more stable market.</P>
    <P>The regulations in the private rented sector already in place need to be enforced.  New legislation is necessary to provide security of tenure for tenants in the private rented sector and there must be some control of house prices.  It is outrageous that while the cost of building is increasing by only 3 or 4 per cent per year, the price of new houses is increasing by 25 or 30 per cent. At a minimum, the Government should show its intent that it is serious about tackling the housing crisis by accepting Deputy Hayes's Bill which deals with one particular aspect of the crisis.  It is time we had a comprehensive policy on housing from the Government and some proposals were brought before this House to deal with the problem in its totality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Hayes on bringing forward the Bill.  Currently there are 2,000 people on the housing waiting list in Wick-low. During the current housing boom, house prices have increased by 140 per cent in the county.  That is unequalled anywhere in the country. Many theories have been put forward as to the reason for this and there is an element of truth in all of them.  In a free market it is difficult to fault the producer of a product for seeking the maximum price.  Indeed, anyone selling their house privately will look for the optimum take and no matter how Christian we think we are or the claim we may lay to having a social conscience, I have yet to encounter a man or woman who will undersell their property.  As developers and builders squeeze the market for as much as they can, so too will the numerous individuals who purchase from plans and sell on before the building is completed.</P>
      <P>In refusing to accept what the proposer of the Bill referred to as a small measure to assist the consumer, the Government has placed self-pride and arrogance above the needs of people seeking to purchase a home.  In his contribution, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, referred to the fact that the Bacon report stated that the practice of the phased release of new developments, where this approach is used to ratchet up prices, the return of booking deposits and the subsequent gazumping of prices and instances of excessive staged payments is not widespread.  If the Minister of State drives around Knocknacarra and Rahoon over the weekend and reads the advertising hoardings, he will see that they all refer to phase 1, 2, 3 and so on.  He should take the trouble to ring the various estate agents to check the prices of each phase, and as a final exercise he could ask the new homeowners if they feel there should be legislation on gazumping.  Can the Minister hazard a guess as to the reply?</P>
      <P>Governments should make laws for society's good and not to satisfy certain sectional interests. The Minister went on to outline several reasons he could not accept the Bill, mentioning concerns expressed to his Department by mortgage lending and auctioneering interests.  He mentioned the possible implications for family law, yet he also stated that he did not want to totally exclude the possibility of there being scope for action in the legislative area.  Can we take it that he may bring forward a Bill similar to this?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform used Article 43.1.2º, which encompasses a guaranteed right to transfer specific items of property, as the main reason for not accepting the Bill.  He said the Bill would interfere with those rights.  However, if the Minister had continued to read Article 43, he would have seen that Article 43.2.1º states:</P>
      <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Article 43.2.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court judgment in 1957 in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Southern Industrial Trusts case referred to Article 43, private property rights and the assessment of what the common good required.  That judgment stated that those were &ldquo;matters primarily for the consideration of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; Mr. Justice Kenny, in the case of the Central Dublin Development Association <i>v.</i> the Attorney General in 1970, stated that, among other things, when dealing with these Articles the exercise of these rights ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice.  He also stated that the State may, accordingly, by law restrict their exercise with a view to reconciling this with the demands of the common good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes' Bill has sought to apply the principles of social justice and to reconcile their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. Unlike the Minister, who chooses to hide behind the Constitution, he gave full consideration to the constitutional parameters.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for bringing this Bill before the House and I commend him for his work on it.  It is timely, as we have a serious problem in this area.  This Government is failing.  It is failing to deal with the crisis in agriculture; it is failing to deal with the crisis in the health service, where waiting lists are growing by the day; and it is failing to deal with the traffic situation, not just in Dublin but all over the country. It does not surprise me that the Government will now fail to deal with the problem of gazumping.</P>
      <P>The Government is a failure.  It cannot manage the current prosperity, and the job of the Government is to manage.  Deputy Hayes' Bill is full of common sense, which is lacking on the Government side.  The Minister is relying on laws going back to 1695 and earlier.  The statute of fraud was mentioned; we know who the frauds are.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach has been a milky, watery one.  The Minister said it was important to be flexible, but what he means is that he is procrastinating.  He wants to do nothing and is the champion of mediocrity.  The Minister mentioned a voluntary code.  How does he expect people to adopt a voluntary code when, as Deputy Hanafin said, they can make millions of pounds in profits by adding zeros to the price of property?  How does he expect people to say: &ldquo;We will give all this up and adhere to a voluntary code&ldquo;?  Things do not work like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is hiding behind the consultant's report.  The consultant did a good job, but the Government also has a job.  The country cannot be run by consultants.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform huffed and puffed last night and said that we cannot always punish <Col N="1334" /> bad behaviour by using criminal sanctions.  The behaviour was called immoral and reprehensible, but the Minister for zero tolerance does not want to do anything to stop it.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies have spoken all night about the crisis in housing; there are 40,000 people on the waiting lists, but there are local authority houses in east Cork boarded up.  Why? People are crying out for houses.  Why are housing officers not carrying out inspections?  Why is there a huge outcry about waiting lists?  People do not know where they stand on waiting lists because there is no transparency.</P>
    <P>Agencies are starved of resources.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has asked for statutory penalties to stop gazumping.  The IAVI has stated that legislation should be amended to stop gazumping.  Not all vendors will adhere to a voluntary code, though some might.  A code of practice was tried in England, but it failed.  I ask the Government to cut out the red tape.  Government Deputies have spoken of having to carry out surveys and get documents prepared.  What is wrong with that?  Let that be done before a house goes on the market.  Why does a buyer have to wait until afterwards?  The thrust of this Bill is that a seller will have to have his house in order, if one pardons the pun, to put his house on the market. Everything would have to be ready; he would have to have his surveys done and his deeds sorted out.  Why can we not do this?  It would prevent gazumping.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the Bill at this eleventh hour so that we can discuss this on Committee Stage.  The Bill is not as flawed as the Government side thinks.  I think it did not even read it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very appropriate that it is one of our few young Deputies, Deputy Hayes, who is introducing this Bill.  He speaks for thousands of young people who cannot even aspire to buying their own houses in the most buoyant economy we have ever experienced.  This is very serious, because the economic and social fabric of our society is being seriously damaged when the most basic constitutional unit of the State &mdash; the family &mdash; is under such pressure and insecurity.  It is extraordinary that so many of the obstacles the Government has found in the way of accepting the Bill are constitutional in nature.  Is private property once again taking a higher position than the family's position as the basic unit of society? The family unit is considered one of the most important factors in the achievement of the common good.  Yet this unit is under serious pressure, particularly when it comes to young people who wish to marry, set up house and create the future of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be rejoicing in that we can invite educated, skilled people back to join our work-force after the haemorrhages of emigration, but they cannot be accommodated.  Those couples who have put together the finance necessary to buy a house face a market whose prices and business <Col N="1335" /> practices are out of control.  Members from all sides of the House have stated that profit margins on house building are immorally high and that couples are being held to ransom.  We, as legislators, must examine this.  If we have an immoral society which, on a profit level, works against the rights of people, we have a responsibility to examine that.  It is not good enough to reject the Bill as being fundamentally flawed without offering anything in its place.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to put the housing crisis in context.  Not alone has the price of houses and rents gone beyond the scope of many people, but it has not been linked to the difficulties experienced by couples with children who have bought houses and are attempting to pay their mortgages.  We do not have a high quality child care support system even though both parents are forced to work.  The heaviest burden falls on women who juggle home, work and child minding responsibilities to meet mortgage and child care costs.  Such couples are caught in a double bind in that they have little chance of buying a house and, when they do manage to buy one &mdash; usually at a cost of huge insecurity as highlighted by Deputy Hanafin &mdash; they do not have the choice of one partner staying at home, of flexible work structures or even good child minding facilities to enable both of them to work outside the home. This is crucial because it is part of the social and economic context in which the housing crisis must be seen.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Hayes on raising this matter, if only in one specific but serious area. What he and all Members of the House want is a properly planned national programme which takes account of the social and economic demands of the most vulnerable people in the country, young couples and their young children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.  I must declare that I have a vested interest in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to this problem has been to commission the Bacon report and implement part of its recommendations which has taken investors out of the market.  That may have reduced the price of houses, although I do not believe it has.  It has certainly increased rents by up to £80 per month for families renting houses and the same percentage increase applies to apartments and flats.  That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last night that not every problem can be solved with legislation.  In Opposition, he complained that not enough legislation was introduced. Six or eight months ago, I introduced a Bill on the licensing of bouncers and he could not accept it.  He said it was not the right thing to do. <Col N="1336" /> All we are trying to do with this Bill is to protect young people who are finding it very difficult to buy homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing spent most of his time talking about people selling houses, second hand houses in particular. I have not witnessed anyone gazumping a second hand house.  Would the Government get real?  It is new houses which are being gazumped. This is happening to people who have paid an initial deposit and who find, because of demand, the contract is not sent to them, the deposit is returned and the house costs £10,000 more.  I know a number of people to whom this has happened. I heard this evening of a couple who were trying to buy an apartment in town, went to lunch to consider whether they would buy it and returned to find it cost £10,000 more.  Admittedly, no deposit was paid.</P>
    <P>Will the Government ensure that when a deposit is paid on a house, the price of that house cannot increase?  I work for builders and have made it clear that under no circumstances would I gazump the price of a house on a person if I took a deposit at a certain price.  Every person in my business should give the same commitment to the young people with whom they deal.</P>
    <P>The price of land is being blamed for the increase in the price of houses.  The Government took certain actions which have done nothing to reduce the cost to the first time buyer.  Young couples cannot afford to buy houses, even at £87,500, the price at which we were selling them in Navan a month ago.  A number of them were finding it difficult to raise the money required to obtain mortgages.  A similar house in Dublin would cost £20,000 more.  The Government has failed young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Hayes on producing the Bill, which is a worthwhile and important measure.  I listened with interest to, and read carefully, the speeches of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made in the House last night.  They were an utter disgrace.  Every objection raised to the provisions of the Bill is either spurious or shows such a lack of understanding of the way property law works in reality as to fall well below the standards one would expect from a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Farrelly, I have a vested interest in this area.  I am a partner in a law firm which undertakes a great deal of conveyancing The Bill was carefully examined in the context of its provisions and I have no doubt it is workable.  It may require a few amendments, but has there ever been a Bill produced by a Minister on a law reform issue which has not ultimately required amendments prepared by his Department?  It is an utter disgrace to trot out the adage that the Bill is fatally flawed.  This phrase has been used on a repetitious basis over the past 18 years in the House by Ministers who take the view that an <Col N="1337" /> Opposition Bill in their political area in some way challenges their ministerial masculinity.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In his speech, the Minister, Deputy Molloy, stated that a code of practice approach is favoured by the Law Society.  I challenge him to produce a letter from the Law Society, which represents solicitors in this country, objecting to the Bill, stating it is opposed to it and that it favours a code of practice instead.  The committee of the Law Society, which is considering the provisions of the Bill, has reached no conclusions on it.  The Minister deliberately misled the House as to its position.  The speech delivered last night by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated that not only would the Bill constrain vendors, it would impose equal constraints on purchasers.  That is an utter misrepresentation of the contents of the Bill.  It imposes no constraints on purchasers.  It is designed to ensure that purchasers are not gazumped.</P>
    <P>I predict that this Bill will suffer the same fate as other Private Members' Bills which have produced the knee-jerk reaction of Government-Opposition, based on fictitious objections.  I guarantee that within six months of this Bill being voted down by the Government, it will produce an almost identical Bill.  It will be an utter disgrace if it does not do so as young couples will continue to be gazumped by unscrupulous developers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In summing up the Government's contribution to this Bill I wish to again raise the key questions of whether the Bill is legally sound and whether its provisions would be workable or effective in practice.  If the Bill does not satisfy these criteria then the House has no option but to reject it.  It is clear from the contributions of my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, that the Bill fails on both counts.  The best legal advice suggests that there are serious risks of unconstitutionality attaching to the Bill.  On this basis alone the House has no option but to reject it.</P>
      <P>However, there is also a range of further legal difficulties and defects in the Bill.  For example, it cuts across many fundamental principles of contract law and would represent an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the basic rights of buyers and sellers to freely enter into contracts.  It would penalise home purchasers as well as vendors.</P>

      <P>I have no problem defending the Government's record on housing.  We are building more houses than ever.  More than 40,000 new houses will be completed this year.  We have provided capital expenditure of £437 million for housing in 1998, an increase of 26 per cent on 1997.</P>

We have made important improvements to the range of social housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, and we have taken prompt and effective action to tackle the problem of house price increases.</P>
      <P>The speed and effectiveness of the Government's response on this issue has been recognised by almost every commentator.  Despite the impression that the Opposition would try to create, the Government's Action on House Prices is, in a relatively short time, already starting to have a positive effect.  In particular, the ending of investor speculation and the increase in the supply of second hand houses following the reduction in stamp duty rates are helping to restore balance to the housing market.</P>

As a rural Deputy, I am delighted to support Deputy Hayes' Bill and congratulate him on his actions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has boasted about the level of capital expenditure.  Limerick is a rural county and there are 990 people on the housing waiting list and this year the Minister of State gave us capital to purchase or construct 57 houses.

    <P>If this Bill is not enacted it will result in more people joining the waiting list.  These are people who would have obtained mortgages and purchased their houses in the past.  The Government has a closed mind.  It decided that this Bill was unconstitutional and defective.  Every Bill introduced <Col N="1341" /> by Fine Gael, including my Bill on the registration of sex offenders, receives the same response.  The same speech is given in response to any Opposition Bill.  There is a crisis and this is a small and important way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in this area for young people who aspire to own their own houses and those on the waiting list for local authority housing.  Many people, some of whom are single parents with one child and who may have an opportunity to get a house in five, six or seven years and are living in poor conditions, think they will never get a house. Will the Government deal with the housing crisis to ensure young people in employment can buy houses, which is a tradition in Ireland, that those who are marginalised can live in decent conditions and that there is a level of social justice in the housing policy?</P>

    <P>I have discovered a further loophole for people who sign contracts.  It concerns those who have joint mortgages in that the first named has been given the right to vote and the right to obtain shares when a company goes public.  This has come to my notice in the context of First Active <Col N="1342" /> which is going public.  It means that a partner who abandons the home and is the first named on the joint agreement will still get the votes even though the partner in the house may have paid the mortgage for ten or 15 years.  This is absurd. A letter states that the first named on a joint residential mortgage is regarded as a representative, i.e., the first named joint account holder, and as such is entitled to vote or obtain free shares.  This is unbelievable in this day and age.  It may have been acceptable when marriages did not break down but it is presenting a major problem today. I intend to have it reviewed under the Building Societies Act, 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank colleagues on all sides who contributed to the debate.  The interpretation of this legislation specifically by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is fundamentally flawed.  Last evening the Minister at that Department, Deputy O'Donoghue, said: &ldquo;One thing we must be clear about is that this Bill is attempting to deal with the situation where there is absolutely no contract between the parties&rdquo;. Under the relevant statute, of which Ministers of State, Deputies Dan Wallace and Molloy, would have considerable knowledge, once a vendor and a purchaser establish an agreement, a memorandum must be established surrounding the documentation, the title and all the other documentation for that transaction.  Therefore it was incorrect of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tell the House there is absolutely no contract between the parties: there is case law to establish that there is a verbal contract, evidenced by a booking deposit.  Our legislation would simply speed up the time involved where the vendor must give to the purchaser that written contract.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Government that the views as outlined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are wrong from a legal and constitutional perspective.  There is a way of testing that and I am open to suggestions.  I know the Government will vote down this Bill.  I give the Minister the opportunity through the Committee on the Environment and Local Government, of which he is a member, or any committee of the House, to invite the Law Society, the auctioneers and the builders to give evidence as to how we can rectify this problem.  I am interested only in rectifying this problem.  In his contribution he said further: &ldquo;I understand the association [the Home Builders Association in Galway] will propose a code of practice which enshrines the principle that where a booking deposit is made for the purchase of a house at a particular price, the transaction should proceed to conclusion, subject to appropriate conditions and requirements being satisfied&rdquo;.  If it is acceptable to have that by way of a code of practice, why is it not right to have it enshrined in law?  That is all we are trying to do.  We want this code of practice enshrined in law.  There is no disagreement on that, yet the Government is voting it down.  I cannot understand that logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> When auctions take place all the documentation for the transaction &mdash; title, financing, survey report and so on &mdash; is upfront.  Our legislation would require that conveyancing would have to change because all the documentation would have to be upfront as in the case of an auction.  We are proposing nothing radically different from what is already the case and working in practice in relation to auctions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter asked a fundamental question about the Law Society's role in this matter.  The Minister said the Law Society had shot down this proposal.  I challenge him to show us where they said that.  As I understand it, the Law Society is considering the legislation before the House and has not reached a conclusion.  I challenge the Minister to produce evidence which backs up his claim that the society has shot down my proposal.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation we are proposing to give greater consumer protection to young couples and purchasers in an over-heated market.  Our legislation is watertight and it works.  When our committee takes evidence from all the players <Col N="1344" /> involved &mdash; auctioneers, the Law Society, builders and the Consumers Association &mdash; we will show that legislation can change the law in favour of purchasers and vendors.  There are circumstances when vendors are left to carry the can. Our legislation would enshrine enforceable consumer protection in the area of house purchases. The question that has to be asked is why the Government is so opposed to putting in place a strict code of practice and actual penalties whereby gazumpers are allowed hike up the price for young couples by £15,000 to £20,000 one month after signing the booking deposit.  The public will have to know the Minister's position because there is a fundamental difference between the views of the Government and this side of the House.  We will not accept the current legal position and will continue to campaign on the issue.  The Government's position is hollow, and will be seen as such when the public makes its final decision on the matter in the very near future, as ultimately it will be necessary to enact new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The farming sector is currently experiencing considerable difficulties with the pigmeat, sheepmeat, beef and cereal sectors being most severely hit.  The main issue about which primary producers and consumers feel strongly relates to the huge differentials which exist between the prices paid at the farm gate and those which are charged in retail outlets.  Price differentials cannot be justified and the serious creaming off of profits is affecting individual farmers and producers and is also impacting on consumers.  According to the laws of economics, when prices drop consumption increases.  At a time when there is a serious overhang in the marketplace, increased consumption would be of significant benefit to the lines of production I mentioned.</P>
      <P>We have reached a stage here where a limited number of multiples are exercising a disproportionate degree of power and control over the whole production chain.  There seems to be a diminishing sense of loyalty and commitment to home producers and Irish suppliers.  This House must extend consideration to everybody right across the board.  If we ignore the importance of the supplier network the basic economy will suffer.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would address the points I have made, particularly on the degree of power being exercised by the multiples. There is a strong case for the Competition Authority to examine the very serious differential between the price at the farm gate and at retail outlets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kirk, for the opportunity to say a few words on this topic.  He outlined cogently why this issue needs to be tackled.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I and other public representatives in the Border counties are particularly conscious of the very severe difficulties facing one particular sector, the pigmeat industry.</P>
      <P>Pig producers in the Border region in particular are suffering huge losses.  One of the difficulties is the lack of capacity in the Border region.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and his officials for their ongoing efforts to try to resolve that difficulty.  I am glad some progress is being made with the reopening of the McCarrens plant in Cavan.  I take the opportunity to appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and his colleague the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, to ensure that we make the maximum use of that facility as quickly as possible because competition is needed.</P>
      <P>Pig producers in our area are anxious to have another slaughtering outlet to which to sell their product.  It is essential that the small scale producer is protected.  This is extremely urgent because of the serious losses endured by that sector for some time.  Over the summer months many people asked me why the price of the finished product in the supermarkets and shops was not coming down when the price to the farmer had dropped dramatically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to the legitimate concerns of Deputies Kirk and Smith on behalf of consumers.  Unfortunately, my Government colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has responsibility for consumer affairs, is abroad on official business.  I assure the House that he shares the Deputies' concerns about price differentials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> I am delighted to inform the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will, on behalf of the Government, invite representatives of the supermarket multiples and RGDATA to discuss the very serious concern that is being expressed up and down the country about the huge price differential between farm gate prices and retail prices.  I will also outline other action we are taking to ensure that consumers get the best possible deal for their money.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a Member of this House representing a largely rural constituency with many farmers, I can vouch for the fact that farmers also have legitimate concerns about the price differential between what they get for their produce and for what it is subsequently sold at retail level.</P>
    <P>Farmers are suffering badly and the Government is doing everything possible to alleviate their plight.  Undoubtedly, consumers are looking at the relatively low price farmers are getting for beef, pigmeat, lamb and other produce and wondering at the prices being charged in the supermarkets and shops.  Deputies and the House need be in no doubt that the Government is determined to find out why there are such big price differentials and ensure that consumers get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>We cannot countenance a situation where, to use economic jargon, people in the value chain are rent seeking.  In plain English, the Government will not have the consumer fleeced.  Government would be extremely concerned if significant reductions in farm gate prices are not proportionately reflected in reduced consumer prices.  Some time may be needed for price reductions to work their way to the retail outlets.  Legitimate concerns are being expressed on behalf of consumers and the matter will have to be investigated further.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials to pursue the issue urgently.  We will have meetings with representatives of supermarkets and RGDATA soon.  We will also consult with the Department of Agriculture and Food to get their input.  We will examine other aspects of the food value chain to see where any &ldquo;creaming off&rdquo; might be taking place.  We will, as appropriate, meet with any other association or industry representative group to ensure that they are fully aware that this Government will not tolerate the interests of consumers being affected adversely.  We will consult with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to examine how his office can be of assistance.</P>
    <P>In addition, the issues highlighted here this evening raise concerns about possible anti-competitive behaviour in the marketplace.  We would be equally appalled if that were the case.  I hope it is not.  However, the Competition Authority has ample legal powers to investigate and prosecute as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am bringing the content of this timely debate to the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement.  I will ask him to follow up the <Col N="1348" /> issues raised and take whatever action he deems necessary in the interests of consumers and the primary producers &mdash; the farmers &mdash; on whom we are totally dependent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter concerning the skipper and crew of the Irish fishing trawler the <i>MFV Girl Jane</i> who were the victims of an incident which occurred 17 miles south of Baltimore, County Cork, on 21 September 1998 created by a French trawler, <i>Melodie</i>, the owner of which is believed to be S. A. Nicot Arment.</P>
      <P>Both the Irish and French boats were fishing in that area.  The Irish trawler crew did everything possible to avoid getting involved but they failed to get the French boat to veer off.  Consequently, the French boat got entangled in the Irish vessel's net.  The French boat made no attempt to free the Irish boat's net but proceeded to burn it in five or six places with a gas torch.  The Irish boat's wire combination was entangled in the French trawler's trawl door.  The French crew then proceeded to cut the combination wire as well.  As a result the Irish trawler lost its net, valued at £3,000, the combination wire worth £700, and two days' fishing.</P>
      <P>The Irish trawler suffered loss and damage as a result of this incident.  The Minister gave a commitment in the press the morning after this incident that he would investigate it and make sure that the French trawler concerned and the French authorities compensated the Irish trawler owner. Having hauled its trawl door, the Irish trawler steamed back to Baltimore to find a replacement net.  In 25 years fishing experience, this was the worst incident they had ever come across.  They honestly believed at the time that the crew had to be Spanish and could not be convinced they were French but, alas, they were French.  The skipper of that French registered trawler must be a very dangerous man.  I further believe this was no accident and that the skipper intended to destroy the Irishman's fishing net.  This man should be immediately removed from the position of skipper because of his conduct in the interest of good relations on the high seas and the safety of crew members and vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service was contacted at 4 p.m. on 21 December about this incident and contact was also made with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Investigations seem to be continuing in respect of the incident but there are no moves afoot to compensate the Irish fishing trawler which suffered a loss of £3,700 as well as the loss of fishing opportunities and loss of approximately £1,000 in profits, a total of £4,700.  What efforts has the Minister made to ensure the trawler owner is compensated for this blatant act of <Col N="1349" /> piracy on the high seas?  How much longer can we tolerate this action?</P>

I want action from the Minister rather than pious words.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, I share his very deep concern about incidents such as this.  It is completely unacceptable that the safety of Irish fishermen is put at risk by strong arm tactics of harassment and intimidation.  I will not tolerate illegal interference with the legitimate activities of our fishermen.  Such deplorable behaviour is irresponsible, dangerous and shows scant regard for the safety of fellow fishermen.  I assure the House I am taking every possible step to prevent such incidents from happening.  I have already put in place a rapid reporting and response system when they do arise.</P>
      <P>This incident is a symptom of recurring problems between fishermen in the fishing grounds off the Irish coast.  I want to see the problems and the causes of the problems tackled and solved.</P>
      <P>At my request, discussions have been taking place in recent months between my Department and the French fisheries ministry on this problem. We had already decided, prior to this incident, to host a face to face meeting this month between Irish and French fishermen and their representatives in Dublin.  That meeting will take place next Friday.  The French ministry will also attend.  The recent incident will obviously be top of the agenda and the Irish side will be pressing for answers.  The meeting is also a forum for finding solutions to prevent such incidents.  The two sides will be exploring the scope for codes of practice and improved communication in the interests of peaceful coexistence in the fishing grounds off our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent incident, to which the Deputy has referred, happened on 21 September off the south-west coast, some 20 miles off Baltimore. The skipper of an Irish fishing boat, the <i>Girl Jane</i>, reported to my Department that the boat had been dragged backwards by a French registered fishing boat and that its fishing gear had been cut by the crew of the French registered vessel using a blow torch.  The French vessel then left the scene and headed back to France.  At my instructions the matter was taken up immediately by my officials in strong terms with the French authorities. My deep concern about the alleged incident was conveyed to them and the French authorities were requested to investigate and respond to us as a matter of urgency.  We are currently <Col N="1350" /> waiting for their response, which I expect will come fairly shortly.</P>

I will protect the interests of Irish fishermen by ensuring the most effective surveillance and control of all fishing vessels in these waters.  We are working closely with the Department of Defence, the Air Corps and the Naval Service on sea fisheries protection so that all legitimate fishermen can go about their business safely and securely.</P>
      <P>I already arranged for a rapid response system last March following similar incidents.  I am glad to have this chance to spell out these arrangements again.  Fishermen should immediately contact the marine emergency service, IMES, of my Department if an incident takes place, via the VHF radio or 999 emergency telephone system.</P>

All of these will be available and several of them can take pictures of the scene, which can be very valuable in subsequent disputes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for permitting me to raise again the issue of the £70 million EU fine on the Irish Government for irregularities and fraud in the beef industry.  It gives me an opportunity to reply to the campaign of obfuscation which the Taoiseach and the Government have been orchestrating with some success since I first raised the matter yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will state in simple terms what the issue is about.  First, over a three year period from 1990 to 1992 sections of the beef industry, in particular the Goodman group, swindled huge sums of EU beef intervention moneys and abused the tendering process.  In a letter to the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy O'Malley estimated the extent of the scam was about £250 million.  The European Commission became aware of the fraud and held the Irish Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food responsible, because they had been negligent in their control of the system.  The Irish authorities were formally notified of this at meetings on 7 May 1993 and 27 July 1994, both of which dates were before the beef tribunal produced its report. The Commission imposed a fine on the Irish Government in the form of disallowances totalling <Col N="1352" /> almost £70 million.  This was appealed by the Government and the final decision by the European Court of Justice was given last Thursday, confirming that the fine was to stand.</P>
    <P>The question which now arises relates not to the fine itself, which has been confirmed by the European Court, but to the moneys which were swindled in the first place, the major beneficiary of which is known, namely, the Goodman group. Article 8 of EU Regulation 729/70 makes clear that member states are required by European law to seek recovery of sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence.  Our questions to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, yesterday were specifically about the recovery of moneys lost due to irregularities or negligence in 1990 and 1991. The Minister replied that there was no recourse and no route to recovery; in other words, although the beneficiaries of the swindle are known, the State will not look for the money back, as it would do in the case of someone who defrauded social welfare or a small business which was late paying tax.  The advice to this Government and to the previous Government was that recovery could not and should not be pursued until the appeal process was completed, and the legal advice was that it could not be done by way of a levy on the industry.  My point, and that of my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, has always been that recovery can and should be pursued through the Irish courts in accordance with Article 8 of EU Regulation 729/70.</P>
    <P>This morning, the Taoiseach accused Deputy Rabbitte and me of seeking to confuse matters in the House yesterday, but it is he who has been most successful in generating a fog of detail which appears to have had the desired effect in some quarters.  First, he arranged for the briefing and debriefing of the press corps yesterday evening, which left most people in the House unclear whether the Government was going to seek recovery of the money.  Second, he announced that summonses were served on AIBP in Ardee yesterday for matters arising from the beef tribunal, thus giving the impression that the Government was pursuing something.  He did not tell us that these summonses were authorised on 12 October 1997, nor why it has taken 12 months and questions on the Dáil Order Paper to activate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Third, he sought to shift political responsibility onto the last Government by selectively referring to its legal advice, He did not explain that the question of recovering the money would arise only when the outcome of the appeal was known, as the then Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry explained to the Committee of Public Accounts on 6 April 1995, and as is clear from the Government decision of 12 March 1996, which I call on the Taoiseach to publish in the interests of accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> For two days the Taoiseach has been using the complexities of the beef intervention scheme, beef tribunal issues, legal cases, and European regulations to smother the scent of a rotten Government position.  The Irish taxpayer had to pay a £70 million fine because a few beef barons swindled huge sums of European money.  The swindlers are known but this Government is not going to seek recovery of the swindled money, as it is legally obliged to do.  Will the Government seek the recovery, not of the fine <i>per se,</i> but of the swindled money?  Will it take the beneficiaries to court to recover this money?  If it persists in its refusal to do this, how does it expect to be able to protect the interests of this country in its discussions with the EU on agricultural funding, which was discussed by the Commission today, and on Structural Funds?  If the Government does not do the job it is required to do under European law &mdash; to recover money which was swindled from European schemes &mdash; it will seriously undermine the position of this country and its industries in their dealings with the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion to dispel some of the confusion which has been evident over the past 24 hours.  As regards Question No. 82 of 6 October, the answer I provided to Deputy Gilmore in the House yesterday was clear.  The European Court of Justice delivered judgment on 1 October on the appeal by Ireland against the disallowances for beef intervention and multiple tendering.  The court found in favour of the Commission and against Ireland.  The amount of money involved was some £50 million in relation to intervention beef storage and some £1.8 million in relation to multiple tendering.  The court upheld the Commission's position that there had been weakness in the control system for beef intervention in 1990 and 1991.  It also ruled that the Commission had taken account of improvements in the control system which had been introduced when it reduced the 1991 penalty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>In regard to multiple tendering, the court found there had been an infringement of Article 9(2) of Regulation 859/89 and that member states have a general obligation to take the measures necessary to satisfy themselves that the transactions financed by FEOGA are executed correctly, even if the specific Community Act does not expressly provide for the adoption of particular supervisory measures.  The court also rejected similar appeals lodged by Denmark, France, Italy and the UK.  While the Government was disappointed with the outcome of the appeal, the court has spoken the final word on the matter and that has to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which has been debated in the House over the past day is why these disallowances cannot be recouped from certain companies which were seen to be responsible for the disallowances. On the face of it, this is a fair question with which <Col N="1354" /> many people will identify.  It has been examined by a high level group which reported that the options for recovery of the disallowance were limited.  This report was presented to the Government of which Deputy Gilmore's colleagues, Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Rabbitte, were members, and its conclusions were accepted by that Government.</P>

      <P>The recoveries group was established in April 1995, shortly after the notification of the proposed disallowance by the European Commission.  Its terms of reference required it to examine all options of recoverability of disallowance with a view to having proposals ready for implementation when the final decision would be made by the Commission.  The group consisted of senior officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, as it then was, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General, and a senior counsel served as its independent legal adviser.  Following the formal disallowance decision in March 1996, the group reported to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>The legal advice obtained and endorsed by the group was that the disallowance levied on Ireland did not of itself entitle the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to recover any part of the disallowance from companies which may have featured in the case made against Ireland by the European Commission.  The group examined the options of imposing a general levy on the beef industry or a levy on those companies against which there was evidence of wrongdoing in the period 1990-2 in respect of which the disallowances were made.  It concluded neither option would be legally sustainable.  The other major option considered was for specific recovery based on proven irregularities.  In this respect the group concluded that any proceedings must be based on a recognised cause of action in Irish law and must be proved in accordance with the rules of evidence in civil proceedings.</P>

      <P>The point has been raised as to why Article 8 of Regulation 729/70 should not be used to recover moneys lost as a result of irregularities or negligence.  The point has been raised as to why Article 8 of Regulation No. <Col N="1355" /> 729/70 should not be used to recover moneys lost as a result of irregularities or negligence.  The position remains that this Article cannot be used for recovery purposes unless a direct link can be proved between the irregularity and the specific recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The recoveries group noted that proceedings had issued against AIBP for the recovery of damages in respect of irregularities found at AIBP Rathkeale.  Further proceedings were then in preparation for issue against AIBP in respect of irregularities at Shannon Meats. Both proceedings have yet to come to a court hearing.  Some £1.8 million is being sought in recoveries in respect of these cases.</P>
      <P>Allegations had been presented to the beef tribunal about the non-declaration of deboning yields which, under the regulation are the property of the intervention agency.  This matter has been the subject of a recent Government discussion arising out of which it was decided to serve summonses on AIBP.  These summonses were served yesterday afternoon and the next step will be for the Department to submit a claim within 21 days.</P>
      <P>As regards Questions Nos. 86 and 106, I can confirm that investigations were initiated in November 1997 at the plant referred to while an audit was conducted there in March 1998.  As regards the November 1997 issue, the investigations were undertaken on foot of information received by my Department about the delivery of cattle to the plant.  Arising from these, my Department was satisfied that the cattle in question had been imported from the United Kingdom in contravention of EU veterinary regulations, as transposed into Irish law.  Consequently and in accordance with the established policy, the cattle were slaughtered, the carcases were rendered and the resulting material was subsequently exported for incineration.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 86, the precise origin of these cattle in the United Kingdom has not been definitely established but it is believed they came here from Northern Ireland.  A slaughter notice was served on the owner of the cattle.  The investigations have not yet been completed but I assure the House that my Department is most anxious that legal proceedings be taken against those involved with this illegal importation if it is possible to sustain a case.</P>

Following on from this a detailed review of the <Col N="1356" /> Departments regulatory activities and controls was undertaken by officers of my Department and existing procedures were further developed and modified in the context of the demands of the new audit format.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because of my concern that the number of people committing suicide is nearly as many, if not more, as the number being killed on our roads each year.  At the last meeting of the North-Eastern Health Board we received a report dated 28 September 1998. The National Task Force on Suicide was established by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan, to identify the problem as regards suicide and how it could be effectively addressed.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board decided to initiate its own study.  In 1997, the first year of the above study 36 suicides occurred in the four counties in which the North-Eastern Health Board is involved.  That worked out at a rate of 11.8 per 100,000 of population.  The figure was only provisional because a number of other cases had to be dealt with.  The most common method of suicide, unfortunately, is hanging at 44 per cent followed by shooting at 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>The health board completed a separate study on youth views on suicide.  A total of 857 teenagers co-operated with the board and were asked questions about self-harm, behaviour and thoughts of suicide.  Approximately 23.5 per cent expressed some degree of suicidal thoughts and 12.5 per cent admitted self-harm and suicidal thoughts over the previous six months.  Anxiety and depression symptoms appeared to be most closely associated with both suicide and thoughts of self-harm.  That in itself gave me the idea to follow up on the problem and to see if the Oireachtas can do anything about it.</P>
      <P>Given the substantial proportion of males, 86 per cent, and the number of people committing suicide, a substantial number under the age of 25 years, there is a need for counsellors to be appointed to second level schools.  This proposal should be seriously considered given the amount of money involved and the amount the Government has at its disposal leading up to this year's budget.  If we are earnest about trying to tackle the problem, we should appoint counsellors so that they are available to talk to young children with problems in schools.  There may be many problems at home about which the individual will have no one to talk.  As the Government proposes to tackle the problem of deaths on the roads, it should be as committed to helping to tackle this problem and we should start in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Farrelly for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to contribute.  In the first quarter of 1998, 106 males and 23 females suffered death by suicide.  These figures are provisional as they refer to deaths registered during January to March 1998 rather than deaths which actually occurred during that period.  This figure is, therefore, a conservative one.  The figure annualised totals 516.  This represents an increase of 19 per cent on the 1997 figures.  It is difficult not to sensationalise this epidemic but we must not do so.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister present does not have direct responsibility in this area but I plead with the Minister responsible to immediately implement in full the recommendations of the National Task Force on Suicide.  In the area to which Deputy Farrelly referred, the National Task Force on Suicide recommended that teachers at all levels be supported in respect of the psychological and social dimensions of their work through undergraduate and continual education courses.  It further recommends that programmes should be initiated aimed at teaching the child about positive health issues, including coping strategies and basic information about positive mental health at an earlier stage as a natural part of their health care curriculum.  Guidance counsellors should be available at all schools.</P>
      <P>On three occasions in recent months, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, announced the introduction of psychological services and said a planning group had been set up to establish such a service for all young people inside and outside school and that its report was imminent.  I do not want to be political but I am extremely tempted to be when I hear the Minister of State making such an announcement for the third time.  I expected the Minister of State to be here to announce it a fourth time, but it is important that we introduce the service.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Farrelly and Deputy Neville for the sincerity they have shown in the way they approached this important subject. I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  As the Deputy is aware, the report of the National Task Force on Suicide published in February 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy which placed particular emphasis on the need for concerted and co-ordinated action by the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the report, the Minister has been in contact with a number of his ministerial colleagues, including the Minister for Education and Science, with a view to implementing the task force recommendations.  The Department of Health and Children has also contacted <Col N="1358" /> all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies, requesting that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's inquiry concerning counselling services in post primary schools, it is understood that an action plan for the development of guidance and counselling in post primary schools is being prepared by the Department of Education and Science and that the process of consultation and the finalisation of this plan is nearing completion.  The Minister for Education and Science expects to make an announcement about the general thrust of this plan in the near future.  All post-primary schools have sanction to avail of certain levels of guidance and counselling provision.  I understand that the Department of Education and Science is also working on the development of guidelines for schools on the issue of responding to all traumatic incidents which may occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>A Department of Education and Science planning group, on which the Department of Health and Children was represented, has just finalised a report on the development of a national educational psychological service for all schools. Arrangements will be put in place to establish this service under a national educational psychological service agency early in 1999.  It is intended that there will be consultation with the Department of Health and Children on how a new national educational psychological service will relate to psychological services provided by the health boards for children and young people and on related matters, such as the development of guidance and counselling and support for schools in regard to issues such as the prevention of suicides and responses to traumatic incidents.</P>
    <P>In the broader context, the Department of Health and Children has been involved in partnership with the health boards and the Department of Education and Science in the development of many initiatives that relate to the social, psychological and well being of young people. They include substance abuse and child abuse prevention programmes and the development of the health promotion schools project.  A fundamental principle of these initiatives is that the development of self-esteem and a positive self-concept is important in establishing a confident self-image for our young people.  This philosophy coupled with practical decision making skills and relevant information can better equip our young people to take their place in society.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the Department of Health and Children will continue to work in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science on these matters and other areas of mutual concern.  I thank them for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>The information sought is contained in the schedule which is being circulated.</P>
      <P>Since the Act commenced on 21 April 1998, my Department has received 50 requests.  Some 20 have been granted and of these ten have been partially granted.  Seven requests are ongoing and four requests were transferred to other Departments. Where requests have been partially granted, certain information was withheld as it was exempt under various relevant sections of the Act.  In addition, 17 requests have been refused and two have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>All but one of the requests fully processed to date have been dealt with within the timeframes allowed under the Act.  The specific length of time taken to process each request within these time limits varies, depending on the complexity of the request and the volume of records requested.</P>

      <P>I had a brief courtesy visit with a delegation of senior Libyan officials on Friday, 24 July.  The delegation had been invited by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Ireland and explained that it had taken up the invitation with a view to improving Libya's relations with Ireland and with the European Union, in both political and trade terms.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to press the delegation to restore the trade in live cattle which had been beneficial to both our countries in the past.  I was pleased to be informed by the delegation that the existing barriers to the live cattle and beef trade between the two countries would be removed following its return to Libya.  I am pleased to note that this has now happened.  The delegation also indicated that it expected a doubling of trade between Ireland and Libya in the medium-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic management initiative, SMI, is a wide-ranging programme for the modernisation of the Irish civil and public service. Responsibility for implementation ultimately rests with the head of each public service <Col N="1362" /> body to deepen the process and embed the strategic management approach within their individual organisations.</P>
      <P>Because of its role at the centre of Government, my Department has played a leading part in the design and implementation of the process to date.  In view of the range and complexity of the measures involved, the process is being over-seen by a co-ordinating group, an implementation group for the Civil Service and, to develop the proposals contained in Delivering Better Government, various working groups.  Membership of these groups is not just confined to officials but includes experts from diverse private sector backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The groups are supported by a cross-departmental SMI team of officials drawn from a variety of Departments and offices based in my Department. The team also facilitates the implementation throughout the Civil Service of the recommendations that emerge from the groups' deliberations.  The process is further supported by networks of officials across the Civil Service involved in, for example, quality service, personnel and IT.</P>
      <P>To date, a number of significant initiatives have been taken, both legislative and administrative. Crucial underpinning legislation such as the Public Service Management Act, 1997 and the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 are now in place. As the Deputy will be aware, the first strategy statements of Departments and offices under the Public Service Management Act were laid before the Dáil by 1 May last, as I had promised.  Strategic planning, through preparation of these statements, is central to the SMI process. Changes have been introduced in the multi-annual budgeting and administrative budget aspects of financial management.  The introduction of performance management and other human resource changes are currently under discussion with the Civil Service unions.</P>
      <P>Later this year I expect to have further recommendations on regulatory reform, financial management and information technology before Government for consideration to build on the progress made to date.</P>
      <P>Steps have been taken to roll out SMI to the wider public service.  My Department is working closely with Departments who have bodies under their aegis as we begin to facilitate extension of the SMI.  A group is in place, under the chairmanship of my Department, consisting of representatives of Departments with responsibility for the organisations in the wider public service, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Health Service Employers Agency, to progress the modernisation programme.</P>
      <P>In both the Civil Service and the wider public service the programme of change will be advanced through the partnership arrangements agreed under Partnership 2000.  This work is being supported by the National Centre for Partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> A very significant amount of work has been done throughout the civil and public service to provide the excellent service we require.  It is essential that each Department and office now takes responsibility for progressing the next steps in SMI over the coming months.  My Department will continue to support them as it has since 1994.</P>

      <P>On the 17 December 1997 I informed the House that in accordance with a Government decision, taken in October 1996, the future of social partnership structures had been reviewed in consultation with the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000.  The review had taken account of the views of both the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council which are representative of all strands of social partnership.</P>
      <P>Based on the outcome of that review and in response to the views put forward by both the NESC and the NESF, in particular the latter's report No. 16, A Framework for Partnership, I informed the House on 4 February that the Government had announced on the 9 December its decision to reconstitute both organisations on a statutory basis.  In the interim, both the NESC and the NESF were reconstituted on a non-statutory basis and I understand that their inaugural meetings are due to take place in the near future. As regards the legislation, the Government yesterday approved the drafting of a Bill to place both on a statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of both bodies have been revised to ensure that their activities are fully complementary.  The NESC will continue to provide strategic analysis through its reports and will develop a framework within which discussions on future national programmes will take place.  The NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment.  The membership of both bodies has now been <Col N="1364" /> changed to reflect more fully the various strands of the social partnership process.  The composition of the new bodies is as follows the NESC comprises five nominees from each of the five social partners pillars; five representatives from Departments &mdash; one of whom will be a county manager representing local government interests; and five independent members the NESF will comprise 15 members of the Houses of the Oireachtas; five nominees from each of the business, trade union and farmer pillars; 15 representatives of non-government organisations; five representatives of Departments; five local government representatives and five independent members.</P>
    <P>The main changes in composition relate to the inclusion of local government representation and community and voluntary representation on the NESC and the inclusion of Departments and local government representation on the NESF. The terms of office of members of both the NESC and NESF will be for a period of three years, during which time members may nominate alternates.</P>
    <P>As regards administrative arrangements, the Office of Public Works is at present seeking a premises where both the NESC and NESF can be accommodated.  This is a prerequisite for the facilitation of better co-operation and sharing of support services between both bodies which is also being investigated by my Department.</P>

For this reason a number of Departments and agencies, as well as the national taxi organisations, business and consumer interests were represented on the forum.  The representative from my Department ensured that I was kept informed of developments.  The time spent was approximately one half day per month.</P>
      <P>The forum has now completed its work.  It presented its recommendations to me on 2 September. A copy of the forum's recommendations has also been laid before the Dáil.

      <P>The circumstances of the last three months, especially the difficulties surrounding Drumcree and the tragedy of Omagh, as well as other functions such as the peace mass on 17 July in the Pro-Cathedral, have afforded me the opportunity of frequent meetings with a number of church leaders.  I also met in May with Arch-bishop Empey and with Fr. Paul Byrne, OMI, of the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants on 9 July.  The main pre-occupation of all of us has been to prevent further human tragedy by ensuring that the British-Irish Agreement endorsed by the people is proceeded with.  I and my office continue to avail of the good services of individual clergy and community leaders to further the cause of peace, stability and reconciliation.  I have always believed and found that they have an important role to play, that we neglect at our peril.

      <P>The Information Society Commission's first report was published in February this year and I understand that copies were circulated to every Member of the House.  The report sets out the main areas of the commission's work programme covering awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues and Government services and social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The commission has set up six advisory groups to help take its work forward in each of these areas.  As the term suggests, the role of these groups is to advise the commission.  However, a significant amount of the commission's work is also being done directly at advisory group level, under the overall guidance of the commission.  I will take a few moments to outline the main issues being examined, and some of the specific initiatives which the commission has undertaken recently.</P>
      <P>Possibly the most important work of the commission is in raising awareness of the information society and its benefits.  Initiatives here include the holding in June of a conference on the importance of the information society for social inclusion.  Also in June, the commission co-hosted a symposium on electronic commerce at which Ira Magaziner, special adviser to the US President, was the keynote speaker.  The commission is the primary sponsor of a new television series, TechTV, which is currently being screened by Network 2 every Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. The commission is also launching an awareness campaign for business, in conjunction with IBEC, which will run over the next few months.  In addition, it is encouraging businesses to adopt its logo as a demonstration that they are embracing the information society.</P>
      <P>On infrastructure, the commission is monitoring developments closely in the run up to full liberalisation of the telecommunications market.  It is considering all key issues in this area, including the question of ensuring full international connectivity at competitive prices.  It is one of a number of bodies whose views are helping to shape strategic policy decisions in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to learning, the commission is focusing on strategies to encourage the concept of lifelong learning in all walks of life within the information society.  In this context, it has already highlighted the need for additional measures outside the formal education process.</P>
      <P>In the area of enterprise, the commission is considering employment issues arising under the information society and is examining ways of monitoring and assessing the changes arising from the increasing trend towards new forms of work organisation, including flexible working time, increased teleworking and homeworking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On legal issues, the commission is examining a wide range of subjects where legislation is likely to require amendment or where new legislation may be needed, arising from its work under the other headings.  For example, in order to facilitate <Col N="1367" /> electronic commerce, appropriate legislation is needed under a number of headings, such as facilitating security and confidentiality of transactions, and ensuring protection of data and copyright.</P>
    <P>Under Government services and social inclusion, the commission monitors best international practice in delivery of public services electronically and provides advice on how best to ensure that developments in this area address the needs of groups such as the elderly and persons with disabilities.  As I have already mentioned, the commission arranged a conference in June on the importance of the information society for social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The commission will shortly publish the results of national surveys which it has commissioned on attitudes towards and use of information and communication technologies among both the general population and the business community.  This will enable the commission to focus its efforts in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission will present its next annual report early in 1999.</P>

In addition, it will examine and recommend a system for supporting, including funding, commemorative projects at a community, local, county or regional level, in order to provide local communities, including in areas of social disadvantage, with an opportunity to participate in the commemoration of the millennium.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the work of the National Millennium Committee will be supported by a small millennium office to be established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will also be responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's overall millennium programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Government will announce details of the National Millennium Committee shortly.  The exact funding to be made available for millennium projects and the operation of the millennium office will also be announced in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the cost of providing for the maintenance of long-term payments for those completing community employment and qualifying for unemployment benefit; the plans, if any, he has to address the issue of loss of long-term payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to those former community employment, CE, workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a CE scheme, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance.  As a consequence, they lose entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This issue arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to community employment, CE, workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  Since the position of former CE participants will vary depending on their own particular circumstances, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the cost of enabling such people to retain automatic entitlement to long-term unemployment assistance should they revert to the live register after finishing a period of CE.</P>
      <P>More generally, however, the Deputy will recognise that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.  By way of illustration, it would cost some £5.4 million to extend the Christmas bonus to all UB and DB recipients.</P>

      <P>The 1998 budget provided for significant social welfare increases.  A special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments has been provided for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with pro-rata increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions.  The £5 increase represents an increase ranging between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent.  These are the largest percentage increases which have been provided for the elderly since the early 1980's.</P>
      <P>This year's budget also provided for a general increase of £3 per week for some 560,000 social welfare recipients aged under 66 years, with prorata increases for a further 6,000 people on reduced rate contributory payments.  The £3 increase represents an increase ranging between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the increases provided in the budget took effect from the first week in June. This means that this year's increases are being paid for 31 weeks &mdash; an additional two weeks on previous years.  The consumer price index, CPI, measures the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of consumer goods and services.  The quantity of each item in this basket is proportional to the average amount purchased by all households in the country, as determined by the latest household budget survey. While the cost of some of the items in the &ldquo;basket&rdquo; might increase, these can be offset by reductions in the cost of other items.</P>
      <P>While a projected rate of inflation of 2 per cent for 1998 was estimated at budget time, the latest estimates suggest that the average rate of inflation for 1998 will now be in the region of 2.75 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, because of the significant level of this year's social welfare increases as set out above, <Col N="1371" /> a small increase in the expected average rate of inflation would still mean that social welfare recipients will have received real increases this year and, therefore, their real income position has been protected and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The question of further increases in social welfare rates, including the dates on which such increases would take effect, is being examined in the context of formulating proposals for the 1999 budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department.  The work of all staff who are engaged in any aspect of claims processing is to some degree concerned with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse where it occurs.</P>
      <P>There are some 600 staff at local, regional and national level whose work is entirely or significantly related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  Some 300 of these are responsible for routine investigations under the various schemes and for reporting on and following up suspected cases of fraud where these are discovered.</P>
      <P>Some 57 of these staff are inspectors belonging to a special investigation unit whose specific purpose is to investigate fraud and abuse.  This unit forms part of a nationwide joint inspection unit with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners and investigates employers and employees where abuses of the schemes are suspected.  In addition, all the main scheme areas have staff dedicated to the control of fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1997 a total of 465,621 reviews of social welfare claims and 7,742 employer inspections carried out during the year by control staff generally, resulting in overall savings of £158.9 million. The savings figure of £76 million mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to unemployment payments and is included in this.  Review numbers include routine <Col N="1372" /> reviews as well as those suspected of making fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>The special investigation unit carried out a total of 21,231 reviews of employees, of which 3,485, 16 per cent, signed off the live register resulting in savings of £11.34 million.  In addition, 1,962 employer inspections were carried out by the unit which resulted in the detection of £7.62 million in PAYE/PRSI arrears.</P>
    <P>The level of resources available to the investigation units is monitored on an ongoing basis and, where necessary resources are redeployed where the needs of the situation demand it.  I am satisfied with the present arrangements in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 49 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, has, since its introduction in 1984, been confined to employees on low incomes with families and is designed to provide them with an incentive to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>At present, self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance, UA, appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA.  The rate of UA payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.  About 7,000 people, many with families, benefit under this scheme at a cost of £33 million per year.</P>
      <P>The most recent estimate of the costs involved in extending FIS to the self-employed, including smallholders, was prepared some four years ago in 1994.  It was estimated then that implementing such a proposal could give rise to additional expenditure of £30 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These estimates were subject to some data limitations and do not take account of changes to the FIS scheme itself in the interim &mdash; most notably, the introduction of net income assessment from this month &mdash; or of changes in the profile of likely <Col N="1373" /> recipients.  My Department is currently engaged in preparing revised estimates of the costs involved.</P>
    <P>The preliminary indications from this work suggest that the updated cost of extending FIS to the self-employed could be significantly more than the 1994 estimate, and perhaps even as high as £80 million.  It is evident, in any event, that there would be very substantial costs involved in introducing this measure and it would be a matter for consideration therefore in a budgetary context and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the income of a contributory pensioner and his household must be below a certain limit, currently £15 per week in excess of the maximum standard old age contributory pension rate.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of up to £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum standard pension rate, or savings of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Changes in the national fuel scheme to increase the present income limit of £15 per week as suggested by the Deputies would have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.  In that regard, the House will recall that substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £5 per week were paid from June 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost of payments to asylum seekers in 1998 up to the end of June was approximately £9 million.  It is estimated that the overall cost of social welfare payments to asylum seekers in 1998 could be of the order of £25 million.  This would represent about half of 1 per cent of total social welfare spending.  It is difficult to be precise as the final cost will depend on the numbers of new asylum seekers arriving during the rest of the year; the numbers of existing cases who leave the system, for example, when decisions are made on their claims for asylum; the length of stay in bed and breakfast and hostel type emergency accommodation.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme provides basic weekly payments, rent supplements, deposits to secure private rented accommodation and once off exceptional need payments, for example, for clothing and footwear, to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The question of whether any individual asylum seeker is entitled to refugee status is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is not relevant to the assessment of whether he or she has the means to meet their material needs while they are in this country.</P>
      <P>As there are no special arrangements in place to provide for the food, clothing, shelter and other basic material needs of asylum seekers, they are entitled to claim and be assessed for SWA on the basis that they have no means with which to meet their basic material needs.</P>
      <P>The question of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers through direct provision of food, clothing, accommodation and other basic necessities is being considered by an inter-departmental committee.  In the event of systems being put in place to provide for all the material needs of asylum seekers through direct provision, then the question of SWA payments to asylum seekers would fall to be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, SWA will continue in payment to the individuals concerned in accordance with the legislation.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase the allocation to the 1998 scheme of community support for the elderly in view of the fact that last year the grant aid allocated to the scheme amounted to 90 per cent of the total cost of fitting each alarm unit for the elderly and in view of the fact that it appears that the percentage of grant aid is falling below that of last year so that recipients will have to make an increased personal contribution themselves; and his views on whether it is grossly unfair to expect individual recipients or their local communities or charities to fund more than 10 per cent of the cost of installing alarm units for the elderly.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware my Department has since 1996 operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was provided in this year's estimates.  The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary equipment.  However the actual amount of the grant can vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  I am anxious to ensure that the scheme is focused and provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. However, I am aware that there is a high level of demand in relation to the scheme this year and I am currently in the process of reviewing the situation. I should say that any decision regarding the scheme does have to take account of the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Pensions Board report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative is a comprehensive and detailed document and, while some of the recommendations can be easily implemented, others require in-depth examination of the many issues raised therein.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to report progress on a number of the key findings of the comprehensive report from the Pensions Board on the National Pensions Policy Initiative, Securing Retirement Income.  Working groups have been set up:</P>
      <P>(a) to examine fully the recommendation for an explicit fund to minimise the additional, future costs of social welfare pensions.  This working group comprises representatives of the relevant Departments and a report is expected before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>(b) to progress the recommendation to increase second pillar coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this &mdash; namely, the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Government has accepted this finding, in principle, and the working group is currently examining the issues involved with a view to appropriate legislation being introduced.</P>
      <P>(c) to further examine and advance the proposals to introduce a simplified and more flexible tax regime for pensions.  Again, this was also accepted, in principle, by the Government and the third working group is considering this matter with a view to making the necessary legislative changes.  This group is also exploring the issue of an earnings cap in relation to tax relief on pensions and issues relating to annuity purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) to bring forward proposals in relation to an effective awareness-education programme.  I am deeply supportive of the proposals in this regard.  The importance of clear and easily <Col N="1377" /> understandable information in the pensions area cannot be underestimated.  I expect an initial report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government also accepted the board's proposals for legislative changes in relation to access, vesting, preservation, revaluation, and integration.</P>
    <P>With regard to timescale, as I have outlined, the work of the various groups now continues apace.  I am committed to implementing the proposals in the report as quickly as possible. However, I am also of the opinion, and I am sure the Deputy will agree, that this must be done by way of a considered approach.  A reasonable timescale is, therefore, necessary to achieve this and, accordingly, I anticipate publishing a comprehensive Pensions Bill in the last quarter of 1999, with a view to enactment in 2000.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Commission on the Family, Strengthening Families for Life, contains a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the issues affecting families and wide-ranging recommendations across several different public policy areas involving a number of Departments.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations in the main relate to the approach to be pursued in various areas of policy in the years ahead to strengthen families in carrying out their functions. Some of the commission's recommendations are set in the context of evolving societal change in relation to family life and some involve very substantial costs.  These recommendations will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.  In relation to progress made to date may I refer the Deputy to the Officila Report of Wednesday, 30 September 1998 in which my colleagues have set out the initiatives taken to date within their own areas of responsibility which are relevant to the findings of the Commission on the Family.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to adopting a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in the context of developing coherent progressive and effective policies for families as promised in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with its pro-family approach to the development of policy and services and in response to recommendations from the Commission, the Government has established a new family affairs unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and has provided an additional £2.75 million for the development <Col N="1378" /> of family services in my Department.  This includes £700,000 towards a network of family and community services resource centres; an extra £600,000 for support for marriage counselling services bringing the total allocations this year to £1.5 million; and an extra £600,000 for the expansion of the family mediation service.  A nation-wide expansion of the family mediation service is under way.  New services will be provided from centres in Athlone, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Tallaght, Tralee and Wexford over the next few months.</P>
    <P>This year over 150 organisations providing marriage and child counselling have received grant aid towards the provision of their services. In addition, for the first time, grant aid is being made available to voluntary organisations for marriage preparation programmes and to voluntary organisations providing support and bereavement counselling on the death of a family member.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit has been given a specific responsibility to pursue the findings in the commission's report following their consideration by the Government.  In pursuing the findings of the report the unit will work with the other Departments which are affected by the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>As well as having responsibility for the marriage counselling services and the family mediation service, the unit also has responsibility for a number of other family services, including a pilot programme to provide improved support to families from local offices of the Department through the one-stop-shop model, and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues.  The commission in its report made recommendations in relation to the development of these important services for families.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key objectives is the establishment of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and the incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country.  In formulating proposals for the 1999 budget, the Government will aim to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a wide range of commitments relating to the areas for which I have responsibility, including commitments to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period; to progressively relax the qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and to increase the value of the allowance in real terms; to implement the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, including an <Col N="1380" /> overhaul of the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities; &mdash; to refocus the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unit; and to establish a national mediation service.  In addition, Partnership 2000 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the implementation of the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare before the end of the partnership; family income supplement to be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis; the alleviation of the poverty trap created by the £60 spousal income limit for the purposes of entitlement to the qualified adult allowance and child dependant allowance; and the strengthening and expansion of the community development programme operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>As a result of the improvements provided for in the 1998 budget, substantial progress has already been made in relation to many of the above commitments.  For instance, the special £5 per week increase for pensioners marks a significant first step in meeting the Government's commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by the year 2002.  The general £3 per week increase for those aged under 66 years means that 93.5 per cent of social welfare recipients are about or above the minimum Commission on Social Welfare recommended rate.</P>
    <P>Other commitments which have been implemented or progressed include the calculation of the family income supplement on a net income basis, with effect from the beginning of this month, and the allocation of significant additional funding for the family mediation and marriage and child counselling services and the community development programme.  My priorities for the 1999 budget will include making further progress towards implementing the various programme commitments outlined above, having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>The publication of my Department's social inclusion strategy, as part of the development of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, marks a new stage in the development of social policy.  It finally lays to rest the myth that the alleviation of poverty is simply a case of increasing social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has pledged itself to achieving a socially inclusive society and to addressing the structural causes of poverty as it affects a significant minority in our society.  This pledge is <Col N="1381" /> reflected in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The progression of the NAPS has increasingly recognised that a multi-dimensional problem like poverty requires an answer that transcends sectoral departmental responses.  As part of the response to this challenge, this Government is implementing one of the key elements of the NAPS which is more focused and co-ordinated action among Departments in order to meet the targets set out in the areas of educational disadvantage, unemployment, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
    <P>All this obviously requires a new model of approach, new structures, and the inclusion of new actors in the policy process.  In developing a new model of approach we must look at investing in our society in the longer term.  The need for investment in our infrastructure has been highlighted in recent reports.  We must also invest in our social infrastructure in schools, in hospitals and health care, and in pensions.</P>
    <P>In the same way that our economy cannot develop without the necessary physical infrastructure, so our society cannot develop without a proper social infrastructure.  Rather than seeing such investment as a drain on resources, it must be recognised as a productive investment in our people and in our economy.  This is the new model of approach which we need to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet committee has agreed action on two cross-departmental issues &mdash; homelessness and literacy among the unemployed.  Working groups made up of representatives of key Departments and agencies are currently examining ways to progress these initiatives.  The committee has also approved the development of an initiative aimed at providing an integrated package of support for lone parents.</P>
    <P>Another major recent initiative has been the decision to introduce a mechanism for assessing the impact of policies on people in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty in the policy-making process.  Referred to as poverty proofing, this initiative means that significant policy proposals are assessed to establish the impact they have on the most vulnerable groups in society.</P>
    <P>I am also seeking to identify additional players who can assist in promoting all aspects of social inclusion.  In the case of the business sector, I have established, in conjunction with the employers' bodies, a steering committee to bring into being later this year a new foundation to support voluntary and community activity.  I provided £750,000 for the establishment of such a body in this year's budget.  This joint venture between employers and the State will provide a new source of funding and support for voluntary and community activity in Ireland, underlining business people's commitment towards a process of social inclusion in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>My Department is developing a White Paper on the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector.  I have established a steering committee which includes representatives from a <Col N="1382" /> number of Departments and from across the voluntary sector to progress the issue.</P>
    <P>The White Paper will be an important landmark in the developing role of the voluntary and community sector and its relationship with the State and I am committed to full consultation with the sector in the process of developing the White Paper.</P>
    <P>This is another step in advancing the &ldquo;new model of approach&rdquo; to which the Deputy referred and one which will assist in this Government's commitment to tackling the societal processes which run counter to our aim of building an inclusive society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The means tests used in determining entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  As there are over 472,000 people in receipt of social assistance payments it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments, as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes.  However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to achieve greater equity in the system.  The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 provided the opportunity to commence this process. Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These revised capital assessment provisions were extended to the old age non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's non-contributory pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes from October 1997 and to the rent allowance <Col N="1383" /> scheme for former controlled tenancies from June 1998.</P>
    <P>The revised capital assessment provisions are of benefit to the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital.  For example, a single old age pensioner can now have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non contributory pension &mdash; an increase of £3,173 on the previous arrangements.  A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension &mdash; an increase of £6,345.  A single pensioner can have up to £37,150 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £74,300 before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
    <P>In addition, the effective assessment rates of capital have been lowered for most recipients with capital.  For example, under the former arrangements the effective assessment rate for all levels of capital for old age non-contributory pension purposes was approximately 10 per cent in the case of single people and 5 per cent for a married couple.  Under the new procedures, capital of up to £20,000 is now assessed progressively up to a rate of 6.75 per cent in the case of a single pensioner and up to a rate of 3 per cent in the case of a married pensioner couple.  As only about 2 per cent of single old age pensioners and 4 per cent of married pensioners have capital in excess of £20,0000, the new arrangements have improved the income position of the vast majority of old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>In formulating proposals for the 1999 budget, my main priority for pensioners will be to continue to improve the basic level of pensions, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 by the year 2002.  In this regard, the 1998 budget provided for a special increase of £5 per week for pensioners aged 66 and over &mdash; the largest increase which has been provided for the elderly since the early 1980's.  It should be noted that all old age non-contributory pensioners, including those on reduced rates by virtue of having capital, received this £5 increase in full.  The question of further improving the capital assessment procedures for pensioner would have to be examined in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>In general terms, the disincentives to employment for couples without children are substantially lower than those facing families with children.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of ways in which the social welfare system provides encouragement to couples without children to avail of full-time and part-time employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>For instance, in the case of people who have been unemployed for more than one year, the back to work allowance scheme operated by my Department enables such people to engage in employment while retaining 75 per cent, 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively of their welfare payment over a three year period.  For people wishing to engage in self-employment, the period of support is extended to four years, with an allowance equivalent to 100 per cent of their welfare payment payable in the first year.  Participants in the scheme are also entitled to retain any secondary benefits held prior to starting on the scheme, provided that gross household weekly income does not exceed £250.  I should mention also that the job assist scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners provides another avenue of support for people who have been unemployed for more than one year and who take up full-time employment.</P>
      <P>In so far as part-time employment is concerned, the arrangements for the assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes are designed to ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance.  These arrangements provide that an unemployed person who works up to three days a week may, subject to the level of his or her earnings, qualify for a reduced unemployment assistance payment for that week. For persons without children, a £10 disregard for each day worked is allowed, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that since November 1997 regulations provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and a number of other payments.  Previously, the entitlement to the qualified adult allowance was lost once the earnings of the spouse or partner of a claimant exceeded £60. Under the new arrangements, however, the allowance continues to be paid on a sliding scale until the earnings of the spouse or partner exceeds £90, thus providing a greater incentive to such people to engage in part-time work.</P>
      <P>I believe in summary that the current system offers a great deal of positive encouragement for couples without children to engage in full-time and part-time employment.</P>

      <P>Over the last 12 months, from the end of September 1997 to the end of September 1998, the numbers on the live register decreased by 30,154.  This represents a decrease of 12 per cent of the total live register.  Its achievement was due to the continuing success of the strategies and policies being pursued by this Government.</P>
      <P>Much of the decrease in the live register over the period in question was anticipated when the estimates for 1997 and 1998 were being framed. For example, the average live register on which the 1998 Estimates were framed was 232,000.  This compared with an actual average live register of 254,400 for 1997.  This very substantial decrease, resulted in a reduction of around £84 million in the amount otherwise required for unemployment payments in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual decrease in the live register this year has been even better than had been anticipated when the estimates were being granted.  It is now forecast that the live register for 1998 will average <Col N="1386" /> around 229,000 and this will result in an additional reduction of £11 million approximately in unemployment payments this year.</P>

      <P>The free TV licence scheme is available to people aged 66 or over who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  Certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments also qualify.  In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free TV licence scheme retain that entitlement.  More than 200,000 people qualified for this scheme in 1997 at an annual cost of some £14 million.</P>
      <P>The range of the free schemes currently available does not include assistance towards the cost of cable television or other forms of deflected television systems.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to another question on 29 September, as well as in my statement to the House on 1 October, the Government is gravely concerned at the situation in Kosovo.  I have availed of every opportunity, at EU level, to stress the need for an adequate response to this situation, including at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Salzburg last moonth and also at a further meeting of EU Foreign Ministers which took place in New York on 22 September. I ensured that our views were put forward at the General Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 5 October.  In my statement on 1 October I set out in detail what the Government is doing in support of efforts to ensure that the Belgrade authorities fulfil the demands required of them <Col N="1387" /> by Resolution 1199 which was adopted by the UN Security Council on 23 September.</P>
      <P>I welcome the speedy publication on 5 October of the report of the UN General Secretary, Mr Kofi Annan, which spells out clearly both the large scale of non-compliance since the adoption of Resolution 1199 by Belgrade with its terms, and also the actions which the FRY authorities have yet to take to ensure that its terms are put fully into effect.  I note in particular the reiterated condemnation by the Secretary General of the recent atrocities and of the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, and I fully share his views.  Resolution 1199 calls for international intervention under a number of headings.  It demands that all parties, groups and individuals cease hostilities and maintain a cease-fire and that the authorities in Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership take immediate steps to improve the humanitarian situation and to avert the impending humanitarian catastrophe.  It calls on both sides to enter immediately into a meaningful dialogue without preconditions and with international involvement.  It calls on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to enable effective and continuous international minority in Kosovo, and to facilitate the safe return of refugees and displaced persons, in agreement with the UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
      <P>On 23 September, the Security Council decided to consider further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace and stability in the region should the concrete measures demanded by the resolution not be taken.  The Security Council is now considering the Secretary General's report.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council at its meeting of 5 October underlined the urgency of full and immediate compliance with the terms of Resolution 1199.  It called for an immediate end to violence and for the start of early negotiations with a view to a political solution of the crisis.  The Council condemned in the strongest terms those responsible for the recent atrocities and called on the authorities in Belgrade immediately to investigate, identify and punish those responsible.  It welcomed the initiative of the Presidency to send forensic experts to examine the killings of civilians in Kosovo.  Ministers also expressed their determination to further increase the effectiveness of the existing EU sanctions regime, and to ensure that the EU makes the fullest possible contribution to the international community's pressure on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. With regard to this last commitment, I intend to pursue, in the EU, the strengthening of sanctions and the consideration of possible additional measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers in her question to reports of Contact Group discussions.  Ireland is not a member of this group which comprises Austria &mdash; in its capacity as EU Presidency &mdash; France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom and the <Col N="1388" /> United States.  I understand that the Contact Group will be meeting today and that there will be a special meeting of the NATO Council tomorrow.  Both of these meetings are expected to take account of the current round of talks of international intermediaries with the Government in Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that President Milosevic will by now have a full appreciation of the strength of international feeling on the situation in Kosovo and that he will, without delay, take the necessary steps to start political dialogue, ensure that his forces are genuinely withdrawn and not redeployed, and fulfil, without equivocation and in full, the terms of Resolution 1199.</P>

      <P>Ireland views the debt burden on many developing countries as a major challenge for the entire international community.  It is this concern which lay behind the comprehensive debt relief package recently announced by the Minister for Finance and myself, which commits funds of more than £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor countries.</P>
      <P>As regards debt cancellation, I appreciate and respect the views of Jubilee 2000, while also noting that few Governments, from developed or developing countries, have adopted the position of calling for total debt cancellation.  As regards Ireland's position, we will strongly encourage the international community to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation and we support in this context the call of the G8 countries for bilateral aid-related debt forgiveness.</P>
      <P>In respect of general bilateral and multilateral debt, I wish to emphasise that the position taken to date by developing countries is to generally favour reducing the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development.  Ireland, as stated in the principles announced by the Government, will continue to use every opportunity to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the 1999 Estimates have not been finalised.  Funding is not allocated <Col N="1389" /> in advance to particular humanitarian emergencies. However, I can say that it is proposed to allocate at least the same overall amount of resources to the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund within the Development Co-operation budget as in 1998.  This allows the Government to respond to emergencies as they arise.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned about the humanitarian situation arising from the conflict in Sudan and have, with the Department of Agriculture, given almost £1.4 million in emergency assistance so far this year.  One of the conclusions of my own visit there in August was that emergency assistance will need to continue to be provided on a very large scale over the next 12 months if famine is to be avoided.  A technical mission from the Department of Foreign Affairs will travel to the region at the end of this month to monitor the impact of resources given so far this year and to plan for 1999.</P>
      <P>Irish aid has had a bilateral development programme in operation in Sudan since 1975.  In common with other Irish aid bilateral country programmes, the activities in the Sudan country programme had a planned duration and we have now reached the point where it is appropriate to conclude the programme activities.  Given our continuing concern over the policies of the Sudanese Government, it is not considered appropriate at this time to undertake an entirely new bilateral programme.  The programme office, which has been implementing our bilateral programme, will, therefore, be closed at the end of this year. This approach is similar to that taken by our partners in the EU.  The closure of the bilateral country programme will not effect the substantial humanitarian assistance measures already outlined.</P>

      <P>Stratospheric ozone concentrations over Ireland have been monitored continuously since 1993 at Met Éireann's weather station Valentia Observatory in Caherciveen, County Kerry.  In addition, during the winter months, special balloons are launched from the observatory to measure the vertical variation of ozone.</P>
      <P>In addition to Met Éireann's input, other sources of funding for this ozone monitoring have included the EU STRIDE programme and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  These programmes involve partners in Ireland and abroad, notably the chemistry department of UCD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phenomena involved in ozone depletion will be investigated in great detail during the <Col N="1390" /> coming winter in the Third European Stratospheric Ozone Experiment &mdash; THESOE.  Valentia Observatory will play a significant role in ozone monitoring for THESOE.  There is a clear link between increased Ultra Violet-B Uv-B radiation levels and ozone depletion.  UV-B levels are monitored continuously at sites in Donegal, Galway and Kerry.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 to date, there has been clear evidence of a 7 per cent thinning of the ozone layer over mid-latitudes.  Extremely low temperatures at the North Pole are required for springtime ozone depletion due to chloroflurocarbons &mdash; CFCs &mdash; and other ozone depleting chemicals. Such conditions have existed in recent winters &mdash; 1994-97 &mdash; leading to below average ozone values over Ireland and the rest of northern Europe. Conditions in the 1997-98 winter were milder and so current ozone values are closer to long-term averages.  However, the overall trend of stratospheric ozone concentration over Europe is downward.</P>

      <P>By 5 October a total number of 13,538 claims for Army hearing loss compensation have been received.  The records indicate that approximately 35 per cent to 40 per cent of such claims relate to serving members of the Defence Forces.  Settlements have been reached in a total of 1,646 cases and court awards following hearing have been made in 123 cases.  A further 99 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Of the total number of claims finalised the records show that approximately 35 per cent refer to serving members of the Defence Forces.  In respect of the 1,868 cases finalised the cost of compensation has been £41.4 million and accrued plaintiffs' costs have been £11.7 million, namely, a total cost of £53.1 million.  A breakdown of the number of claims received from serving soldiers in each military <Col N="1391" /> barracks is not readily available and I will send them to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Subsequent to the retirement of the previous barrack foreman of works &mdash; BFW &mdash; in August 1997, the carpenter at Stephens Barracks was successful in securing promotion to the BFW vacancy.  He continues to serve in the barracks.  There is no particular fixed number of civilian appointments established in respect of the complement of civilian employees either in Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny, or at any other military establishment. Civilian employees are recruited from time to time for service with various military units in the light of relative priorities and needs.  There are no proposals at present to increase the size of the civilian maintenance staff at Stephens Barracks Kilkenny.  The existing level of staffing is considered adequate to meet the normal routine maintenance tasks likely to arise.  The following tabular statement sets out the numbers and categories employed over recent years.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with the provisions of section 1020 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1977, a married couple are taxed as single persons throughout the year of assessment in which the marriage takes place. However, if after the end of that year the total tax paid by the couple in that year is greater than the tax which would have been payable had they been married, a refund can be claimed.  This is explained in the Revenue Commissioners' publication, Taxation of Married Persons, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On 17 September the taxpayer notified the inspector of taxes of his marriage.  In view of his particular circumstances which included an undertaking that his wife would not be taking up employment before 5 April 1999, the inspector concessionally agreed to grant him the married personal allowance.  A certificate of tax-free allowances was issued accordingly on a week one basis with effect from 21 September 1998.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the issue of the married tax-free allowance was already concessional the inspector could not backdate such issue.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, taken in the past 12 months to validate the cardiac surgery waiting list; the number of persons on this waiting list in June 1997 who have been removed from it due to the person's death or the person opting for private treatment; the number of persons on the cardiac waiting list for less than six months, between six and 12 months, and more than 12 months; and the hospital and health board area concerned in each case.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested regarding the number of patients removed from the list due to the person's death or the person opting for private treatment is not routinely collected by the Department. However, I have requested this information from the agencies concerned.  I will communicate with the Deputy on this matter, and also on the steps taken to validate the list, in due course.</P>
      <P>Regarding the numbers waiting for cardiac surgery, at the end of June, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,142 adults and 69 children on the public cardiac surgery waiting list.  A breakdown of this list on an agency basis is contained in the following Table 1.  The Deputy will note from Table 2 that the end of June 1998 waiting list total compares favourably with the figures for the same period last year, showing a reduction of 24 per cent for adults awaiting surgery and 32 per cent for children.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that postgraduate training programmes of both dental schools in orthodontics and other disciplines adequately reflect current and future needs of the public dental service under the Health Strategy and the Dental Health Action Plan.  My Department recently had discussions with the heads of the two dental schools on this issue.  Following these discussions the chief dental officer of my Department requested the joint committee for specialist training in dentistry &mdash; JCSTD &mdash; to arrange a visitation to the regional orthodontic units in Dublin, Galway and Cork by the specialist advisory committee &mdash; SAC &mdash; in orthodontics and paediatric dentistry.  The purpose of the visitation by the SAC is to provide independent assessment of the suitability of the trainees working in the units, the proposed training programmes and the training centres for post graduate training in orthodontics. I understand that the request for a visitation will be considered at the next meeting of the SAC.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Western Health Board and I understand that the person concerned applied for a refund under the drugs refund scheme and not the drug cost subsidisation scheme as stated.  Under the drugs refund scheme, persons whose expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines for use in a specified three month period, commencing on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October exceeds £90 are eligible to claim a refund of their expenditure in excess of that amount.  This includes expenditure in respect of dependants.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has indicated that the application concerned included a receipt for £72.27 in respect of prescribed medicines purchased on 30 June 1998 and as this medication was deemed for use in the following calendar quarter, no refund was made.  The person concerned was advised that this outstanding expenditure will be reckonable as expenditure for the July-September quarter.</P>

      <P>The Health Act, 1970, as amended by the 1991 Act, introduced the criteria of &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; for determining eligibility for health services in Ireland.  Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he/she satisfies the health board that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.  Under EU regulations a person on a temporary visit to Ireland from another EU or EEA country has an entitlement to urgent necessary treatment on the same basis as residents of Ireland and certain categories of such persons have full eligibility for health services.</P>
      <P>Where a person is deemed not to be &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland and is not covered by EU regulations the hospital may apply the full economic charge for any services provided. However, in exceptional cases, a health board has the discretion to provide urgent medical treatment at a reduced charge or without charge where application of the full economic charge would cause undue hardship.  I have referred the case of the person concerned to the chief executive officer of South-Eastern Health Board to have the matter investigated and have asked him to reply directly to you.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>While my Department did not host any event for the recent international day, Ireland fully supports action at EU and wider international level to protect the ozone layer.  Further proposals in this regard were considered by the EU Council of Environment Ministers on 6 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of reports on the development of illegal trade in CFCs and other ozone depleting substances.  The amendments to the Montreal Protocol, which were agreed at the Ninth Meeting of the Parties in 1997, included a requirement to establish a system for licensing the import and export of ozone depleting substances to enhance international efforts to curb illegal trade in these substances.  European Community legislation, which already provides for a licensing system, is being further developed to take account of the recent amendments to the Montreal Protocol.  My Department is engaged in consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the enforcement of import and export controls, <Col N="1417" /> with regards to making provision for addressing illegal trade in CFCs and other ozone depleting substances.</P>

      <P>The law relating to cruelty to animals is set out in the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  My Department's responsibilities in relation to animals, relate to the licensing and control of dogs. Section 18 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, provides that a person who is convicted of the offence of cruelty to a dog may, in addition to any penalty prescribed under those Acts, be disqualified from keeping a dog for such period as the court thinks fit.  I intend to arrange for consultations with animal welfare interests to explore any dog control related problems arising in the context of intensive breeding of dogs.  I will consider what action, if any, may be required following these consultations.</P>

      <P>Waiting days have been a feature of the disability benefit scheme since its inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.</P>
      <P>The principal reason for the application of a three waiting day period is to avoid the disproportionately high administrative costs which would be involved in processing disability benefit claims of a very short duration.  As many employers have occupational sick pay arrangements which provide compensation for employees for short spells of incapacity, the waiting day rule also serves to reduce the overlap between State and occupational sick pay provision.</P>
      <P>In addition, it can reasonably be expected that most workers would be able to absorb the loss of the first three days earnings without suffering undue hardship.  However, where a person has a subsequent spell of incapacity in quick succession, then the three waiting day rule is waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be emphasised that workers are not <Col N="1418" /> generally left without any financial support during the three waiting day period.  Where a person has no recourse to occupational sick pay and has no other income, supplementary welfare allowance can be paid.</P>
    <P>While I have no plans at present to amend the three day waiting period for disability benefit purposes, my Department will continue to keep the operation of this rule under review.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that increasing the basic allowance by £1 per week would cost £7.6 million.  Any increase in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last five years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £45 million in 1997.  This year a sum of £45.2 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This applies to long-term payments, including invalidity pension, only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, and short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In the 1998 budget this policy direction has been continued through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit has been increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3.00 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.00. In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins has been introduced from September of this year.</P>

      <P>The death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person, or on the death of the spouse, widow, widower or child of an insured person under 18 years.  The purpose of the grant is to help with funeral and other post-bereavement expenses.</P>
      <P>There are other measures in place, which are designed to assist people in the immediate after-math of bereavement.  For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her qualified adult for six weeks.  In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his/her weekly income.  These payments, known as exceptional needs payments, may be made towards funeral expenses where it is established that there is an inability to meet the costs by the family concerned.  The present arrangements are being examined and any proposals in this regard would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The average time to process appeals which were finalised in August 1998, the most recent period for which figures are available, was 20 weeks.  The average time taken to process those appeals which were determined following an oral hearing was 30 weeks.  To date in 1998, the proportion of appeals determined by appeals officers following an oral hearing is 53 per cent.</P>
      <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of the particulars supplied by the appellant and by the deciding officer, without the need for an oral hearing, and these are cleared more quickly.  The average time for these appeals summarily dealt with in August 1998 was just under 13 weeks.  When an oral hearing is required, however, additional delay is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is quasijudicial and the procedures are designed to ensure that every appellant's case receives full and adequate consideration.  There is an inevitable time-lag in such a process.  In some cases delay may be due to material from the appellant being awaited by the appeals officer before a decision can be made.  Delay can also occur when the grounds advanced by the appellant in support of the appeal require further investigation or, in sickness related cases, where arrangements are made for a further examination by a medical assessor.  Oral hearings arranged by the appeals office may also have to be postponed at the request of the appellant or his/her legal representatives, because of other commitments by them or because more time is sought by them in order to prepare their case.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the social welfare appeals office.  At all times, however, it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is fully consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that the appeal of every person who has recourse to the office is fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance weekly rate less £6. <Col N="1421" /> This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) rate. The current SWA rate for an adult is £68.40 per week.  Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The limits are set by the health board using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed annually to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. Health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within these limits.</P>
      <P>In addition, health boards must be satisfied that the rent payable by the applicant is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence and is reasonable having regard to the applicant's residential needs.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the Deputy is referring to people who, while resident in Ireland, are in receipt of social security pensions paid by institutions outside the State.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance of £6.00 per week is to recognise the extra cost of living alone.  It is payable as an addition to weekly social welfare pensions to people aged 66 years of age or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments, and who reside alone.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to extend this allowance to people in receipt of a social security pension-benefit from a country covered by EU regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  I would point out, however, that this does not preclude low income pensioners from qualifying for the free schemes, provided that they are in receipt of a qualifying payment, for example in this instance, from another EU member state, or that they satisfy a means test and are living alone or with certain categories of excepted people.</P>

      <P>In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property.  In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, any claimant, irrespective of age, whose sole means are derived from the assessment of board and lodging in the parental home and who is entitled to less than £25 per week, has his or her payment increased to £25.</P>
      <P>One of the principal arguments for the abolition or relaxation of the benefit and privilege rule for young unemployed people is that the operation of this rule encourages them to leave the family home in order to qualify for higher unemployment assistance payments and rent supplements. However, the limited research which is available highlights that the reasons for young people leaving home is a highly complex process with many different facets, including the pattern of full-time education participation and the nature of employment sought.  Most interestingly, in this context, the research found that unemployed people were the slowest group to move out of the family home.</P>
      <P>While these results must be interpreted in the light of the complex factors which prevail in the decision to move out, they do not lend support to a view that unemployed young people are more likely to leave the family home because of the qualification conditions for unemployment assistance or rent supplements.  Nevertheless, my Department will continue to review this area in the light of any new evidence which becomes available.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been achieved in recent years in reducing the incidence and effects of poverty and unemployment traps in the social welfare system.  Among the measures which have contributed to this improvement are: the continued enhancement of child benefit as part of a strategy of making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents; the introduction of net income assessment for the purposes of determining entitlement to family income supplement; the introduction of a tapered qualified adult allowance, which provides for the retention of the allowance, at a reduced level, when the earnings of the spouse or partner of a social welfare claimant has earnings of between £60 and £90 per week; the revision of the means testing <Col N="1425" /> arrangements governing entitlement to unemployment assistance, which ensure that claimants have an incentive to work for up to three days at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance; the continued enhancement of the back-to-work allowance scheme and the back-to-education programme operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>On a general level, my Department constantly monitors the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives are removed.  This is in line with the national anti-poverty strategy which identifies tackling unemployment as one of the key areas for helping people out of poverty.  I am determined to continue to work towards ensuring that the welfare system is fully responsive to the needs of the unemployed and particularly the long-term unemployed and that it provides real opportunities to such people to break out of the cycle of unemployment.  In this regard, I will be examining the potential for the introduction of further measures in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following statement.  The most notable increase in expenditure has been in respect of rent supplements. Several factors have contributed to this increase such as large increases in rent levels; the lack of availability of local authority housing, particularly for single people; easing of eligibility criteria in certain circumstances to ease the transition from welfare to work; and the growth of marriage breakdown and the increase of one parent families which have lead to increased household formation and a consequent greater demand for rent supplements.</P>
      <P>An inter-departmental committee, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is examining the implications of transferring the administration of rent supplements to local authorities.  I understand that it is expected to report shortly.</P>

A recommended classroom size of 600 square feet or 15 square feet per pupil was specified in The Rules for National Schools, published in 1965.  The recommended classroom size <Col N="1430" /> was subsequently increased in the late 1970s to 70 square metres, approximately 750 square feet, to cater for changes in curriculum and enrolment patterns.  As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to his Question No. 45 of 23 June 1998, this recommended size is currently under review by the Education Research Centre in the context of curriculum developments and improved pupil-teacher ratios.</P>

      <P>The ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme, together with the higher education grants scheme, and the vocational education committee scholarship scheme comprise the third level maintenance grants schemes.</P>
      <P>The value of the maintenance grant under these schemes was increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1989-99 academic year.  This increase is in line with the practice in recent years to incresse third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.  The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been incresed to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £660 at the adjacent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were increased by 3.2 per cent, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1996 to March 1997. <Col N="1432" /> This is consistent with the approach adopted in recent years to determine the increase in income limits.  I also applied this increase to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that, under the change of circumstances provisions in the schemes, a candidate's eligibility can be reassessed in the event of a change in the candidate's reckonable income, which is likely to be permanant.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. My priority in relation to the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have honoured the commitment by way of introducing a maintenace grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants.  As the schemes are of general application it is not possible to make exceptions on behalf of individual candidates.</P>

      <P>One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service.  Earlier this year, my Department recruited 15 educational psychologists for the purpose of expanding the psychological service to primary schools.  One of these psychologists has been assigned to certain primary schools in County Offaly.</P>
      <P>On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be established.  I intend bringing proposals for the establishment of such a service to Government shortly.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 152 to 154, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standarised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this academic years.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for the third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, I was concerned about that portion of the charge, which is intended to fund student services and in particular, the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparancy and accountability.  The Higher Education Authority issued the framework to the publicly funded <Col N="1434" /> third level institutions at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide iformation as to the allocation of the charge towards exams/registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is co-ordinating a review of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial pressure placed on students, I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In relation to the proposal from the students union at the Institute of Technology in Carlow, the position is that the payment arrangements for the charge are a matter for the individual institutions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>My Department seeks to arrange a home pick-up/set-down service for all children attending special schools or special classes.  However, this does not prove possible in some cases due to the excessive costs involved; the distance or time factors involved; or the inability of the pupil to avail of a service because of the nature of his-her disability.  In such cases, my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport for the child to the nearest pick-up point or to the school.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupil.</P>
      <P>In the particular case in question, it was not possibel to arrange a home pick-up which would allow the child to be collected at a reasonable hour in the morning.  In these circumstances, a transport grant was offered to the child's parents to help defray their costs in transporting him to the nearest pick-up point.  However, I now understand that this arrangement is causing difficulty for the family of the child in question.  I have asked my officials to review the transport arrangements for the child with a view to improving the service being provided.</P>

      <P>The ESF-aided middle level technician programme consists of one or two year courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical-business skills programme consists of three year national diploma and one year &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; diploma level courses.  The programmes apply to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects.  The programmes only operate in Institutes of Technology in the State and St. Patrick's college, Carlow is not eligible to participate therein.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's college, Carlow is an approved college for the purposes of the higher education grants (HEG) scheme and the national certificate in applied studies (social care) is an approved course for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers was in receipt of an ESF-aided maintenance grant in 1997-98 in respect of her attendance at the first year of the national certificate in business studies (recreation and leisure) at Cork Institute of Technology. She transferred to St. Patrick's college Carlow in 1998-999 and is now pursuing the first year of the national certificate in social studies (social care).  While this is an approved course for the purposes of the HEG scheme, candidates who have previously pursued a undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the HEG scheme, the vocational educational committee scholarship scheme or the European Social Fund-aided maintenance grant scheme are not entitled to receive a grant under the HEG scheme until they have completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level.  Accordingly, the student in question will not qualify for grant or fee assistance until she enters the second year of the course in Carlow.</P>
      <P>This position of repeat students under the higher education grant scheme differs from that of repeat trainees under the European Social Fund-aided maintenance grant scheme, where, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, trainees who have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course are allowed to transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to take up the question of what the student was advised or her interpretation of the advice in relation to the tenure of the ESF grant with the relevant authority. I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of these investigations in due course.</P>
