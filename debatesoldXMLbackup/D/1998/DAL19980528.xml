    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies John Bruton, Rabbitte, Quinn and Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31 I move that the Dáil sitting be suspended to allow the Taoiseach make a comprehensive statement on his knowledge of the Fitzwilton plc donation to Mr. Ray Burke in 1989 and the dealings of the various Departments in which Mr. Burke served as Minister with companies associated with Fitzwilton plc before and after that donation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given notice of my intention to request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest, namely, the disclosure in <i>Magill</i> that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ray Burke, received a further donation of £30,000 in June 1989 from a subsidiary of Fitzwilton plc in addition to the similar donation from JMSE; that £10,000 of the donation passed on to Fianna Fáil headquarters came from the contribution of Rennicks Manufacturing rather than the JMSE contribution; the adequacy of the investigation carried out by the Taoiseach into the financial affairs of Mr. Burke prior to his appointment as a Minister; the links, if any, between the Rennicks donation and public policy decisions; and the need for the Taoiseach to make a comprehensive statement to the House on his investigations into and knowledge of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek leave to adjourn the Dáil to discuss the entire implications for the House of the article published in <i>Magill.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to have the business of the Dáil suspended to allow the Taoiseach make a clear statement on the disclosure in <i>Magill</i> which <Col N="934" /> exposes inconsistencies and misleading statements made in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 31.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I give notice that I have submitted a Private Notice Question to the office of the Ceann Comhairle on the same topic and I earnestly request that he allow it in view of the serious nature of the matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8<i>a</i>, motion re Priority Questions, No. 8<i>b</i>, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, No. 23, the Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages, and No. 5, the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate and that the Dáil on rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we should have a debate today during Government time on what the Taoiseach knew about the donations to Mr. Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the motion regarding Priority Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I do not think we should take any motions without debate. I give notice that in light of the fact that the Government has not volunteered that the Taoiseach will give information on this subject, we cannot agree to any Government motions on the Order of Business.  The priority business of the House should be an explanation from the Taoiseach regarding what he knew about Ray Burke's dealing with Fitzwilton-related companies in 1989 when the Taoiseach was a member of the Government, and what and when he knew about the truth regarding the £10,000 paid by Mr. Burke to Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach has an obligation to explain these matters and it is in his interest and that of the House that it be done today, not next week.  The matter should not become the subject of weekend speculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we deal with both proposals on the Order of Business I will allow a brief comment from party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter which can <Col N="935" /> adequately be dealt with by brief comments from party leaders.  We want a full debate with provision for questions and answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy tables a substantive motion there can be a full debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not agree to any Government proposals on the Order of Business unless and until the Taoiseach agrees to personally explain to the House his knowledge and involvement in all these matters and fully answers questions regarding them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the House we are dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not accepting the Order of Business.  We agreed to it at the meeting of the Whips but that was before the knowledge we now have was available.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate, on the basis of the Private Notice Question, that a proper statement will be made by him and that time will be provided after Question Time for this matter to be dealt with in the manner suggested by Deputy Bruton.  We cannot have a weekend of speculation and innuendo.  Everybody in the country can speak about the matter but we cannot.  The person who has the information is a Member of the House.  He inadvertently misled the House earlier this year and now he has the opportunity to put the record straight. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider and to give an undertaking to change the Order of Business and order statements for after Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow another brief comment before the Taoiseach replies.  The matter cannot be debated now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>All Opposition parties tabled requests for the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31.  Those requests have been refused so we have no option but to oppose proposals by the Government for the day's business unless they include an arrangement for the Taoiseach to explain what he knew about the donations received by Mr. Burke, about which the former Minister made misleading statements to the House last September.</P>
      <P>I agree this matter should be dealt with after Question Time but the period available between Question Time and the Adjournment is less than an hour and it is not possible to deal with this matter in that time.  Today's sitting should be extended to provide for an adequate debate, including statements and questions and answers, on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business was agreed by the Whips.  Five motions under Standing Order 31 have been put down.  As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, I never seek to influence or <Col N="936" /> even comment on such motions to his office.  I followed that policy today and have done for the past 11 months.  I did not know whether the Ceann Comhairle would accept the motions.  If they had been accepted, there would have been a debate on this matter later today.</P>
      <P>For once I agree with Deputy Bruton.  I would be glad to make a statement to the House.  I did not mislead the House and if others did, that is a matter for them.  I would like to make a statement today and I am willing to answer any questions I can.  I am conscious that the Flood and Moriarty tribunals are continuing their inquiries.  That some of these matters are now in the public domain arises or at least partly arises from the fact that when my party was dealing with orders of discovery or affidavits for the tribunals, it gave full and comprehensive answers.  Those issues are now in the public domain.</P>
      <P>I am sure the inquiries will follow them up but it is not satisfactory that I have not had an opportunity to say my piece.  I hope the Whips can agree on a suitable procedure because I wish to make a statement today and to answer questions. I hope I will have that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is a matter for the House.  As Deputy De Rossa pointed out, if time is not ordered now, time might not be available for an adequate discussion.  We need answers not just about what the Taoiseach knew but on the dealings of Mr. Burke as Minister with responsibility for communications, a portfolio which both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil agreed he should hold regardless of what other responsibilities he held.</P>
      <P>Answers are required on what he did and why he did it with regard to matters concerning communications.  That cannot be dealt with quickly.  The Taoiseach can probably deal with our concerns regarding the donation to Fianna Fáil comparatively quickly but the other matter, which is also of grave moment, concerns the integrity of decision making in the State and requires extensive treatment.  The debate should commence at midday and not be delayed until after Question Time.  It could recommence after Question Time.  A one and a half hour debate would not be adequate to deal comprehensively with all the matters involved.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I are on the same wave-length on one matter at least, that this matter must be dealt with comprehensively and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions at issue are serious and time is required to enable all participants to prepare adequately for them.  On the motion for the Order of Business my party will seek a debate of two hours duration to facilitate an accurate and meaningful discussion.  This should take place after Question Time and should continue until 6 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help us to prepare for the debate if the Taoiseach told the House what reassurances he gave the Tánaiste which caused her to offer such a fulsome defence of Mr. Burke at the time.  It might also help us to prepare if the examination and investigation by Deputy Dermot Ahern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of suggestions have been made.  Deputy Quinn seeks a period of two hours, Deputy De Rossa said the period after Question Time is not long enough and Deputy Bruton wants adequate time.  It is a matter for the Whips.  I do not care what is decided because I am ready and will be here all day anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful if the Government Whip would come before the House at a specified time &mdash; I suggest midday &mdash; to make an announcement regarding the Order of Business. Perhaps we should reconvene at that time so we will know what the Government proposes and we can make whatever decisions or amendments we wish to make to the order.  It would be constructive if midday were agreed as the time limit.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive copyright Bill was promised by the Government.  When is that likely to be published?  The Bill before the House is an abstract, four section Bill.  I do not wish to give the impression that I do not welcome it because a rumour was circulated that preparation of legislation had been closed down in that Department.  After 11 months this is the first Bill the House has received from these three photogenic Ministers.  There are major issues involved in copyright legislation but the Bill before the House is simply an abstract to overcome a problem. Is the major Bill imminent?</P>

      <P>The Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998 fast tracks the penalties issues.  A complaint was made by the United States to the World Trade Organisation and this Bill is necessary to tackle that problem.  A comprehensive copyright Bill of more than 400 sections is currently being prepared and should be ready by July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach on promised legislation.  With regard to the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, June 1995 was the deadline by which the Irish Government had to alert the European Commission about special areas of conservation.  It is nearly three years since that deadline was set.  Has there been a speeding up of preparation of the wildlife Bill in light of that shameful fact?  What is the position in regard to the promise made by the Tánaiste that by March or April 1998 we would have the Administrative Procedures Bill, a Bill to give to citizens rights in dealing with public institutions following the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will be ready in late 1998.  A revised draft of 78 sections has been sent to the parliamentary draftsman.  The Administrative Procedures Bill will be included in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill which will be ready next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I raised previously the Government's proposal to introduce legislation to <Col N="939" /> regulate the private security industry and a Private Members' Bill on the issue was turned down.  The Taoiseach said that the Government was awaiting the report of an expert group.  That group reported some months ago, yet there is no mention of the matter on the Government's list of promised legislation.  At what stage of preparation is the legislation and when will it be introduced? The present position where anybody may set up a private security firm is wide open to exploitation by criminal elements.  In that regard I wish the Garda well in its intervention in the Caple Street siege and hope it brings the matter to an early and speedy conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is with the Minister who made statements on the issue during Private Members' time.  No specific legislation is promised on that matter, but the Minister will make a statement on it shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct one suggestion on special areas of conservation and ask the Taoiseach a question.  On the wildlife Bill, in view of the fact that the directive referred to was signed in February 1997 and the listing of sites is outstanding, when will the list of sites be forwarded to the European Union?  Is it proposed to bring forward separate legislation on cross-ownership of the media ahead of and separate from the broadcasting legislation so that there is no conflict of interest between owners of newspapers, radio and those who may be applicants or make tenders to provide delivery systems for digitalisation?  Such legislation on cross-ownership was brought forward by a backbench committee of the Tories in Britain and is hardly radical. Will cross-ownership legislation be put in place to eliminate the possibility of abuse of their position by people who may have beneficial interest in those making applications for multiplex systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the details of listed areas, that is a matter for the Minister.  On the second question, there is no such legislation.  The Deputy advocated that the Minister should consider Tory legislation, at which I am surprised, but I will bring that to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be confusion let me expand on that point.  Even the Tories saw the dangers of predators attacking the communications system.  Will the broadcasting legislation include a prohibition on cross-ownership or alternatively will other legislation dealing with cross-ownership be put in place before tenders are advertised and licences sought for the delivery of multiplex systems?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment facilitates a view expressed on Committee Stage by one of the Government backbenchers who felt that a six-month period would be more appropriate than two months.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 as a whole aims at striking the right balance between, on the one hand, ensuring that legal proceedings challenging decisions on motorway schemes or roads-related environmental impact statements can be brought to finality expeditiously and, on the other hand, safeguarding the right of the individual to challenge those decisions where he or she considers it necessary to do so.  In section 5 and the related part of section 4 the correct balance is being achieved.  Having considered the points made on Committee Stage, I remain of the view that two months is a reasonable and sufficient amount of time for lodging an application for leave to apply for judicial review.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House expressed concern on a number of occasions at the length of time it takes to bring major infrastructural projects to reality.  In that context, it would be inconsistent as well as unnecessary to amend the Bill as proposed.  I ask the Deputy to reflect on this and to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was moved by the arguments put forward from the Minister's party on Committee Stage.  We are amending legislation in this area to give communities sufficient time to access proposals and, if necessary, get external professional advice.  A two month period is not sufficient for that process.  During the Committee Stage debate members of the Minister's party suggested a six month period, but I considered a four month period would be more reasonable.  It would not disrupt the process or cause an inordinate delay, but it would give communities an opportunity to monitor developments that might impact on their lives.  Will the Minister reconsider this suggestion? By way of compromise, a three month period would be a welcome improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if we will reach consensus on this point.  A number of factors were taken into account when deciding the two month limit.  The two month provision gives a longer period &mdash; five months &mdash; to make a challenge to a motorway scheme.  Under the relevant part of the CPO law &mdash; which until the enactment of this Bill applies to challenges to motorway schemes &mdash; proceedings must be initiated within three weeks of notice of the decision being published. The High Court has discretion to extend the period from two months if it believes there is sufficient reason to do so and there is no time limit on any such extension by the court.  A two month period was considered appropriate by the House when enacting the Local Government (Planning <Col N="943" /> and Development) Act, 1992 in so far as it concerned challenges to planning decisions by local authorities or An Bord Pleanála and similar provisions were enacted more recently in the Waste Management Act, 1996 in respect of decisions by the EPA on waste licences.  No reason has been put forward to justify road projects being treated differently.</P>
      <P>We should bear in mind that the ministerial decisions concerned do not come out of nowhere. They are a product of long periods of project planning by local authorities and the NRA which involves the provision of information to, and consultation with, local individuals and groups.  Also, submissions and objections would have been made to the Minister by individuals and groups and their views presented at the public inquiry. By the time the ministerial decision is made public, the major issues involved are likely to be well known to all interested parties.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to reflect on a case where a project is not a matter of controversy and is not likely to be the subject of a court challenge.  The effect of the amendments proposed would mean that, for no reason, a full four months would be lost before these projects could proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Minister of State did not come into the House with an open mind. Because the two month period is included in previous legislation, he has decided we cannot learn from a changing environment.  Since it appears I will not convince him, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;and the road authority concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This issue was also discussed in detail on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister had time to reflect on the points I made.  Section 5 which deals with judicial review at Section 55A.2<i>(b)</i> states that an application for judicial review &ldquo;shall be made by motion on notice (grounded in the manner specified in the Order in respect of an <i>ex parte</i> motion for leave) to the Minister and the road authority concerned,&rdquo;.  It should be made abundantly clear that responsibility lies with the Minister, not the road authority.  While the road authority may be notified subsequently, it would be more in keeping with general practice to delete &ldquo;the road authority&rdquo; from the subsection.</P>

      <P>While I understand Deputy Howlin's concern, when a Bill deals comprehensively with the need to provide information for the various actors involved, as this one does, we should leave it as it stands.  Deputy Howlin is making a very narrow legal point.  The inclusion of &ldquo;the <Col N="944" /> road authority&rdquo; in this case is desirable.  An application for a judicial review should concern the road authority.  I am satisfied with the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, when an application is made for a judicial review it is the Minister's decision that is being challenged.  However, it is important to note that his or her decision is fundamentally dependent on the motorway scheme or the EIS to which it relates and these are made by the local authority. It is reasonable, therefore, that the local authority should be given notice of an application for judicial review.  It is also likely to save time. Given that proceedings tend to revolve to a considerable extent around the actual motorway scheme or the EIS made by the local authority, it is appropriate that the local authority should be involved in the proceedings from the outset rather than delaying the case at a later stage while this is being done.  Moreover, the courts would probably expect this to be the case and require it in the interests of hearing all sides.</P>
      <P>Comparable provisions are contained in other codes.  For example, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992 requires that notice of legal proceedings be served on all the formal parties to a planning application or appeal.  Similarly, the Waste Management Act, 1996 requires that notice be served on the EPA and the applicant for a waste licence.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, consider the text as drafted as the more efficient and appropriate approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears my arguments on Committee Stage did not impress the Minister or the Fine Gael Party.  This amendment was designed to bring clarity to the matter because it is the Minister's order that is being challenged and that should be made clear.  However, I accept the logic of the case put forward and withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>On page 5, lines 37 and 38, to delete &ldquo;which leave shall only be granted where the High Court certifies that its decision&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or the Supreme Court which leave shall be granted only where the court certifies that the decision of the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was also debated on Committee Stage and, if I recall correctly, the Minister said he would consider it.  It relates to the question of an appeal once a determination is made by the High Court on a judicial review.  My amendment seeks to have the widest possible avenues of judicial appeal open to the parties concerned. This is normal procedure when appealing matters to the Supreme Court in a variety of other legal cases.  To foreclose that option in the case of a judicial review would simply narrow the normal <Col N="945" /> legal rights available to citizens under the judicial process designed by those who framed the Constitution and supported by the people.  I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect on this matter &mdash; which, if I recall correctly, enjoyed the support of Deputy Dukes on Committee Stage &mdash; and accept that the normal avenues of legal appeal should be open to parties in the case of a judicial review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Howlin correctly recollects, I supported this amendment on Committee Stage for the reasons he outlined.  My view has not changed, unless the Minister of State has a cogent reason for narrowing the avenues of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was proposed by the Deputy on Committee Stage and I undertook to come back on the issue.  However, in considering this amendment we must reflect again on the overall purpose of this section as agreed on Second Stage.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that legal proceedings challenging decisions on motorway schemes or environmental impact statements can be brought to finality as expeditiously as possible, bearing in mind the importance of having final and conclusive decisions on major road development proposals within a reason timescale.  Of course, objectors must have a proper and full opportunity to have their views taken into account and the section makes appropriate provision for this.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment, by enabling unrestricted access to the Supreme Court, would provide an unnecessary extra layer of review and frustrate the objective, which I think we all share, of allowing public works which are in the interests of the common good to proceed without undue delay.  It goes without saying that as far as major infrastructural projects are concerned, delay can often mean success for those who choose to pursue unreasonable individual objections to the detriment of the common good.</P>
      <P>Provisions comparable to those now proposed are contained in the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not reflected further and certainly has not been convinced by the case made on Committee Stage.  In recent years the number of judges sitting on the High Court Bench has expanded remarkably and there is a broad range of talents now available to the High Court.  Any judicial matter that comes before them can receive a variety of mixes of that talent.  While I am not being disparaging of any individual member of the High Court, because of that they are not all equally rounded and talented in every aspect of law.  There can be a divergence of view in relation to matters.  For the assurance of a common policy it is important that a review by the Supreme Court should be available to a claimant. <Col N="946" /> Otherwise, while I do not want to put it too crudely, there is currently an element of pot luck in who one gets in the High Court in relation to any particular matter.  If there is no other court of appeal beyond the decision of individual High Court judges, no matter how competent they are in other areas, it means one can have in the system an inconsistency which will not be to its benefit.  For that reason the fail-safe mechanism of guaranteeing a communality of policy through an ultimate Supreme Court decision-making proposal has merit and holds water in this regard.</P>
      <P>Rather than reading out the next paragraph in his brief, the Minister of State should reflect on this matter and see if it is possible to allow the full range of judicial appeal, which is open to anybody in a criminal case, to parties in judicial reviews of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is wrong to assume or act on the basis that every further appeal and the use of any further avenue is necessarily vexatious.  I think that is what the Minister of State is saying to us.  Undoubtedly, some are, but life is like that.  Of 100 cases that go to appeal there may indeed be five or ten that are vexatious &mdash; taken by people who simply will not recognise reality.  However, that is why our court system exists.  There are people there to judge and a hierarchy of courts.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Howlin is getting past the point at which he had me convinced, I agree with him on some of the things he said.  The fact that persons are appointed to the Bench of the High Court or the Supreme Court does not necessarily confer upon them an immediate accession to wisdom. I have seen courts do stupid things in the past and I have no doubt they will do so in future. However, it is a bit dangerous for Deputy Howlin to say that if we expanded the Bench far enough pot luck would give us a good result.  Even Deputy Howlin would not suggest that in the rarefied reaches of the top bench of the Labour Party there is always, necessarily, agreement on the points of pure wisdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that section 5 as drafted is fair and reasonable.  People concerned with the effects of a particular project will, when the section is enacted, have their views taken into account in a number of ways.  First, as regards the planning of infrastructural projects, the provision of information to and consultation with local individuals and groups is increasingly seen as essential to successful project development and implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, people are able to make written objections or submissions to the Minister as part of the motorway scheme and the EIA process.  Third, people can present their views at the statutory public inquiry and, fourth, there will be a preliminary hearing of the High Court in cases of an application for leave to apply for judicial review. Fifth, there will be a full hearing of the matter in the High Court where warranted and, sixth, there <Col N="947" /> will be consideration by the court of any application for leave to take the matter to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On this basis I do not think it can be reasonably concluded that insufficient opportunity is being given for individual views to be heard and taken into account.</P>

However, it is necessary, for constitutional reasons to ensure that the new restrictions on judicial review will not be struck down because they might be held to interfere with proceedings already under way or in being.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is with pleasure as well as a deep sense of responsibility that I introduce the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998.  This Bill represents a small first step in a root and branch reform of copyright law which is one of this Government's highest legislative priorities.  The principal instrument of that reform, the proposed Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998, is in an advanced state of preparation in my Department and I hope to be in a position to bring it before this House in the near future.</P>
      <P>The importance for the economy of providing a modern, effective and efficient regime of protection for copyright and related rights can scarcely be overstated.  Copyright is still often thought of mainly in terms of books and other written materials.  Yet, although the protection of this traditional area may be important, it goes only a little way to showing the importance of copyright in the commercial system as a whole.  Copyright and its related rights are designed to protect the essential economic interests of creators and owners of a wide range of intellectual assets, including dramatic, musical and artistic works, computer programmes, databases, sound recordings and broadcasts, as well as rights in live performances.  Without a strong regime of legal protection for copyright and related rights, the vitality of enterprise in all these areas could be blunted or destroyed.  Bearing that in mind, and given the enormous contribution of both the artistic and high technology sectors to the current success of the economy, Deputies will require little convincing of the vital need for a powerful system of protection for copyright and related rights in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present state of copyright legislation is far from satisfactory.  Many Deputies will be familiar with the remark that Ireland is, courtesy of St. <Col N="949" /> Colmcille and his book, the birthplace of copyright. Be that as it may, it cannot be argued that our record in updating this area of our legislation has been impressive in recent years.</P>
    <P>The last substantial reform was effected by the Copyright Act, 1963, which was to a large extent based on the United Kingdom Copyright Act of 1956.  In terms of primary legislation, the intervening period has been barren, apart from the limited Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1987. In the area of performers' rights, the Performers' Protection Act, 1968, afforded limited protection to the rights of performers under criminal law but, at least in any direct sense, did little to secure performers' rights in the civil field.  In addition, some secondary legislation has been introduced in the form of regulations under the European Communities Act with the aim of transposing certain European Community directives into Irish law.  However, Ireland is facing the 21st century with copyright legislation designed for the 1950s.</P>
    <P>This situation is profoundly unsatisfactory.  A copyright system designed for the 1950s and left to stand without revision or review cannot serve the needs of the cultural sector or of our modern information and entertainment industries, the more so when the principal Act upon which that system rests was expressed in technology specific terms appropriate to that period.  The Government is totally committed to sweeping away the archaic and outmoded system based on the Copyright Act, 1963, and to bringing forward a new regime of protection for copyright and related rights in line with the most stringent requirements of the information age.  This reform will be achieved for the most part in the forthcoming Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998.  It would be inappropriate to discuss the content of that measure in the context of the present Bill. However, it might be useful to indicate some of the principal objects informing its preparation.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention is that in place of the outmoded system of copyright and related rights protection currently in place, the new legislation will provide for a clear, transparent and logical system of protection for copyright and related rights, for performers' property rights and rights in performances, moral rights in copyright works and for intellectual property rights in databases. The Copyright and Related Rights Bill will include clear provisions on the assignment and transmission of rights and on the licensing of rights.  The existing provisions on infringement, offences, remedies and penalties will be replaced by a new regime clearly favouring the vindication of their rights by legitimate rightsholders and allowing for the imposition of penalties which are realistic by modern standards in relation to offences expressed in clear and comprehensive terms.</P>
    <P>Apart from its generally outdated quality, a specific criticism of current Irish copyright and related rights legislation is that there has been a failure to transpose into Irish law the terms of a number of European Union directives relevant to <Col N="950" /> this area and to bring Irish law into conformity with obligations incurred under international law on copyright and related rights.  I assure Deputies that it will be a specific objective of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998, to bring Irish law into full conformity with all the EU directives in question, as well as all relevant obligations under international law, including the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, known as the TRIPs Agreement.</P>
    <P>In view of its important and extensive subject matter, it will not surprise Deputies that the Copyright and Related Rights Bill will be one of the longest and most complex non-consolidation Bills to come before this House when, in the near future, the lengthy process of its preparation and drafting comes to an end.  In the meantime, the Government is pleased to bring forward the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, as a means of dealing with two serious deficiencies in the existing legislation as a matter of urgency and, perhaps more importantly, as an earnest of its determination to achieve comprehensive copyright reform at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The measures included in the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, may be briefly summarised as follows.  The Bill contains two substantive sections.  Section 2, which provides a replacement for the present section 26 of the Copyright Act, 1963, is designed to secure the following: that a presumption as to the subsistence of copyright in a work which is clearer than that contained in the Copyright Act, 1963, is put in place; that a clear presumption in favour of copyright rightsholders taking civil actions for breach of copyright, with the onus on defendants to rebut, is put in place; and that where a copy of a work carries or embodies a statement or mark identifying a party as the author, owner or exclusive licensee in relation to the copyright in that work, the identification thus established shall be presumed correct with the onus on defendants to rebut.</P>
    <P>The right of copyright rightsholders to take civil actions for breach of copyright will always be a vital part of the overall system of protection for copyright rights, and the provisions of section 2 are designed to establish clear presumptions which will facilitate copyright rightsholders in taking such actions.  The right to bring civil actions is only part of the answer to copyright infringement.  It must be supplemented with a regime of offences and penalties of sufficient severity to constitute a punishment and a deterrent proportionate to the seriousness of copyright theft as a commercial crime in the context of the modern economy.  In consequence of this, section 3 of the Bill amends section 27 of the 1963 Act, as amended by the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1987, providing for a regime of penalties in respect of copyright offences very much more severe than that contained in the existing legislation. Specifically, it provides for fines of up to £1,500 per offending item or up to one year's imprisonment, or both, in respect of summary <Col N="951" /> convictions for copyright offences in the District Court, and for fines of up to £100,000 or up to five years' imprisonment, in respect of convictions for copyright offences on indictment in the higher criminal courts.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to amend the specification of copyright offences contained in section 27 of the Copyright Act, 1963, in the context of the present Bill.  This specification can only be modernised in conjunction with the general modernisation of copyright legislation, and will, therefore, be dealt with in the forthcoming Copyright and Related Rights Bill.</P>
    <P>The Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is a limited measure, but it must be judged in the context of the Government's copyright policy as a whole.  Taken in conjunction with recent Garda successes in combating copyright piracy &mdash; on which I trust the force will accept my heartiest congratulations &mdash; and with our commitment to urgent and fundamental reform of the copyright system as a whole, the Bill should be seen as a clear signal of the Government's determination to see that a modern, effective and efficient system of protection is provided for copyright and related rights, and that those who would profit unfairly from the fruits of the intellectual labours of others are confronted and defeated.</P>
    <P>I am confident of the shared determination of Members to progress this major area of the reform of our law which is of vital importance to the continued health, not only of our cultural life, but of Irish industry in the information age.  I look forward to positive and constructive debate, not only on this Bill, but on the greater measure of copyright reform soon to come before this House, of which the present Bill is the merest harbinger.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is not opposing this Bill and will co-operate fully with the Government on it.  As the Minister pointed out our copyright laws date from 1963 with some minor amendments in 1987.  In light of the advances made in the past 36 years, and especially in recent years in the area of information technology, we have a great deal of catching up to do.  I understand it is intended to introduce the Copyright and Related Rights Bill shortly and that it will be one of the largest items of legislation ever introduced.  Given the contents of this Bill it will be challenging and I look forward to getting involved in its detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is, by comparison, a small one and strives to make minor changes in the law.  It is a precursor of what is promised.  I understand the Copyright (Amendment) Bill will be incorporated in its entirety into the Copyright and Related Rights Bill when introduced and eventually passed.  Why is the Government introducing the Bill at this time?  As pointed out earlier there has been a dearth of legislation from the Minister's Department during the year.  While the promised Bill has taken much time and effort, it would have been more useful if all the work could have been <Col N="952" /> presented together.  The truth is that the Government was threatened with legal action and possible sanctions by the United States because of the state of our legislation.  We could have been dragged before the World Trade Organisation because the Americans had complained that Ireland had not complied with certain trade related aspects of the intellectual property agreement.</P>
    <P>This situation has forced the Government to introduce this stop-gap measure in the hope of avoiding a most embarrassing series of sanctions. Will the Minister confirm that this finger in the dyke reaction will be enough to satisfy the United States, and possibly others, or are we wasting time debating this Bill when we should be working on the serious business of updating all the law in this area?</P>
    <P>We will not oppose this Bill and will not table amendments.  However, I ask the Minister of State and the Government to take on board and consider an aspect of the law which is a fundamental part of the Bill we wish to have amended in the legislation which is to follow.  The change I am about to suggest is such a major issue with the Government parties, Fianna Fáil in particular, that I feel it will not be contemplated.  Nevertheless, Fianna Fáil has abandoned many of its so-called core values in the past few years and I hope another change in direction will be made.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks the Minister for Education and Science talked about putting students who cheat in examinations into jail.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is known as the Minister for zero tolerance seems to see jails and prisons as the only answer to all crime.  In this Bill we see more of the same.  Fines or prisons are the sanctions to be imposed on a person found guilty of an offence under section 27 of the Principal Act, amended by the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the increase in severity of penalty, on summary conviction, from a fine of £100 to £1,500 and that the courts can also impose an alternative sentence not exceeding 12 months &mdash; whereas up to now it was six months &mdash; with the power to impose both a fine and a prison sentence, is this the best method?  We believe prison should be reserved for the most dangerous criminals, those who need to be taken out of circulation for the good and safety of society.  To put people into prison because they cannot or will not pay a fine adds to the overcrowding of prisons and leads to the revolving door syndrome.  The law breaker who does not pay a fine ends up in jail for a very short period.  This incarceration costs the State a great deal of money in time, manpower and resources and at the end of the day the lawbreaker is out on early release, not having paid a fine.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently where a gentleman was incarcerated in Cork prison for two days because he could not pay a fine of £500 for a minor offence.  This individual is one of the most harmless people I know and yet was incarcerated with dangerous criminals, rapists, murderers and <Col N="953" /> thugs.  Would community service orders or taking money from him, in instalments, have served him and society better and freed up valuable prison space?  While I am digressing slightly we should take cognisance of this in all legislation.  To put people into prison for non-violent crime is reaching back to the time of the debtors' prison in Victorian times when people were locked up and the key thrown away until they paid the debt.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Government to consider including in future legislation, as in this legislation, the explicit provision that money be deducted from wages, social welfare benefits or whatever, in instalments, and that community service orders be imposed in place of custodial sentences where it is clear the convicted person would not be a danger to society.  This would cost the State very little when compared with the cost of keeping a person in prison and the law breaker would pay much more in financial terms or by doing good for society.  God knows there is a great deal of community service that could be done.  We would have fewer people in prison and those sentenced would have a greater chance of serving their sentences which would do away with the revolving door system.  This would require a major about face on the part of Fianna Fáil, but we live in hope.</P>
    <P>We will not oppose the suggestion to increase the severity of penalties on conviction or indictment. The other major change that will be implemented under the Bill concerns the presumption of ownership.  In the past, the onus was on the person who could be identified by name, mark or work if challenged to prove ownership. The provision before us today turns this presumption on its head and the onus will now be on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff is not the owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright.  That the copyright will now presume to subsist in the work unless the contrary is proved is a welcome move.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a double-edged sword.  I put down a marker for the Minister in regard to the major legislation that will be forthcoming.  We have a rich tradition of music, song and dance but with modern digital recording methods there is a danger that large multinational companies will come here, digitise our traditional music, subsequently claim copyright and, in effect, &ldquo;steal&rdquo; our birthright.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputies will agree that Irish music is currently the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; since Riverdance and other such phenomena.  Irish music is fashionable world-wide and is very valuable but we must move swiftly to protect it.  I hope that will be taken into account in the Bill currently being prepared and that the Government will take its responsibilities seriously to protect our heritage.</P>
    <P>On the question of licences, in the main, schools are licensed and they pay their dues but there are question marks over the role of universities. Do they co-operate with the licensing authorities <Col N="954" /> and will the Minister, in the forthcoming legislation, act to ensure that all copyright holders are protected and that nobody can circumvent the copyright legislation as it is currently enacted?</P>
    <P>This minor legislation, which we will not oppose, is a precursor of what is to come but it contains two or three important measures.  We do not intend to table any amendments but await the forthcoming legislation which we hope will be produced as quickly as possible because we have waited long enough for it.  Now that the Ministers have taken time off from getting their photographs taken here, there and everywhere, we might see some real work emanating from that section of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and his officials for briefing the Opposition in recent days and giving us an insight into the way the Department is preparing the major copyright Bill which will be brought forward later in the year and to which we look forward. In that context, the Labour Party is happy to accept the Copyright (Amendment) Bill with a small number of technical amendments.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is basically a sticking plaster measure.  It was brought forward primarily as a result of the threat of legal action from the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.  Six months ago the Government suffered major embarrassment when the US Government publicly threatened us with legal action because of our failure to meet the basic copyright standards of the Trade Related Intellectual Properties Agreement, the TRIPs agreement.  I raised this matter in the House at the time, along with Deputy Stanton and others.  It is extraordinary that it took us such a long time to come to grips with a fundamental aspect of our changing economy and society.</P>
      <P>I spoke this morning to a prominent person in business, who also has a track record in the public service, and he was most irate that for three and a half decades, this issue lay asleep like Rip Van Winkle, and nobody thought it was sufficiently important to bring it to the attention of the then Minister.  At the last possible minute before our lawyers were dragged into court by the Americans and other countries, we brought forward this minor legislation to plug two of the major loopholes.  We can now offer our American colleagues the promise of a major copyright Bill later in the year.</P>
      <P>People in the IT community and the cultural industries, about whom I will speak later, would have expected that legislation covering a such a major development in those industries would have been updated earlier.  I am not criticising the current Minister.  We should have had our eye on the ball over the years, as the prominent person to which I referred said to me this morning during a meeting on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the early 1990s, there has been a series of highly documented court cases in both the American and British judicial systems which clearly indicated that significant new safeguards <Col N="955" /> were necessary to protect creative thinkers in our country and creative works brought into Ireland as a result of the major successes of the IDA.</P>
    <P>A number of cases spring to mind concerning the development of the World Wide Web, for example, Playboy <i>v.</i> Webbworld Inc.  in the United States and the Shetland Times <i>v.</i> Dr. Jonathan Wills, two cases mentioned in a recent interesting article by Mr. Denis Kelleher in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  That article indicated that over significant areas a large body of the population did not understand they could click on their computers, call up original and creative work and call it their own to use, distribute and make money from as they thought fit.  The legal system has moved ahead in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that his colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have had some success in this area, particularly the Garda Síochána and the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  Last March Ms Justice Laffoy dealt severely with a case taken by four major US film corporations who sued a County Meath businessman because of the way in which he had violated their fundamental copyright and utilised their product for profit.  Such cases alarmed our American friends, the source of much inward investment.  If they went unchallenged, it would have posed an incredible danger to the Celtic tiger and Ireland's economic development.</P>
    <P>The Web and the Internet have led to new industries and business.  We have been lethargic in trying to facilitate them.  In recent days there has been the case, which was raised by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, of the &ldquo;Mirror&rdquo; site which Microsoft wished to develop in Ireland.  That project failed apparently due to the lack of bandwidth in production here.  It has been said in the past that companies like Microsoft were also anxious about the fact that their original and creative programs, which we all use in daily work, were not adequately protected by Irish law.  That may have been another factor in Mr. Gates and his executive team deciding recently to put that interesting development on hold.  I hope Minister Harney will be able to secure such a mirror site from a company like Microsoft at some stage and to encourage the other famous companies from California to locate here.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, San José, one of only two cities with which Dublin is twinned &mdash; the other is Liverpool &mdash; lies in the middle of Silicon Valley.  The Taoiseach started the special relationship between Dublin and San José 11 years ago.  As a result, interesting connections have been made with the likes of Intel, Hewlett Packard, etc.  . It is also important to encourage further developments with software as well as hardware firms.  The Bill is welcome in that it begins to move into an area protecting this kind of work.</P>
    <P>We noted also the success of the development <Col N="956" /> of the software translation industry in Ireland.  I would give the Government some credit in that regard.  The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, played a fundamental role in this in his years in the then Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Finance.  As the House will be aware, Ireland's share of the European software market in this valuable niche industry is about 75 per cent.  As I understand it, the companies translate into all the European languages the major developments, particularly of American but also of British computer and software industries.  It is an extraordinary success story, which is not noted by the bulk of the population of the country.  It is critical that we protect the producers who are feeding Ireland's companies with the software programs which are then distributed throughout Europe &mdash; we are the second biggest producer in the world after the US &mdash; and the inward investment which they represent. The ever changing nature of Irish industry should be provided for carefully in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton correctly mentioned the wonderful explosion in the development of the cultural industries in recent years.  We have seen the success of Irish music and film.  This success was reiterated in recent weeks and a member of practically everyone's family or someone in their immediate circle has been an extra or actor in a film around Dublin.  That wonderful success story needed some fundamentally stronger law in order to ensure ongoing success and to protect acts such as Riverdance, the colossal output of Irish traditional and rock musicians, and the film industry. In the previous Administration, Deputy Michael D. Higgins provided much information on what he sees should be protected.  When the major Bill is introduced, the Labour Party will utilise Deputy Higgins's expertise in this regard.</P>
    <P>After a year we have a short Bill before us comprising four sections.  It provides for increased fines for breaches of current copyright legislation, and rightly so, and it reinstates ownership rights. I welcome the major provision which makes a presumption in favour of the producer of original works and seeks to protect them in particular. Even in areas where an author is dead, it seeks to protect the estate in that regard.</P>
    <P>The current legislation, even taking into account these amendments, remains among the most inadequate and antiquated in the European Union.  It reflects the capacity for breaches of copyright under advancements in electronic publishing, digitalisation and technology.  I look forward to the more elaborate Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998, which the Minister has promised.  I understand from the briefing that it contains about 450 sections.  It is understandable that it requires much preparation and worldwide research to make that new Bill as watertight as possible.  I look forward to further briefings on that Bill this summer and to a fundamental and full discussion of it in this House.</P>
    <P>The Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998, is a most important piece of legislation which will <Col N="957" /> determine the ability to deal effectively with the future of Ireland's world share in the information society.  Jobs and livelihoods in Ireland depend on the ability of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to bring forward effective legislation on copyright.  The Copyright Act, 1963, which the Bill before the House amends, simply allows the owners of copyright in literary, music and artistic work to control how that work is copied and used.  From the references to broadcasting transmission, for instance, it is clear that the Act refers to an earlier time almost before television, never mind computers.</P>
    <P>With the existence of many websites and the ease with which an individual can set up a site, Ireland's copyright law has become weak and, in many circumstances, irrelevant.  In furnishing a website with information, it is often easier to copy information from publications and ignore completely the copyright attached rather than commission new information.  This practice of copying information from books and magazines without permission from the owner of the material is unfortunately widespread.  Unless we provide adequate legislation to cover copyright on the Internet, we could be left with a situation whereby a person who provides the technical support on the Internet to a website owner may become liable for breaches of copyright.</P>
    <P>The inability of the Minister to bring forward copyright legislation demonstrates a clear lack of organisation and awareness of the new technology. Apart from the fact that this Bill fails to deal adequately with a range of copyright matters, there are one or two technical aspects on which the Labour Party is tabling brief amendments.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting in IBEC headquarters attended by the majority of organisations interested in copyright, including the NUJ, a proposal was adopted to set up a one stop shop covering all aspects of copyright relating to original creative material, the written word, recordings, graphical software, etc.  The idea is that a one stop shop would offer other parties interested in purchasing copyright goods the ability to do it all in one place thus reducing red tape and cutting significantly the amount of time needed to secure permission to use the material.  I ask the Minister, if he has not already considered that matter for the major Bill, to contact IBEC, look at the proposal and see how it could be incorporated.</P>
    <P>That said, and with those caveats, I am happy to accept the Bill with minor technical amendments which the Labour Party is proposing.</P>

      <P>It is doubtful whether we ought to engage in a major debate on copyright law. The minor measure we are introducing will be repealed in a few months as a result of the more significant Bill which has been in gestation for a considerable period.  If I am wrong I presume the Minister of State will correct me in his reply. However, the major Bill will repeal all copyright law including this Bill.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I did not have an opportunity to hear the Minister of State's address.  This Bill has been produced because of pressure from what Graham Greene might have called &ldquo;the Americans&rdquo;. There may be good reasons for that but this legislation is concerned with alleged piracy in specific areas.  It is because of that pressure that the Bill is being taken as an abstract from a more significant Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the first to agree with the Minister of State that this is a complex area of law.  The intellectual property unit in the Department has been put under significant pressure to produce this Bill.  It is an area of unusual complexity and the staffing and resources in that unit have not always been what they ought to be.  During the EU Presidency further pressures were put on the unit concerned.  We are behind in terms of the implementation of European Union directives and two in particular.  We are not exactly out of step in Europe in the sense that it could be <Col N="960" /> argued that we are all behind on this side of the Atlantic.  It is an open question as to whether there was ever a basis for the alleged inadequacies of Irish copyright law.</P>
    <P>For proprietary reasons the software industry in the US was very aggressive and assertive in making this claim.  However, if one reads the financial press it is notable that the entire US software industry does not hold that view.  One company which bestrides the globe in this sector and which, happily, is located in Ireland is at loggerheads with the US Government in respect of a number of issues.  Nonetheless, the US threatened to put Ireland on watch and asserted significant pressure.  This Bill has emerged from that pressure though not all of the US software industry was unhappy about the supposed inadequacies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While not going into any depth in this debate in trying to define what we are talking about perhaps Macauley's definition is still most apposite. He said that copyright was &ldquo;a tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers.&rdquo; That is a pithy summation of what was seen to be copyright law long ago.  From that bounty, as from all bounties, grew the gigantic, modern commercial publishing business.</P>
    <P>From that ancient rationale we have come to the present situation of the roles of the software and film industries.  It is possible to say that Hollywood, Wapping, Silicone Valley and Seattle would have us forget the ancient rationale.  They would have us talk in terms of truck commerce and the great religion of our age &mdash; the false faith of economics.  However, copyright and the law of intellectual property more generally is about much more.  It is originally and by intention a more decent thing.  It is about creating a more civilised, literate and learned society in which intellectual endeavour is cultivated and the grantaided, tax-relieved and self-absorbed creative community works for the wider social good and the stimulation and enrichment of cultural life. This high and noble interest is also evident in the origins and development of patent law.</P>
    <P>Is it true that we are following some of the principles in the recent Trade Marks Act?  It is a significant shift.  In layman's English, one is guilty until proven innocent.  As I see it, that is the nub of the Bill.  It is a drastic measure.  Perhaps the extent of electronic and video piracy is such that this is necessary.  There is no doubt that one of the greatest difficulties the Minister will face in devising the new copyright Bill is getting the balance right.  In terms of the competing forces, the assertion of proprietary interests and the introduction in this Bill of evidentiary presumptions in favour of the plaintiffs, it is important that we get it right.</P>
    <P>Every country in the world is facing pressure to update and adapt copyright law and the law on intellectual property generally.  The process of drafting the new Bill coincides with a major moment in history for intellectual property as a result of the emergence of the information <Col N="961" /> society.  It is a happy juncture for us, whatever about the alleged delay, to be bringing forward reforming legislation.  How we handle the amendment of intellectual property legislation will have a major influence on what the information society will come to mean for us, who will benefit and the extent to which society will gain from it.  They are major questions in terms of what might loosely be described as the US position in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the important factors in the theoretical shape of copyright is the public interest.  It may not be readily apparent that the decisions we will make in the major Bill will have profound implications for the public interest.  The State should regulate or intervene only to the extent that it can be said to further the public interest.  Copyright is a case in point.  It is an artificial construct created by the State with the public interest in mind.  In the case of copyright, the public interest may coincide at any time with the interests of any one or any combination of the groups interested in copyright.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation, which may seem to be minor, will be on the Statute Book for a short time.  It is my understanding that the Minister expects to be back in the House in the autumn with the major Bill.  We are, therefore, wasting our words on the desert air on this one.  I sincerely hope the Minister will give a commitment that on the introduction of the major Bill we will have an opportunity to adequately tease out these fundamental questions.  He has informally suggested that we should facilitate the passing of this Bill expeditiously.  I do not think anybody is minded to obstruct its progress if there are significant commercial interests at stake, although there are significant theoretical, philosophical and public interest questions to be raised about that.</P>
    <P>There is a presumption of guilt until proven innocent.  Section 2(4) raises an established principle of the law on intellectual property, that an employee gets paid for his or her contribution but he or she does not own the copyright.  What are the implications of this subsection in the era of the Internet where a journalist writes an original work of some value which can be accessed almost immediately all over the world?  While the owner of the copyright may get paid a number of times, the journalist gets paid only once.  It is a principle which can be translated into other propositions which could be advanced.</P>
    <P>What is intended by section 2(8) which states that the presumption set out in subsections (2) to (7) shall apply to the same extent in any actions relating to an infringement alleged to have occurred before the date on which copies of a work were published?  Does it refer to live performances? This is an area of some complexity.  I fear that we are putting legislation on the Statute Book on the word and honour of the Minister without knowing the implications.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to give the right to assert ownership in certain circumstances.  For example, if the Acting Chairman and I were to contrive to <Col N="962" /> write down the notes of Boolavogue, slightly adapt them, prepare the music sheets or make a record, it seems we could assert ownership of that work.  It also seems that flyboys could exert ownership of the great body of traditional Irish music of which it is not possible to trace the authors.  It is not contestable.  I am aware this area has been looked at by flyboys for some time who have no greater facility than I have in the business of authoring music but they can become very wealthy overnight if successful.  For the reasons I explained I am happy to facilitate the expeditious enactment of this legislation.  It is my understanding it is primarily driven by Hollywood and the Silicon Valley, it will be repealed on the introduction of the major Act and the Minister will give adequate time to the House on that occasion to tease out major and significant questions in terms of society and public interest.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for facilitating me in dealing with this legislation and I hope to deal with all Stages in the short time available.  I accept the comments of my colleagues across the floor who realise this is a breakout Bill.  A number of important issues were raised which we will discuss in the context of the major Bill.  I can give Deputies an assurance there will be an adequate consultation process.  I envisage the Bill will be published and that there will be some period within which there will be consultation, which will not only benefit the House but outside interests.</P>
      <P>In the past this ministry and others identified copyright as a complex area.  Rather than adopt the salami approach of dealing with EU directives, the thrust of this approach is to introduce comprehensive legislation that covers the up to date position.  I envisage the forthcoming Bill will be state of the art, but it will only come about if we can have the greatest possible degree of consultation. There are many areas of expertise inside and outside this Chamber into which we should tap.</P>
      <P>I will deal with a number of the issues raised. Deputies Rabbitte, Stanton and some of my party colleagues raised the question of the protection of the position of Irish music and folklore.  On the protection of Irish musical heritage, I assure Deputies that measures addressing this matter are under consideration under the copyright and related rights Bill.  A number of Deputies said there is not much point in going into many of the details of that because the Bill has not yet been produced.  I am determined that issue should be addressed because I also share the concerns of Deputies Rabbitte and Stanton about protecting the position of culture and folklore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the question of staffing. He would be aware of the position in the intellectual property unit in my Department.  I assure him steps are being taken to ensure increased staffing and other resources are available to the unit to discharge its vital tasks not <Col N="963" /> only in the area of copyright but intellectual property so that in future our intellectual property law will be maintained at a high standard.  I am conscious that area has been neglected and in trying to fulfil my ministerial responsibilities I was determined that area should be tackled as quickly as possible.  Deputy Rabbitte also raised the issue of the treatment of works of employees. The existing law and this provision reflect a well established principle on the treatment of such works of employees.</P>
    <P>I will try to reply to the points raised by Deputies and then move on to take the remaining Stages of the Bill.  It is not my intention to detain the House with extensive further comments, but I wish to comment on a number of detailed matters some of which were prompted by Deputies' remarks.  Deputy Stanton mentioned the slowness of copyright reform and asked why if copyright law is so important it has been left unreformed for such a long time.  That neglect continued for far too long, a situation about which a succession of Governments must feel less than proud.  That was acknowledged today.  However, in recent years all parties in this House have shown a renewed interest in copyright as its importance for the information age economy has become clear.  That point has been widely accepted throughout Irish society.  This is the information age and we are well ahead in that area.  Recent statistics have shown that we are the second largest exporter of software to the US.  There is a responsibility on us, not only for cultural but economic reasons, to deal with this matter as quickly as possible.  If reforming measures are only now coming forward, that has largely been due to the fact that resources in the Department were unavoidably focused on other priorities, including the reform of patent and trademark law and the heavy programme of work connected with intellectual property under the 1996 Irish Presidency of the European Union to which Deputy Rabbitte, then a Minister of State, referred.  However, Deputies may be assured that whatever about past omissions, the Government and my Department are fully committed to the urgent modernisation of Irish copyright law and to its maintenance in a fully effective and up to date form into the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies Stanton, Broughan and Rabbitte referred to obligations under the World Trade Organisation and said that the United States took some measures to try to push us along in that direction.  Deputies referred to the contacts between the United States trade authorities and my Department regarding the level of Ireland's compliance with international law in the field of copyright and related rights and in particular to our level of compliance with the trade related aspects of intellectual property known as the TRIPs agreement.  The discussion in question extended over a period of one year during the course of which the US trade authorities made clear their unhappiness that Ireland, an advanced <Col N="964" /> industrial country and EU member, should have fallen so far short of putting in place a system of protection for copyright and related rights which was up to the standards required by the TRIPs agreement, a standard which must be observed on the broadest possible geographical base if the development of intellectual property is to flourish on a worldwide basis in the interests of all.</P>
    <P>The terms of the international agreements in question were expressed in general terms so that the question of whether specific details of a particular country's copyright law is in compliance will be open to debate.  I share Deputy Rabbitte's view that Ireland would not necessarily accept the criticisms of our level of compliance with the TRIPs agreement on all points, but what is beyond doubt is that taken as a whole Irish copyright legislation, which was formulated 30 years ago or more, is not capable of meeting the overall standards of protection required by modern intellectual property treaties, such as the TRIPs agreement, which are geared to the information age. Securing an effective and efficient regime of copyright protection, fully compliant with the TRIPs standard, is a major specific objective of the forthcoming copyright and related rights Bill. The Government is convinced that only a comprehensive reform measure along the lines of that Bill is truly capable of bringing Irish copyright and related rights law fully into line with our international obligations, a result wished for by ourselves and by our trading partners.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Government is more than pleased to bring forward the present Bill, limited as it is, as a token of its serious intent to achieve fundamental modernisation of the copyright law at the earliest possible date and as a measure which will effect a valuable improvement to the regime of Irish copyright protection in its own right for the short-term.  The Government is pleased that on the basis of its undertaking to bring forward the present Bill with all speed, and I appreciate the co-operation of the House on this, the copyright and related rights Bill will be brought forward at the earliest date practicable. A better understanding has been established between the Irish and the US trade authorities which has allowed the latter to refrain from proceeding against Ireland under WTO dispute resolution procedures.  I am telling it as it is.</P>
    <P>When I took office I realised there was pressure to deal with this matter, and I have dealt with it.  The intellectual property unit of the Department has been expanded and I hope a comprehensive Bill on this matter will progress with speed.  We can assure Irish copyright rights holders as well as our trading partners that Irish copyright and related rights law will soon represent a leading model for the protection of the rights in question as we enter the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton mentioned the penalties, which are comparable to those in the Trademarks Act mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte.  Those penalties are substantial by any standards and should <Col N="965" /> be sufficient to be effective as both punishment and a deterrent to those tempted to enrich themselves unfairly on the back of another's intellectual labours.  The proposals for financial penalties on summary conviction being capable of accumulation on the basis of the present Bill may appear to be a severe measure.  However, the cumulative damage that can be done to the interests of legitimate rights holders and traders by what is sometimes viewed as small scale copyright piracy activities can be immense.  It is the Government's view that the courts should have the power to penalise offenders in this category.  Furthermore, it is the advice of the Attorney General that following recent constitutional jurisprudence in the Supreme Court, measures allowing the accumulation of summary penalties in relation to separate offences is not offensive to constitutional justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton suggested the introduction of community service orders or other penalties for copyright offences should be considered.  I will consider any such suggestions in the context of the larger Bill.  Deputies should bear in mind that the penalty regime finally decided upon must maintain a deterrence profile proportionate to the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 2(8) merely confirms the substantive presumption in the section in relation to proceedings arising out of infringements that occurred before copies of the work in question were published.  Infringing action often occurs where for example copies of a work fall into the hands of pirates before it is published.  This measure is a practical response to the realities of how copyright piracy works.</P>

      <P>My advice is that it does not. Under the Trademarks Act, summary conviction is a fine not exceeding £1,000 or six months imprisonment or both.  On indictment, the penalty is a fine not exceeding £100,000 or up to five years in prison or both.  The present Bill's summary conviction penalties are comparable if slightly more severe.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation.  I consulted Members on the need to move forward with this short Bill.  I look forward to proceeding as quickly as possible with the larger Bill and I assure the House there will be the utmost degree of consultation with Members and the wider public because there will be huge interest in this matter. Tough decisions will have to be made because there is public interest, commercial interest and lobby groups who will have much to say.  It has been described as one of the most comprehensive Bills in the history of the State.  There will be much work to be done.</P>

      <P>These are brief technical amendments.  My Labour Party colleagues and I considered tabling some major amendments, but following our briefing with the Department we felt it better to wait for the major Bill.  The Minister referred to the &ldquo;salami&rdquo; approach to implementing EU directives. A recent trade union publication had a list of dozens of EU directives, not implemented in domestic legislation, which indicate that the Department has a remit in many areas including copyright.  It might be preferable if some of those were implemented.  The complexity of the area means it is time consuming for officials to produce legislation to deal with it.  There may not be an Act for all time and we may need to update legislation on a regular basis.  The approach dismissed as a &ldquo;salami&rdquo; approach could be relevant in this case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The endorsement of the British-Irish Agreement by the people of Ireland marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the island. It offers a future based on the acceptance of <Col N="969" /> diversity and on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and partnership.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Agreement won the backing of 85 per cent of those voting on the island, including large majorities North and South, indicates a widespread willingness on the part of the people to set aside the bitter legacies of the past and seek to resolve their differences on political issues by democratic and exclusively peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The massive &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the South and the extraordinary turnout and strong support for the Agreement from both sides of the community in the North showed how deeply people desire lasting peace and political agreement.  It is now incumbent on all those who opposed the Agreement to respect the democratic verdict of the people and to work effectively the institutions which derive from it.</P>
    <P>Now that the referendums have taken place, the priority is to move ahead with the implementation of the Agreement.  This must be carried forward in a balanced and comprehensive manner. The Agreement is a package and must be implemented in its totality.</P>
    <P>A significant stage in the implementation process will be the holding of elections to the new 108 seat Northern Ireland assembly on 25 June. Following these elections the assembly, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council will be established in transitional form pending the formal entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.  This, we expect, will take place in early 1999.  In the intervening period, the shadow assembly will meet to organise itself, including to resolve its standing orders and working practices, elect the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and allocate up to ten ministerial posts.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Northern Ireland transitional administration and the Government, operating in the shadow North-South Ministerial Council, will meet to undertake a work programme to identify and agree by 31 October at least six areas in which Implementation bodies are to be established and at least six areas where co-operation will take place separately through existing bodies.  It will then fall to the two Governments to complete all necessary legislative and other arrangements to enable the implementation bodies to be established on the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government has established an interdepartmental steering group of senior officials, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to co-ordinate and actively move forward the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister believe non-governmental groups and organisation can do to assist the peace process?  I have in mind organisations such as the Orange Order and the GAA.  Will the Minister join me in urging the GAA to continue to pursue the objective of <Col N="970" /> changing rule 21 which the organisation will be considering over the coming weekend as a gesture which would be well received throughout the island?</P>
      <P>In the context of the marching season what steps has the Minister taken and what steps are being taken on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland to try to resolve the Drumcree marching issue?  There is serious conflict in that area on an annual basis.  If there is to be true reconciliation between the communities some way of reconciling these conflicts must be found.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister anticipate the introduction of legislation to give effect to cross-Border bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his three supplementary questions concerning the Orange Order, the GAA and rule 21, the marching season and cross-Border bodies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the GAA will meet shortly to consider rule 21.  This is a matter for the GAA, but in light of the peace process and the atmosphere which exists on the island I think it will give serious deliberation to the possibility of deleting that item from its rules.  However, it is a matter for the GAA.  Personally, I think removal of the rule would be helpful.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Orange Order, the peace process cannot be left solely to the politicians.  All elements of society, including the Orange Order, must contribute to it.  I strongly urge the order to contemplate the continuing peace process and its participation in it in the interests of what everybody on the island seeks, namely, permanent peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Regarding the marching season, the Deputy is aware that the Parades Commission announced its determination on six parades, including the banning of parades along the Lower Ormeau Road by the Apprentice Boys on Easter Monday, 13 April 1998 and by the Ballynafeigh District Orange Order on Sunday, 23 April and the rerouting of the contentious parade by the Dunloy Apprentice Boys on 17 May.  In a very helpful gesture it was also announced on 25 May that loyalist protests outside the Church of Our Lady in Harryville, County Antrim, had ended.  The Taoiseach and I met the Garvaghy residents' association and the Ormeau Concerned Citizens yesterday and had a long and detailed discussion with them.  The Government will continue to use its best endeavours in co-operation with the British Government to bring about a resolution of this issue.  The Parades Commission has its duty to carry out and we hope it will make the right decisions in the interests of the communities which these parades offend.</P>

      <P>What about legislation on cross-Border bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can outline a timetable which might be helpful to the Deputy.  On 25 June, 1998, elections will be held to the Assembly and in <Col N="971" /> early July the Assembly is due to begin meeting in shadow form to elect the presiding officer, Shadow First Minister and Deputy First Minister. It will appoint the Shadow Executive during the transitional period and determine its standing orders, committee structure, location and so forth.</P>
      <P>In September there will be inaugural meetings of the Shadow North-South Ministerial Council and the Shadow British-Irish Council.  The deadline for the agreement of the Shadow North-South Ministerial Council on at least six areas in which implementation bodies are to be established is 31 October.  At the end of 1998 and in early 1999 the two Governments are to enact legislation and take the other steps necessary to establish implementation bodies.  In February 1999, the Governments are to exchange letters notifying each other that all necessary legislation has been enacted.  The British-Irish Agreement then enters into force and the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will be formally established.  Full powers will be devolved to the Assembly.  The Government will then make a declaration which will trigger the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>That is the proposed timetable.  There is &ldquo;many a slip &lsquo;twixt cup and lip&rsquo; but that is the timetable everybody should work to achieve.  As far as this Government is concerned, it is a timetable to which we hope to adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the timetable.  It is extremely useful.  A great deal of work must be done by all sides and let us hope everybody approaches the work schedule with an open mind and in a constructive manner.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters.  The first relates to rule 21 and the decision that is due to be made by the Gaelic Athletic Association in the next few days.  The Taoiseach was actively involved with the President of the GAA some weeks ago and the Minister will be aware that there is substantial reaction in Nationalist circles in Northern Ireland to the proposal before the council.  Does either the Minister or the Taoiseach intend to make the Government's view on this matter clear?  It is primarily a matter for the GAA, but it is necessary to give leadership with regard to the removal of rule 21 at this time.  If this time is not considered suitable, the rule will never be removed.  The Government should convey a strong message on this issue before the deliberations of the ruling council of the GAA take place.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to the remarks made by Mr. Adams in the United States yesterday with regard to Sinn Féin's attitude to decommissioning and its rejection of the principles of consent in self-determination as agreed in the talks?  Does the Government intend to clarify those matters from its point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> Will there be a role for the secretariat in Maryfield or will it be closed down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last matter first because I was very much concerned with it during the talks.  The closure of Maryfield is part of the Agreement.  There is another question, however, which is where the secretariat will be located.  That is part of the ongoing discussions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy wishes.  We will do our best.</P>
      <P>With regard to rule 21, I agree it is a matter for the Gaelic Athletic Association which has made an enormous contribution to this country over the years and is part of the fabric of our society. There are many intelligent men and women in that organisation who can adjudicate on rule 21 as they see fit.  I accept the Deputy's point about leadership but I doubt that there is a role for the Government to point the finger at the GAA and tell it to change its rules.  Its members are good, concerned people and I believe they will make the right decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell and I agree that rule 21 should be changed but in a liberal and pluralist society the Government should not instruct any organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest the Government should instruct, but should give leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean.  In the context of leadership, there is no other way to lead except to let the organisation make its own decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about the remarks by Mr. Adams.  Last Friday the people, North and South, at the ballot box expressed their overwhelming support for the Agreement. It is clear the people accept that their right of self-determination can and should be exercised as set out in the Agreement, which is on the basis of consent.  Their verdict is the only one that counts.</P>
      <P>While it is understandable that parties should highlight those aspects of the Agreement which are particularly attractive to them and play down the others, the reality is that every part of it must be implemented without addition or subtraction. It is unrealistic to suggest that any other course of action is feasible.  It is important that all parties which support the Agreement, including Sinn Féin, should work its institutions in good faith while honouring their commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  I expect and believe that the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; parties will act in good faith in this matter.</P>

      <P>The quota will therefore be 14.4 per cent, a perfect quota.  One could get elected quite easily with 8 or 9 per cent of the vote with transfers, perhaps even less.  Would the Minister consider it helpful for constitutional Nationalist parties in the North to advise the electorate to continue their preferences to Unionist or other parties which will participate in the process and not for wreckers?  Would he consider that helpful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is reviewing the situation and a review committee is beginning to work on it.  My view with regard to the Assembly elections is that, unless we are asked for assistance, politicians in the South should take a vow of silence.</P>
      <P>Such a course would be helpful in the election process and in what we are seeking to achieve. As I am aware from my experience, words can cause difficulties, as Deputy Spring is aware.  I have no problem about that matter and when or if I write my diaries I will explain what I meant and what I should have done afterwards. However, sin ceist eile.  The least said, the soonest mended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.  We do not have a role in this, it is a matter for the politicians in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I referred to the remarks made by the President of Sinn Féin in the United States yesterday. Effectively, he said that Sinn Féin does not accept the principles of consent in self-determination as established in the Agreement.  I will be most concerned if there is not a strong message from the Government to Sinn Féin in this regard.  A total of 95 per cent of the people in the Republic supported the Agreement as did 71 per cent of the people in Northern Ireland.  It is one matter to be selective about parts of the Agreement one likes and dislikes &mdash; there were hard decisions for everybody &mdash; but we are trying to ensure that violence is removed from politics in this island.  The sooner we get clarification that there is non-violent support for the Agreement, the better.  In that respect we must heed what was said by Mr. Adams and a strong message will go out to him very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's views about the remarks made by Mr. Adams in America. The Agreement is there for all to see.  It was negotiated over a long period and involved many participants.  It is set out in clear language and must be taken in its entirety.  The principle of consent <Col N="974" /> means exactly what it should mean and there is no resigning on it.  The question of decommissioning and prisoners is written large in the Agreement and one cannot nit-pick or misinterpret. Those who misinterpret do so at their peril and at the peril of what we all seek to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Effective participation by Ireland in the Petersberg tasks, which is voluntary and entirely a sovereign decision for Ireland in each case, has been facilitated by a number of important developments, which I will summarise.</P>
      <P>The Western European Union meeting at ministerial level in Birmingham in May 1996, explicitly recognised the traditionally active role Western European Union observers, including Ireland, have played in the field of UN peacekeeping and the contribution they could bring to Western European Union operations in the framework of the Western European Union's Petersberg tasks, which were conceived in the context of support for the activities of the UN and OSCE.  In response to a proposal by Sweden and Finland, both of whom are Western European Union observers, and with the support of Ireland, the Petersberg tasks were included in the Amsterdam Treaty so that the European Union may avail of the Western European Union to implement such tasks.  The Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly provides, in Article J.7.3, that all member states of the Union, including the five observers at the Western European Union, shall be entitled to participate fully in these tasks and in the relevant planning and decision-taking for such tasks.</P>
      <P>In response to the Amsterdam Treaty, the Western European Union meeting at ministerial level on 22 July 1997, confirmed its recognition of the rights of Western European Union observers in relation to participation in Petersberg tasks. Subsequently, at the Western European Union ministerial meeting at Erfurt on 18 November 1997, the Western European Union took further steps to facilitate participation by Ireland and the other non-aligned observers, Austria, Finland and Sweden, in planning and decision-taking for the Petersberg tasks undertaken at the behest of the EU, in which they intend to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear in the Dáil on 11 December last, Ireland welcomes the willingness of the Western European Union to prepare itself to give effect to the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU, and to facilitate the contribution that Ireland and the other Western European Union observers can make to Petersberg tasks based on our long UN experience.  Ireland's <Col N="975" /> readiness to participate in specific Petersberg tasks will depend, in the first instance, on the nature of the task in question.  It will also depend on the availability of suitable personnel, whether from the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána. The Interdepartmental Committee on Peacekeeping is currently examining these issues.  In this context, too, the Department of Foreign Affairs has had discussions with the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish whether changes will be required to the current defence and Garda Síochána Acts.  The matter remains under consideration.</P>
    <P>I will continue to ensure that Ireland will be in a position to participate effectively in any Petersberg tasks to which we may propose to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the changes to Article 29 of the Constitution could give rise to more significant security and defence policy issues than those contained in the Amsterdam Treaty proposals?  Does he agree the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the recent Amsterdam Treaty was to a large extent based on scare tactics and bogey men and women talking about compulsory homosexual marriage and compulsory enrolment in a mythical European army?  Does he agree, therefore, it is time to inform the public?  People cannot make a decision on security and defence policy issues unless they are informed.  Does the Minister agree the Government should provide time for a debate in the House on its policy on security and defence matters?  Does he agree we should not only be part of the changing security architecture, but one of the architects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, as far as possible, we should be at the centre of Europe.  There was a great deal of misinformation put out by the people who sought to misinform, particularly on the defence and security side.  There was a strong attack on our neutrality.  My party and I value our position in that regard.  I tried to clarify matters as far as possible.  I believe many of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes were &ldquo;don't knows&rdquo; because of the complexities of the treaty and the fact that it did not contain one main idea.  It comprised a series of amendments to Maastricht and other treaties.  It was a modest proposal.  For many other reasons, it was difficult to get the message across, but I do not have to go into detail on that now.</P>
      <P>I have undertaken on a number of occasions to seek a debate to clarify our position on these matters and to get the views of the Opposition.  I will urge the Whips to make time available for a debate in the House on these matters.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government views India's nuclear tests with grave concern.  This concern has been intensified by reports that Pakistan has today conducted three nuclear tests.  The Government is deeply dismayed at this latest development which, with the earlier Indian tests, constitutes a major threat to regional peace and stability and has serious implications for the non-proliferation regime.  We are taking steps to make known our concerns to the authorities in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>As regards India's tests, I summoned the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> of India to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 13 May to express the shock and concern of the Government at the five nuclear explosions India detonated.  I had already made known the Government's grave concern in a statement I issued immediately after receiving reports of the first of these explosions on 11 May. I stressed to the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> the importance Ireland attaches to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and &mdash; in the light of our traditional role in respect of that treaty &mdash; our particular anxiety about the possible consequences of India's action.</P>
      <P>I underlined the threat the emergence of another nuclear weapon state would represent to the prospect of achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.  I recalled India's leadership in the non-aligned movement over the years and the disappointment which resulted among India's friends, including Ireland, at this action.  For decades India has been a vocal advocate in the United Nations and elsewhere of nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>Standing among the non-aligned has been a significant and defining element in the non-aligned approach to global nuclear disarmament.  The credibility of India, and of that approach, has be irrevocably called into question.  As a regional power in south east Asia, India has a particular responsibility in the maintenance of peace and the reduction of tensions in the region.  By these latest actions, India is failing to live up to its responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 40 years, India has been a most vocal advocate of nuclear disarmament.  We hope and expect that India will take account of the universal censure of its actions.  We hope, too, that it will refrain from any further negative steps, such as the weaponisation of its nuclear capability.  Any such developments would have serious and long-term <Col N="977" /> effects on the prospects for the achievement of global nuclear disarmament.  The <i>chargé d'affaires</i> assured me that he would convey immediately the view of the Government to his authorities.</P>
    <P>Ireland, for its part, will redouble its efforts to have the nuclear weapon states fulfil their legally binding obligations to eliminate nuclear weapons at the soonest possible date.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter further with my EU colleagues at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 25 May.  Following that discussion, the European Union issued a declaration condemning the series of underground tests of nuclear weapons and calling on India immediately to take a number of steps to reverse the course it has set upon, including the signing of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.  We also agreed that the European Union will follow closely the evolution of the situation and will take all necessary measures should India not accede to and move to ratify the relevant international non-proliferation agreements, in particular the CTBT.</P>
    <P>As regards Pakistan's tests, so far we have seen only summary reports and I am not in a position to convey detailed information to the House. However, I can assure the House that we are actively addressing the issue in consultation with our EU partners and I will issue a statement later today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if he spoke to the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> and why was the ambassador not called in?  Was it because he was unavailable or absent?  What view did the General Affairs Council take on the question of sanctions or effective action to persuade the Indian Government of the error of its ways? Is the Minister aware that Pakistan is threatening to have a nuclear test, perhaps in days?  Will he tell the House if he has taken pre-emptive steps to call in the Pakistani ambassador to express to him the concerns of the Government and this House about the possibility of similar tests taking place in Pakistan?  If he has not already done so, will he now undertake to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Indian <i>chargé d'affaires,</i> I asked for the ambassador.  I cannot say why he did not turn up.  I do not even want to speculate. He may have been on holidays but I simply do not know.  I spoke to the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> for half an hour in very civil terms and he responded very civilly.  He was left in no doubt as to how this country felt, having regard to our history and the whole area of nuclear disarmament.  We will continue the campaign and I will make a number of announcements in the very near future to give <Col N="978" /> impetus to our concerns for the totality of nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the imposition of sanctions against India.  A common European Union response to the Indian nuclear tests was discussed at the General Affairs Council last Monday.  The series of nuclear tests carried out by India was condemned, as we now condemn the tests carried out by Pakistan.  A number of steps were identified which India must take immediately. These include signing the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and moving to ratify it, as well as giving a commitment neither to assemble nuclear devices nor deploy them in delivery vehicles.</P>
      <P>We also agreed that member states would work for a delay in consideration of loans to India in the World Bank and other international institutions. The European Commission was asked to consider this question in its review of the general system of preferences.</P>
      <P>The implication of the nuclear tests and India's progress in acceding to the international non-proliferation agreements will now be examined in regard to India's continued eligibility for GSP preferences.  However it is not currently envisaged that comprehensive economic sanctions will be adopted.</P>
      <P>The question of aid is really a matter for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. In recent years India has received some aid from Ireland under the bilateral aid programme. While a number of countries have suspended or frozen their bilateral aid packages, there has been no agreement at European Union level to suspend aid to India.  I would be against suspending aid to India because the aid we give &mdash; and this can be confirmed by the Minister of State &mdash; is targeted at the poorest of the poor in developing countries, through non-governmental organisations. Any suspension of aid would inevitably hurt the poor and would cause little discomfort to the Indian Government.  In those circumstances, I am not considering the option of suspending bilateral aid to India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have in mind that the Minister might suspend bilateral aid, but there may be other ways to put pressure on the Indian Government to change its policy.  At the start of question time, I did not realise the Pakistani test had already taken place.  Will the Minister now call in the Pakistani ambassador and express to him the grave concerns of this House, the Government and the nation about this development? Will he announce in the House what initiatives the Government intends to take concerning nuclear non-proliferation.</P>

      <P>I would be prejudicing what my intentions are if I replied to the last part of the Deputy's question.  I do not want to give them away at this stage but the Deputy will find out in due course.  I am not giving him a short answer.  I can tell the Deputy privately, if he wishes.  I am <Col N="979" /> taking an initiative which I think will be helpful. However, it would prejudice that initiative if I gave details of it at this time.</P>
      <P>I intend to call in the Pakistani <i>chargé d'affaires.</i>  I will express to him the horror and concern of the House and the Government about what has happened.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that stopping aid would certainly not be of assistance in the current situation.  Has he drawn the attention of the Indian authorities to the incongruity, to say the least, of being in receipt of aid and at the same time spending hundreds of millions of pounds on this kind of adventure, which is quite simply all it is?  Has he had any response yet from the Indian authorities to the meeting he had with the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> ?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister received indications from other member states of the European Union as to what unilateral or combined action they might consider, bearing in mind the considerable success of the EU's pressure on France which succeeded in having that country's nuclear tests stopped.</P>

I pointed out to him the very matter the Deputy raised concerning the extraordinary poverty which exists in that country which I know and like very well. They are a great people but there is huge poverty in the country and it is incongruous, to say the least, that they should set off millions, if not billions, of pounds worth of explosives in pursuit of some extraordinary aim to have a nuclear arsenal on the basis of having a regional balance of power in the event of attack.  I pointed all that out to him.  I am glad the Deputy supports me in ensuring that, despite that fact, the aid gets through to the poorest of the poor.</P>

      <P>Is there any indication as to what steps other members of the European Union may take?  It is not simply a question of sanctions but of how the European Union can assist in lessening the tensions or perceived threats in the region which obliges India to consider this type of action.</P>

      <P>A number of things can happen. The EU, presumably on the direction or request of the Presidency, can withdraw its ambassadors from India for consultations, which is the formula used.  Such action would be a grievous rebuff to the country concerned.  However, that has not happened.  Sanctions could also be imposed on technology and business and on many other areas of interchange between EU countries on the one hand and India on the other.  Many areas could be mentioned but there is no intention of imposing such sanctions.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleagues and the Minister that it is important the aid we direct to India continues to go to the poorest of the poor.</P>
      <P>As regards the strong stance which was taken rapidly by President Clinton, has there been a discussion in the European Union about introducing equal measures in terms of economic sanctions on India?  I was astounded by the response and reaction of the Indian Government to the views expressed by the world leadership.  It seemed to be totally distant and to be pursuing its own policies. We had difficulties a number of years ago with the French Government, our European Union partners.  Ultimately, persuasion was effective, but it was a difficult time within the European Union.  We should consider taking strong measures at European Union level to deal with the Indian Government.  I regret the news announced by the Minister that Pakistan has also carried out three tests.  This exacerbates an already difficult situation in the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Deputy's point of view.  America was quick off the mark in this regard.  The EU agreed that member states, the World Bank and other international institutions would work for a delay in considering loans to India.  Member states asked the Commission to consider this matter in its review of the general system of preferences.  The implications of the nuclear tests and India's progress in acceding to international non-proliferation agreements will now be examined in terms of India's continued eligibility for the GSP.</P>
      <P>It is not currently envisaged that comprehensive economic sanctions will be adopted.  I will articulate the strong feelings expressed in this House that there should be economic sanctions. Should we be at the top of the list in urging economic sanctions on a country like India?  Perhaps we should take the lead in this regard.</P>

By focusing on that issue at a central European Union level, it would help to sober up the Indian and Pakistani Administrations which have taken this reckless path in reaction to each other.</P>

I am not sure if it will be taken but, if not, I will write to the Commission to find out how much is spent on aid to Pakistan and India.  I do not know if they will have any information on the amount both Governments have expended on nuclear explosions.  It is a helpful suggestion which will focus the minds of those <Col N="981" /> people.  They will be able to compare the amount of money given in aid and the amount paid for the type of nuclear explosions carried out in the past number of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen years of conflict, a poor harvest and lack of access to vulnerable communities have resulted in a humanitarian crisis in parts of the south of the country.  The worst affected communities are in Bahr-el-Ghazal, Equatoria and the Nuba Mountains.  Estimates vary as to the number of people in need of immediate assistance.  Figures given by aid agencies range between 400,000 and 700,000 people.</P>
      <P>The Government has been actively engaged since 1994 in addressing the ongoing humanitarian emergency in southern Sudan.  This was reflected in a total of £2,246,000 in food and other aid to the people of Sudan between 1994 and 1997.  This does not include the bilateral programme in northern Sudan.</P>
      <P>As soon as the extent of the present crisis started to become clear, the Government responded quickly to humanitarian needs and took action at political and humanitarian levels. A total of £800,000 was allocated during May to UN agencies and Irish NGOs to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people.  The Government of Sudan allowed increased access to the affected communities following an international outcry and assistance is now beginning to reach the most needy.</P>
      <P>However, humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for a political solution.  A number of actions have been taken to help galvanise international efforts in support of a peaceful political settlement.  At the beginning of May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to express our concerns to the Deputy Foreign Minister of Italy, who is the chairman of IGAD.  This body supports the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development which brought together the Sudanese Government and the SPLA in Nairobi for peace talks earlier this month.  The Minister raised these concerns again last week with Foreign Minister Dini in Rome.  At the General Affairs Council in Brussels we drew the attention of EU Foreign Ministers to the urgent need to actively support efforts to achieve a political settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of actions have been taken at humanitarian and development levels.  On 7 May the Irish Ambassador to Egypt, who is also accredited to Sudan, raised the Government's concerns about restricted humanitarian access directly with the Sudanese authorities.  At my request, the humanitarian situation in Sudan was <Col N="982" /> put on the agenda at the EU Development Council meeting on 18 May and a number of important conclusions were agreed regarding the approach to humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>As a further expression of our concern, I will visit Khartoum from 6 to 7 June to convey the views of the Government to the Sudanese authorities on a number of issues, to press for continued access for humanitarian aid and to request them to work to bring about a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  The Government will continue to work with the international community to ease the humanitarian crisis and to support efforts to find a peaceful political settlement.</P>

      <P>To what extent, if any, do communications exist between the Government and representatives of the European Union with the agencies working in Southern Sudan, to ascertain the position on the ground and whether an immediate response, of a practical nature, can be provided?  Apart from what has happened in the past couple of years which was laudable and necessary, do the Government and the European Union intend to respond to the emergency in that region?</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply we had a long discussion at the recent meeting of development Ministers on 18 May on this issue.  We were at pains to insist that we co-ordinate our efforts because co-ordination is so important in such a crisis, particularly since there is such limited access to the critical area in the south.  The whole humanitarian effort is being co-ordinated by Operation Lifeline Sudan &mdash; a consortium of UN agencies and NGOs.  The world food programme manages the overall logistics including a massive air operation to deliver assistance.  Since the lifting of the flight ban by the Government of Sudan &mdash; this only came about as a result of international effort from all our EU partners and America &mdash; the actual delivery of food has doubled.  Transport by road is very difficult because of insecurity and the onset of the rainy season.  The weather is also causing problems with the airlifts as most of the air strips are small dirt landings.  Every effort is being made to increase the amount of food reaching those in need.</P>
      <P>The Government has been allowing access but international pressure must continue to ensure that access continues to be available.  Access has been the difficulty, not money.  All our European partners are ready and willing to give humanitarian assistance.  In the past four weeks, through UNICEF, Trócaire and World Vision, we have donated £800,000 to that effort.  The same effort is being made by all our European partners.  We are monitoring the situation to ensure that access is kept open.  This is a civil war.  This matter is a fallible process and has to be kept under review on a daily basis.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of Commission proposals for a New Transatlantic Marketplace Agreement, NTMA.  The Commission paper followed discussions at the EU-US Summit in December 1997, and comprised four principal elements including the removal of technical barriers to trade in goods, the elimination of all industrial tariffs, the establishment of a free trade area in services, and the greater liberalisation of Government procurement, intellectual property and investment.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposal was discussed in detail at Council fora.  Ireland's approach was open and constructive.  We stressed that the proposal should not affect the multilateral rules-based trading environment in an adverse manner. In discussion, we supported the view that the concepts and common interests underlying the Commission proposals should be examined with a view to seeing how best they might be developed in harmony with EU commitments to the multilateral system and the WTO.</P>
      <P>These discussions resulted in an alternative proposal which aims to accelerate economic growth and trade liberalisation without adversely affecting EU commitments or the multilateral trading environment.  The paper entitled the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, TEP, was discussed at the EU-US Summit on 18 May where it was the subject of a joint statement.  We share the view of partners that the outcome of the summit in this and other respects, marks an important step forward towards resolving differences and in developing the EU-US economic and commercial relationship.  We agree with our partners that the US, as well as the EU, must commit itself to the package agreed at the summit and we adhere to the ideas expressed in the EU unilateral statement which link the various elements contained therein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from statements made by Commissioner Brittan that he is an advocate of this new relationship.  I appreciate the Minister has said Ireland favours this concept.  If within the Council of Ministers a working group is developing proposals, how can this be advanced and is it capable of receiving affirmative support from all member states?  As I understand it, France has expressed views which are totally opposed to the concept.  Is there any prospect at this stage of a European Union position outside the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's information is correct. I was very much aware of the reaction of France.  The Deputy is right in saying that Commissioner Leon Brittan launched the NTMA <Col N="984" /> initiative.  The key components of the NTMA are the removal of technical barriers to trade and goods through mutual recognition and harmonisation; the elimination of all industrial tariffs by 2010; a free trade area in services; a greater liberalisation of Government procurement and intellectual property and investment.  The rationale behind Commissioner Brittan's proposal is explained in the Commission's communication on the New Transatlantic Marketplace Agreement &mdash; which the Deputy will have studied.  The Commission stressed the importance attached to ensuring that the NTMA was fully compatible &mdash; this is probably where the tensions arose &mdash; with EU international obligations and aims and claimed that the proposal will help to spur a millennium round of trade negotiations.  The reaction of partners was sceptical.</P>
      <P>France strongly objected to the proposal and was highly critical of the lack of transparency by the Commission.  While other partners were more positive, concerns were raised about the difficulty the proposal would cause for the WT0 and the multilateral system in general.  Several partners and the US felt that certain aspects of agriculture should be included in any such agreement.  Concerns were also raised at the proposed bilateral dispute settlement system because of the potential conflict.  A problem arose because of the potential conflict with the WTO and the dispute settlement system.  Many partners expressed doubts about a free trade area mainly because of potential damage to the multilateral trading system, and in particular, to negotiations associated with the general agreement on trade in services. There was also some doubt about the likely success of negotiations with the US, given the difficulties over recent negotiations on financial services in Telecom.  Some partners had concerns about the timing of the negotiations which could divert from preparations for GATT 2000 negotiations. A problem arose because of a potential conflict between the multilateral philosophy and the WTO.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Spring was Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had the opportunity to sit in on many meetings in relation to the whole process of transatlantic co-operation. There is a difference in co-operation between the European Union and the United States and between the European Union and Canada.  It is clear that whatever restrictions or difficulties apply on both sides of the Atlantic there is a need for such a development.  Will the Minister agree that given the whole process of EU enlargement the peripheral nature of Ireland will become more acute as the market moves more to the east?  Therefore, we have a particular interest in trying to re-establish ourselves nearer the centre. In the past Helsinki has become identified with the OSCE and security, the Hague with certain UN conventions and Strasbourg with human rights.  Does the Minister see any benefit in establishing here a centre for transatlantic co-operation <Col N="985" /> with somebody such as Senator George Mitchell as chairman so that we would become the centre of what would be inevitable co-operation? If there is any sanity in the European Union and in the United States and Canada in the coming years we should not await the full consolidation of the process in the European Union but position ourselves nationally in a situation where we are identified, being in the centre of European Union transatlantic co-operation geographically. This is something we could claim with some credibility and without awaiting anybody's authority.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the peripheral nature of our island in the context of the European mainland.  As far as being pushed out further as a direct result of EU enlargement, this Government and future Governments must ensure we remain at the heart of Europe despite our location.  On transatlantic co-operation, it is important that we attract organisations to this country.  Deputies Mitchell and Spring are correct that Ireland was open and constructive in discussions.  We consider it essential that the multilateral rules-based trading environment be not adversely affected by the Commission proposal.  We appreciated the concerns of partners and we were also aware of the sensitivities of third countries.  We supported the view that the concepts and common interests underlining the NTMA proposals should be examined to see how best they might be developed in harmony with EU commitments to the multilateral system and to the WTO.</P>

I am not against free trade in principle but in practice we have to move slowly in terms of opening up even more free trade areas between ourselves and the United States.  Given that we have recently committed ourselves to the euro, the stability pact within the European Union and the widening of the EU to include east European states, many of which are highly underdeveloped, will the Minister agree it is essential that we concentrate on developing this area in advance of opening up more areas of free trade which inevitably will lead to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is important that we place on record, in the light of the complicated nature of the subject, the proposals outlined in the Transatlantic Economic Partnership.  The paper was discussed at the EU-US summit on 18 <Col N="986" /> May where it was the subject of a joint statement. The Transatlantic Economic Partnership aims to accelerate economic growth mainly by reducing regulatory and other non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services.  The partnership stipulates that the US and EU should work together to achieve substantial further trade liberalisation on a multilateral basis.  It is based on three principles &mdash; accentuating market access for suppliers of goods, services and farm products; engendering long-term results on Euro-American issues, both bilaterally and multilaterally; and extending the initiative to include broad participation of business, social, environmental and consumer interests.  The partnership covers the important areas of manufactured products, agriculture services, industrial customs duties, global electronics, trade and intellectual property rights, investment, public procurement and competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 40, 48 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Kosovo continues to be a matter of deep concern to the Government and to the international community generally.  It was considered further at the General Affairs Council which I attended on Monday.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the developments in Kosovo which led to the EU imposing certain sanctions on Serbia on 19 March and the United Nations Security Council doing likewise on 31 March, and which I described in my reply to a question on 1 April.</P>
      <P>Since then the situation has been monitored closely, and preparatory work has been undertaken so that any decisions on further sanctions could be implemented quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community has four basic objectives with regard to Kosovo: first, to get a dialogue and negotiations started between the <Col N="987" /> Serbian and ethnic Albanian sides; second, to have the Serb forces carry out their duties in conformity with international standards of behaviour; third, to see an end to attacks and other incidents by the so called Kosovo Liberation Army; and fourth, to see an end to support from both inside and outside the FRY for the activities of the KLA.</P>
    <P>Dialogue has now started between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian sides.  The cohesiveness of the international approach to date has played an important part in promoting this dialogue.  As a result of international action President Milosevic has now taken responsibility for the start of a political process, rather than allowing the earlier stalemate to continue indefinitely.  Dr. Rugova, the leader on the ethnic Albanian side, has also been persuaded to engage in dialogue with Milosevic.  At their meeting on 15 May they agreed to open a dialogue which would be carried forward by their delegations.  The first such meeting took place last Friday, 22 May.</P>
    <P>The situation remains very serious, with frequent reports of clashes between security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army.  Tensions along the border with Albania also give rise to the greatest concern.  This violence represents an increasing threat to the human and civil rights of all the inhabitants in Kosovo and to regional security as well.  To end the cycle of mounting violence, the FRY and Serbian security forces must stop repression and carry out their duties in conformity with international standards.  Attacks on the security forces also have to cease and support for such attacks, whether it comes from inside Kosovo or from persons living abroad, also has to stop.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note, the Education Agreement, which is seen as a possible bridge between the sides and which was at a stalemate for almost two years, is now being implemented.  The return of university and school buildings for use by the ethnic Albanians represents the honouring of one commitment by the Serbs.  Unfortunately, however, violence by local elements has meant that damage, sometimes extensive, has been done to buildings.  The European Commission has offered assistance for the implementation of the Education Agreement and technical studies have already started, including on the restoration of buildings.</P>
    <P>In view of the start of the dialogue between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, the General Affairs Council last Monday decided that a proposed EU measure to stop new investment in Serbia would not be taken forward at this time. Should Belgrade fail to engage seriously in a substantial dialogue and to take meaningful steps to reduce violence and diminish tensions in Kosovo, the EU will proceed with this ban.  The Council will examine the matter again at its next meeting on 8 June.</P>
    <P>While there have been ministerial visits to the region, including Belgrade, by the Presidency, I <Col N="988" /> am not aware at this time of any plans for a visit to the region by the ministerial troika.</P>
    <P>It is hoped the special envoy of the EU, and the special representative of the OSCE Chairman in Office, Felipe Gonzalez, who briefed the Foreign Ministers at the Council on Monday, will be in a position to fulfil his mandate in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply to what is an area about which we all have reason to be concerned.  The reality is that Kosovo is under martial law with the domination of 90 per cent of the population by 10 per cent.  My worry, which I want to convey to the Minister, is about the repercussions of what is happening in Kosovo on the implementation of the Dayton Agreement.  I welcome the intervention by the European Union.  It is an area which we must monitor carefully.  In fairness, the Minister has outlined that the conflict arises from both sides, repression by state forces and of course the Kosovo Liberation Army on the other side causing problems for whatever prospects exist for establishing dialogue and peace between both sides.</P>
      <P>The EU must take a strong stance.  We want to see the autonomous status of Kosovo restored at the earliest possible time.  I do not see any other solution.  It is unlikely that the 90 per cent Albanian population will accept domination, which Serbia is trying to impose.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister make sure, at European level, that the Presidency takes a strong stance?  My worry is that there will be a spill-over from Kosovo into Albania which will undermine whatever prospects exist for the implementation of the Dayton Agreement.  I believe those prospects are quite good but they are being undermined by Serbia's response to this situation in Kosovo.</P>

Will he state whether this matter has recently been discussed at OSCE as well as at EU meetings? What steps are being taken to try once and for all to bring some sort of decency to the procedure of government which Mr. Milosevic is intent on bringing to that region in general?  Is Mr. Milosevic regularly made aware of the views of the EU and the OSCE in an effective way which gives him cause for concern, or do we simply rely on <i>démarches</i> and statements which are literally like water off a duck's back to the man concerned?</P>

As I indicated on 1 April the EU, through a common position adopted on 19 March, introduced four measures: an embargo on arms sales; a ban on the sale of goods which could be used in internal repression of terrorism; a moratorium on government financed export credit for trade investment, including government financing for privatisation and a ban on visas for senior Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia representatives responsible for repressive actions by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia security forces in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>There are two additional measures on which preparatory work has been completed, as I indicated in my reply, namely, a freeze on Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assets held abroad and a freeze on future investment in Serbia.  Further action on these will depend on Serbia's response to the EU's demands which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>As Deputies have said, there is a serious danger of this situation escalating.  On Monday the EU reiterated its support for an enhanced status for Kosovo, as Deputy Spring rightly pointed out, including meaningful self-administration of Kosovo and the territory of the FRY. Ireland supports this while not excluding any outcome which may be reached between the Kosovar Albanians and Belgrade.  A redrawing of international boundaries without agreement would threaten to destabilise other countries in the region and that is Deputy Mitchell's concern. One would have to bear in mind the significance of such a development.</P>

      <P>In the past two months, since 28 March 1998, there have been three substantive meetings of the General Affairs Council.  These meetings took place on 30-31 March, 27 April and 25 May.</P>
      <P>I represented Ireland at the General Affairs Council on 27 April and 25 May.  As regards the 30-31 March General Affairs Council, Ireland was represented by Minister of State Kitt and Minister of State Fahey.</P>
      <P>In addition to these three substantive meetings, the General Affairs Council met once in special session in the margins of the World Trade Organisation Meeting in Geneva on 18 May.  On that occasion, Minister of State Kitt, who has responsibility for international trade, represented Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am arranging to send the Deputy a list of <Col N="990" /> Council meetings in all formations, totalling 23 in number, over the past two months.  Included in the list, in addition to the Council meetings to which I have just referred, is a Special Council meeting on EMU, which was held in Brussels on 2-3 May, exceptionally at the level of Heads of State or Government.  Ireland was represented on that occasion by the Taoiseach, who was accompanied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and Minister of State Fahey.</P>
    <P>The Council in formations other than the General Affairs Council also met on a number of other occasions during the period, including ECOFIN, which the Minister for Finance attended on 21 April, 1 May, 3 May and 19 May. The Minister for Agriculture and Food participated in the meetings of the Agriculture Council on 31 March, 20-21 April and 25-26 May.  There were four occasions on which Ireland was represented at official level: the Social Affairs Council on 7 April, the Health Council on 30 April, the Internal Market Council on 18 May, and the Culture and Audiovisual Affairs Council today, 28 May.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it is important that senior or junior Ministers represent the country at all meetings.  However, where the ministerial seat is empty, the quality and depth of knowledge of those officials who sit in the ministerial seat is quite extraordinary.  This country would not be disadvantaged by their presence.</P>
      <P>I take the point, in principle, that a political presence should be there as often as possible. Sometimes it is not possible, and so be it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the procedure at the outset of meetings of the General Affairs Council, for example, which is the most senior council outside of the European Council because it has a sort of a supervisory role as well as the role for foreign ministers, is that the list of A points and the list of B points are agreed.  Then what is discussed over lunch and even over coffee at lunch is agreed so that Ministers in private can bear their souls, have open exchanges and discuss things which they cannot discuss in a more open forum. This sort of discussion can only take place where it is a discussion between equals, where Ministers meet Ministers.  Therefore, sending a civil servant, even if it is the permanent representative, to a meeting of that kind is frowned upon by other Ministers because they expect to be able to talk in a collegial fashion to other colleagues.</P>

I now have a panel of colleagues who will represent me if Minister of State O'Donnell, who is an extremely busy person and has her own remit, is not available.  In such cases, I can and do call on the assistance and aid of other competent and co-operative colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say I remain absolutely committed to the principles I set out in this House and elsewhere in regard to the need for absolute financial propriety and probity in the conduct of our public affairs.  The issue of financial contributions to political parties has dogged and continues to dog democratic politics in many parts of the western world.  I share the determination of everyone in this House that we have clear rules strictly observed so as to maintain full public confidence in the political process.  Financial contributions to politicians should be made for strictly political purposes, be clearly accounted for and given with no other motive than the good government of this country and support for the democratic system as a whole.</P>
      <P>In the past this was a relatively unregulated area.  I have contributed in Government and Opposition to establishing tighter rules and guidelines.  I deeply regret any departures in my party or any other party from the high standards that should have always been required.  Where controversy or legitimate public concern arises or facts that have not hitherto been known come to light, they must be fully disclosed to the appropriate authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us in this House have a common interest in ensuring full clarity where there has been cause for concern.  The tribunals we have established are, in my opinion, the best vehicle for following up any new disclosures if they can be brought <Col N="993" /> within their jurisdiction and we should not try today to prejudice, pre-empt or cut across their work.  That said, I am willing to listen to and consider any points put to me by other Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>Coming to the specifics of the case, let me say at the outset that Fianna Fáil has operated in a proper, transparent and above-board fashion in this matter.  It has taken the appropriate action and has promised and provided its fullest co-operation to the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, remarks I made while Leader of the Opposition were recalled.  Those remarks, made at the time of the Dunne's tribunal, were that what matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available.  I am proud to say that in this matter, Fianna Fáil has lived up 100 per cent to this stern challenge by making available additional information that had not been specifically requested to the tribunal that has been delegated by the Dáil to deal with this matter.  This will also become clear when I outline the sequence of events.</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal made an order for discovery and an order for production against the Fianna Fáil Party on 20 February 1998.  There was nothing unusual in this and we understand that a variety of orders of discovery and inspection have been made by the tribunal against a number of persons including other political parties.  The order for discovery dealt with contributions made by Mr. James Gogarty, Mr. Michael Bailey or any person or company connected with them.  In addition, the tribunal sought discovery of documents relating to the payment of any sums of money by former Deputy Ray Burke to the Fianna Fáil national organisation since 1 January 1989.</P>
    <P>An extensive affidavit of discovery was furnished by Fianna Fáil to the tribunal on 1 April 1998.  At no stage prior to the delivery of the affidavit of discovery had the tribunal ever asked any questions of Fianna Fáil in relation to Rennicks, the Fitzwilton subsidiary referred to in <i>Magill.</i>  It was the Fianna Fáil Party which volunteered and disclosed through the discovery process documentation in relation to Rennicks as was its bounden duty.</P>
    <P>The first time I found out about Rennicks was when the affidavit of discovery for the Flood tribunal was being prepared by Fianna Fáil party officials.  That affidavit was prepared in the weeks immediately before 1 April when a massive and exhaustive trawl of the party's files and books of nine years ago was undertaken.  I was appraised in the latter half of March of the discoveries and full disclosure was made to the tribunal.  It took some time to establish from the company concerned that it had a corresponding record confirming the contribution.</P>
    <P>The affidavit, sworn on behalf of Fianna Fáil, discovered documents available to the party relating to the Rennicks transaction.  The Fianna Fáil Party did receive from Ray Burke a contribution of £10,000 by way of bank draft.  This was, <Col N="994" /> in the normal course of events, credited to the account of the party.</P>
    <P>The following documents were later discovered: (a) an official party receipt made out in the name of Rennicks acknowledging receipt of a sum of £10,000; (b) an extract from the cash receipts book showing the contribution from Rennicks to the sum of £10,000, and (c) a photocopy of a compliment slip from Rennicks accompanying the donation which also bore the name of Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>Up to then, I had been given to understand that the £10,000 received by Fianna Fáil from Ray Burke in 1989 was drawn from a contribution he had received from Joseph Murphy Structural Engineering, and, even bearing in mind that he would certainly have received other smaller contributions, it was reasonable to presume that in the main it came from that source.  The reason for this belief was because our inquiries last summer and last autumn had concentrated on establishing, following media allegations, if Ray Burke had received a large donation in 1989 from JMSE or people associated with it; if so, were there any special reasons; and if, as claimed, Fianna Fáil had received a £10,000 draft from Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern travelled to London at my request to conduct an interview with the principal of JMSE.  He was examining the array of allegations about whether Ray Burke had received a donation from JMSE or others involved in it, the amount and whether there were any special circumstances surrounding it.  He was asked to do a specific task and he did that in a thorough fashion.  Indeed, a full account of the Minister's inquiry is being furnished to the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <P>At one stage, there were claims that Mr. Burke received £80,000 from that company or its principals leading to endless speculation about why he had been given the money so it was most prudent that we made our inquiries.  I inquired as to whether Ray Burke had paid £10,000 to Fianna Fáil.  It was quickly confirmed to me that Fianna Fáil had received a £10,000 draft from Ray Burke in 1989.  My assumption was that this cheque came from the JMSE money or mainly from it.</P>
    <P>I was not aware at the time Ray Burke made his statement in the Dáil that the £10,000 paid to the Fianna Fáil Party by Mr. Burke came from Rennicks.  I similarly did not know that he had received, not one contribution of £30,000 in June 1989 but two amounting to £60,000, nor could this reasonably be inferred from his statement to the Dáil.  I was apprised of these facts in the course of the preparation of the affidavit of discovery.  It is a pity they were not brought to light earlier for the benefit of the House last autumn when the ministerial statement was made.  I could not have clarified this on 5 September last year or at the time of Mr. Burke's statement in the Dáil because I knew nothing about Rennicks until we were in the course of preparing the affidavit.</P>
    <P>It was the Fianna Fáil Party which disclosed to <Col N="995" /> the tribunal the documentation in relation to Rennicks and that we only received one £10,000 contribution by way of bank draft from Mr. Ray Burke in 1989.  At no stage prior to the delivery of the affidavit of discovery had the tribunal ever asked questions of Fianna Fail in relation to Rennicks.  We were the ones who told it about Rennicks.</P>
    <P>Some have suggested that I should have come to the House when these matters were discovered. There is surely no straighter, more direct or appropriate way to declare something than to swear it in an affidavit and to send the documents we had on this to the tribunal established by the Dáil and delegated to investigate the matters.</P>
    <P>We deemed that the appropriate and most correct way to deal with this was to give what we had discovered to the tribunal and let it investigate it further and come to conclusions.  As the House knows, Mr. Justice Flood has been appointed to investigate these issues and he should be allowed to do so without there being a parallel process ongoing in this House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is giving full co-operation to the tribunal. Last week the lawyers for the tribunal contacted the solicitors to Fianna Fáil.  The purpose of that contact was to arrange for inspection of the original documentation as discovered and disclosed in our affidavit and as furnished to them. On Tuesday the lawyers for the tribunal carried out an inspection of the original documentation as discovered.  An official of the Fianna Fáil Party was present at that inspection to give assistance to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We will continue to give the fullest co-operation to the tribunal which should be allowed to continue with its work and our job will be to debate the tribunal's report and ensure appropriate remedial action is taken on foot of its recommendations. It was my conviction last autumn and remains my conviction today that due process should be followed.</P>
    <P>The concerns I have expressed over an appropriate ethics commission which would be in a position to investigate allegations of this nature make it all the more urgent to have this legislation processed as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Finance intends urgently proceeding with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The revelations in today's <i>Magill</i> magazine once again raise disquieting questions about the way Fianna Fáil in Government conducts business and its curiously lax approach to investigating allegations of wrongdoing.  The Taoiseach has admitted investigating Mr. Ray Burke last year prior to appointing him Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We were led to believe that he had reassured the Tánaiste that Mr. Burke had nothing to hide.  Much was made of the travels to London by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to ensure this investigation was comprehensive and complete.  The Taoiseach said he was satisfied <Col N="996" /> that nothing improper had occurred.  Yet, out of the blue today, we learn of another huge donation to Mr. Burke from a related company with which his Department had extensive and potentially lucrative dealings.  On the basis of this performance the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, would not get a job as an investigative inspector in his Department.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, before he became Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern said he had investigated allegations against Mr. Burke, had gone to him on four separate occasions and gone through in detail the allegations against him.  Did Mr. Burke tell the Taoiseach at the time about his contribution from Fitzwilton-Rennicks?  Did the Taoiseach check party records at headquarters at the time as part of his pre-appointment investigation of Mr. Burke and, if not, why not, given that he had made much of this being a thorough investigation? If he did check party records, how come he did not find out about the Fitzwilton-Rennicks donation?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach must explain why, on 5 September 1997, he confirmed Mr. Burke's assertion that the £10,000 payment made to Fianna Fail headquarters in 1989 related to the JMSE donation to Mr. Burke even though Fianna Fáil now acknowledges having receipted Fitzwilton-Rennicks for the same payment at the time?  Was the Taoiseach fully frank in his statement on this matter on 5 September last?  Did he investigate Mr. Burke before appointing him Minister for Foreign Affairs or was the investigation just a pretence to seduce the Progressive Democrats?</P>
      <P>On 8 October 1997 the Taoiseach repeated this misleading version when he told the Dáil that Mr. Burke had &ldquo;retained less than half&rdquo; of the JMSE £30,000 for his personal campaign.  We now know that he retained it all and that it was from Fitzwilton-Rennicks money that he paid the £10,000 to Fianna Fáil headquarters.</P>
      <P>When did the Taoiseach learn that his September statement was wrong?  We are now told that it was some time in March.  What sort of records does Fianna Fáil keep?  Who is the president of Fianna Fáil?  Who is responsible for the sort of records the party keeps?  If a president of Fianna Fail is conducting an investigation into a particular Minister, does he not have access to party records in regard to fundraising?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Flood tribunal issued an order of discovery on 20 February this year, the Taoiseach must have been aware two and a half months ago that he had misled the public in linking the £10,000 payment from Mr. Ray Burke to JMSE instead of Fitzwilton-Rennicks.  Why did the Taoiseach not come into the House to correct <Col N="997" /> the record of his Dáil statement of 8 October as soon as he knew it was misleading?  It is not a defence to say he was bound to confidentiality in his disclosures to the tribunal.  His first responsibility was to this House.  The Taoiseach, knowingly, allowed a misleading statement made by him in October to remain on the record for two and a half months.  By his own admission today he knew it was a misleading statement by him.  It is hard to believe that last September, in confirming with his party officials that a £10,000 payment had been made by Mr. Burke to headquarters, the Taoiseach would not have found out that this payment was related to Fitzwilton-Rennicks not to JMSE.</P>
      <P>To test the veracity of the Taoiseach's statements we need to know who in Fianna Fáil headquarters checked the 1989 records and if the Taoiseach interviewed the person who checked the records either during his investigation of Mr. Burke prior to his appointment or in the preparation of his Dáil statement of 8 October 1997. Did he check with the party accountant on either occasion?</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that a donation which was supposed to be for national party headquarters was handed to a Minister who had discretion to divert it to cash for his own benefit.  It would have been much easier for Fitzwilton to post the cheque to Fianna Fáil headquarters.  Everyone knows where Fianna Fáil headquarters is.  They know the address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it usual for a public company using shareholders' funds to issue a cheque to cash?  This bizarre method of payment is all the more difficult to justify if the Minister receiving the cash had had dealings in a ministerial capacity with Fitzwilton or companies with overlapping ownership with Fitzwilton.  Did any present Fianna Fáil ministers know of the donation to Mr. Burke at the time or afterwards?  Who were the party treasurers and were they told about it?  Did they take any action and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A spokesman for Fitzwilton has confirmed that the company made donations to two political parties prior to the 1997 general election.  In the interests of transparency will the Taoiseach tell the House whether Fianna Fáil was one of these parties and, if so, how much the party received? Have any personal contributions been made by Fitzwilton to any members of the present Cabinet? It is important that all dealings by Mr. Burke as a Fianna Fáil Minister with companies with overlapping ownership with Fitzwilton now be fully investigated.  Discussions between Mr. Burke and all other Ministers on such dealings with companies with overlapping ownership with Fitzwilton are a matter of valid public concern in the circumstances that have now been disclosed. Mr. Burke may have good and valid explanations, <Col N="998" /> so also may Fitzwilton but the matter must be publicly explained.  It has not been explained in the House by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Fitzwilton plc, Dr. Tony O'Reilly, is an immensely successful businessman. He has created jobs and wealth in Ireland which all Governments have acknowledged.  As is well known, he has extensive business interests in a wide range of areas.  One of Dr. O'Reilly's interests concerns the television transmission system, MMDS, which was a source of considerable controversy in the lead up to and aftermath of the general election of June 1997.  Mr. Burke was linked to that controversy.  Dr. O'Reilly's newspapers took an unprecedented interest in the result of that election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Burke as Minister for Communications in the late 1980s issued licences for the operation of the television transmission system, MMDS.  Of the 29 licences Mr. Burke awarded in 1989, 19 were awarded to Princes Holdings, a company associated with Independent Newspapers Plc., which is controlled by Dr. O'Reilly who also has a big interest in Fitzwilton. Nineteen of the 29 exclusive licences were issued to one company despite the fact that the regulations specifically required the then Minister Burke to have regard &ldquo;to the desirability of allowing any person to have control of an undue number of programme retransmission systems.&rdquo; Was that monopolistic decision discussed at Cabinet at the time?  Did the then and present five Fianna Fáil Ministers approve that monopolistic decision by the then Minister Burke?</P>
      <P>In the change of portfolios after the 1989 election Mr. Burke, although he changed Departments, still retained the portfolio of communications which was transferred from his old Department of Industry to his new Department of Justice.  That was considered a most unusual combination at the time.  The communications brief was referred to by me as Mr. Burke's &ldquo;personal baggage&rdquo;.  This strange allocation of portfolios must have been the subject of discussion between the then Taoiseach and his Progressive Democrats coalition partners.  Why did the Progressive Democrats agree to the allocation of the communications portfolio to Mr. Burke after the 1989 election?  Did they ask any questions about it and, if not, why did the Progressive Democrats negotiators, who included Deputy O'Malley, not ask questions?</P>

      <P>In February 1991, Mr. Burke, the then Minister for Justice and Communications, wrote to Mr. Joe Hayes, managing director of Independent Newspapers, a major shareholder in Princes Holdings, on the status of the MMDS franchises.  He stated:</P>
      <P>You were invited to apply for an exclusive franchise and it is accepted that no further licences for television programme retransmissions, wired broadcast, relay or other rebroadcast or relay within or to your franchise regions will be granted for the duration of your television programme retransmissions licences.</P>
      <P>Neither will the Minister during this time permit geographical extensions in any wired broadcast or relay (cable television) licences which now exist in the region.</P>
      <P>Immediately MMDS service is available in any of your franchise regions, my Department will apply the full rigours of the law to legal operations affecting the franchise region.  My Department will use its best endeavours to ensure that there are no illegal rebroadcasting systems affecting that region within six months after commencement of MMDS transmissions.</P>
      <P>He gave this exclusivity and guaranteed it in this way without bothering to survey, identify and exempt areas where it was physically impossible for Princes Holdings to provide any TV service. Why did Mr. Burke give such far reaching private assurances to a private company?  Was he influenced by the donation he had received two years earlier?  Those written assurances by Mr. Burke to Mr. Hayes tied the State's hand and opened it to huge legal claims if it changed its TV retransmission policy.  Did Mr. Burke discuss this letter to Mr. Hayes with the Cabinet at the time, five members of whom, including the Taoiseach and Minister Molloy, sit at the Cabinet table?  If it is not possible to extend the remit of existing tribunals, I want a full inquiry into these matters with powers to compel attendance of witnesses either by an appropriate committee of this House or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was Charles Haughey's trusted political lieutenant and Ray Burke, in turn, was the Taoiseach's trusted political lieutenant.  At no time in all their long mutual associations did the Taoiseach suspect that there might be anything irregular about Fianna Fáil fundraising, about where the money went, and why.  Did it occur to him to ask a question or is it just a matter of rushing <Col N="1000" /> now for the high moral ground after the event when it makes no difference as against asking the tough questions at the right time when they might have made a difference?</P>

      <P>When Deputy Bertie Ahern was in Opposition, he said to Dáil Éireann in the February 1997 debate on the Dunnes tribunal report that &ldquo;what matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available&rdquo;. In light of the new revelations contained in the latest edition of <i>Magill</i> magazine, that political dictum should be echoing in the Taoiseach's mind.  Clearly in response to the Taoiseach's dictum, he and his party decided the best reaction was to do nothing.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach must fully satisfy the House and the public on his answers to a series of questions which now centre on two issues vital to his credibility. The first is the nature of the inquiry he undertook, on no less than three separate occasions, into the donation to Mr. Ray Burke from JMSE.  We know Mr. Burke's version of events.  We also know the Taoiseach felt it necessary to conduct inquiries and even to appoint a Front Bench colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for this purpose.  We have been told that Deputy Ahern travelled as far as London to interview relevant witnesses.  Yet, apparently all the time the most relevant evidence remained unnoticed on a file in Mount Street.  When the Flood tribunal made its order, Fianna Fáil was able to produce three separate documents which it now accepts demolishes the assurance of Mr. Burke's assertion to this House that he had passed on to his party's head office a substantial portion of a donation which he had received in the normal course of events and for purely political purposes from JMSE.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, those records show an official party receipt in the name of Rennicks, the Fitzwilton subsidiary, acknowledging receipt of £10,000; an extract from the cash receipts book showing the Rennicks' contribution; and a compliment slip from Rennicks accompanying the donation and signed by Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>Unless there was a substantial number of donations passed on to Fianna Fáil's head office by Mr. Burke during the late 1980s and this particular transaction was lost in the volume of files &mdash; a matter which I will pursue &mdash; then it was clear from the very start to anyone who did a basic examination of party records that Mr. Burke's story about his involvement with JMSE was untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sort of inquiry was carried out?  Surely at least the Taoiseach could have satisfied himself on the essential truth of the one aspect of Mr. Burke's version of events, which could be proven <Col N="1001" /> by records available to the leader of Fianna Fáil, that the party had received a donation, via Mr. Burke, from the source whom he claimed had given it.  Yet the party records show this to be untrue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he had looked at the matter &ldquo;inside out and upside down&rdquo; on three occasions, when he heard about it in spring 1996, at some stage in 1997 and again after the election.  He gave assurances when questioned by the media that he had done his utmost to check the story thoroughly.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 September 1997 in words directly attributed to the Taoiseach, he said:</P>
    <P>It was always the same story.  It was a big contribution, There is no doubt about that.  He did give £10,000 to the party.  It was a political contribution.  Mr. Burke received it.  I know the circumstances about it.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the Taoiseach have repeated twice in the last two days that he was not aware at the time Mr. Burke made a statement to the Dáil that the £10,000 donation came from Rennicks.  Yet no credible inquiry, let alone three &ldquo;upside down and inside out&rdquo; inquiries, could have been conducted by him or on his behalf without uncovering that fact.</P>
    <P>My colleague and former party leader, Deputy Spring, received an anonymous note last autumn to this effect:</P>
    <P>Re: Mr. Ray Burke, TD, Rennicks Signs, members of the Fitzwilton Group.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1989 general election, the Rennicks Company applied to the IDA for substantial grants for the manufacturing of road signs and went to see the then Minister for Industry with responsibility for the IDA, Ray Burke TD, to brief him on their application for IDA financial support.  In attendance was Mr. Robin Rennicks, Managing Director; Mr. Paul Power, Director; Mr. Ray McKenna, financial advisor to the Fitzwilton group and Rennicks companies.  Having briefed Mr. Burke, Mr. Burke introduced the subject of financial support for himself and his party and bluntly requested £30,000.  This caused amazement and embarrassment to the delegation.  They requested the opportunity to consider the matter. Mr. Rennicks paid over £30,000 to Ray Burke TD.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to make further allegations regarding the Bovale controversy.  Deputy Spring met the Taoiseach around this time to discuss his general concerns relating to the then unfolding Burke controversy.  He conveyed the contents of this letter to the Taoiseach and said that as the letter was unsigned, he &mdash; Deputy Spring &mdash; would take no further action on the issue, but would leave it with the Taoiseach.  We now know what the Taoiseach did with the information: precisely nothing.</P>
    <P>On the basis of what we now know, the Taoiseach's three inquiries smack of a cover up at <Col N="1002" /> worst and at best an aversion to uncovering the whole truth.  Equally important, however, is the issue of what the Taoiseach did when, to use the phrase in Fianna Fáil's press release last night, he was apprised of the truth.  It is important to note that were it not for the Flood Tribunal making an additional and unexpected order for discovery, this matter would not have come into the public domain.  The tribunal made its order on 20 February 1998 and Fianna Fáil would have prepared its response in the following days.  When the full story became apparent, it must have astonished Fianna Fáil officials, including the party leader.  If the story that they had investigated matters fully is to be believed, they must have felt duped.  The Taoiseach must also have known that the Dáil had been misled.  Why did he not return to the House immediately and apprise it of the facts? This was surely the natural thing to do for a Taoiseach who had been misled by a former party colleague. All Members, particularly those with Government experience, must be aware of the duties they owe.  It does not matter if the misleading statement was deliberate or accidental, nor does it matter if a Member was the author or an unwitting partner to its being made.  One's obligation is to set the record straight at the earliest opportunity.  The Taoiseach chose not to do so. Why?</P>
    <P>We are now faced with two scenarios.  Either the investigations ordered by the Taoiseach were a sham, or they were successful and subsequently information was concealed from the House.</P>

      <P>This debate is bad news for politics because it revives the issue of substantial payments to politicians.  It brings all politicians and political parties into disrepute.  It is bad news for the Taoiseach because he implicated himself in a most unique investigation into a colleague whose appointment to Cabinet he wanted to facilitate. In doing so, the Taoiseach gave him a clean bill of health, appointed him to Government and accused Members who brought up the JMSE donation of hounding an honourable man from office in a vendetta.  It is bad news for the Tánaiste, who was so full in her praise of Mr. Burke's position that not even Fianna Fáil backbenchers expressed similar words.  It is bad news for the relationship between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The Tánaiste is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying: &ldquo;I have total faith in the judgment of the Taoiseach in relation to the Fianna Fáil members of the Cabinet.&rdquo; It is bad news for Deputy Dermot Ahern after his Inspector Clouseau-like performance in London.  I hope he never loses his job because he would not get a job as a private investigator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is bad news for politics because it reopens the Haughey era.  The extraordinary events triggered by the Sam Smyth scoop, which led unexpectedly to blowing the lid off the Haughey era, are now being debated again here.  For young people in particular, given Mr. Haughey's standing as a former Taoiseach, this must be a turnoff when it comes to politics.  The Taoiseach has done an excellent job until now in protecting Fianna Fáil to the extent that many people must now be convinced that the present Taoiseach cannot remember Mr. Haughey's name.</P>
      <P>However, this is still bad news for the Taoiseach. Despite his best efforts, he has failed to ringfence the fallout from the Haughey case.  It has now reached into the heart of his own Cabinet, deprived him of his most senior Minister, raised profound questions about his judgment and raised serious questions about credibility, when he was told by Fianna Fáil headquarters about the £10,000 from Fitzwilton.  Why did he tell journalists on 5 September in relation to the Gogarty or JMSE money that: &ldquo;He did give £10,000 to the party&rdquo;?  Surely if the Taoiseach did not know that that money was Fitzwilton money, Fianna Fáil headquarters would have put him right quickly, long before he sat beside then Deputy Burke while the latter misleadingly led the House to believe the £10,000 he was referring to was JMSE money?  The Taoiseach acquiesced all that time.</P>
      <P>This is bad news for the Tánaiste, because after Mr. Burke's performance she told journalists: &ldquo;I thought it was a very strong statement.  I think it answered all the queries raised in the last number of weeks in various articles in the media.&rdquo; That was the Tánaiste's summation.  It is a claim that even Mr. Burke, incidentally, would not make for himself.  It appears that power doth make cowards of us all.  I do not think the Tánaiste can ever be as trusting in her relationship with the Taoiseach again.  Does she know if these are the only donations received by Mr. Burke?  Does the Taoiseach know?</P>
      <P>This is especially bad news for Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>

      <P>I also received the document read out by Deputy Quinn.  I made inquiries regarding the allegations that the company was looking for IDA grants and was told that there <Col N="1004" /> was no basis to them.  I accepted that, but it is an entirely different construction now.  I did not know that Deputy Spring had brought this to the attention of the Taoiseach in order for him to act. It is now clear that nothing was done, and only for the tribunal this would not have emerged.  It took the Opposition to include a special term of reference for the tribunal to investigate matters other than JMSE and general planning issues.  We would never have known about this otherwise.</P>
      <P>The <i>Magill</i> article deals with £1.3 million being paid out in grants to this company, and it is suggested that those grants were entirely legitimate. This puts an entirely different construction on what Deputy Quinn said.</P>
      <P>When huge donations like this are transferred to politicians most people ask <i>cui bono</i>?  Who benefits and profits from it?  Does it support democracy or are there other reasons for it?  We are assured that Tony O'Reilly knew nothing of this £30,000 donation.  However, as Minister for Communications &mdash; as Deputy John Bruton said, a portfolio Mr. Burke insisted on taking with him &mdash; Mr. Burke would have been well aware through Dr. O'Reilly of the connections of the Rennicks subsidiary to Princes Holdings, to whom he granted 19 of the 29 licences awarded from the MMDS system.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote some of the paragraphs excised from the <i>Magill</i> article, presumably on the basis of legal advice:</P>
      <P>One of Mr. O'Reilly's interests concerns the television transmission system, MMDS.  That was the source of considerable controversy in the lead up and the aftermath of the general election of June 1997.  Mr. Burke was linked to that controversy.</P>
      <P>In 1988 Mr. Burke, then Minister for Communications, issued licences for the operation of a television transmission system, Multi Micropoint Distribution System, MMDS.  Of the 29 licences awarded, 19 were awarded to Princes Holdings, a company associated with Independent Newspapers plc, which is controlled by Mr. O'Reilly.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Justice and Communications, Mr. Burke, wrote to Joe Hayes, managing director of Independent Newspapers:</P>
      <P>You were invited to apply for exclusive franchises and it is accepted that no further licences for television programme retransmissions, wired broadcast, relay or other rebroadcast or relay within or to your franchise regions will be granted for the duration of your television programme retransmission licences.</P>
      <P>Neither will the Minister, during this time, permit geographical extensions to any wired broadcast relay, cable television, licences which now exist in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undertaking given in my letter of 28 May 1990 to the Irish Cable Operators Association applies to your company.  Immediately MMDS service is available in any of your franchise <Col N="1005" /> regions, my Department will apply the full rigours of the law to illegal operations affecting that franchise region.  My department will use its best endeavours to ensure that there are no illegal rebroadcasting systems affecting that region within commencement of MMDS transmission.</P>
    <P>These paragraphs were excised but it is important that we know who drafted the letter.  Given its nature and contents, we need to know if it had been approved by the Attorney General before it issued.</P>
    <P>The investigation requested by Deputy John Bruton, perhaps initially carried out by a committee of this House, is necessary.  The statements in <i>Magill</i> in terms of Dr. Tony O'Reilly may be correct. However, if the lid continues to come off the Haughey era and if members of Fianna Fáil who were not complicit in any way are branded like the rest of us and the ranking of politicians debased, we have to clear the matter up once and for all.</P>
    <P>There was never any clarity about the extraordinary incident a long time ago when the then Minister, Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, offered Ray MacSharry a very large sum of money to shift his allegiance from Mr. Haughey.  It seems remarkable that the source of that money was never established.  It assuredly did not come from a Trinity don, which is an unusual vehicle to make such an offer.  Perhaps this investigation may discover where that money came from and its purpose in politics.</P>
    <P>At the time of the general election, we experienced the influence of Independent Newspapers plc.  which is dominant in the newspaper market. It has a 30 per cent shareholding in <i>The Sunday</i><i>Tribune</i> and effectively controls it financially, as well as ten provincial newspapers.  Few people in politics will forget the impact of the front page editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the day before the general election headed &ldquo;It Is Now Payback Time&rdquo;.  We have been assured that people like Tony O'Reilly do not influence editorial decisions of the paper control.

      <P>The Taoiseach's speech is as carefully crafted a response to the issues raised as were the replies of the former Minister, Mr. Burke, to questions put to him in this House on 10 September 1997.  The Taoiseach treaded carefully through a political minefield and was economical with the truth.  I do not say that with pleasure.  Following events in this House on 10 September 1997, Mr. Burke said a line was being drawn in the sand.  Today's events show that this Government is standing midriff in political quicksand.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach emphasised the need for ensuring full clarity.  I wish to deal with the Taoiseach's speech and take matters further from where we stand in the debate at this moment.  The Taoiseach referred to Fianna Fáil as having, in a sense, some merit:</P>
      <P>At no stage prior to the delivery of the affidavit of discovery had the tribunal ever asked any questions of Fianna Fáil in relation to Rennicks, the Fitzwilton subsidiary.</P>
      <P>As if it is praiseworthy he went on to say:</P>
      <P>It was the Fianna Fáil Party which volunteered and disclosed through the discovery process documentation in relation to Rennicks.</P>
      <P>The order of discovery was made on 20 February 1998.  What is not known in this House is that the anonymous letter received by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn and Deputy De Rossa which has been read into the record of this House, was also received by the Fine Gael party last September.  It was sent anonymously and there was no means of confirming its veracity.  No Member of this party wanted to make wild allegations that could not be substantiated.</P>
      <P>In a public hearing which took place before the planning tribunal at the beginning of February, Mr. Justice Flood commented on anonymous correspondence he received.  At that stage it was determined that bearing in mind that the tribunal was the recipient of anonymous correspondence, it was in the interests of ensuring the tribunal was able to fully carry out its work that Deputy John Bruton referred the anonymous letter about Rennicks to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over two weeks after the tribunal received that <Col N="1007" /> letter, the order for discovery was made in respect of documentation held by the Fianna Fáil party.  There is a clear and absolute nexus to the events which occurred.  It is obvious that first, the investigation conducted by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil party before the formation of the present Government, was little short of a charade.  I disagree with Deputy Rabbitte on one issue &mdash; Deputy Dermot Ahern's investigation does not make him the Inspector Clouseau of Irish politics but the Mr. Magoo of Irish politics.  He took the plane to England when all he had to do was walk down the road to Mount Street and ask his own general secretary to check the books.  At that stage the information was readily and clearly accessible, but a mock investigation took place which did not produce the information which resulted from the order of discovery.  Serious questions must be asked as to why that is so.</P>
    <P>On 5 September 1997 the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a story shortly before the Dáil debate in which Ray Burke made a statement and answered questions.  In the story the issue arose of the payment made by Deputy Burke from the Gogarty moneys, or JMSE, to Fianna Fáil.  The article stated:</P>
    <P>Last night the Fianna Fáil general secretary, Pat Farrell, confirmed to the <i>Irish Independent</i> that £10,000 of the £30,000 had been handed over to party headquarters during the course of the June 1989 general election.  The precise date could be furnished when the Fianna Fáil financial controller returned from holidays.</P>
    <P>The £30,000 was not an anonymous sum &mdash; it was from the money paid by Mr. Gogarty.  I presume the Fianna Fáil financial controller was not on holidays from 5 September 1997 until 20 February 1998.  Mr. Farrell stated that Mr. Burke had passed on the contribution himself.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the presentation of this issue by Fianna Fáil under the leadership of the Taoiseach was that Mr. Burke received £30,000 from Mr. Gogarty, £10,000 of which was paid to Fianna Fáil headquarters.  The Taoiseach again referred to this issue in the debate which took place on the resignation of Mr. Burke, saying that &ldquo;accepting an unsolicited gift of £30,000 of which less than half was retained for his personal campaign was certainly imprudent, but a few weeks ago in the House almost no one considered it a hanging offence&rdquo;.  What the Taoiseach has not told us in his carefully crafted speech is whether he asked the general secretary of Fianna Fáil if the £10,000 received by the party was from JMSE.  He stated that up to the period shortly before the affidavit of discovery was sworn on 1 April he had been &ldquo;given to understand that the £10,000 received by Fianna Fáil from Ray Burke in 1989 was drawn from a contribution he had received from Joseph Murphy Structural Engineering&rdquo;.  Who gave him to understand that?  Was it Fianna Fáil's general secretary, its financial controller, Ray Burke or <Col N="1008" /> Deputy Dermot Ahern, who Magoo-like tottered around in political darkness trying to ascertain what on earth was going on?  The Taoiseach stated it was reasonable to presume that the money came from this source and that &ldquo;the reasons for this belief was because our inquiries last summer and last autumn had concentrated on establishing, following media allegations, if Ray Burke had received a large donation in 1989 from JMSE or people associated with it; if so, were there any special reasons; and if, as claimed, Fianna Fáil had received a £10,000 draft from Ray Burke&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the draft as if the inquiry last September concerned whether Ray Burke had at some stage in 1989 paid a sum of £10,000 to Fianna Fáil.  However, the inquiry was to discover whether the draft had been paid out of JMSE moneys.  Is the Taoiseach saying he failed to ask that question and that he lacked the competence to request his party's general secretary to investigate that issue?  Why is it that within two or three weeks, or less, after Deputy Bruton referred the Rennicks letter to the tribunal and the tribunal sought an order of discovery, Fianna Fáil was able to produce three different sets of documentary evidence to show that the £10,000 received never derived from JMSE but rather from Rennicks?  Why was there such confusion?  Why did it take an order of discovery from the tribunal for it to become clear that the JMSE moneys were retained by Ray Burke and that the £10,000 paid to Fianna Fáil was one third of the money from Rennicks Manufacturing? Either there was a cover-up or a sham series of investigations with public assumptions to protect Fianna Fáil.  That is simply not good enough.  It goes to the core of the credibility of the Taoiseach and the Government.  It undermines the credibility of Deputy Dermot Ahern in the context of public utterances he will make on a variety of issues in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>But not so far on this issue.  The statement is with the tribunal and the Deputy does not know what it contains.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the credibility of any statement made by him on this issue in the past. This is the responsibility of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this issue the Taoiseach has exhibited either incompetence or has been extraordinarily economical with the truth.  He supported the view in the House that Deputy Burke had paid the £10,000 from JMSE to Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach had an obligation to the House, following the information becoming available to him, to put the record straight but failed to do so.  In his speech he refers to the fact that it would have been better if Ray Burke had told us about these other moneys when addressing the House last September.  In September I asked Ray Burke to inform the House of moneys he had received in addition to those from JMSE.  He said, &ldquo;as far as other funding is concerned, I am here to answer <Col N="1009" /> questions in respect of a donation of £30,000.  I never received a larger contribution but I have no intention of dealing with other subscriptions I received before or since the period under discussion&rdquo;. Mr. Burke remained in office for four weeks after drawing the line in the sand, having refused to disclose to the House the nature of any other contributions received by him.  At that time Fianna Fáil headquarters knew of the Rennicks contribution and the Taoiseach stood over Mr. Burke's refusal to reveal to the House the additional and extraordinarily coincidental contribution of £30,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has serious questions to answer which have not been answered and which cannot be answered in full by the tribunal under Mr. Justice Flood who is confined to considering payments by JMSE and planning issues.  All Mr. Justice Flood can conclude in relation to this payment is that the £10,000 paid to Fianna Fáil did not derive from JMSE but from Rennicks. The tribunal cannot say why the payment was made or why Fianna Fáil dealt with it in the manner in which it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What action, if any, did the Taoiseach take after he was apprised of the contents of the anonymous note of last autumn, which I placed on the record of the House?  Why, when he was apprised in March 1998 on foot of the discovery of documentation for the Flood tribunal, did he not take the opportunity to come before the House and set the record straight, knowing that he had, perhaps inadvertently, misled the House on the basis of the information he received?</P>

      <P>Last Friday was a hugely historic day for our country.  It was a good day to be Irish and a good day to be in politics.  It appeared that politicians had redeemed themselves.  After years of scandals and tribunals in which the profession of politics was seriously tarnished politicians had made a huge effort to negotiate peace for our island.  However, only 56 per cent of the electorate in the Republic voted.  Why?  The answer is that for many people politics is irrelevant, dirty and corrupt.  As far as they are concerned, Dáil Éireann is a type of cesspit and they hold politicians in contempt.  They see the revelations in <i>Magill</i> as &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Politicians often have a tendency to blame the messenger.  They believe it is the fault of the media that they are held in such low esteem because the media concentrate on the negative aspects of politics.  I reject that interpretation. The only people who can clean up politics are politicians and we can do that quickly by making a clean breast of these matters.  Each party should declare fully and openly where it gets its money. If that is not done, the scandals and suspicions of corruption will continue and politicians will continue to be the losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party is prepared to open its books and declare where we get every penny of our funding. <Col N="1010" /> Other parties should do the same.  However, will they do it?  I doubt it.  What we have here is a charade and the Taoiseach and the Government are aware of that.  The Opposition pots are calling the Government kettle black.  If Fitzwilton gave money to other political parties, the parties should declare it today.  If they admit it, they will probably repeat the political mantra of the 1990s that no favours were sought or given.  This is nonsense. While money from big business is lubricating the wheels of politics, the engine of democracy is grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>The so-called &ldquo;main&rdquo; parties are culpable.  The definition of a main party is no longer determined in terms of size &mdash; I have always argued the Green Party is equal in size to some of the smaller parties in the House &mdash; but in terms of where they get their money.  All parties, including the smaller parties, appear to be getting money from the banks.  The Taoiseach referred to this in his speech in the context of establishing rules and guidelines.</P>
    <P>A few months ago significant changes were made to the Electoral Act.  They were agreed by the so-called main parties and were passed by the Oireachtas without a murmur from the media. The changes are particularly significant in the case of Mr. Burke.  They related to donations from the party to an individual in the party and to moneys given to an individual which were subsequently given to the party.  The only Members who spoke out against these changes were the Green Party Deputies and Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
    <P>The changes to that legislation permit the type of occurrence we are now discussing.  It is now possible for an individual to get money from a company and pass it to the party without having to declare it.  That is wrong and the House made a fundamental error when it agreed to that change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is true.  The party can subsequently help that individual in certain ways.  It is a means of politically laundering money.</P>
      <P>On 10 September last year, I asked Mr. Burke why the donation was made in cash.  He said I would have to put that question to Mr. Gogarty. I am not in a position to so do.  However, can the Taoiseach say if it is standard practice that companies making large contributions normally make the cheques out to cash?  Does he now unequivocally condemn the actions of Mr. Burke?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House last year that it had hounded an honourable man from office. Does he still consider Mr. Burke to be an honourable man?  Does the Tánaiste still have total faith in Mr. Burke?  Will the Progressive Democrats stand by and allow this type of behaviour to continue? They are also somewhat compromised, however, by the documents which were found in the skip.  The Progressive Democrats lack credibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has been misled.  The Taoiseach led <Col N="1011" /> us to believe that the £10,000 came from JMSE and this mistruth was continued.  The document read by Deputy Quinn is devastating.  Why did the Taoiseach not act on the information from Deputy Spring?  We have been told that Mr. O'Reilly knew nothing about the £30,000. However, he certainly benefited from the actions of Mr. Burke.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the symbiotic relationship between big business and politics continues to exist and to arouse suspicions.  The only way the Taoiseach can allay them is by opening up the system.  We might be opening a can of worms but it would be a cathartic experience by which we could cleanse politics once and for all.  If that is not done, the real losers will be politicians and the profession of politics.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, Mr. Haughey might be gone but the Haugheyites live on and are thriving in Government.  I watched the Taoiseach being interviewed on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; recently.  He appeared to row back from his previous position on this issue.  His attitude appeared to be that Charles Haughey was not such a bad guy after all.  When people bring politics into disrepute they should be condemned unequivocally.</P>

There will be lower election turnouts than ever.  We must make an effort and have stricter controls on contributions to political parties.  All contributions should be revealed. Why not have complete openness and transparency? What have we to fear?  Perhaps people fear the connection that obviously exists between contributions from big business and the actions of politicians.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be no more revelations over the coming years because if there are, there will be the lowest turnout ever at the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> A Minister or any politician who receives £30,000 from a developer or an agent of big business is, by virtue of that, seriously compromised regardless of the context of that donation.  This issue is larger than one individual, the former Minister, Mr. Burke.  It goes to the heart of our political system and of the political establishment that dominates that system.  It has long been suspected that a golden circle of big businesses, leading politicians and political parties exists in the State and that suspicion was proven by revelations culminating in a series of tribunals.  However, we still do not know the extent of the golden circle and, as yesterday's revelations show, we still do not know what remains hidden.</P>
      <P>The principal of the company at the centre of this controversy, Mr. O'Reilly, through Independent Newspapers and Fitzwilton, wields enormous power in the State and beyond.  Independent Newspapers made £100 million profit last year.  Ownership of five national newspapers and ten regional papers in this small State gives that one individual and his company massive power, not to mention the fact that his tentacles stretch right across the globe in terms of controlling important sections of the mass media in a number of countries, even Australia.</P>
      <P>As reported in an article in <i>Magill,</i> over the years Fitzwilton plc has made contributions to all the main political parties through their representatives. The difference between an individual politician and a party getting a large donation is only a difference of degree.  Despite the fact that leading politicians have been at pains to create a chasm between the two types of donation, in reality it is all part of the one scenario.</P>
      <P>In 1989 £30,000 was equal to the average annual income of three ordinary workers and £60,000 was equal to the average annual income of six workers.  The ordinary people do not believe these large donations are given as a demonstration of the generosity of the corporations giving them or because of their alleged concern for the democratic system.  Since corporations and developers are mean in practically every aspect of their business lives, why should their hearts suddenly melt on the doorsteps of politicians and political parties where they are apparently consumed by overweaning generosity?</P>
      <P>Big businesses and developers who give large donations expect rewards in return, whether they are outlined at the time or in an unspoken understanding that will materialise later in, for example, a Finance Bill at budget time or in drastic cuts in corporation or capital gains tax under various guises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between developers, business and the former Minister, Ray Burke, was rotten to the core.  A political system which is paid large contributions by big business and, for which, in return, the businesses receive favourable consideration from Governments &mdash; even if it is done legally &mdash; is corrupt.  That type of corruption has been oozing from the pores of the political system <Col N="1013" /> in this State for many decades and it is evident in all our industries.  The banks have donated handsomely to political parties over the years and were treated accordingly in various budgets and Finance Bills.  Developers and builders have made massive contributions to political parties and have also been handsomely rewarded.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers called for transparency.  I call on all the political parties to outline before this debate concludes whether, since 1980, they received funds from Fitzwilton or any of its subsidiaries or related companies, how many donations they received and how much money was involved.  Since Fitzwilton claims it contributed across the board, the parties should state whether they have been at the end of its generosity. If they are not prepared to give the information, they should state why.  Failure to give the information will allow the public to again draw the conclusion that this is not a serious debate, that the political establishment is involved in another exercise of shadow boxing and covering up the mechanics by which the system works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate and commend them for the spirit in which they asked questions.  I have never concealed information or been economical with the truth.  I ask my colleagues to accept that.  It is simply not in my nature to do that, and certainly not on this issue.</P>
      <P>Members asked about the inquiry I asked Deputy Ahern to carry out.  Before the appointment of the Government, allegations surfaced from many places that the then Deputy Burke had received money.  I tried to find out the truth, but got nowhere.  I did not go around as an investigator, I simply tried to follow up inquiries that had been made, but people would not give me any information.  I asked Deputy Dermot Ahern to carry out an investigation and we tried to cross check information we had picked up.  We tried to contact Mr. Joe Murphy, the principal in JMSE. Deputy Ahern travelled to London at my request to conduct an interview with that gentleman.  He tried to examine the array of allegations that were made about Ray Burke, whether he had received a donation from JMSE or others and the amount involved.  It was not illegal in 1989 to receive a donation.  We were simply trying to find out if one had been given and, more importantly, if there was any substance to the allegations being made by Mr. Gogarty.  That was Deputy Ahern's specific task.  He has submitted his report to the tribunal and it will be public knowledge in due course.  He told me that Mr. Murphy denied donating any money.  On the day I appointed the then Deputy Burke as Minister I was working on the understanding that no money had been given to him.  I asked Deputy Ahern to do a job and he did it to the best of his ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  That was two days before the Cabinet was formed.  I sent Deputy Ahern to London because of the rumours going around, and that was the result.  Of course, we subsequently found out that was not the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked two questions.  I recollect only two conversations with Deputy Spring.  The first took place in Washington at the Ireland Fund dinner, where we certainly did not discuss that issue and the second took place where Deputy Gormley is sitting now.  Following Deputy Spring's resignation I spoke to him briefly during a vote in the House and he asked me to assist in concluding an arrangement relating to a staff member.  He may have mentioned it to me on that night but I have no recollection of it.  I recollect receiving a number of anonymous letters and notes, though not many, regarding the former Deputy, Mr. Burke.  Our party headquarters gave at least one of these to the tribunal. Without checking, I am not sure if it was the same letter but if Deputy Spring said he mentioned that and referred it to me, I accept that.  I accept that is what Deputy Spring said but I do not have any particular recollection.  If I did, I am sure I would have said so because many others have asked me if I got any notes.  I got more than one or two, unfortunately, but, no more than anyone else, I could not substantiate them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked when this was brought to my attention.  I was told in early February that we would receive orders from the tribunal with which we would have to comply.  We had a number of new staff and had started going through all our records at headquarters, not just on this issue but on others because I was anxious to update and improve our system.  We have all our records, thankfully, and we were going through the records and putting things in place.  Later on this was discussed with the staff at headquarters.  In the last week or ten days of March, certainly after St. Patrick's Day, the staff informed me that in checking &mdash; they checked a number of things, it was not the only thing &mdash; they had found that the £10,000 had nothing to do with JMSE.  In their view it concerned a company called Rennicks and they tracked this in the documents I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the first check was in any way thorough.  The first check last year was whether Ray Burke gave the party £10,000.  That was the only issue we were really concerned with at that stage and the answer to the question was yes.  When they started doing more detailed checks they found that it was not from JMSE; they believed it was from Rennicks.  I asked the officials to check this out and said we would have to report it to the tribunal immediately.  I thought that was the proper procedure; to give it to the tribunal because the Dáil had given the tribunal powers to follow this up.  I thought I should disclose it.  Perhaps I should also have given it to the Dáil.  I am not going to argue about that.  Perhaps that would have been a good idea but I did not do that; I gave it to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> I also told the officials they should inform the company that we were disclosing this.  One of the officials contacted Mr. Robin Rennicks, on my behalf, to tell him of this.  Mr. Rennicks was in the Far East and we had difficulty finding him.  A Mr. David Byrne, on behalf of the company, made contact to say that they had given no money at all, under any circumstances, and that this was not correct.  Some time later, Mr. Rennicks confirmed that it was the case.  We went ahead and gave the data to the tribunal.  That is the position.  I asked the general secretary, when he made the statement, if we got the £10,000. That was it.  There was no intrigue.  I was not checking anything else.  Maybe I should have gone through the books.  I would say to Deputy Shatter that at least we have books to go through.</P>

      <P>I note what Members are saying about these matters but I do not know if there are specific allegations arising from what Deputies Rabbitte and Bruton have said.  We already have two tribunals and if there is some way of including any of these issues within their terms of reference, these allegations could be looked at, or the matter could be referred to by a committee of the House.  In either event it would be subject to the normal process and legal advice.  I have no difficulty with either option but analysing the best way of doing that is a matter for another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I received the anonymous allegations in regard to Rennicks Signs back in September, we inquired whether any IDA grant had been paid to Rennicks Signs.  We discovered that no such grant had been paid, which was one of the reasons for taking the view that this allegation was not sufficiently substantial to go public with at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach know whether a grant was actually paid or sought by the Rennicks company from the IDA while Mr. Burke was Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Did Mr. Burke, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, discuss with the Taoiseach, with the Fianna Fáil Cabinet or the Fianna Fáil-Progressive <Col N="1016" /> Democrats Cabinet, his decision to give an exclusive licence for the MMDS system to one company, which happens to have an owner in common with Fitzwilton?  Was that discussed with the Cabinet?  Equally, was the further letter about that matter of 1991 discussed either with the Cabinet or with Fianna Fáil Ministers?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence requiring an investigation into the possible motives for the payment by Fitzwilton to Mr. Burke?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the motives for that payment ought to be investigated? If he does so agree, does he further agree that the existing tribunals cannot do that within their existing terms of reference and that the Attorney General has advised it is not possible to change their terms of reference?  The Taoiseach has been loud in the House in repeating that advice.  If that is the case, and if the Taoiseach agrees that the motives for this payment by Fitzwilton to Mr. Burke ought to be investigated, how does he propose to investigate it?  Does he agree that we must make a decision on that quickly? Does he agree that a committee of the House ought to have the power to compel witnesses to appear on that matter?  Has he checked whether any members of the existing Cabinet have received any money of a personal kind from Fitzwilton or associated companies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, I have no information on the Rennicks' IDA grant.  I will have to check that.  I do not believe it received a grant but I would like to have that confirmed before I put it on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>As regards the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I understand from having checked today that an <i>aide memoire</i> was brought in the normal way to Cabinet setting out the fact that there would be competitive arrangements. Subsequently, I do not believe anything more was discussed at Cabinet.  I have no information regarding the letter of 1991 or of those issues having been discussed.  Neither have I any knowledge of any Ministers being involved in any of those discussions.  The normal practice would have been that once the <i>aide memoire</i> was passed the system was set up and it would have been a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I have asked through the Minister to have the records, files and <i>aide memoires</i> checked within the Department. There has been some delay, however, because these files and records were removed to the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and they have only now been returned.  They are being checked by the civil servants within the Department to see if they contain anything of concern.</P>
      <P>As regards my Cabinet colleagues, I checked last year and none of them received financial aid from Fitzwilton or any other subsidiaries.  I have not checked in the recent past because any money they now receive must be declared under the new law so it would be public knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I can understand how someone could say there are motives behind such payments in the same way they said there was a motive related to planning behind the £30,000 payment.  If there is something to investigate, it should be brought within the terms of the inquiries.  Deputy John Bruton was correct when he said that it cannot be investigated by the current tribunals because the Flood tribunal is only dealing with planning issues, and this is not such an issue, and the Moriarty tribunal is investigating other individuals and is not directly related to this.  If the House believes these are matters of substance, I would prefer if they were dealt with by the tribunals. I discussed that matter today with the Attorney General who discussed it with some of his staff. We have not come to a conclusion yet because we want to know if there is just a possibility of a motive or if there is something of substance to investigate.</P>
    <P>I can understand how people could say that Cabinet members are involved.  However, my investigations show that no member of the Cabinet is involved in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it only in the last 24 hours that the Taoiseach started inquiries in the Department of Public Enterprise about the allocation of MMDS licences?  Surely as soon as he heard last March that Mr. Burke had received a donation of £30,000 from Fitzwilton, which has a common ownership with Princes Holdings, he would have recognised that there could have been a conflict of interest in Mr. Burke's case? Why is it only today that he has started to investigate it?  Did it not occur to him to make such an investigation when, by his own admission, he heard about this matter last March and knew then that £30,000 had been paid by Fitzwilton to Mr. Burke?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that alarm bells should have been set off in his mind when he thought back to the controversy concerning the MMDS issue and the fact that the communications brief was treated as a personal fiefdom for Mr. Burke by Mr. Haughey?  Did the Taoiseach not think there was something strange about that?  Why is it only today that he has apparently contacted the Director of Telecommunications Regulation?  Is it not possible that people might say the Taoiseach is only making these inquiries now because the issue has become public and that as long as no one knew that any money had been paid to Mr. Burke by Fitzwilton, the Taoiseach would not have made any inquiries?  It is only because the matter was brought to light in <i>Magill</i> today that he is making these inquiries.</P>

      <P>That matter was on my mind. As soon as it was brought to my attention I said it must be made known to the tribunal.  If the tribunal wanted to change or extend its terms of reference or to make recommendations, it would have asked to do so.  It is not for me to carry out the tribunal's work.  The tribunal has asked us in <Col N="1018" /> Fianna Fáil a number of times to look at this aspect.  I do not want to do the tribunal's work.  I have asked the officials in the Department of Public Enterprise if there is something in this which requires us to ask the tribunal to investigate it under its terms of reference.  The chairman of the tribunal can make a request to change the terms of reference.  That was the only motivation and it is the job the tribunal is carrying out.</P>

      <P>The tribunal has been through, in the most detailed manner, all the financial records of former Deputy, Mr. Ray Burke.  It is commonly known that it has cross-checked everything. I am sure this information, which came to its attention in March, will assist it in its work.  A number of senior counsels and a large staff are working on these matters.  If it thought it required an extension or an amendment of its terms of reference, it would have requested that.  If it felt this payment was outside its brief, it would not have paid such great attention to it and asked two senior counsels to follow it up.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach stated that he spoke to Mr. Burke and then he asked the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to conduct an inquiry.  Did he specifically ask Mr. Ray Burke if he had received money from JMSE/Murphy &mdash; I am equating the two for the purpose of the debate &mdash; and, if so, what was his reply?  I accept what the Taoiseach said in relation to what Mr. Murphy said in London to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. However, what action did the Taoiseach take when Mr. Ray Burke said in the House that he had received money from JMSE/Murphy?  He appeared to support that position prior to Mr. Ray Burke's final resignation.  Was there not a conflict in the Taoiseach's mind at that stage between the report the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had produced and what Mr. Burke said?</P>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach has no recollection of the information conveyed to him by Deputy Spring in relation to the contents of the anonymous letter.  Given that Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Labour Party got a copy of what was an anonymous letter &mdash; all of us in politics receive such letters &mdash; and in light of the specific rumours surrounding Mr. Burke, of which this was another, and the fact the Taoiseach was investigating other rumours, did the Taoiseach receive such a letter, or specifically that letter, or hear any rumours associated with Mr. Ray Burke and Rennicks and, if so, did he act upon it?</P>

Any letter I received was after Ray Burke left the House.  I think I may have got one before he left this House which came to nothing, in so far as I could check it.  In fact it was impossible for Ray Burke to be involved in it and, when I had them checked, I found that some of the names in the letters did not exist.  I had taken some trouble to do that while he was here.  A letter from Rennicks was not one of those I was pursuing.</P>

      <P>To avoid misunderstanding, and I do not in any way wish to wrongfoot the Taoiseach, Deputy Dermot Ahern investigated rumours surrounding contributions to Ray Burke. This was sufficiently important for the Taoiseach to be concerned before the Government was formed on 26 June.  Deputy Dermot Ahern went to London and asked a specific question of a specific person in relation to Ray Burke.

Is he seriously telling Deputy Quinn that, while he dispatched someone to London to ask the donor if he gave the money, he did not ask his colleague if he had received it? If he did not receive it, what was the point in sending someone to London to find out if the donor gave it?  Is it the case that in all this time and for the preceding two years the Neary business was in the headlines?  Every so often the Neary issue would blow up and it was manifestly known to be about planning.  Did the Taoiseach ask Ray Burke prior to his appointment to Cabinet whether he had received any payments in connection with that?  That was the background that gave rise to all these questions.

      <P>Did the Taoiseach refresh his memory before coming into this important debate in terms of his own standing on the anonymous information Deputy Bruton, Deputy Spring and I received and whether the Rennicks issue was in the middle of it?  Does the Taoiseach know of or suspect any payments to Mr. Burke other than the two that have now come into the public arena?  Does the Taoiseach accept that at a minimum this reflects very badly on his judgment and that despite all that we now know, he proceeded to appoint the then Deputy Ray Burke to a senior Cabinet post?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a brief discussion with Deputy Spring and it was the only occasion he could have mentioned it to me.  I received a number of anonymous letters and there was one we considered we should put before the tribunal.  I did not check that today but I certainly remember checking a few others.  I could tell the Deputy in half an hour whether it was the letter from Rennicks.  It is as simple as that.  In regard to what we were checking, Mr. Ray Burke never stated he did not get contributions: he got contributions. My concern was to be absolutely clear if he got a very substantial contribution.  Having checked the matter through Bailey and JMSE, it was not clear whether he had received that contribution.  My concern was whether he had received it and if there was anything wrong with it.</P>
      <P>To this day, Ray Burke would say &mdash; and I asked him on a number of occasions &mdash; that he received contributions and there was no wrongdoing. That is the reason he is involved in the inquiry and I presume, until the inquiry is concluded, he is innocent.

Was it normal for donations to Fianna Fáil to be made in Ministers' homes?</P>

      <P>It is not acceptable that people should take party donations made out to themselves or to cash.  If they were made out to the party these matters would not arise.  The system is different now in that these donations have to be declared.  The events to which the Deputy referred were not normal practice.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, when I tried to find out in the first instance about these matters, I was told that no money whatsoever had been given.  It was only when officers in Fianna Fáil headquarters found the receipt that we knew this money had to be from Rennicks, that the contribution was given through Mr. Burke from Rennicks.</P>
      <P>On the matter of no favours asked, as I said earlier in reply to Deputy Quinn, I was told by Mr. Burke when I asked &mdash; I ask prior to the election because I remember stating it in at least two or three press conferences around the country where people asked me about it &mdash; that no favours were asked and no favours were given.  I am sure the inquiry will find out whether that is true.  The inquiry has been working to that end for a considerable time and I am sure by the time it reaches its conclusion, it will be satisfied on that matter.  I cannot say categorically what was the position in relation to Fitzwilton or Rennicks.</P>

In that context, will the Taoiseach clarify whether he made contact with Rennicks to ask why the payment was made?  What did the company think it was doing?

      <P>I got back here not with the suffrage of the Minister of State but with the support of the people of north County Dublin.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising this issue with the Minister.  The crisis in the potato industry which has affected growers in Wexford and Cork but particularly those in Lusk, Rush, Ballyboughal and other parts of Fingal was brought about by heavy rainfall and severe frost just before Easter.  The effect of this is that the traditional early Rush flowery potatoes to which we have been accustomed every year will not be available this year.  We will have to make do with imported potatoes from Spain, Greece, England and Israel.  New Irish potatoes will not be available in the shops until late August or early September.</P>
      <P>For many of the growers, particularly those depending on the first and second crops, the financial loss will be devastating and some of them may be put out of business.  Some of the crops have already been completely destroyed and ploughed into the ground.  Others are very severely damaged and if decisions are not taken to dig them out within the next week blight may take over. We all know the implications of such a development. These farmers and their families are devastated. Having planted the seed potatoes they were looking forward to a bumper crop, particularly as the early indications were that there would be a good yield this year.  Compensation must be on the agenda.  The growers are particularly aware of the process which must be gone through with Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the European Commission and the Government before compensation is paid.</P>
      <P>One matter requires immediate attention.  The Minister must direct Teagasc survey the extent of the problems and assist the growers in making decisions on the depleted crops.  There are precedents for giving compensation but we must identify the problem and I hope this will be done with the help of Teagasc.</P>
      <P>The horticulture industry is the Cinderella section within the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The vegetable growers are being squeezed out of business and their jobs are at risk.  We want to see action.  The Minister must direct Teagasc to identify the problem and report on it to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Unfortunately the Minister is unable to be in the House this evening. Approximately 1,500 growers are commercially involved in potato production, growing in the region of 16,000 hectares.  The annual area planted for early ware production is approximately 3,500 hectares, over 50 per cent of which is planted in County Dublin.  As there is no common organisation of the market nor any form of intervention mechanisms such as market withdrawals or export support, the potato sector is <Col N="1030" /> subject to normal market forces which can lead to fluctuations in producer prices and in areas planted from year to year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food introduced a scheme at the end of last year to compensate farmers heavily dependent on tillage crops for their income, for losses sustained as a direct result of the exceptionally adverse weather conditions which occurred in 1997.  This scheme was designed to assist a small number of growers, including a number of potato growers, whose livelihoods were threatened as a direct result of the adverse weather conditions and the scheme was a special once-off measure.</P>
      <P>Ground conditions during the spring this year were such that it was possible to complete soil preparation and planting of the early potato crop somewhat earlier than in other years.  The early potato crops were well advanced in growth as a result of the favourable growing conditions up to the time of the severe frosts in April.  The foliage of such crops was vulnerable and was damaged by the severe frost.  A setback of this nature to growth would normally result in later harvesting of potato crops and an erosion in the level of producer prices achieved where harvesting overlapped with harvesting of main crop potatoes.</P>
      <P>Crop damage from the severe frosts was not confined to potatoes alone nor to County Dublin. Under the circumstances it would be inappropriate at this point to undertake a survey with a view to establishing the extent of potential losses to the early potato crop.  Teagasc advisory staff normally monitor such problems and advise producers on crop options available to them.  A general record on crop status is normally retained in such areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has no funds available to compensate potato growers whose crops are found to have been damaged by the heavy frosts in April of this year.  Weather conditions leading to various levels of crop losses are a normal feature of farming and frost damage is a particular risk for growers engaged in early potato production.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Installation Aid Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  This is an extremely important subject throughout the agricultural sector. It is of particular importance to young farmers who desire to take over their parents' farms and to facilitate the smooth and earlier transfer of these farms which is extremely beneficial from a structural and socio-economic perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The installation aid has been suspended since 7 August 1997, a period of more than nine months, and, despite empty rhetoric, it has not been restored.  While one might accept the explanation put forward in September 1997 that there were inadequate means to fund the scheme, this explanation does not hold water now as there was a clear failure on the part of the Government in the budget on 3 December 1997 to provide the <Col N="1031" /> necessary finance to permit the scheme to recommence in January 1998.  Instead, there was a fudge and an attempted smokescreen with an amount provided in the budget to permit those who had been in the process prior to the suspension date to be now processed.  However, the nub of the matter is that there was no funding for the many new applicants who had the necessary educational and training qualifications who sought entry to the scheme but remain locked out and deprived of a grant to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the drop-off in numbers participating in agricultural colleges in the 1997-8 academic year.  In 1996, 932 students enrolled in the 11 agricultural colleges; this number dropped by over 8 per cent to 858 in 1997; the agricultural colleges have the capacity to take in 950 students. When I attended one of these very fine colleges at picturesque Multifarnham, County Westmeath, in 1976 the college was overflowing with students. Teagasc has a number of training centres which have the capacity to enrol 534 agricultural students each year but only 343 students enrolled in 1997.</P>
    <P>These are the facts and it is hardly a coincidence that the drop in numbers in agricultural colleges and Teagasc training centres happened at a time when there was a suspension of installation aid.  These are stark statistics which tell their own story.  The recently published Santer proposals bring further bad news for young Irish farmers and there is little doubt that these proposals will make it even more difficult to attract young people into agriculture.</P>
    <P>While these proposals allocate an additional 1 per cent milk quota to Ireland, it is obviously wholly inadequate as we are surely entitled to an additional 7 per cent or 8 per cent quota.  It was recommended that member states make young farmers the priority category for the distribution of available quotas within the regime.  The broad thrust of these proposals is extremely negative. They will lead to further reductions in the number of farmers.  They will also increase the permissible level of installation aid to 25,000 ecu. This is a clear recognition of the difficulties encountered in attracting young people into farming.</P>
    <P>Recent figures from the Central Statistics Office confirm that, on average, our farmers are the oldest in Europe with only 12 per cent under the age of 35.  The average Irish farmer is 15 years older than his Australian or New Zealand counterpart.  In the last year or so the numbers directly employed as farmers have fallen by 4,000.</P>
    <P>Those who live in rural Ireland are aware of these statistics and of the drift from the land which is proceeding at an alarming rate.  If a factory was to shut down with job losses of a similar scale, there would be uproar and the Government would immediately and correctly establish a task force to alleviate the plight of the people affected. The last thing it would do is suspend a scheme of vital importance to the economy.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of the installation aid <Col N="1032" /> scheme would play a significant role in maintaining farm families and young people on the land.  The grant was £5,600 and to qualify applicants had to have the appropriate educational qualifications and be under the age of 35.  It is my information that the overall cost of reintroducing the old scheme would be approximately £6 million per annum.  I understand the proposed new scheme is more tightly focused and targeted.  The cost will probably be lower, perhaps £4 million.  It costs, on average, almost £5,000 to transfer a farm.  This includes legal fees, capital acquisitions tax and the cost of purchasing or leasing land under the enlargement clause of the early retirement scheme.  If the Commission's proposals are implemented, I hope this clause will disappear.</P>
    <P>The cost of reintroducing the installation aid scheme would be a small price to pay to keep a young person on a farm and thus prevent rural depopulation, maintain jobs and increase farm standards.  It is worth noting that, on average, the IDA spends £11,700 in creating a new job in industry.  I fail to see why we should not pay less than half that amount to keep a young person in farming.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister concluded negotiations with the farming organisations about six months ago and reached agreement, in principle, on the type of new scheme that should be introduced but nothing has happened since 3 December 1997.  All we have had are smokescreens. I ask the Minister, on behalf of young farmers, particularly in my county of Westmeath and the midlands, to indicate when the new agreed scheme will be introduced.  Will he, please, indicate a start-up date?  The parameters have been agreed with the farming organisations.  The time for fudging has past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It is not possible to say definitively at this time what the position in relation to agricultural colleges will be in 1998.  While the indications are that there may be a fall-off in numbers, the closing date for applications is not until 5 June.  Usually, a high proportion of applications arrive in colleges in the last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Student numbers in agricultural colleges went down by 9 per cent in 1997-98 compared with the previous year, having been relatively stable for several years.  While the suspension of the scheme of installation aid may be a contributory factor, it is not the only one.  Other factors include the need for young people, particularly from smaller farms and where parents are relatively young and active, to earn income from an off-farm job.  The ready availability of off-farm jobs is giving schoolleavers choices which they previously did not have.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food wishes to emphasise, however, the importance of agricultural education for any young person who intends to take up farming.  With the technological and economic changes taking place and set to continue, it is of the utmost importance for young people to equip themselves for farming. <Col N="1033" /> It is recognised that the financial assistance provided under the installation aid scheme has given a significant incentive to young farmers to embark upon a career in farming.  Since the inception of the scheme in 1986, some 6,725 applicants have been paid aid of about £38 million to date.</P>
    <P>Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry a total of £17 million was set aside for the scheme on the basis that about 3,000 young farmers would participate in the 1994-99 period.  Some 3,000 applications had been received by mid-1997 and, due to the high level of demand, it was necessary to suspend the scheme in August 1997 in respect of new applications.  By 27 May 1998, a total of 3,961 young farmers have been paid some £22 million under the 1994-9 measures.  In addition, about 600 other applications are being processed with a potential grant commitment of a further £3.2 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of the measure to young farmers starting out on their agricultural careers the Minister for Agriculture and Food has obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance to introduce a more tightly focused revised scheme which will be targeted at those smaller farmers most in need of assistance.  The scheme will be financed solely by the Exchequer and in the current financial year the funding will have to be found from the resources of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Following discussions with the various farming organisations, the terms of the revised scheme are being finalised within the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The approval of the Minister for Finance and the EU Commission will be required before the scheme can come into operation.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food will be endeavouring to secure the necessary approval at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has expressed alarm at conditions in Naas Hospital which continue to deteriorate.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Naas Hospital development programme was approved more than one year ago.  In the intervening period conditions in the hospital have worsened considerably.  The problem of overcrowding is now much more serious. The lack of facilities is accentuated by the demands imposed by an increasing population in its catchment area.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be political but I remind the Minister of State's senior colleague that this time last year he paid a much publicised visit to Naas Hospital when he expressed deep concern at conditions in the hospital.  He tore out his hair, beat his breast and said there would be no delay in the provision of the extra facilities required.  This should be done without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> I could engage in a similar stunt but I have no wish to do so as this is not an issue on which one should engage in political acrobatics.  As a matter of extreme urgency officials of the Department and the health board should travel to Naas and acknowledge the situation is serious.  Patients are being cared for in wards which were not built for that purpose, many have to wait for long periods in corridors and waiting areas before being treated.  The staff are under extreme pressure. This is not in the best interests of patient care or the reputation of the hospital.  The gesticulations should stop.  Action should be taken immediately.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the past six to eight months.  I hope I will not have to raise it again.  The time for exploring the issue here has long since past.  It is time for the Minister to make his annual visit to Naas Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am glad he raised it and I am happy to report progress on our plans for a major development of Naas Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is probably well known by now that a comprehensive development brief for Naas Hospital was formally approved by my Department last June.  Following that approval the Eastern Health Board proceeded as rapidly as possible with the preparation of a revised development control plan for the whole hospital development and, in particular, the preparation of a detailed development option for phase two of the project within the approved cost limits.</P>
      <P>The board appointed a design team for the project and it has been working flat out, in consultation with the board's project team, to ensure that planning of phase two continues with all possible speed.  When it is completed, phase two will upgrade many areas of the hospital to a modern standard.  These will include the various hot spots which have been the subject of ongoing criticism.  For example, there will be a new accident and emergency department, designed to modern standards and built to take account of the growing volume of patients arriving at the hospital.  Similarly, the out-patients department will be overhauled and appropriate facilities will be provided which will be patient friendly and of a high quality.  Various other patient areas, including medical, surgical and geriatric wards, will be provided in spacious and attractive accommodation, replacing the cluttered and overcrowded conditions which obtain due to lack of space in the existing building.  The hospital's day care services, operating department, intensive care unit and coronary care unit are now at an advanced stage of design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board continues to progress this major building project as quickly as it can.  I understand the planning application was lodged with the local planning authority at the beginning of this month.  The Deputy called for <Col N="1035" /> immediate action on the matter and such action is being taken on a daily basis and will continue to be taken until the project has been completed. However, hospitals are not built overnight.</P>
    <P>The health board and the hospital management have worked in close consultation with hospital staff.  I compliment all involved not only on their patience and forbearance in what we all know to be a difficult situation but also on the enthusiastic and constructive manner in which they have contributed to the planning and design of the new facility.  I am happy to report genuine progress at Naas.  Approval has been given to proceed to stage three of the planning process.  That allows the design team to bring the project to sketch design stage and that process is proceeding rapidly.</P>
    <P>The staff, management and patients at Naas Hospital have had to endure difficult conditions. However, I echo the recent statement by the manager of the hospital that Naas Hospital is a very good news story in that we are embarking on a major £30 million development which will totally revolutionise the present service.  I look forward to reporting further progress as this major project develops during the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat an deis seo a thabhairt dom an ceist thábhachtach as seo a tharraingt anuas.  There is something seriously wrong with the manner in which schools are informed at the end of the school year that they are about to lose teachers.  The system is particularly damaging in socially disadvantaged areas. It appears the number of teachers allocated to each school is based on the pupil intake at the start of the previous school year.  If numbers fall in any one year, the school concerned can lose a teacher and that leads to extraordinary anomalies.</P>
      <P>The Central Model infants school in Marlborough Street, Dublin 1 had an intake of 72 pupils last September.  During the course of the school year that number increased to 74 and the projected intake in September 1998 will bring the number up to 77 or more.  That school received a letter from the Minister's Department this week instructing it that one of its two teacher posts allocated at the commencement of the Breaking the Cycle pilot scheme will be suppressed with effect from 31 August 1998.  That school did not have the required number of pupils last year, but it will have a sufficient number in September 1998 to retain that teacher.  However, despite that it will lose that teacher.  This system must be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter stated this decision was determined by the 72 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1997.  That school was selected for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  It is officially regarded by the Department of the <Col N="1036" /> Minister of State as one that provides for children who are among the most disadvantaged in the State.  I commend the previous Government for that desperately needed and most welcome initiative in providing education for the disadvantaged, but I deplore the current crude attempt to dismantle such a valuable and worthy scheme.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, if the Minister does not act, that school will lose a committed teacher and a valued member of staff this year and when the number will have increased next year it will have to advertise and appoint a new teacher.  That unnecessary disruption would be unhelpful in any school but that school, which is in a socially deprived inner city community where many of the children come from desperately deprived environments, has no chance of properly providing for their needs.  That school is in the Department's back yard.  If the Minister of State were to look out the window of his office he would see it.  He might call to the school to check the position and then he could address this matter.</P>
    <P>A second school, the local senior mixed model school, is facing a similar plight.  In September 1997 it had an intake of 97 pupils and the projected intake for September 1998 is 104 pupils, yet it is caught in the same trap.  If that school loses a teacher this August, it will be impossible to meet its obligations under the Breaking the Cycle scheme, which requires a pupil-teacher ratio of 1:15 in second class.  When the school authorities brought that to the attention of the Department in the past week or so, it was told to allocate two teachers to fulfil its Breaking the Cycle obligation in second class.  That would result in three teachers teaching 81 pupils, a pupil-teacher ratio of 1:27.  What chance would those children who come from the Sean MacDermott Street area of Dublin 1 have in such circumstances? None.  Is it any wonder there is a heroin epidemic in this community?  The Minister of State may not be aware that the gateway to heroin is social disadvantage and that is fuelled by inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>A third school, serving the Sheriff Street community, St. Laurence O'Toole senior girls' school, has also been told in the past week that it must lose a teacher this year, even though its projected intake for September 1998 shows a significant increase in the number of pupils.  That school was the only one in the Sheriff Street area to miss out on the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  Its sister schools catering for children from the same community were included.  The senior girls' school was hoping to benefit from an extension of the scheme in the coming year, but instead it will suffer even further disadvantage by losing a badly needed teacher.  That is appalling.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that no school in the circumstances to which I referred loses a teacher.  Those schools make great efforts to build up a dedicated teacher-pupil relationship, yet the Department, which should be encouraging such a relationship, does not appear to care.  Its <Col N="1037" /> action will have a devastating effect on the good work being done.</P>

      <P>Táim lánsásta eolas agus freagra a chur faoi bhráid na Dála faoin' scoileanna san i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that the withdrawal of teaching posts in primary schools arises in virtually every case because of enrolment decline.  The unfortunate reality of the matter is that the two schools to which the Deputy refers have both experienced enrolment decline and it is because of this factor alone that decisions have been taken to withdraw posts at the schools.  The staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s, and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.  It is a standard situation that does not deviate or change.  It is fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>St. Laurence O'Toole girls' national school had an enrolment in September 1996 of 96 pupils. However, by September 1997 the enrolment at the school had dropped to 83 pupils.  The minimum enrolment required by the school to retain the third teaching post is 87, some four points above that which the school actually had.</P>
      <P>The authorised staffing at the school for the 1998-9 school year is a principal and two teaching posts, a full time remedial teaching post and a concessionary post because of the school's designation as a disadvantaged school.  In addition, the school has the services of a teacher counsellor and a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>While I am mindful that the school serves a community which has many problems, the facts are that there has been substantial enrolment decline at the school and the overall staffing level at the school is, in relative terms, quite good.  For these reasons, I cannot authorise the retention of the third teaching post at the school.</P>

      <P>Turning to the Central Model senior mixed school, as the Deputy is aware this school is one of 33 urban schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  The Breaking the Cycle project was introduced in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main elements of the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle was the implementation of a 15:1 pupil-teacher ratio in the junior classes of all schools included in the project.  Since the introduction of the project, all the selected schools have been allocated sufficient staffing resources to ensure that a maximum class size of 15 pupils applies in all junior classes.  The allocation <Col N="1038" /> of teaching resources to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle project is also determined by reference to the school's enrolment at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Central Model senior mixed school on 30 September 1997 was 108 pupils, down from 114 the previous year.  An enrolment of 108 warrants a staffing complement of principal and three teachers.  However, in addition to this staffing, the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a shared remedial teacher, a full-time disadvantaged concessionary teacher, a shared home-school-liaison teacher, a shared teaching counsellor and a special additional assistant.</P>
    <P>The school's September 1997 enrolment of 108 pupils is capable of being managed adequately within the maximum class size guidelines, including the 15:1 maximum class size guideline which applies to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  In the circumstances, the staffing levels being made available to the school would appear to be adequate.  However, I will arrange for a member of the Department's inspectorate to visit the school as soon as possible to assess the school's overall needs.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Deputy Gregory with great interest.  He made great play of the fact that the previous Government gave Breaking the Cycle status to one school and not the other.  Is the Government to be lambasted for what the previous Government introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I assure him that in view of his raising the matter, I will ask the Department to take a special interest in these schools and to have a Department inspector make an assessment to make as positive and fair a decision as possible bearing in mind the problems raised by the Deputy.  I am from rural Ireland and my child's small rural national school lost a teacher because the numbers were down.  Some of the pupils of that school must travel ten miles for classes so I understand the Deputy's situation. I will do my best to improve that situation as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union believes that it is in the interests of both the Union and Turkey that their bilateral relations be developed further.  The Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness to assist Turkey in the further reform of its political and economic systems.  Ireland shares fully in this position.</P>
      <P>In the context of the wider perspective of Turkey's aspirations for membership of the Union, Turkey's eligibility for accession on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states was confirmed by the European Council meeting at Luxembourg on 12-13 December.  While the political and economic conditions allowing accession negotiations to be envisaged are not satisfied, the European Council nonetheless considered it important to draw up a strategy to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the European Union in every field.  The strategy included, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of the possibilities afforded by the EC-Turkey Association Agreement, an intensification of the Customs Union, implementation of financial co-operation and participation in certain programmes and agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Council at Luxembourg invited Turkey to participate in the European Conference, which had its inaugural meeting on 12 March in London.  The conference was designed to bring together the member states of the European Union and the states aspiring to accede to it with the objective of stepping up their dialogue and co-operation in areas of common interest.</P>
      <P>The European Council also indicated that strengthening Turkey's links with the EU depends on that country's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU, respect for and protection of minorities; the establishment of satisfactory and stable relations between Greece and Turkey; the settlement of disputes by legal process, including the International Court of Justice; and support for negotiations under the aegis of the UN on a political settlement in Cyprus on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 March the European Commission brought forward a communication to the Council of Ministers elaborating on the possibilities afforded by the strategy outlined at Luxembourg, and Council is currently considering these proposals. Turkey, for its part, declined to attend the <Col N="1040" /> inaugural meeting of the European Conference, and has not so far responded positively to the proposals outlined in the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council.  The UK Presidency has been active in seeking to maintain an ongoing dialogue with Turkey, and we have fully supported the Presidency in its efforts in this regard.  Turkey is an important partner for the Union and it is in the fundamental interest of both parties &mdash; the Union and Turkey &mdash; to develop relations further.  We also wish to encourage Turkey to reflect further on the elements for enhanced co-operation outlined at Luxembourg which we believe have considerable potential to deepen the relationship between the parties.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that I visited China from 23 to 28 February of this year and that I had useful and productive meetings with the then Prime Minister and the then Foreign Minister, among others.  I have no plans at present for a return visit to China in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the course of his meeting with Chinese premier Zhu Rongji at the ASEM summit in London last month an invitation was extended to the Taoiseach to visit China before the end of this year.  The Taoiseach accepted this invitation and discussions are currently taking place at official level to determine if it might be possible to undertake the proposed visit this coming September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is current Government policy that the question of human rights in China, including Tibet, should be raised with the Chinese authorities on every appropriate occasion.  This policy was followed by me during my meeting in Beijing last February with the then Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen.  On that occasion, I also urged the Chinese Government to engage in direct negotiations with the Dalai Lama.  It would not be appropriate, however, for the Taoiseach to delay or postpone his visit to China until such time as the desired talks between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities had commenced.  Indeed, I <Col N="1041" /> believe that the cause of the Dalai Lama and of the Tibetan people would be best served if the Taoiseach were to proceed with his visit to Beijing, using the opportunity to make known our concerns on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is of course always welcome to visit this country as he has done in the past.  The Government continues to hold both the person and the office of the Dalai Lama in the highest regard.  The question of whether the Taoiseach or other members of the Government would be able to meet him were he to come here again could only be decided at the time of such a visit.</P>

      <P>In my written reply on Tuesday last to Deputy Quinn's parliamentary question on the progress of the various agencies under my remit towards Year 2000 compliance I outlined the position relative to the Department of Foreign Affairs which includes embassies abroad.  The Department has drawn up a plan to ensure that it is Year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999.  This plan covers all IT hardware and software along with other office equipment and plant.</P>
      <P>The plan includes the following: an inventory of all hardware and software in the Department, close contact with suppliers, on-site testing and replacement/upgrading of any non-compliant hardware or software.  Work on implementation of the plan is currently under way.  The plan was submitted to the interdepartmental Year 2000 monitoring committee in December 1997 and a quarterly report was made in April 1998.  Within the Department two committees have been set up to monitor and oversee progress, one relating to the Department itself and the other to the agencies under the aegis of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Department in common with other agencies in the public and private sectors is acutely conscious of the need to ensure that services are not disrupted by the potential failure of equipment due to the Year 2000 problem.  It has already examined the risk levels posed to the various services it provides for the public and to the internal operations essential to its workings.  The Department is accordingly prioritising these elements with a view to achieving full compliance of all systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 28 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Indonesia where both political and economic conditions remain dangerously unstable.  We are of the view that President Suharto's welcome decision to resign last week provides an opportunity for the process of political reform to be taken forward.  We have urged the new government of President Habibie to put in place democratic structures and institutions which will create an administration that is accountable to the people of Indonesia.  We are hopeful that the necessary changes in the political structure of the country can take place as rapidly and peacefully as possible.  The General Affairs Council, at its meeting of 25 May, called in addition for the release of political prisoners and for full respect of individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>As it is our practice to accord recognition to states rather than governments, the question of withholding recognition of the new administration does not arise.  In any event, it is important that channels of communication with the new regime should be maintained so that it can be persuaded to undertake the political and economic reforms which are essential.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that any moves towards increased democracy in Jakarta will assist considerably in the search for a settlement of the problems in East Timor.  We would greatly welcome and strongly encourage moves towards a settlement which would be acceptable to the people of East Timor and would improve the human rights situation there.  In a statement issued yesterday, I called for the release of the East Timor leader, Xanana Gusmao, as well as all other political prisoners in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council last Monday, I supported &mdash; together with my Portuguese colleague &mdash; the inclusion in the Council Conclusions of a call on the Indonesian authorities to co-operate constructively with the efforts, conducted under the auspices of the UN SecretaryGeneral, to obtain a just, global and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor.  This was agreed.  Furthermore, a visit to East Timor by a troika of EU Ambassadors is planned for early next month.  As regards contacts in Jakarta, the Minister of State at the British Foreign Office, Mr. Derek Fatchett, is currently in Jakarta for talks with the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> Ireland has no resident diplomatic mission based in Jakarta.  Following the recent outbreak of unrest in Indonesia, however, I instructed the Irish Ambassador to Indonesia &mdash; who is accredited from Australia &mdash; to visit Jakarta to see to the welfare of Irish citizens and to report first hand on the situation in the country.</P>
    <P>Ambassador O'Brien, together with the Irish honorary consul in Jakarta, held meetings with Irish citizens in Indonesia and advised them to leave the country as soon as possible.  The majority of the 180 or so Irish citizens followed this advice and have departed.  Those who decided to stay were advised of the risks; consular care for these citizens is being provided through our honorary consul in Jakarta.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his efforts on behalf of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, together with the North/South Ministerial Council and implementation bodies, will be established immediately on the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement. The devolution of legislative and executive powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly will take place at the same time.  The Agreement does, however, envisage that the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council shall meet in shadow form during the transitional period which will begin after the Assembly elections.</P>
      <P>The timing of the Agreement's entry into force is dependent on the enactment, in both jurisdictions, of all the necessary legislation.  Given that the shadow North/South Council's work programme to agree and identify at least six areas for implementation bodies does not have to be completed until 31 October next, the legislative process may not be complete until early next year, although we shall do our utmost to accelerate matters.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which was established by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which is serviced by the Anglo-Irish secretariat based at Maryfield will cease to exist on the entry into force of the new British-Irish Agreement.  It is expected that the secretariat will close by the end of this year in preparation for the establishment of the new institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is concerned at the potential for a difficult marching season this year.  It is important that the historic achievement of the Good Friday Agreement which has been so resoundingly endorsed by the people, North and South, is not threatened or undermined by a difficult marching season.  It is equally important that the people of Northern Ireland are spared the trauma that has accompanied the marching season in recent years with attendant damage to cross-community relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some discussion with the British Government on this year's marching season and our contacts at political and official level will be intensified in the period ahead.  The Taoiseach and I also met earlier this week with representatives of the residents groups from the Garvaghy Road in Portadown and the Lower Ormeau Road <Col N="1046" /> in Belfast to discuss the latest situation in their areas.  In all our contacts, we are emphasising the importance of local dialogue and of all concerned contributing to it.</P>
    <P>The Parades Commission, which is now operating with statutory backing and powers, has an important role to play.  To that end, the commission must approach its task in an even-handed way and be seen to be fair and impartial in its decisions, particularly in the critical period immediately ahead.  The chairman of the commission and some of his colleagues were in Dublin yesterday and saw the Taoiseach.  They also had valuable meetings with officials.</P>
    <P>I continue to believe that local agreement, based on mutual respect and accommodation of the respective rights and traditions of both communities, is the best way of resolving the problems surrounding contentious parades.  I hope that dialogue can be facilitated in an effort to resolve the impasse which exists in a number of areas.  I welcome recent developments in Dunloy and at Harryville and hope that we will see similar positive developments elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the parades issue will receive the closest attention in the weeks ahead and that the Government will do all it can to encourage an accommodation on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement defines the means by which a united Ireland can be achieved.  For the first time, a clear mechanism to enable this is to be established in our Constitution and in British constitutional legislation.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the British-Irish Agreement recognises that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.  It is accepted that this right must be achieved and exercised with, and subject to the agreement and consent of, a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  It is acknowledged that the present wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland is to maintain the Union.  The two Governments affirm however that if, in the future, the people on the island exercise their right to self-determination on the basis described in the Agreement to bring about a united Ireland, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Article 3.1 of our Constitution recognises &ldquo;that a united Ireland shall be brought <Col N="1047" /> about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions on the island.&rdquo; The new British constitutional legislation will provide that if the wish expressed by a majority voting in a poll in Northern Ireland &ldquo;is that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament such proposals to give effect to that wish as may be agreed&rdquo; between the two Governments.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of Cyprus in the first round of EU accession negotiations was confirmed by the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg on 13-14 December.  The accession process involving the 15 member states, the ten CEECs, and Cyprus was launched on Monday, 30 March, in Brussels.  Intergovernmental conferences to begin negotiations with Cyprus and with Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia, on the conditions for their entry into the Union and the ensuing treaty adjustments were inaugurated on the following day.  At the same time as the Union is conducting accession negotiations with the five most advanced CEECs and Cyprus, the preparation of negotiations with Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Bulgaria is being speeded up in particular through an analytical examination of the Union acquis, that is to say, the policies, laws, practices and obligations that have been agreed or that have developed to date within the European Union.  The Commission will submit reports on the individual progress of all candidate countries to the Council later this year.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with the Foreign Minister of Cyprus, Mr Kasoulides, yesterday at which we discussed the progress being made in the enlargement negotiations.  As a small country, I believe Ireland's experience of membership of the Union may be of particular interest to Cyprus in the current phase of its relationship with the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Following extensive discussions on a joint British and French proposal for a European Union Code of Conduct based on eight agreed common criteria, political agreement was reached on the text of the code at the General Affairs Council on Monday.</P>
      <P>Ireland has long advocated the adoption of measures to ensure the effective implementation of the EU common criteria in line with our objective of the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and technologies for military use.  During the Irish Presidency in 1996 some initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for internal use by arms export licensing authorities was agreed.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations for the EU Code of Conduct, our primary objective was to ensure the code' s credibility as a promoter of restraint and responsibility.  To be credible, the code needed to contain clear unequivocal language on human rights.  Throughout the process, Ireland advocated the strongest possible language on human rights consistent with the importance we place on human rights in our foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed therefore at the outcome in respect of the human rights criterion.  I had wanted to see a provision envisaging complete <Col N="1050" /> abstention from arms exports to countries where there have been serious violations of human rights but certain partners were not even able to accept the possibility of restraint in respect of such arms exports.</P>
    <P>While Ireland could have blocked adoption of the code on the grounds of this inadequacy, I took the view that even a limited step by the EU in this area is preferable to no step at all.  We will use the opportunities presented by the annual review mechanism in the code to continue our efforts to ensure that responsible export control policies are put in place by all our partners in the EU and to press for the clearest possible language on human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned at the current impasse in the Middle East peace process. The decision by the Israeli Government, reported earlier this week, to reject the current US proposals for a second redeployment as provided for under the Oslo Agreement is particularly disappointing.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may be aware, the Middle East peace process is based on the Oslo Agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in September 1993.  This very comprehensive agreement, which was supplemented by several secondary agreements, envisaged a series of Israeli redeployments from the Occupied Territories &mdash; the West Bank and the Golan Heights &mdash; overrun by Israeli forces during the 1967 war.  It was intended that, once these redeployments were completed, final status talks would begin to address the remaining outstanding issues, such as the status of Jerusalem and refugees. The entire process was to be concluded by May 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to early 1997, the process envisaged in these agreements was more or less on track. However, due to a combination of events, including unilateral Israeli attempts to expand settlements <Col N="1051" /> in the Occupied Territories and terrorist suicide bombings, the process stalled.</P>
    <P>Since last summer, the US Administration has been making very strenuous efforts to restart this process &mdash; efforts which Ireland and other European Union member states have fully supported. The basis of this approach has been to link progress in redeployment with progress in tackling terrorism.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the US has mounted a major diplomatic effort to persuade Israel to accept its proposals.  This has been complemented by the very active support of the EU Presidency, including separate visits to the region by Prime Minister Blair and the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook.</P>
    <P>Following these visits the main parties were invited to London by the British Prime Minister. Mrs. Albright, the US Secretary of State, held lengthy negotiations with the Israeli Prime Minister, which were subsequently resumed in Washington. It now appears, as I indicated earlier, that the Israeli cabinet has formally rejected the US proposal.</P>
    <P>While we appreciate Israel's concerns regarding its security, both internal and external, we find difficult to understand their refusal to implement their commitments under the Oslo agreements, thereby jeopardising the entire peace process.</P>
    <P>In view of the widespread international concerns, new initiatives are already being mooted, notably a recent Franco-Egyptian proposal for a high-level international conference and a call by President Arafat for a summit meeting of Arab leaders.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council has been kept fully briefed by the UK Presidency on all developments, most recently at its meeting on 25 May. The EU's Special Envoy to the Middle East, Ambassador Moratinos, has also been very active in his efforts in supporting the Middle East Peace Process and has kept the Council fully informed.</P>

      <P>I am aware from reports in the media of a proposal put forward on 19 May by an organisation chaired by Mr Jacques Delors.  The proposal envisions that each of the European political groups should choose a candidate for the position of president of the European Commission prior to the next European Parliament elections scheduled to be held in June 1999.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the proposal made by Mr Delors' organisation is addressed in the first instance to European political groups which will, no doubt, give it careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's overall approach on EU institutional matters is guided by the need to respect fully the relevant treaty provisions, to ensure the maintenance <Col N="1053" /> of the essential balance between the Union's institutions and to safeguard the rights of smaller member states.</P>
    <P>Article 158 of the EC Treaty provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Governments of the member states shall nominate by common accord, after consulting the European Parliament, the person they intend to appoint as president of the Commission. The Treaty of Amsterdam will amend these provisions by requiring that &ldquo;the nomination shall be approved by the European Parliament&rdquo;.

      <P>I understand that advance media publicity precipitated an announcement by the British side that Mr. Chris Patten would be chairman of the commission.  The Government had not been consulted at that time about the chairmanship.  The appointment of Mr. Patten has been welcomed by a range of opinion in Northern Ireland.  I would add that the Government, which welcomes this appointment, has suggested a number of suitable candidates for appointment to the commission, and we remain in contact with the British side in this regard.

      <P>In 1996 a total of 77 countries received aid under the bilateral aid programme, which includes the emergency humanitarian assistance fund, operated by the development co-operation division. <Col N="1054" /> Details are provided in the Irish Aid Annual Report on Ireland's Official Development Assistance for 1996.  A similar number of countries received aid in 1997.  details of which will be provided in the 1997 Irish Aid Annual Report, which we hope will be published next month.</P>
      <P>The Irish aid programme has six priority country programmes within its bilateral aid programme &mdash; Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  In addition, there are programmes of assistance in other countries including South Africa, the Occupied Territories. Zimbabwe, Sudan, Eritrea and Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>Through schemes such as the NGO co-financing scheme, the human rights and democratisation programme and the fellowship programme, we are able to extend our reach to countries in South America and Asia as well as to other parts of Africa, in particular.  West Africa.</P>
      <P>The emergency humanitarian assistance fund provides aid to alleviate the immediate effects of natural disasters, famine, drought or conflict related emergencies.  The funds are channelled through the Irish non-governmental organisations as well as through the international agencies. Countries which received assistance in 1997 included Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia.  Afghanistan and North Korea. In addition rehabilitation assistance is provided to countries in post-conflict situations.  The majority of this budget in 1997 was allocated to rehabilitation and construction efforts in Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovinia.  Funding was also provided to Angola and Somalia.</P>
      <P>It is an issue of great importance that spending on the bilateral programme and on emergency and rehabilitation assistance is properly utilised. The Irish Aid Programme is reviewed regularly by sectoral experts from within the development co-operation division.  by external consultants and by the development assistance committee of the OECD.  Agencies in receipt of monies from the bilateral aid programme including the emergency assistance fund and the NGO scheme are required to produce reports on how the monies are spent.  In addition the division's two internal auditors undertake regular reviews and visits to our overseas offices.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Irish Aid Programme is producing good results and that the money spent reaches its targets and is used in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive reviews of the roles and functions of honorary consuls are carried out periodically. The most recent such review was in 1993.  The two main functions of honorary consuls are to provide consular assistance and protection to Irish citizens abroad and to assist in the promotion of Irish economic interests; they also supplement the work of our embassies by helping to process visa applications and to organise official visits to the countries in which they are located.  There are 67 honorary consuls in 49 countries.</P>
      <P>Honorary consuls receive annual honoraria of £500 and are allowed to retain half of the consular fees they collect, but not more than £100 in respect of any single fee.</P>
      <P>When the establishment of consulates headed by honorary consuls is justified, having regard to the numbers of Irish citizens living in or visiting and/or the potential for developing economic relations with the country or area concerned, suitable persons are appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, subject to the approval of the authorities of the relevant countries.  Such persons are usually professional business people, Irish citizens or citizens of the particular countries, who are well established and have good contacts with people in the political, administrative and business fields.  Appointments are made for three years initially.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware a diplomatic conference on the establishment of an international criminal court will be held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998.  It is hoped at that conference to adopt a Statute to establish a permanent international criminal court which will have the jurisdiction to <Col N="1059" /> prosecute persons guilty of such heinous crimes as the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</P>
      <P>Ireland will be represented at the conference in Rome and I will attend during the first week to make a statement to underline the importance to Ireland that the conference be successful.</P>
      <P>Most armed conflicts today are internal and not international.  Therefore, I fully share the view that, in order to be an effective instrument of justice in relation to the types of crimes over which it is envisaged the court will have jurisdiction, including genocide, the future court should have the jurisdiction to try crimes committed in non-international as well as international armed conflicts. This is a position which Ireland has always advocated and will continue to do so in Rome.</P>
      <P>In his question the Deputy referred to the prosecution of persons for crimes committed in Cambodia. It is generally envisaged that the future court will only have jurisdiction over crimes committed after the Statute setting it up has entered into force.  However, this is a matter which will be finally decided in Rome.</P>
      <P>The question of bringing to justice those guilty of committing crimes in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge period is now under active consideration in the UN and various proposals have been put forward.  One such proposal is the establishment of a special tribunal empowered to prosecute persons found responsible for those crimes in Cambodia, similar to the two ad hoc tribunals created to prosecute those accused of committing crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Ireland supports moves to bring to justice the perpetrators of those appalling crimes.</P>

      <P>The Government is very much aware of the suffering endured by the victims of violence arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The British-Irish Agreement dedicates a section to these victims of violence.  It is based on recognition of the concerns and difficulties facing victims of violence and their families, as well as of the fact that for many their suffering remains a painful and living reality today.  The Agreement acknowledges that the provision of services which are supportive and sensitive to the needs of victims will be a critical element in the process of reconciliation and recognises the need for the allocation of sufficient resources to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach warmly welcomed the publication, on 13 May, of the report of the Northern Ireland Victims Commission, which he described as a &ldquo;comprehensive, sensitive and cogent analysis <Col N="1060" /> of what is both a profoundly important, and a profoundly emotional set of issues&rdquo;.  The Government is studying in detail the report and its wideranging and imaginative recommendations which emphasise, in particular, the need for practical assistance to be made available to the victims.  We will consult widely, including with the British Government and the new institutions to be established under the Agreement, on how we might offer appropriate support to whatever arrangements and schemes are put in place.  As the Taoiseach said in his statement, following this consultation we will be making a significant financial contribution.  In this regard, particular consideration will be given to the proposed Trust Fund focused on compensating the children of victims for social and-or educational disadvantage suffered by reason of the death or serious injury of a parent through violence.</P>
    <P>The Government has authorised my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of victims in this jurisdiction and to identify what further measures need to be taken.  The former Tánaiste, Mr John Wilson, has accepted the Minister's invitation to carry out this important task on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>I want to categorically state that there has not been a cut of any type in the allocation for research support through the National Research Support Fund Board.  On the contrary, funding provided to this board has increased substantially each year since its establishment in 1995.  The allocations for each of the years are as follows; £4.831 million in 1995; £7.548 million in 1996; £8.0 million in 1997 and a minimum of £8.799 million for 1998 is being provided.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, I announced an additional £0.5 million to enable the Higher Education Authority to fund new basic research projects in 1998 which have been evaluated, approved and recommended by the National Research Support Fund Board to the Higher Education Authority.</P>

    <P>As Minister with responsibility for science and technology at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science, I am extremely pleased with the increased allocations for science and technology which have <Col N="1061" /> been provided by our Government this year.

      <P>Five of these cases relate to non-implementation of directives within the time limits set out in those directives.  In respect of three of these five cases, the relevant implementing measures have now been completed and it is expected that the proceedings against Ireland in those cases will be withdrawn shortly.  In respect of the fourth case, implementing measures in the form of ministerial regulations have been drafted and it is expected that the relevant Minister will make the regulations in the near future.  In respect of the fifth case, the relevant Minister sent instructions to the parliamentary draftsman's office on 18 May to draft the appropriate implementing measures and this will be done at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>The other three cases relate to differences of opinion between the State and the European Commission as to the correct interpretation to be given to the provisions of particular directives. The Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General, with appropriate assistance from my Department and other relevant Government Departments, are working together to ensure that Ireland's interests are fully defended in these proceedings.</P>

      <P>As I replied in a priority question earlier today on this matter, the endorsement of the British-Irish Agreement by the people of Ireland marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of this island.  It offers a future based on the acceptance of diversity and on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The fact that the Agreement won the backing of 85 per cent of those voting on the island, including large majorities North and South, indicates a widespread willingness on the part of the Irish people to set aside the bitter legacies of the past and to seek to resolve their differences on political issues by democratic and exclusively peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The massive &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the South, and the extraordinary turnout and strong support for the Agreement from both sides of the community in the North, showed just how deeply people desire lasting peace and political agreement.  It is now incumbent on all those who opposed the Agreement to respect the democratic verdict of the people, and to work effectively the institutions which derive from it.</P>
    <P>Now that the referenda have taken place, the priority is to move ahead with the implementation of the Agreement.  This must be carried forward in a balanced and comprehensive manner. The Agreement is a package, and must be implemented in its totality.</P>
    <P>A significant stage in the implementation process will be the holding of elections to the new 108 seat Northern Ireland Assembly on 25 June. Following these elections, the Assembly, the North-South Council and the British-Irish Council will be established in transitional form, pending the formal entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.  This we expect will take place in early 1999.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period, the shadow Assembly will meet to organise itself, including to resolve its standing orders and working practices, to elect the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and to allocate up to ten ministerial posts.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Northern Ireland transitional Administration and the Government, operating in the shadow North-South Ministerial Council, will meet to undertake a work programme to identify and agree by 31 October at least six areas in which implementation bodies are to be established, and at least six areas where cooperation will take place separately through existing bodies.  It will then fall to the two Governments to complete all necessary legislative and other arrangements to enable the implementation bodies to be established on the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government has established an interdepartmental steering group of senior officials, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to co-ordinate and actively move forward the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement.</P>

These are issued by US embassies and consulates on the authorisation of the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service.  Immigrant visas can be obtained by applicants who are successful in the annual diversity immigrant visa lottery or through sponsorship by a US employer or by a relative who is a US citizen or who has been issued with a &ldquo;green card&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Seven hundred and seventy-six Irish people were recently notified by the US authorities that they had been successful at the lottery stage in their applications for immigrant visas available in 1999 under the &ldquo;Diversity Programme&rdquo; and were invited to submit further documentation in support of their applications.  Because more such notices are sent out than visas are available people should respond to them quickly.  The application period for the visas available under the &ldquo;Diversity Programme&rdquo; in the year 2000 will be 1 to 31 October 1998.  The US Embassy will in due course announce details of the application process.</P>
      <P>Temporary work in the US may also be undertaken by holders of one of a number of different categories of non-immigrant visa.

      <P>The Government has responded quickly to the current emergency in Sudan.  Fifteen years of conflict, a very poor harvest and lack of access to vulnerable communities have resulted in a serious humanitarian crisis in parts of the south of the country.  The worst affected communities are in Bahr-el-Ghazal and Equatoria.  Estimates vary as to the number of people in need of immediate assistance.  Figures given by aid agencies range between 400,000 and 700,000 .</P>
      <P>The Government has been actively engaged since 1994 in addressing the ongoing humanitarian emergency in southern Sudan.  This is reflected in a total of £2,246,000 in food and other assistance to the people of Sudan between 1994 and 1997.  This does not include the bilateral programme in northern Sudan.</P>
      <P>As soon as the extent of the present crisis started to become clear, the Government responded quickly to humanitarian needs and took action at the political level and humanitarian levels.  A total of £800,000 has been allocated in recent weeks to UN agencies and Irish NGOs to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people. The Government of Sudan allowed increased access to the affected communities following an international outcry and assistance is now beginning to reach the most needy.</P>
      <P>However, humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for a political solution and I have taken a number of actions to help maintain pressure by the international community on the warring parties to come to a political settlement.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of May, I wrote to express these concerns to the Deputy Foreign Minister of Italy, chairman of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), who brought together the Sudanese Government and the SPLA in Nairobi for peace talks earlier this month.  I also pressed for early political action on Sudan at the EU General Affairs Council on Monday of this week.</P>
      <P>A number of actions have also been taken at the humanitarian level.  Minister O'Donnell and I met representatives of Irish NGOs active in southern Sudan and UNICEF on 4 May to brief them on actions being taken by the Government and to hear their views on the situation.  On 7 May, the Irish Ambassador to Egypt, who is also accredited to Sudan, raised the Government's concerns about restricted humanitarian access directly with the Sudanese authorities.</P>
      <P>At the request of Minister of State O'Donnell, the humanitarian situation in Sudan was discussed at the EU Development Council on 18 May and a number of important conclusions were agreed regarding the approach to humanitarian assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further expression of our concern, Minister O'Donnell will visit Khartoum from 6-7 June to convey the views of the Irish Government to <Col N="1065" /> the Sudanese authorities, to press for continued access for humanitarian aid and to request them to work to bring about a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work with the international community to ease the humanitarian crisis and to support efforts to find a peaceful political settlement.</P>

During both these visits, I raised the issue of human rights violations at the highest levels and I outlined these approaches in some detail in statements to this House on 11 December and 1 April last, respectively.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, my office is in the process of arranging a number of incoming and outgoing visits for the second half of 1998.  Specific human rights issues may arise in the context of some of those visits but, at this stage of planning, no agendas have been agreed or finalised as yet. As I noted in my reply of l l December last to a very similar question from the Deputy, I am always ready to look at the question of visits to countries where specific human rights issues have been identified.  However, a prime criterion in coming to a decision in this regard would be the prospect of my being in a position to contribute to a solution of any existing problem.</P>
      <P>In addition to my bilateral visits, I will also be using the opportunity provided by forthcoming EU meetings and the UN General Assembly in September, as well as other appropriate international meetings, to raise specific human rights concerns.

      <P>I have accepted the recommendations of the quota review group which gave priority for the allocation of quota from this reserve to eligible applicants with low livestock units.  Livestock units are calculated with reference to applications under the suckler cow premium scheme, ewe premium scheme and special beef premium scheme and from any milk quota held by the applicant. All the available quota has been utilised by eligible applicants with less than 5.8 livestock units.</P>
      <P>As the person named already has 27 livestock units, suckler cow quota of 17 and special beef premium of ten livestock units, he is not eligible to receive an allocation of quota from this reserve.</P>
      <P>The quota section of my Department has no record of having received medical evidence from the person named but in any event this would not be relevant to his eligibility for an allocation of quota from this reserve.</P>

      <P>The person named will be paid his 1994 extensification premium grants within the next week.</P>
      <P>He could not be paid previously as the stocking density of his holding was calculated at 2.09 livestock units per hectare and under Article 4(h) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2066/92 a producer must have a stocking density of less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare in order to qualify for extensification premium.</P>

    <P>However, he recently submitted an official milk recording certificate which certified an average yield greater than the national average yield of 897 gallons used in the previous calculations. This higher certified yield, when used <Col N="1068" /> in the calculations, caused his stocking density to be reduced to 1.17 livestock units per hectare and thus qualifying for 1994 extensification premium grants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Seed of cereal species including maize may not be marketed in Ireland unless it conforms to certain criteria and conditions.  These conditions require that the seed be certified and labelled in accordance with the EU Council directive on the marketing of cereal seed and also that the seed is of a variety registered in the Irish National Catalogue or the EU Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species.  This applies irrespective of whether the seed is genetically modified or not.  Seed which does not comply with these conditions on certification and labelling, cannot be marketed for propagation purposes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware that two genetically modified varieties of maize have been entered in the Spanish national catalogue and three varieties have been entered in the French national catalogue. None of these genetically modified varieties have as yet been registered in the common <Col N="1070" /> catalogue, which provides for the free movement of certified seed in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken under Directive 90/220/EEC to grant consent for the placing of genetically modified products, including genetically modified seed varieties for cultivation, on the EU market include specific labelling requirements.</P>

      <P>I am aware of public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from telecommunications masts associated with mobile phone systems.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with whom my Department liaises on the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.  Research and studies in this area are carried out on an on-going basis and medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications companies operating here are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association in co-operation with the World Health Organisation in 1988.  These levels were reviewed in 1996 by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, an independent scientific body, which endorsed the levels set. Measurements taken here show that emissions level are well below the recommended safety limits.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation established by the Minister for Public Enterprise monitors licensed operators of telecommunications systems to ensure compliance with all the conditions of their licence including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.</P>

The staffing subgroup comprises senior nursing and consultant medical staff, whose recommendations regarding nursing and medical staff requirements were incorporated in the overall submission made last year to my Department.</P>
    <P>I allocated £1.5 million for staffing and related commissioning costs of phase 2A in 1998 and I am glad that this important development is now being brought into use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons who received the withdrawn Amerscan Pulmonate II product in Irish hospitals was 460.  This figure was established following a request by my Department to each of the hospitals involved to identify all patients who were administered the product and to make arrangements to inform each person and to provide appropriate counselling.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 16 December 1997, the advice I received from the CJD advisory group was that the risk of transmission of new variant CJD through this product was unquantifiable but likely to be very low.  This view was reflected in decisions taken by the authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere not to contact patients who had received the product.  The decision to inform patients in this country was taken, on balance, following very careful consideration of the ethical issues involved having regard to the extremely low risk of transmission of the disease, the lack of a diagnostic test for new variant CJD, the lack of any treatment and the unknown incubation period of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extremely low level of risk involved was confirmed by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, CPMP, of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, EMEA, in a position <Col N="1074" /> statement on new variant CJD and plasma-derived medicinal products, produced on 25 February last.  This statement followed a workshop of international experts on transmissible spongiform encephalopoties, TSEs, convened by the CPMP to consider the available information on new variant CJD and relevant TSEs.  It concluded that knowledge of other TSE agents suggests that the transmission of new variant CJD by medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma is very unlikely.</P>
    <P>I understand from the manufacturer that the relevant Amerscan Pulomonate II product batches were recalled from all European countries where they had been supplied.  I am not aware of any support groups that exist in these countries for recipients of the product.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines relate to the provision of new masts.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, the <Col N="1075" /> addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast, and the replacement of an existing mast, are, subject to strict limitations, exempted development.  These regulations give statutory support to the policy of co-location which was advocated in the guidelines to avoid unnecessary proliferation of masts.  There is no information in my Department to suggest that planning authorities are not applying the guidelines to new masts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95, 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The planting of genetically modified crops in this country is controlled under the genetically modified organisms regulations, 1994, SI No. 345 of 1994 and EU Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment.  The 1994 regulations transpose directive 90/220/EEC into national law, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the competent authority for the purposes of the regulations and the directive.  It is a matter for users in this country to ensure compliance with the requirements of the regulations or the directive, as appropriate, before proceeding with the deliberate release of a product containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms.  Compliance monitoring and enforcement of the regulations and the directive is a matter for the EPA.</P>
      <P>Genetically modified seed products can only be marketed in the EU subject to consent being granted under Directive 90/220/EEC and compliance with any conditions attached to the consent, including labelling requirements.  Following an amendment of the directive in 1997, transposed into national law under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, S.I. No. 332 of 1997, genetically modified products must be labelled or accompanied by documentation to indicate that they contain or consist of genetically modified organisms.  In the case of genetically modified products to be marketed in mixed consignments with non-genetically modified organisms, information on the possible presence of genetically modified organisms is sufficient to meet the amended labelling requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a national mediation service is identified as a key priority in the programme for Government.  Up to now the service has been concentrated in Dublin with a centre in Limerick only opening in the last two years.  The benefits of family mediation have been highlighted to me by the Commission on the Family whose final report I received recently.  That report endorses the greater use of mediation which allows couples whose marriage has broken down to resolve issues, including issues relating to children, in a non-adversarial and comparatively inexpensive manner.</P>
      <P>In consequence, the budget allocation for the family mediation service for 1998 was trebled from £300,000 to £900,000, having remained static at £300,000 from 1994 to 1997.  The extra provision of funds is intended to help finance the opening of new centres around the country.</P>
      <P>No final decisions have yet been made as to the exact locations for the new centres.  However, with regard to the north-west, the Deputy can be assured that due cognisance will be taken of current demand for the service, geographical and demographic considerations.</P>

      <P>Due to a technical difficulty posed by section 59(1)(c) of the Wildlife Act, 1976 it has not been possible for me to make regulations for Baldoyle Nature Reserve and other nature reserves throughout the country.  Following the receipt of advice from the Office of the Attorney General it was decided that the best way of resolving the problem would be to amend the Act itself.  A draft wildlife amendment Bill is at advanced stage of preparation.  When the Bill passes into law I will then be in a position to make regulations for Baldoyle and other nature reserves.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of signage it is the policy of Dúchas the heritage service of my Department that signage on its properties be bilingual.  Dúchas is currently engaged in a programme to provide information panels at each nature reserve in the country.  The existing information signs at Baldoyle nature reserve will be replaced as part of this programme.  These new panels, when erected, will be bilingual.</P>

      <P>The EU action plan adopted by the General Affairs Council on 26 January 1998 was designed to deal with the situation arising from an influx of illegal immigrants from Iraq <Col N="1081" /> and neighbouring countries experienced by several member states beginning in late 1997.</P>
      <P>The action plan is designed to address the various concerns arising in this situation comprehensively, including humanitarian concerns.  It contains the following main elements: development of an action-orientated dialogue with the Government of Turkey and with the UNHCR; ensuring that humanitarian aid makes an effective contribution, including by ensuring improved NGO access to northern Iraq; improved analysis of the underlying causes and origins of the influx; effective application of asylum procedures to ensure that the humanitarian aspects of this influx are not overlooked; preventing abuse of asylum procedures; enhanced police co-operation in tackling organised crime; implementation of a number of steps to combat illegal immigration in these areas:</P>
      <P>better exchange of information between member states about migration and asylum,</P>
      <P>improved visa issuing procedures and consular co-operation in the issue of visas,</P>
      <P>posting of liaison officers and exchange of officials,</P>
      <P>effective and consistent border controls,</P>
      <P>immediate expulsion of persons illegally present on the territories of the member states in so far as no right to remain exists.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 19 March, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reviewed progress in the implementation of the action plan on the basis of a report by the Presidency.  The Council concluded that further co-operation with Turkey could be useful in such areas as the examination of ways of ensuring the proper screening of asylum seekers, the improvement of conditions for detaining illegal immigrants prior to removal, the exchange of practical experience of effecting returns to third countries, assistance in developing new Turkish immigration laws, and technical assistance in improving the detection of false documents at the border.  The Council also concluded that the EU is prepared to assist Turkey financially in implementing these measures, subject to the normal conditions.</P>
      <P>A further report on progress in implementing relevant action points will be considered by the Council at its meeting today and tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The enclosure with the letter to which the Deputy refers calls on member states to implement the action plan with due consideration of the concerns and recommendations of the authors of the letter and, in so doing, to respect their international obligations regarding the protection of refugees.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports the action plan as a balanced response to a problem which has not, in practice, affected us but is of serious concern to many of our EU partners.  The plan does not affect the international obligations of member states regarding the protection of refugees.</P>

      <P>A number of private commercial third level institutions have requested recognition for the purposes of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Among the colleges which have applied and have not been successful or are awaiting a response in relation to the 1998 scheme are The Holy Ghost College, Kimmage Manor, the Irish School of Ecumenics, the Institute of Education, Portobello, St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, Shannon College of Hotel Management, Dublin Business School, LSB College, MidWest Business Institute, Griffith College, Dublin, Skerry's Business College and HSI, Limerick.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House previously, my current priority for funding is to increase the places on publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the determination of minimum standards for recognition, my Department is guided, <i>inter alia</i>, by the following criteria:</P>
      <P>(i) whether the institution has been subject to an institutional review by the NCEA, and the result of such a review;</P>
      <P>(ii) whether the courses have been approved by the NCEA for the purposes of its awards;</P>
      <P>(iii) whether the courses have been validated by other recognised third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for Educational Awards have set down minimum requirements for recognition in relation to the overall availability of resources in an institution and the entry requirements and academic standards for the approval of courses for NCEA awards.  These standards would be acceptable to the Department of Education and Science for the purpose of recognition <Col N="1085" /> for the higher education grants scheme if resources were available to extend the scheme to private colleges.  However, consideration would also have to be given to other factors such as financial bonding and consumer protection.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in County Cork will be eligible for a higher education grant or VEC scholarship grant from September 1998.</Quest>

      <P>The course referred to by the Deputy is a post-leaving certificate course and therefore the provisions of the higher education grants scheme or the VEC scholarship scheme will not extend to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the programme for Government, An <Col N="1087" /> Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  As the Deputy is aware, I have already advised the House of my intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants, as soon as possible for students <Col N="1088" /> who are registered on PLC courses, as of September 1998.</P>
    <P>Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates.  Further information on the administrative arrangements for the PLC scheme will be available in the near future.</P>
