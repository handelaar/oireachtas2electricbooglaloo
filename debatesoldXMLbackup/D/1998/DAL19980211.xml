    <Title>Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the extraordinary fact that there has been no substantive educational legislation of general application since the foundation of the State, and only the Vocational Education Act, 1930 at second level, Irish education is highly regulated.  Many of those involved, especially school principals and managers, have received circulars about which they have not been pleased, and have felt that their right to be consulted has been overlooked.  That is an interesting background to this Bill because many Ministers for Education would have wanted to introduce legislative provisions but the combined strength of forces with an interest in the matter meant they were not in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that Irish education is highly successful and this is reflected in the attraction of the Irish workforce, particularly highly educated young people, for high-tech employers. A great debt of gratitude is due to those who achieved this with limited resources and less recognition.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, another side to the story.  It must be borne in mind that each year approximately 1,000 pupils fail to make the transition from primary to post primary level.  Some 3,000 leave the post primary system without any qualification and about 15,000 leave with only a junior certificate or an undistinguished leaving certificate. More than 90 per cent of the approximately 4,000 who leave with no qualification whatsoever come from very poor backgrounds.  Upper middle class children are seven times more likely to avail of third level education than those from poor backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge for educators and the system is to maintain the generally high standards, while simultaneously ensuring that the educational disadvantage and poverty which were illustrated in the 1997 NESC report on early school leaving and youth unemployment are addressed.  That is a huge challenge for educators.  The challenge for Government, which is somewhat different, is to provide resources and distribute them wisely to ensure this is possible.  The challenge for the Oireachtas is to design a legislative framework which facilitates progress and regulates fairly, balancing the interests of the partners in education <Col N="5" />&mdash; parents, patrons, students, teachers and the State.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly stated that where conflict arises between the various interests the welfare of students should have priority.  The guiding principles should be access, participation and benefit.  Levels of access and participation are clearly reflected in the benefit of the education system to students and, ultimately, to society and the State.  In fairness, it is probably the case that resources rather than legislation are the key to progress in this area.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been debated for a long time, beginning with the Green Paper in 1992, the White Paper and the Second Stage debate of the Bill introduced by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, which took place from 3 to 13 March 1997, almost a year ago.  The Minister is not repeating his predecessor's most glaring errors which brought her into conflict with the various interests, and showed how powerful those interests are in many respects.  However, we must publicly acknowledge her work as a Minister and her commitment to improving the quality of education and the service provided to pupils.  The contribution of other Ministers and Ministers of State to the debate since the publication of the Green Paper, such as Deputies O'Rourke, Davern and Brennan, must also be acknowledged. The Bill has had a long gestation period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen to drop the regional education boards, as per his pre-election commitment. Any such boards or other intermediate structure ought to be judged on the basis of cost, reciprocity and democracy.  I said during the debate on the previous Bill that the boards appeared to have little or no powers and I found it difficult to judge whether they were a tiny step in the right direction towards greater democratisation or a cop out.  The directors of those proposed boards had excessive powers.</P>
    <P>There will now be no immediate tier but the Minister has indicated he will encourage local partnership and co-operation in education, which is very important.  I know he is aware of the Clare education forum in which all the interests at primary and second level came together &mdash; anyone who knows anything about education will know how diverse those interests are &mdash; and sought consensus over a long period.  It is fair to say they reached an unprecedented level of understanding and co-operation.  I would like to see an intermediate level at some stage in the future.  I do not favour retaining the monolith of the Department <i>ad infinitum</i> as I do not think that is healthy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the different perspectives which people bring to the debate.  I am sure my views are very strongly coloured by the 20 years I spent as a teacher.  I am probably required under the ethics in public office legislation to declare that interest because if I lost my seat or decided to leave the Oireachtas I would return to work as a school principal.  As I said, my perspective is coloured by my experience as a teacher; others approach the debate from the perspective <Col N="6" /> of a parent, which I am also.  There are subtle differences which colour people's approach to the debate and to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the past, teachers tended to be extremely annoyed by the issuance of edicts by circular, which used to be signed by the Secretary of the Department, particularly in regard to contentious matters.  I am glad this is now being put on a legislative basis.</P>
    <P>In section 2 the Bill defines &ldquo;special educational needs&rdquo; as referring to the needs of &ldquo;students who have a mental or physical disability&rdquo;. That definition falls far short of recognising dyslexia and other learning difficulties and does not appear to refer to groups with special needs, such as traveller children and ethnic minorities, which is now arising with the increasing number of refugees.  There are also substantial numbers of schoolgoing children from the alternative lifestyle community in areas such as my own.  Such children did not present any difficulties in my school in terms of discipline and so on.  Of course, they do present some difficulties for schools as English is not always their first language.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of rural schools in east and north Clare, parts of west Cork, Mayo and elsewhere have such students.  It would be appropriate to state in sections 9(a) and 15(g), where reference is made to special educational needs, that the relevant needs of these groups ought to be considered.  If that were done I would be far more at ease that students who need the assistance of resource teachers, remedial teachers or psychological counselling would be included in the special educational needs category.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4)(b) states that the Minister shall &ldquo;wherever practicable&rdquo; consult with the usual interests.  There is a good case for making that consultation process a formal requirement in law. I do not foresee any particular difference in the immediate future, but it might be safer to make it a requirement in the legislation and to delete the &ldquo;wherever practicable&rdquo; element.</P>
    <P>In section 8(1)(b) the Minister has handled the tricky area of the powers of trustees and patrons exceptionally well.  To the best of my recollection, the majority of community schools have not yet had their trustees sign and the Minister is clearly allowing space and time for that issue to be resolved.  That is wise of him but, in the interest of a better system and better accountability and procedure, that area must be dealt with in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 deal with the recognition of schools and the withdrawal of recognition.  It would be helpful if, for example, in section 10(2)(a) the Minister were required to specify the numbers required for recognition and the withdrawal of recognition.  I understand it is difficult to do that because special circumstances pertain in some geographic areas, such as islands, which would not readily accommodate themselves to a general rule.  However, the failure to specify numbers may create difficulties for future Ministers. <Col N="7" /> The Minister, and anybody who has looked at future planning for education will be aware that the demographic forces at work will create many difficulties for future Ministers and, indeed for this one.  There is a plus in that teachers are becoming available because of the drop in enrolment and may be redeployed where the Minister sees fit or where the greatest need arises.  The drop in numbers at primary level and, subsequently, at second level will have an impact on the type of enrolment which makes a school viable.  It will bring pressure to bear on school amalgamations and other rationalisations which, undoubtedly, will create difficulties.  We will witness objections and demonstrations in defence of schools.  I am glad sections 10 and 11 have been included but I would prefer if they were more precise in relation to numbers and the criteria to be used in making judgments in such cases because it is always easy to be precise in the absence of a specific case than when dealing with particular cases.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the inspectorate which has made an enormous contribution to the evolution of education.  Since its role changed from that of policeman of the system to facilitator of growth and development inspectors have, individually and collectively, made an enormous contribution. That is probably more evident at primary level where it is easier for them to contribute than at second level where inspectors tend to inspect with regard to specific subjects and probably find it a little more difficult to impact on the system generally.  I note they are to conduct assessments and advise students and parents.  I am not clear about the rationale for that but I thought those who would advise pupils and parents in the first instance would be teachers.  If outside personnel are to do so &mdash; nobody could argue but that inspectors are well qualified to do so &mdash; there could be practical difficulties. That is a matter about which I am a little concerned and an area in which I declare an interest.  The interest of the teacher might be somewhat put upon in such a circumstance, particularly if it was not handled as it should be.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the Minister proposes to set up the psychological service and include it in the inspectorate.  It is a much needed service.  Without giving the matter much consideration, I would have assumed the way to set it up would be to set it up on a statutory basis at national level but the Minister obviously has good reasons for including it in the inspectorate.  I will be interested to hear the rationale for that decision and I am sure it will be debated at length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an plean ag an Aire Coiste a bhunú in a Roinn chun pleanáil a dhéanamh i leith leabhar agus áiseanna do mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  Tá ceist le freagairt againn mar Stát áfach.  An bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoin nGaeilge a athbheochan?  An bhfuil stádas na Gaeilge ag dul chun cinn nó ag cúlú?  Is ceisteanna deacra iad sin.  Má fhéachaimid siar ó bunaíodh an Stát ceapaim <Col N="8" /> nach mbeimis sásta leis an freagra má tá freagra macánta le tabhairt ar an cheist sin.  Tá súil agam, áfach, go mbeidh dul chun cinn éigin againn leis an Bhille seo ach nílim chomh cinnte go mbeidh.</P>
    <P>Another element of the Bill which interests me and which I see, to some extent, as an omission is the area of discipline and a code of conduct in schools.  Section 22 deals with principals and teachers, section 23 with the principals and section 24 with staff matters generally.  While it is clearly implied that under the school plan there would be a code of conduct or discipline for pupils, it is not spelled out in the way teachers, in particular, would like.  On the counter side, there is a grievance procedure and other procedures for appealing decisions of teachers but from my reading of the Bill, there is little provision for sanctions. It is not fashionable to talk about sanctions nowadays but anybody who has stood in front of a class, as the Minister has done, will know there is a need for discipline.  It is not something we can sanitise out of the education system and I am not sure it is wise to attempt to sanitise it out of education legislation as well.  I am sure it is an issue which can be sensibly revisited on Committee Stage.  Perhaps I have misread the Bill because there seems to be plenty of opportunity to provide a code of conduct.  It is a reality in any education system and there should be a specific provision for a code of conduct or discipline <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>The school plan has been mentioned, which I welcome.  The introduction of the school plan over the years has been a great contributor to development in Irish education.  It has encouraged staff, even in the smallest schools, to consider their roles and to put on paper a system to develop an educational provision for children which best meets their requirements.  It also enables teachers to perhaps identify their strengths and weaknesses and to devise a school plan which provides for the best interests of the pupils in their care.  I am glad the school plan has been included in the Bill and that it still has considerable potential for development.</P>
    <P>The provisions for examinations are welcome. There is a comprehensive range of provisions to protect the integrity of the system which is important after the glitches in recent years and the publicity surrounding the loss of examination papers.  Of all the elements in the education system, nothing requires protection of its integrity in the way the examination system does.  It is seen as an objective assessment of a pupil's educational progress.  There are plenty of arguments in favour of changing the system and that is a matter which may be looked at in terms of the provisions proposed by the Minister.  He has left adequate room for various possibilities to be explored.  However, the examination system must be seen to stand independently and be beyond reproach.  The provision in the Bill will go some way in this.  We must accept that people believe the education system needs to go some way to show the system of examinations can stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> There is the parallel debate about whether the education system, as it stands, is the most appropriate way to deal with the assessment of people and their growth in educational terms.  There is room for another provision in the Bill which sets up the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on a statutory basis.  Much work needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>All the reports I have read which measure the lack of participation in education by people from poorer backgrounds and the lack of benefits to them from education point, among other things, to the overly academic school curricula being pursued at various levels.  I wish the Minister well with the Bill and urge him to bear in mind some of my suggestions.</P>

      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to speak on this Bill, and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the Dáil.  The Minister spoke about regional educational boards.  I always said at county and urban council level that I am not too keen on regional boards and would prefer things to be done on a county basis.  People should have control over their own areas and have a say about everything in their county, whether relating to health or education.  Regional boards are too removed from local areas.  People can have an input into county boards and I welcome the Minister's decision to leave vocational education committees as they are.  While some people have been critical of vocational education committees, they have worked well.  They meet on a regular basis and the general public are able to have their concerns raised at meetings by their public representatives.  I compliment vocational education committees on their excellent work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the allocation of £10 million for minor capital projects as it will eliminate the need for schools to contact the Department every time they need a boiler serviced or want to buy new desks and chairs.  I mean no disrespect to civil servants, but I hope they adopt a lenient attitude and will not require schools to produce a receipt for every nail and bolt.  At the same time there must be accountability.  This scheme is being run on a trial basis and consideration should be given to developing it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On boards of management, I welcome the increased partnership between parents, teachers and schools.  I was a member of a board of management for many years and was chairman for part of that time.  The board included the bishop's nominee and the principal's nominee.  In many cases the principal of the boys' school nominated the principal of the girls' school and <i>vice versa.</i> This meant that if they did not agree with a proposal it was defeated.  The only proposals they always supported were those relating to fundraising <Col N="10" /> for the school.  I am delighted that there will be equality on boards of management as it means everyone's rights will be protected and there will be compromise rather than a dictatorship.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical of the nuns and Christian brothers who educated and looked after pupils.  I wish there were more of them as they were dedicated to the education of young people. There has been much outcry about certain events but I compliment these people on their devotion to education.  As in all walks of life, there are good and bad in this sector of society.  Nuns and Christian brothers are committed to the education system and they should be thanked for their work.</P>
    <P>I have had many disputes with teachers who, like politicians, can be very sensitive and tend to get worked up over minor comments.  However, it can be very difficult to teach a class of 31 or 32 pupils.  It is not correct that people can make unsubstantiated complaints which may damage a teacher's reputation.  It is important, therefore, to protect teachers.  Most teachers do a very good job and they must be complimented on this.</P>
    <P>The Department operates a scheme under which primary and secondary teachers are given leave to go on a cultural exchange to a Third World country.  Two primary teachers in my town have applied for leave to visit Aror in Kenya.  The people of Westport have taken on the project in this disadvantaged area on a pilot basis.  They are very generous and every penny collected by them is used to build health centres and schools and to train teachers, nurses and doctors in Aror.  This project which has been running for ten years is a wonderful success and recently won a national award.  I compliment John O'Donnell, Liam Lyons and the other people involved in it.</P>
    <P>These two teachers applied for leave to visit Aror to see how the project can be progressed. They were granted leave without pay &mdash; I believe they should be paid by the Department &mdash; but they will lose their pension rights for these two weeks.  I contacted officials but they do not give a damn and have no understanding of the matter. The only way I can get the matter resolved is to raise it with the Minister.  The local priest and bishop in Westport have visited Aror on many occasions and if the Minister contacts them they will tell him how successful the project is.  These two teachers have young families but they are committed to the project.  I ask the Minister to ensure that they do not lose their pension rights. If the Minister's officials ring my office I will give them the names of these people.  The Minister is a teacher and a caring man and I have no doubt he will solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Teachers in one teacher schools must act as principal, secretary, nurse and maid.  I know a lone parent in north Mayo who had little confidence and spent much of her time at home.  She obtained a place on a FÁS scheme, following which she secured work in the local school where the teacher was very good to her and helped increase her confidence.  Consideration should be <Col N="11" /> given to allowing schools take on FÁS trainees to help them with secretarial and other work.</P>
    <P>I will not be too hard on the Minister in regard to one and two teacher schools as the Government has given commitments in this respect and I know he will solve the problem relating to the two teachers to whom I referred.  It was originally proposed to make all one teacher schools two teacher schools but reference is now being made to schools with 16 pupils or more.  I have no problem with this but the commitments should be honoured as quickly as possible.  If ever a sector of society needed investment this is it.  I will keep pressure on the Minister until he honours the commitments in this area.  It is wrong to expect a principal of a school, male or female, to be secretary, doctor and nurse as well as teacher. Because of the risks involved and the fact that people make claims against them, teachers must be protected.  I hope the Minister takes that point on board.</P>
    <P>There is great need for remedial teachers to deal with a sector that is disadvantaged.  I am reminded of Ernie Sweeney, whom the Minister has probably met &mdash; I am aware Deputy Coughlan met him.  He was illiterate and educated himself. He is the person who requested that photographs be placed on ballot papers.  Last week I attended a meeting of Macra na Feirme, an organisation which holds courses to educate people on farming.  Of the 12 or 15 people doing the course, three or four could not read or write. Resources must be put into remedial teaching. Funding should also be made available for the literacy campaign undertaken by vocational education committees.  That money would be well spent and would help a disadvantaged sector.</P>
    <P>Last night I raised on the Adjournment the special needs of people such as those with autism and other handicaps and disabilities.  Funding must be provided to help those people, for whom there is nobody to speak.  There are no organisations such as the IFA or the INTO to help them. While many families are affected by such handicaps, the number is not sufficient to make a strong case for those involved.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill and hope the education sector will gain from it.  I hope the Minister will honour the position of two teacher schools.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time with me.  I ask the Minister to take on board the Deputy's comments about teachers in Westport.  As a Cavan-Monaghan Deputy, I compliment the people in Mayo and the teachers in question on their generosity.  The Deputy referred to what is probably a pilot scheme, which should be extended.  This is the first time I have heard of the scheme, which is worthwhile.  It is wrong that people who are so generous are penalised by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a very important Bill.  Legislation without the necessary <Col N="12" /> back-up will not solve the problems that exist.  It would be like faith without good works.  We must provide the necessary wherewithal for education. We have an excellent system of education, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Many modern industries are attracted to this country and our young people are capable of taking up jobs in those industries.  That is because we saw the necessity to develop a much maligned area of our education system, regional and technical colleges.  Not every child is geared to be a professional, to take up jobs in accountancy, law and medicine.  Technical education was neglected up to recent years and in the last decade or so children have adapted well to the vocational education system.  As chairman of the parents' committee of Cavan vocational school I have first hand knowledge of the tremendous input of that system to education.  This area needs greater resources, and money provided for that purpose would be an investment in the State.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty for children who have the ability to learn, they will succeed in any school, whether a vocational school or a college.  I am not downgrading the college system of education, but vocational schools cater for a broader spectrum of the population.  Those schools were once considered second class education institutions, which was wrong.  There are insufficient resources to cater for children with difficulties &mdash; 50 or 60 per cent of students are in that category.  Perhaps there is not enough support in the home and not all parents encourage and help their children. There may be various reasons for that which are unrelated to social problems.  Perhaps some parents believe, as in my time, that primary school education is sufficient.  That was acceptable 15 or 20 years ago, when on leaving primary school one could get a job in the bank, but that is no longer the case.  The minimum education needed at present for any worthwhile job is the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There are children who experience great difficulties learning and are unable to keep up with the brighter students.  Those children need support and it is important to provide remedial teaching at an early stage.  I could flood the Minister's office with representations about remedial teachers, for which there is a demand in every school.  The Minister is trying to meet that demand by grouping schools, but there are still many schools that do not have the service of a remedial teacher.  Such a service is vitally important at an early stage to encourage children and give them the necessary back-up.  Perhaps teachers should even visit homes and encourage parents to help their children.</P>
    <P>Since my youngest child is doing the leaving certificate examination this year I am aware of the concerns and tensions involved.  The points system, which is outdated, must be examined because it puts much pressure on children.  Difficulties are also experienced in filling in CAO forms.  It is not uncommon for young people to have a nervous breakdown and drop out of school <Col N="13" /> because they cannot achieve the necessary points for the job they wish to take up.  The points system should be changed.  For example, a young girl who gets a sufficient number of points to study nursing may not make a good nurse whereas another girl who is well suited to the job may not have the necessary number of points.  That is the case across the board in various aspects of education. Because a person gets the necessary number of points does not mean they are suitable for the job.  I am not saying the points system should be abolished, but a certain number of places should be filled by interview.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Minister who is a young man and not far removed from the education system.  I hope he will take on board the matters raised so that as many children as possible are assisted in achieving their goal in life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this Bill.  The practical realities which people bring to the debate are perhaps more important than the legislation before us.  The Bill appears to be acceptable to the partners in education. This is to be welcomed because I recall acrimonious debates on the previous Bill when I was on the other side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Deputy was not often in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of being back in Opposition.  When we were in Opposition we got our points across.  I recall it being said that when Fianna Fáil returned to Government we would not introduce regional education boards. Nobody believed us.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has not proceeded with them.</P>
      <P>It is important that all the discussions in the various education fora or on the Green Paper or the White Paper have been brought together in the Bill.  While it contains statutory provisions for teachers, boards of management, functions of the school, the school plan, etc. , it has enough flexibility to allow for the development of education.</P>
      <P>The achievement of so much without statutory provisions has only been possible because of the flexibility within the educational system.  For example, there would be no vocational educational schools without parental support and if people had not been prepared to fight for them. I hope, therefore, that there will be enough flexibility within the section dealing with the recognition of schools to allow for community needs and for what communities consider to be important. While we cannot have schools appearing everywhere, perhaps the Minster will introduce an amendment which provides that community needs must be taken into consideration in giving formal recognition to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions regarding boards of management.  I am also glad that there is no more acrimony regarding these boards and that the State will not be dictating to schools the kinds of boards they should have.  Boards of management <Col N="14" /> have been helpful and I believe that discussions among the various partners in education will address situations where the principal of one school is on the board of management of another.</P>
    <P>However, there should be more openness among boards of management and they should involve people with an interest in education who could perhaps bring more to them than teachers and parents.  That would be an excellent development. All means of persuasion should be used to ensure that almost all schools have boards of management because they allow for more openness within schools and enable people to be more aware of what is happening within the schools system.</P>
    <P>I may have misread the Bill but there appears to be no mention of gender equity within the boards of management.  Perhaps the Minister will address that.  Probably most parents on boards are women but gender equity should be encompassed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on disadvantage and I compliment the Minister on including a section on educational disadvantage; if it were not included it would not be recognised.  I am especially worried about educational disadvantage because I represent a rural constituency.  We must distinguish between the high achievers and those with special educational needs, such as people with autism and dyslexia and children who need remedial education.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which considered details on the education provided by Teagasc, I was taken aback at the revelation that eight out of 15 students attending one of the agricultural colleges could neither read nor write.  How did these people get through the system with such terrible disadvantage?  While there are tremendous achievers and while many have taken up third level education, which is very important, many other people have slipped through the system.  Resources and support structures must be provided.  They should be inclusive and should involve parents, teachers, boards of management, the schools inspectorate, educational psychologists, remedial teachers and home-school liaison officers.  If these groups combined to support young people we could deal with many aspects of educational disadvantage.  Access to remedial education must be allowed which does not entail the remedial teacher spending 50 per cent of his or her time driving to and from the schools within his or her remit.  The issue of remedial education is close to the Minister's heart and I hope he will ensure that it will be made available to all the schools and all the pupils who need it.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with funding and I am glad that the Minster has allowed flexibility here.  For example, in recent years the tax year and not the academic year has been taken into consideration. However, the academic year is the best way for dealing with funding allocations.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position on funding <Col N="15" /> vocational education committees.  The section does not mention the VEC scheme but provides that money will be provided to the vocational education committees who will then distribute it equally to the schools.  The flexibility of funding for the scheme has been removed.  The Minister has had much experience on vocational education committees and perhaps he might look at this aspect.  The money should be provided to the VEC scheme as opposed to the schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 31 which provides for teaching through the medium of Irish.  This was a huge omission from the previous Bill.  It is very disappointing that many young people have little regard for the language.  Although they are taught Gaelic from the age of four, their fluency and working knowledge of the language when they finish their leaving certificate is poor.  I hope the board will address this matter.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh níos mó suime ag na daltaí sa teanga.  Tá Bille Teanga le teacht agus mar gheall ar sin beidh níos mó postanna le fáil ag daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Dá bhrí sin tá sé níos tábhachtaí go mbeadh suim ag na daltaí sa teanga agus go mbeadh níos mó tacaíochta don teanga ón Roinn.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil rud éigin á dhéanamh ag an mBille maidir le téacsleabhair i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil.  Tá súil agam nach ndéanfar dearmad ar an teanga atá thuas i gCúige Uladh.  Sin atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair mar tá go leor téacsleabhar ann ó Chonamara agus áiteanna eile mar sin.</P>
    <P>When the Minister sets up the boards, will he take special cognisance of the Gaelscoileanna, particularly those based in the Gaeltacht?  Gaelscoileanna have evolved and developed but I hope they are not a fad or something parents feel their children should attend because it is the &ldquo;in place&rdquo; to go.  There is huge sincerity among people developing Gaelscoileanna but I hope there will be regard for small Gaeltacht schools. The people running the Gaeltacht schools are annoyed, and correctly so, because they feel the Gaelscoileanna have greater pupil-teacher ratios and access to support structures and Gaeltacht schools are losing out.  I do not want that to happen. There are many Gaeltacht national and second level schools in my constituency.  I hope the structures will be there to ensure support for these schools and the development of the language, even in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá eagla orm go bhfuil na Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that a representative of Gaeltacht schools, in addition to a representative of the Gaelscoileanna, is involved on the board?  This is most important.  There was much support for the establishment of a special structure for Gaeltacht areas during the discussions on the regional education boards.  In common with the Minister, I do not agree with regional boards, but I hope the new board will address some of the concerns expressed during those discussions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The responsibilities given to students and the recognition of their role within the school system are most welcome.  I hope the partners in education by having students involved, will instil responsibility in young people.  As the chairperson of the board of a large vocational school with almost 1,100 pupils, I am aware that instilling responsibility and respect for their school in students is a difficult job.  Their involvement in the educational system is most important.  I am glad school councils will be recognised and students will be involved in their schools because they are the people who will benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>The recognition of the role of parents is vital and I commend the work done by parents in recent years in the development of schools.  It is unfortunate that parents were in the past only hauled out for fundraising events.  They have more to say and do than fundraising.  I am delighted recognition has been given to parents' associations and that they will work in partnership with teachers to ensure that the best is gained from the educational system.  They will be involved with the boards of management in the development of schools and discussions on school plans.  Parents are involved in the development of their children and they will have educational responsibilities.  At parent association meetings, a principal often says it is most unfortunate that the parents he or she wanted to see are not present.  The people who are really interested are involved in parents' associations and I hope an increasing number of parents will get involved in the development of education for their young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister's innovation with regard to technical education through the provision of computers and the need for computer literacy is most welcome.  It is a milestone in the educational development of young people.  I hope they will be able to compete with the best.  However, we should consider what skills are required for the new millennium and what jobs will be available then.  Technical education and computer literacy are necessary but many computer companies are dying off and jobs are being lost.  An initiative must be taken involving education and employment and enterprise groups to ensure that the needs of the next 20 years are addressed now. Education will decide what jobs will be available in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the development of vocational education is most important.  The Department should have an increasing role with regard to apprenticeships.  This area warrants an initiative.  It is most unfortunate that many young people who want apprenticeships as plumbers, electricians or carpenters through FÁS cannot take them up because they cannot get sponsors. It is a pity people are being brought in from the UK to fill jobs which were not available in Ireland 20 years ago when we exported our trades people.  People who need trades people now <Col N="17" /> know they must write large cheques and take their chances in finding somebody.  The Department of Education and Science should be more involved in the development of this type of education in terms of the skills needed for the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  The Minister wishes to bring forward a number of initiatives during his term of office and I hope we can get down to basics and address the problems in the educational system.  These include capital expenditure, the provision of remedial teachers, support services, educational psychologists and addressing the future needs of young people.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Nuair a chuir an tAire tús leis an díospóireacht seo chuir sé in iúl dúinn go raibh áit faoi leith ag an tír seo sa mheid is nach raibh córas dleathach againn sa chóras oideachais.  Chuala mé é sin ó thánas anseo go dtí an Dáil don chéad uair, nach raibh córas dleathach againn sa tír.  Ní dóigh liom go gcuirfidh sé feabhas ar bith ar chaighdeán oideachais na tíre seo toisc go bhfuil ceartanna ag daoine.  Mar braitheann sé go mór ar an méid airgid a chuireann an tAire agus an Roinn Oideachais isteach chun tacaíocht a thabhairt.</P>
      <P>Rights are one thing but availability is something else.  The Fine Gael spokesman on Education, Deputy Richard Bruton, mentioned the importance of catering for disadvantaged children.  However, it will make no difference to disadvantaged children to give them the right to education in their schools if the Minister and his Department do not provide assistance for the school.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a case in County Carlow involving a seven year old child who has cerebral palsy. I am awaiting a response to my queries about this girl, who has been denied access to nearby schools.  She is entitled to be accepted by her local school, but teachers there have no extra services to back them up and are in difficulty.  In the early 1970s I experienced a similar situation when I was teaching, when teachers were willing to work with two disabled children.</P>
      <P>There is no point in telling disabled people they are entitled to go to their local school unless the Department allocates a special assistant to look after them.  Classes are too big and of mixed ability.  Inspectors do not expect any difference in children's abilities; they expect all the children in a class to be of the same high standard.  This is why I worry about giving legislative standing to our educational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can give legal rights to a pupil, but if the local school cannot cope with two extra disabled children, what good are those rights?  The children's parents may go to court and insist their children are accepted at school, though I hope that does not arise.  The Minister should not hide behind the legal framework.  If children have the right to go to school, assistance should be made available to the school concerned.  I met a conscientious teacher recently who was at her wits' <Col N="18" /> end trying to accommodate a particular child.  She wanted to give the child as much attention as possible but had to teach two other classes as well.  She should not have been asked to do so, but she felt the child was entitled to an education and did what she could out of kindness.</P>
    <P>There are probably enough armchair generals in education to defeat Saddam Hussein.  Everybody went to school, so everybody has views and prejudices about education.  Those who loved Irish think it should be taught full-time; those who hated it think it should be banned.  History was thought to be unnecessary, but now it is an essential subject.  Those who liked teachers think they are wonderful, while those who had horrible teachers think they are the worst people one could encounter.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher, I must admit an interest in this matter.  I recall going on my bicycle to teach in a school which had a rat that died of cold there.  I see nothing about teacher training and preparation in this Bill.  If teachers are not the most important part of teaching we are in trouble. We can have all the regulations we want, but if teachers are not dedicated there will be problems. Teaching has always been a very dedicated profession. I hope teachers do not become cynical, because if teaching is regarded as a 9 to 3 job, education is finished.  Teachers do much that is beyond the call of education.  They are criticised for short hours by people who never stood in front of a class.  I never had fewer than 36 pupils in a class and had 54 once.</P>
    <P>It is not as easy an occupation as it seems.  Parents understand this, but academics who have not seen a classroom since being taught themselves produce maddening theories.  There should be much more emphasis in teacher training on the art of teaching.  One may be an expert in French or history, but that does not compensate for lack of teaching skill.  Old training methods may be criticised, but that method included a critic who said to one after teaching &ldquo;Bhí an ceacht sin go maith, ach..  &ldquo;That &ldquo;ach&rdquo; would knock one for six for half an hour.  One learnt quickly what one was doing wrong in the classroom.  There is not enough emphasis on this aspect of teacher training now.</P>
    <P>The higher diploma in education does not cater for the art of teaching at second level.  Unless one falls over one gets the diploma, but that does not mean one knows how to teach.  There is an art to having patience and to accepting a child saying he or she does not understand without savaging them.  It is not easy to have patience.  I spent 32 years teaching, and my one regret is not giving enough time to the slower learners in the class. One must strike a balance and advance with a big class, and I am sure there were pupils who could not follow the lessons.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I returned to college to study for a BA, and one professor spoke with her back to us while she wrote on the blackboard.  The class was composed entirely of primary teachers, and nobody knew what she was saying.  No <Col N="19" /> inspector improved my teaching like that lesson. It must be most frustrating and boring for slow learners to listen to a teacher who knows the subject off by heart but who forgets that they do not understand.  I liked teaching but I regret not spending more time with slow learners and less time with top students.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his Bill, but what was he thinking when posing for photographs to sell computers for Tesco?  This will give the Minister goose pimples in later life.  It is a great sham and shows the oxymoron of this Government. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is asking Tesco to sell Irish beef, while the Minister for Education's photograph is helping to sell food in the same supermarket.  Tesco will give a printer for £35,000 worth of food bought in the store or a computer for £150,000 of food; if the Minister thinks that that is value or helpful to the Department of Education he has missed the boat.  To misquote Churchill, never have so many parents bought so much food for so few computers.  It is an unbelievable mistake.  The Minister should place a note in the newspapers withdrawing his sanction for this scheme.  He is supporting a group that is trying to abuse the demand for computers.</P>
    <P>Examinations are dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister intends tackling the points system, and I wish him well with that.  It will be a difficult task, but that system must be examined.  I have often advocated that in addition to attaining a certain number of points, students should also be interviewed to determine their suitability for courses. I accept, however, that such a system could be open to abuse.  Guidance teachers should not advise students to take up courses in medicine simply because they attain high points in the leaving certificate.  I was flabbergasted when a person asked me why a girl went on to do primary teaching when she had attained very high points in her leaving certificate.  The person thought that because she attained high points she should take up a course in medicine or pharmacy.  I simply said she wanted to be a primary teacher.</P>
    <P>If large numbers of students become doctors simply because they attain high points in the leaving certificate, the standard of medicine will drop. They will become academics and do research work or end up being very dissatisfied with their careers and will not want to be disturbed by patients.  Attaining high points in the leaving certificate does not necessarily mean one has a talent for medicine or veterinary practice.  Students who attain high points could be very happy in jobs other than medicine, pharmacy or veterinary practice for which high points are required.  While it would be difficult to devise an alternative system, I hope the Minister will review the matter.  I accept that the points system is fair in that students get a place in college on merit, but it could lead to many square pegs in round holes. Many students will be dissatisfied with their careers because they do not have a natural talent for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> I welcome the establishment of boards of management and parents' associations.  In the 1960s I set up a parents' association long before the matter was spoken about in the Department of Education and Science.  Deputy Coughlan said those organisations should not merely do fundraising work.  The association I set up in the 1960s did a great deal of fundraising for the school so that we had overhead projectors at that time.  The Department was not very happy about that but it got good value from the excellent staff in that school.</P>
    <P>Schools cannot function properly if there is not a good relationship between parents and teachers.  Friction between parents and teachers leads to trouble for a school.  Teachers must ensure that, within certain limits, parents can visit schools to discuss matters with principals. However, they cannot be allowed take up too much of a principal's time, particularly if he or she is not a walking principal.  There are many disruptions one can do without while trying to teach a class and, as a former principal &mdash; not a walking one &mdash; of an eight teacher school, I am well aware of that.  Children suffer when there is friction between teachers and parents and consequently everyone loses out.</P>
    <P>A school's eligibility for an extra teacher is determined by the numbers attending the school on 30 September each year.  Schools carry extra pupils for a full year before another teacher is appointed.  When I was teaching I think the time period involved was two quarters.  It should not be necessary for a school to carry extra pupils for a full year before an additional teacher is appointed.  If, for example, a family moved into an area in October and their children attend the local school, that school would have to wait two years for the appointment of an extra teacher. Why should children who are entitled to an extra teacher have to wait a full year for the appointment to be made?</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague complimented him on his interest in remedial teaching.  He visited an important part of the country shortly after his appointment and was told of the need for a remedial teacher for two large schools in the area. Will the Minister seriously consider appointing a remedial teacher for the Tullow area?  I received a letter from the board of management today informing me this is the fifth year it has made a submission to the Department in this regard. Instead of theoretical nonsense about legal status and so on, we should appoint remedial teachers to help slow learners.  I accept there could be a huge demand for such teachers, but when the regional boards are abolished I hope the £40 million allocated for that purpose will not disappear into a black hole in the Minister's Department or the Department of Finance.  The Minister should allocate that money to different areas of the education sector, particularly remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>My campaign since 1990 for the abolition of flat top desks has not ended.  When a reply to one parliamentary question from the Minister's <Col N="21" /> Department informs me that one school has taken up the offer of sloped top desks and another states that statistics are not available on such matters, there is something rotten in the state of Denmark.  I will not be fobbed off on this issue.  Flat top desks cause lordosis, forward curvature of the spine.  That did not happen in the past when desks were sloped.  School principals have informed the Department that flat top desks are easy to put together for art classes and so on and pens will not fall off them.  Children are bending over these desks for 14 years.  RTÉ carried a television programme on the matter and physiotherapists also support my view.  The flat top school desk is the murder machine of modern day Ireland and while the Department accepts this, it has fobbed me off.  I will take up the matter on a major scale.</P>
    <P>I could spend many hours talking about the inspectorate.  During my time as a teacher inspectors acted as bully boys, but I am sure times have changed.  In my first year of teaching a divisional inspector spent an afternoon showing me how to do an aspect of the curriculum and when I proudly presented the copies to him at the end of the day, he said I should not be doing that.  Inspectors did what they liked under the old system.  I hope advisers and helpers are appointed and that consideration is given to the way university professors and secondary teachers give lectures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and congratulate the Minister on the work he has done.  He has taken many initiatives in the first eight months of his ministry, he is a very refreshing voice.</P>
      <P>The Bill is particularly welcome because it puts the administration of the education system on a statutory basis and builds on the strength of the education system.  There has been no substantive legislation on first or second level education in the 20th century, other than the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  This Bill clearly outlines the rights and responsibilities of parents, students, teachers and school managers.  This was not the case in the past.  It will ensure that all the partners will be aware of their roles and respective rights in education.  The Bill also underpins the Minister's power to regulate and conduct State examinations and an effective appeals system will be put in place.  The appeal system should balance the rights of students and parents with the effective operation of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Minister and Deputy Browne referred to the important role of teachers.  Much of the credit for the education system in contributing to our economic growth must go to teachers.  The Bill provides for consultation with teachers on a range of issues.  I would like to think this House would be concerned about the welfare of teachers.  This is an issue I hope we can discuss in the Committee on Education and Science.  Teachers can feel isolated and taken for granted in their work.  I welcome the Minister's initiative to appoint a second <Col N="22" /> teacher to one teacher schools of ten or more students.  In one-teacher schools there are enormous pressures to teach students from junior infants to the senior classes.  There are more than 100 one-teacher schools.  The only technology the teacher may have is a telephone to ring for help in the event of a crisis.</P>
    <P>This brings into focus another problem, that of the panel system for teachers.  The position is quite good at primary level in that teachers get panel rights which lead to a teaching position, usually within 28 miles of the school in which they are teaching and in their diocese.  However, there is a greater problem at second level where teachers have been known to be on teaching panels for more than six years without receiving a teaching position.  I am informed there may be as many as 700 teachers on secondary school panels.  That is an appalling prospect for those teachers.  If one is tied in to a secondary school panel system, one cannot apply for teaching positions in vocational or other second level schools. To do so would mean the loss of one's panel rights.  Perhaps the Minister will examine the issue of the teaching panel system at second level.</P>
    <P>We need extra remedial and resource teachers. The demographic dividend, about which we have heard much, should give us extra teachers.  The former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, appointed remedial teachers and resource teachers and this must be continued.  In reply to me and other Deputies the Minister said the staffing arrangements were agreed with the Irish National Teachers Organisation for primary schools in March 1997.  Under that agreement 26 resource teachers and more than 50 remedial teachers were appointed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can find resources to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio given that some teachers are endeavouring to cope with large numbers of students.  In one-teacher schools and special needs schools, the child care assistant programme should be funded.  In many cases a scheme is organised through the FÁS training authority.  By its nature, FÁS will allow only one year of employment for a child care assistant.  It is difficult for a board of management to operate child care assistants on a one year basis.</P>
    <P>It has been reported in recent months, and even in today's newspapers, that there is a problem in getting substitute teachers at primary level. There is concern about the shortage of male teachers.  Some people consider it is now a female profession at first level.  I hope that gender inequality can be addressed.  It is ironic that there is a shortage of substitute teachers and a difficulty for teachers in obtaining employment at second level.  Perhaps the Minister will address both these issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said about examinations. An issue which has not been covered so far concerns the needs of children with a physical or mental disability.  This issue has been discussed briefly at the Committee on Education and Science where we have talked about the use of information <Col N="23" /> technology and music for such children. When sitting some State examinations, children with a disability should be allowed extra time to complete the examination paper.  I have raised this issue on behalf of a profoundly deaf child, to which I received a reply from the Department to the effect that it would allow ten minutes extra in respect of a junior certificate examination this year.  There are people with other disabilities who may need more time in which to complete an examination paper.  The Department should examine this situation and allow more flexibility. An extra ten minutes does not meet the requirements of such students who are trying to deal with State examinations.  The Irish Deaf Society say the use of a sign interpreter for examination purposes is just as important as the amount of time allowed to sit examinations.  I understand there are only six qualified interpreters to ensure access for the whole deaf population to services and resources which the rest of Irish society take for granted.  I hope this matter can be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Deaf Society has stated that in countries such as Sweden and Denmark, when discriminatory practices are removed and access policies put in place, the achievement of deaf people in education matches their potential and reflects their abilities.  It also states that through the work of programmes such as the EU HORIZON Initiative, when Irish deaf students have appropriate access, their achievement patterns in third level education compares with those of their hearing peers.  This is an issue we should discuss at greater length and I hope the Minister will take it on board.  The Irish Deaf Society say that many deaf students at second level are being directed into the rehabilitation service, that few enter third level and few have access to professional occupations.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has responsibility for school transport, a report on which has been published.  On reading the report I was amazed to note we are still talking about the same rules and regulations as in 1968; that there must be ten eligible children between the ages of four and ten to establish a transport service and those children have to be two miles from the nearest school.  There may be some flexibility in the report in relation to children over ten years of age and that they could still be allowed the two mile limit.  There are other issues in relation to the privatisation of the school transport system.</P>
    <P>Other issues such as privatisation of the service and whether schools should have a say are not addressed in the report.  This is disappointing. What is the position on the four pilot projects, one in each province, initiated in 1988?  Given the decline in the school-going population at first level there is a need to change the regulations to give schools a say.</P>
    <P>At second level the position is different, there is overcrowding on school buses.  This leads to a lack of discipline and is a distraction to drivers.  It is impossible to comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> While there are guidelines on the transportation of goods and cattle, there are none on the transportation of students to school.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I compliment boards of management on their efforts to raise funds.  Every first and second level school has to do this to meet running costs.  Thanks to the Minister, more money will be available for technological education.</P>
    <P>Boards of management that wish to use educational videos &mdash; I raised this issue with my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, when he was the Minister responsible &mdash; have to have a television licence.  No Government has tackled this issue, the buck has been passed between the many Departments involved.  While the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a scheme under which old age pensioners are supplied with a television licence, there is no scheme under which primary schools are exempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary schools should not be expected to buy a licence to show educational videos.  This issue has been taken up by the Union of Students in Ireland whose view is that students should pay a reduced fee.</P>
      <P>The process of consultation on this Bill was initiated by Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Education.  A Green Paper was published by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach.  This was followed by the education convention and the publication of a White Paper.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Bill does not provide for the establishment of regional education boards which would lead to greater bureaucracy.  Instead £10 million is to be made available this year to schools for minor capital projects.  A sum of £40 million was to be made available for regional education boards.</P>
      <P>When the INTO conducts a survey to identify schools in need of refurbishment there should be an immediate response.  To allow refurbishment works proceed in one of the schools in my area, Kilglass, teachers and pupils had to move to office accommodation formerly occupied by the ESB.</P>
      <P>Much could be done at local level.  We need only look at what local authorities and county and city vocational educational committees are doing to appreciate the benefits.  In this regard the Minister proposes to establish county fora.  Gaelscoileanna have been established in a number of counties. Scoil Ui Cearnaigh in Ballinasloe which is based in substandard accommodation hopes to be included in the proposed scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is greater co-operation between inspectors, teachers and boards of management.  Inspectors now seem to understand that in each class there are children of mixed abilities.  There was a view that inspectors thought all children at primary level were of equal ability and would progress <Col N="25" /> at the same rate.  This is not the case.  There were horror stories about what inspectors wanted children to do.  I remember a colleague of mine saying the children he was teaching had to learn their tables in Irish at a time when they were finding it difficult to learn them in English.  Now inspectors are pressing for the appointment of remedial and resource teachers.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and hope he will deal with some of the issues which have been raised by Deputies on all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success in this important ministry and congratulate him on taking a courageous decision on multi-denominational education and making the announcement in my constituency.  It is welcome that the National Curriculum and Assessment Board is to be placed on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Having congratulated the Minister on grasping the nettle of multi-denominational education I do not agree with much of what he said.  His speech was a model of revisionism so far as the Department of Education and Science is concerned.  The House is embellished by many teachers who will be able to bring their experience to bear in their contributions.  I was a university teacher for years and may be again, depending on the will and love of the people.  The Minister's extraordinary hubris is unsustainable.  For example, it states: &ldquo;We have a unique education system of which we can be very proud&rdquo;.  People are in the habit of describing themselves as unique.  They are unique in some sense but that does not mean a great deal.  His contribution went on to state: &ldquo;Historically, it has been through education that people have sought to progress and there is no doubt that the quality of the education provided throughout our schools has given us not only our literary and academic reputation, but also our considerable economic success&rdquo;.  The fact is, however, that some of our significant literary and academic figures found it necessary to flee the country, look back at it from abroad and see it objectified.  They returned to tell us what was wrong with the education system only to have their books banned as a consequence.</P>
      <P>Another part of the Minister's speech suggested that the education system has grown organically.  It has not.  I offer these views not as any criticism of the present incumbent of the Ministry for Education and Science but as the views of a public representative that are important to state.  For example, John Marcus O'Sullivan's innovations in education were opposed tooth and nail.  The l930 Vocational Act created a near riot in the country.  Elements of the church were solidly against it.  The vocational schools were referred to as being Godless.  In the history of vocational education, wonderful people were expelled from their positions, people like Frank Edwards who was driven from his post in Wexford on the basis that he was a communist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> If the Department of Education and Science decides to open its files it might try to identify the corpses littered through the history of education. An outrageous abuse of their position was taken not just by the Roman Catholic Church but by all those who purported to have an even more extreme view than the people offering the doctrinal view.</P>
    <P>I see a Deputy here from Wexford.  Wexford has a fine history to write about the organic development of education when communities were torn apart.  The truth is that in the history of education people were driven from their positions and were criticised on the basis of ideological views they might have held even on issues of race.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution further states: &ldquo;There is little need for me to speak at length of the great achievements of the Irish education system&rdquo;.  There have been achievements.  They are visible all around us in the prosperous, sophisticated, confident society we have created.  We might like to call ourselves prosperous, sophisticated and confident, but there is also another society that is not participating in prosperity, that is deeply demoralised and that feels excluded. That society is not included in our change and it wants to be respected also.</P>
    <P>My criticism would be of whatever person filled the position as Minister for Education and Science. I do not like these speeches that are what I call windy rhetoric &mdash; the WR factor.  When we joined the European Union we sent people to Europe who occasionally stood up and gave speeches to the effect that we are a small country, but a proud country.  The Department of Education and Science is inclined to say, &ldquo;we are and have been a wonderful Department&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to give some more examples on why I welcome the National Curriculum and Assessment Board being put on a statutory basis.  I was once chairman of a regional development organisation's arts committee, before we were disbanded. That was the first assault on regionalism. I understand it is now an extraordinary perversion of logic that getting rid of regionalism is supposed to be getting rid of bureaucracy.  I thought regionalism was supposed to dilute centralised State control, but we will leave that aside for the moment.  Recalling my time on that committee in the 1970s, I remember suggesting to the Department of Education another of its great achievements. The Department regarded martial airs as being suitable for boys and lullabies suitable for girls.</P>
    <P>The Department had an even more brilliant insight into its organic development.  It regarded dance as having nothing to do with physical education. We once tried to have a seminar for teachers on the incorporation of dance and movement into physical education.  The Department not only prohibited it but it prohibited teachers attending.  It organised its own seminar in Wexford on real PE, jumping up and down ex-sergeant <Col N="27" /> major style, in opposition to a seminar organised in Clifden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not entirely true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion, therefore, that we have arrived at a prosperous, sophisticated and confident society that is growing organically, with the Department of Education and Science having one inspired rush of blood to the head after another, simply does not hold up.  I feel a moral necessity to state this.  There has been a battle about education since the State was founded and before that.</P>
      <P>I now offer another critique to the revisionism on offer.  In his Second Stage speech last week the Minister stated: &ldquo;The structure and administration of the present education system at first level derives from a letter written in 1831 by the then Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Stanley, to the Duke of Leinster who is to become the chairman of a new Board of Commissioners for National Education&rdquo;.  That is referred to in the history of education as the Stanley letter.  That letter admits, and I congratulate the Minister for putting this into print, that there never was a constitutional or a legal basis for the role of patron in the history of education.</P>
      <P>When I was a Member of the Seanad I recall asking a previous incumbent of the office of Minister for Education, the former Deputy Paddy Cooney, on at least eight occasions to show me the legal or constitutional basis for the role of patron.  The Department eventually came up with a piece of casuistry that was of its best vintage.  It said there was not a legal basis but there had been a principle of continuity.  Translated into the language of the ordinary democratic citizen, we had been getting away with it for years on the basis of the Stanley letter so why should we not be allowed to continue?  That is the deconstruction of the principle of continuity.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the Stanley letter was the basis of a grab for power and control that has left its mark on education.  It reflected itself in the debate in the l930s about vocational education.  It was the basis of the Department wanting to have as much control in vocational education, the Godless sector as it was called by the Department, as in the sector over which it claimed patronage on the basis of a letter sent in the l9th century which had no legal or constitutional basis in Irish law or in the procedures of this State.</P>
      <P>The debate in education has always been about three main factors &mdash; control, access and curriculum. More recently, a fourth factor has dominated these other three, that is, the question of resources.  I have sympathy for this Minister and other Ministers because when one examines the cost five years ago, the total Estimate for the Department of Education was a little over £2 billion.  There is pressure on any Minister, therefore, to manage such a huge proportion of public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> Education is so important it should not have to be restricted in the same way as expenditure in other areas.  For example, it is not simply an expenditure, it is a necessary investment in the structure of the citizenry towards the future.  I hold another view about that.  The case for expenditure in education at all levels should not be made on the basis of utility.  That would be a singularly narrow minded view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to a time when existing computer corporations might fade along with the opportunities that exist in the information technology and other areas, and how they would be replaced.  Everybody knows that in relation to the hardware, we would not have the formation that already exists.  Irish people are highly intelligent and it is a credit to those who trained and educated them in that sphere that they are so adaptable to be able to attract investment. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the base skills which made the hardware possible were engineering skills, and without the training in mathematics and engineering in its different forms, that would not have been possible. Equally, on the software side and the lateral skills which are necessary in developing programming, etc. , they have drawn a wide range of skills from music to mathematics and other forms of skills and adaptations.</P>
    <P>The net point is an enriched broad based education is the best equipment for adaptability into the future.  It is likely that the average person in his or her life's work will change occupation between three and five times compared to perhaps having changed it once when our parents worked, if they got work.  It is the ability to be adaptable and mobile that is important.  Anyone who likes to lean on education for the production of a narrow base at the cost of the general investment in skills and adaptability is getting education and planning wrong.  I have heard voices from industry who want to go down that road, but there is another more extreme view.  It is if they want to go down the other road they should pay for it.  Industry should take on as training the production of the narrow skills of application.  We are subsidising the whole of Europe through such education.  In practice, the big corporations are effectively socialising their costs while privatising their profits.  They are pushing the costs of training and adaptation in new skills applicable within a sector of their industry on to the taxpayer.  Education must be respected as an area that will enable all citizens to do any task and to be capable of being employed in the most highly skilled occupations or whatever, but its more general functions are even more important.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there was a reference by other Deputies to the commitment of the former Minister and my colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach, particularly to special education.  Deputy Killeen gave the game away to some extent when he used the memorable phrase, &ldquo;this tricky area&rdquo; when referring to the area of control.  That is a very telling phrase.  If one is in education and wants to <Col N="29" /> grasp nettles in the area of control, access and curriculum, one would have to make a number of significant changes.</P>
    <P>While recalling many of those who have done reconstructions of their time or written articles like &ldquo;My Education&rdquo; and so on, many a child is experiencing something similar today.  It is necessary for some public representative to say there is something wrong with schools where education comes to an end when the lights are switched off at night and resumed when they are switched on in the morning when the classroom is full.  There is always talk of resources for schooling, but there is a difference between schooling and education. There are countries in Europe where nothing happens in the classroom in the morning until there is an atmosphere of relaxation, music is played and people create an atmosphere in which learning can take place.</P>
    <P>On school architecture, the good old organically driven Department of Education sanctioned putting in concrete floors in schools so that pupils would break a leg if they tried to dance.  There was not a sprung floor in a school that it built until the 1980s.  The architectural design of schools consisted of concrete walls in case teachers wanted to stage a play.  The Department created buildings that were a nightmare.  I say good luck to whoever is Minister for Education, but there is a need to shake up the self-congratulatory ethos of saying, &ldquo;are we not wonderful to be standing as sophisticated, well off and as well endowed as we are today&rdquo;.  School buildings were a disaster.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of music from the curriculum has been appalling although some concessions have now been made.  People will probably write immediately to the Minister to tell him there are 10,400 tin whistles around the country.  Good luck to those who are playing in all the tin whistle bands or those who are playing the odd melodeon, but that is a far cry from including music in the education system.  The present position is a disaster.  When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I had meetings with the then Minister for Education and in the White Paper there is a chapter on the arts, which we wrote.</P>
    <P>I have not heard the word &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; in this debate and there was no reference to it in the Minister's speech.  Children are not going to school to be reared in what I called in the open mind lecture on education, &ldquo;a pedagogy of fear&rdquo;. We should eliminate all fear from education. There should be a pedagogy of creativity and a pedagogy of love.  Education may be the most important Cabinet post.  That is why I wish the Minister well in it.  It is perhaps one of the most important areas in society.</P>
    <P>If we are to adopt a proper approach to education there are a series of measures that should be taken.  On the issue of the television licence, unless one is broadcasting one does not need a licence.  As happened in regard to social welfare, the Department of Social Welfare recouped to the broadcasting division what was lost in respect <Col N="30" /> of the licence fee.  I would welcome schools being linked up to channels like the discovery channel and others which would assist teachers.  I support all the other measures people want which would involve the input of resources.  There is no disagreement on either side of the House on putting more resources into special education although it must be identified as perhaps the most urgent. There is a need for teacher retraining, in-service training and other such requirements.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Members, who had been teachers, say it is a tragedy if a child with learning difficulties is not discovered early on.  If a child's difficulties are discovered early on, something can be done about them.  Imagine the distress of a child who is isolated and managing to get by one day after another by hiding his or her deficiencies.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I make a case for a radical approach to put those missing elements into education. We should spend the democratic dividend on special needs, music and the arts, restore creativity and take teachers, many of whom are deeply distressed, from different levels of education and allow them a period of time to retrain and restore themselves.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím leis an méid atá scriobhta fan Gaeilge ach tá eagras orm.</P>
    <P>We should not be hearing about téacsleabhar 15 years after we first debated that matter.  How can one teach Irish in the Donegal canúint?  Text books are not available in any canúint in relation to Irish in some places.  That is a disaster.  I wish the Minister well and I hope he will return here soon to debate the philosophy of education.  I pay tribute to his Department for its rightful achievements while encouraging it at times to contain the hubris when it comes to wiping out historical facts of the appalling things done in the name of education in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  Last night I attended a function in Wexford involving the Arts Council, the Department of Education and four local schools.  The Minister for Education and the former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht were highly praised for their commitment to the arts in general.  A partnership arrangement between the three bodies brought the arts into the school where teachers and the students were taught about drama, music and dance.  Almost all the 100 teachers present last night thought it was a worthwhile exercise and the children who were present thought it represented something different.  It marked a move from academic subjects such as history and mathematics and showed them another side to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department and the Arts Council should be commended for their active involvement with the arts officer in the local authority and in helping to bring a different culture to our schools.  The Minister should continue this approach and <Col N="31" /> encourage more schools to become actively involved in this sector of education.</P>
    <P>Our education system has served the country well.  There are many excellent teachers but there are also some very bad teachers.  It baffles me that no matter how bad teachers may be the students are stuck with them.  There appear to be few mechanisms for dealing with substandard teachers.  Generally, however, teachers are of high quality and give a good service.</P>
    <P>There are sectors of the education system that need to be addressed &mdash; children from disadvantaged backgrounds, children who are physically challenged and traveller children.  Historically, these three sectors have been left behind by the system.  Previous Ministers have played a major role in developing education through the years. However, these areas have not been given the attention they deserve.  I know the Minister, Deputy Martin, has a deep commitment in this regard and that he will make resources available. At a time of economic prosperity when funds are available it is important to recognise that problems in the education system need to be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>There are large housing estates in my town where very few, if any, of the children go to second and third level education.  Over the last year Enniscorthy vocational college has increased the number of post leaving certificate places it offers from 20 to 180.  I know the Minister is committed to the expansion of the post leaving certificate courses.  For the first time in Enniscorthy young people are given the opportunity to attend courses in the vocational school that may allow them to advance to third level courses.  It is important that post leaving certificate courses are developed and made relevant to companies or industries in a given area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for reconstituting the urban vocational education committees as sub-committees of the county vocational education committees.  However, he should go the extra mile and reconstitute them as independent bodies. They have provided a good service in the past to urban areas.  Deputy Michael Higgins referred to the shenanigans in Wexford when the vocational education committees were formed in the 1930s.  The Wexford town vocational education committee was excellent and provided a good service to the people of the town.  It was a mistake to abolish it and I thank the Minister for reintroducing it to some extent.  He should consider restoring its full powers.  In addition to their normal courses, the vocational education committees now offer second chance education, post leaving certificate courses, adult education and a range of other educational courses.  Urban areas are growing rapidly and there are large numbers attending the vocational colleges.  Therefore, there is a need for a proper vocational education committee structure in urban areas which have different problems and needs from rural areas, properly constituted town vocational education <Col N="32" /> committees should be reintroduced on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The provision of facilities for physically challenged children must be addressed.  Most schools have a distinct lack of facilities for handicapped children.  They do not have ramps or wheelchair facilities.  The Minister should be generous in his allocation of funds to schools with such children attending.  Almost every school in any given region will have two or three pupils who are physically disabled because many parents have decided that it is better for their children to integrate with able bodied children.  The Minister should continue his work in this regard and make further funds available urgently.  Quite some time may elapse between a school making an application to the Department for funds and its application being dealt with.  These applications are always urgent and it is important that the Minister and the Department should be on the same wavelength.  It may happen that a Minister's orientation may be in the interests of the students but it can take time for the Department to respond as he or she would wish.  The Minister should have a priority section in the Department to deal with this area.</P>
    <P>School transport is causing problems in many areas of the country.  The school transport system was an excellent idea when it was set up in the 1960s.  It brought a new dimension to education and for the first time gave rural children an opportunity to attend second and third level education. However, 30 years later it is time to review the system.  The education system has changed and the boundaries for schools have changed.  The results of the review carried out by the last Government were not encouraging.  The Minister might broaden the terms of reference for a new review or for the review group that has been operating.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the transport system would not be acceptable.  Such suggestions appeared following the report of the last review group but the school transport system is very important for rural areas and must continue.  Perhaps the time has come to remove CIE from the system and to hand it over to the schools.  Grants could be made available to the schools to run transport in conjunction with private operators.  When I contact Bus Éireann officials in Waterford to inquire about problems with the school transport in areas in County Wexford, they indicate to me that they would be in favour of such an arrangement. However, when such suggestions are put to the Department they are refused apparently on the grounds of reports made by Bus Éireann.  Yet, when I contact the Bus Éireann inspector he tells me that he would have no problem with it if the Department approved it.  It is an ongoing battle which creates major problems for Deputies and parents.  It needs to be looked at more broadly than was done in the last review.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mary O'Rourke, Séamus Brennan and Noel Davern and the former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach have all been Ministers for Education <Col N="33" /> over a five or six year period.  Over the past few years there was a consultation process and a green paper.  The consultation process is not in question.  Parents, politicians and teachers have all had their say.  It is time the Bill was introduced, and it is welcome.  However, we can over legislate in the area of education.  There must be co-operation between teachers, parents and students in areas not covered by legislation.  For example, problems of discipline have to be dealt with locally, and common sense must prevail.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to put the examination system on a statutory basis and provide for penalties of £1,500 or six months imprisonment and £5,000 or two years' imprisonment for interfering with examination papers.  The Minister should instead consider some kind of community programme where the offender would speak publicly about the offence or serve a sentence within the local community.  The penalties proposed are very severe and could send the wrong signals to young people.  I do not condone interference with examination papers by students, but we can be too severe, and we should look favourably at a more reasonable sanction such as suspension or community service.</P>
    <P>Ministers invariably talk of teachers having a duty to encourage and foster learning.  I see it as their job to do that, and I wonder if it is to be regulated and how it fits into the Bill.  I wonder also what action can be taken against poor quality teachers.  Such teachers are in a minority, but no matter how bad they are, there is no way of dealing with complaints about them.</P>
    <P>More resources are required to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  We all read about the scarcity of teachers in yesterday's papers, and how difficult this will make it to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that when concluding the debate.</P>
    <P>There have been major attacks on the vocational education system over the past week or ten days, particularly by Deputies on the far side of the House.  That system has served us well over the years but, as education moves on, the role of the vocational education committees has to change.  I would welcome a role for parents, teachers and the wider community on the committees. It must be said, however, that the structure of the vocational education committees has been very good for education here.  It gave students from different walks of life the opportunity to attend second level education.  Therefore, I do not support the attacks made on the system during the debate.</P>
    <P>Another cause for concern is how schools operate after school hours.  Most schools are based in villages or large urban areas.  From about 4 p.m. in the afternoon most are closed down until 9 a.m. the following morning.  A large number of schools now have caretakers so it would be possible for school facilities, particularly sports and recreation halls to be made available to the local community.  This would help to meet the demands being made by me and other Deputies <Col N="34" /> of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, for massive amounts of money for community centres in villages and urban centres.  There is a need for more co-operation between the different Departments, and to look at the possibility of opening school facilities to parents, community groups and young people after school hours.  Young people tell me that, once they leave the school premises at 4 p.m., school is no longer relevant to them and they spend their time standing at street corners and getting into all sorts of trouble.  Perhaps the Minister would open schools in a few urban centres and villages after school closing time on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to gaelscoileanna. We have a new one in Baile na Scorthaigh in a rented premises and another in Baile Loch Garmáin and these schools are in need of proper premises and facilities.  The Minister is committed to the development of the Irish language, but the facilities available to gaelscoileanna are not good.  They need extra teachers and equipment.  Most of them have only been up and running in the past year or two.  Will the Minister look seriously at funding in the coming years for the further development of such gaelscoileanna which are proving popular in many areas?</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well as Minister for Education and Science. One of the characteristics of the ministry during his short period in office has been accessibility of himself and his officials.  It is very important that the Minister in a Department like the Department of Education and Science is available to hear people's views and wishes.</P>
      <P>In debating this Bill and education in general, one message coming loud and clear from practically all sources is that there is great confidence among the public in the education system and in the deliverance of the service by all involved. Given the degree of confidence, it must be recognised that we are making progress and providing a good service.  This has been acknowledged by other contributors to the debate.</P>
      <P>If we were to ask young people about education, they would be concerned about points, their future and how education could prepare them for life.  If we were to ask parents, they would say there is a total lack of services for physically or mentally handicapped children.  If one asked that question of everyone, one would get many different responses, depending on individual needs.  Therefore, I recognise the difficulty every Minister experiences in delivering a service which is acceptable to and not criticised by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a long awaited, comprehensive response by the Minister to refocus education for the new millennium.  We can talk about the history of education and the education has been well-delivered by many people &mdash; teachers, departmental officials and Ministers &mdash; down the years, often in difficult circumstances.  However, <Col N="35" /> we must look at the position now and for the future and I would be more concerned with that than with the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill was brought to its present state by the Minister but many of his predecessors had a hand in it.  Few Departments have experienced as much change as this one and many Ministers who tried to introduce change were stifled by changes of portfolio or the short life of various Governments. The first moves towards change occurred in the 1980s when a former Minister, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, introduced a document on partnership in education.  This was the first time we had a debate in which people not directly involved in education were asked for their views and brought together in a forum to express those views and to try to reach a consensus about the needs of education in our modern society. Emphasis would have been placed on the leaving certificate but there was also discussion about the organisation of education and delivering the service in a cost-effective way.  Mrs. Hussey's successors as Minister, including Deputy O'Rourke, were conscious of what happened before and were prepared to continue to make improvements, leading up to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have compared this Bill to the one produced by the previous Minister, Ms Bhreathnach.  When the Minister was Opposition spokesperson on Education he tabled almost 100 amendments to the original Bill.  I do not know how many he has incorporated in the new Bill but I doubt they are all there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those amendments were welcome.  When a Bill like this is published the media highlight various issues and sectional interest groups give their opinion.  The education boards proposed in the last Bill came in for terrible criticism and I welcome the Minister's decision to drop them from this legislation, if for no other reason than if they were retained, those who were looking for resources or services would always home in on the costs of these boards rather than their merits.  If they had been established they would have many advantages on a local level &mdash; the intention was to decentralise &mdash; but those groups which had justifiable claims for additional resources and staffing would state that spending £40 million on education boards was not justified in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dropping the boards the Minister has eliminated matters which caused tension and discussion. Pruning the Bill of all provisions which were contentious or would have given rise to a bad press may be a mistake.  One example of this is the provision concerning boards of management.  His statement on this subject was vague, indicating that such boards could be appointed if the school so wanted.  As a result, boards of management will not be put in place in all schools because there are fears, legitimate or otherwise, that such <Col N="36" /> boards may not be appropriate for particular schools in the light of how they have been administered in the past.  Some schools would find it difficult to change to a board of management system. As we progress through the Bill we will see whether he incorporated all his amendments to the original Bill, but I doubt he has.</P>
    <P>We should begin at the beginning, and in the education process that is the primary sector.  If that service is delivered properly the education system as a whole will be good.  However, that is not so.  Why over the last decade have we slavishly copied many characteristics and ideas from other systems, particularly from our nearest neighbour, which have been of no benefit to us?  Emphasis has been placed on things other than basic education or the three Rs.  We are beginning to see the folly of our ways.  According to an OECD report we have the highest level of school leavers with poor competence in literacy and numeracy.  That is a serious problem which should be addressed as a matter of urgency. Every school, whether in an urban or a rural area, has children who cannot cope.  Their background may not be a factor but their ability to leave primary school and enter second level has been severely retarded by the lack of availability of basic learning.  I do not blame national school teachers because it is impossible for them to give personal, one to one attention in cases of great need in classes of 30 to 40 pupils.</P>
    <P>The three areas in which there is a great demand for change are pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, the provision of remedial and resource teachers where there is an established need and the provision of resources.  When I heard Deputy Michael D. Higgins talk about the environment for learning and hearing the wonderful sound of music being taught in the mornings, I felt it was a far cry from where I came and from what many Deputies witnessed in their schooldays.  That might be a pious notion for the future, but many teachers and pupils have had to work under very difficult conditions in the past. Thankfully there is now a programme in place, which I hope the Minister will continue, to provide adequate facilities, particularly for small schools which were totally unsuitable to educate children, especially during the cold winter months.  If those three areas were tackled at primary level we would have a very sound foundation on which to build a good education system. The fact that the system has survived without those changes is a credit to those at the coalface.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of months since I was elected to the House I have made representations on behalf of many school boards, principals, teachers and parents who have asked for the provision of resource teachers.  They are not being very demanding in those requests as they are willing to share teachers, to change children to other schools and to transport them in order to have access to that very important facility.  I am sure every Deputy has had that experience.  However, we have been told that a total reassessment of <Col N="37" /> this problem will take place in April or May for the coming school year.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge that and react positively to the great need which exists.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary for the Minister to add further to the burden at primary level by introducing the teaching of a continental language, as he recently announced?  It is a great idea, provided the basic fabrics are in place first.  However, to add another burden to an already overcrowded curriculum is unnecessary and unjustifiable.  Many primary teachers may not have the ability to teach a modern language adequately.  A previous speaker suggested that resources, such as tape recorders and audiovisual equipment, might be provided by some of the multinational companies.  However, we should not have to rely on the generosity of such companies, whose intentions may be questionable at times.</P>
    <P>It is far more important to home in on teaching the Irish language.  We all have a great commitment to Irish, but what does that commitment consist of?  I think it is very short lived.  The teaching of Irish in our schools is in crisis.  I have just come from the second level system where Irish is the most unpopular subject among the majority of pupils, who would investigate any available alternative rather than persist in learning Irish. That is very frustrating for those who are trying to teach Irish.  We must focus immediately on our native language and its place in our educational system, rather than abandoning it and increasing the burden of young people by making them learn another language.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to English is similar.  We can find ample evidence in our everyday work to show the rapid deterioration in the standard of written English.  Our examination system is a contributory factor, although not the sole factor.  In the new junior certificate examination structure students can get full marks for many questions by filling in a box or underlining a word.  That represents a total reneging on the idea of getting young people to express themselves in writing.  If we continue along those lines we will be at the top of the league of students who leave the education system with serious literacy and numeracy problems.</P>
    <P>We see constant references in the media to groups of parents complaining about the heavy bags of books which schoolchildren must carry on their backs, to which we will add with the introduction of new subjects.  There is also a great need for the Department to standardise education texts, within reason.  When book publishers present glossy books to schools they are engaging in profiteering as the educational content is often doubtful.  Teachers are pressurised by representatives of publishing companies who give them free copies of books to use on a trial basis, which will then be used in future years.  Three or four texts are often made available to teachers within the same year.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tackle seriously the problem of school transport, which I know is a <Col N="38" /> difficult task.  It may seem like heresy to some people to suggest that the day for CIE to deliver that service is long over.  I can see why the company was chosen to provide the service initially because the decision was taken rapidly and CIE had many buses available which were unsuitable for ordinary passenger transport.  However, it is now time to stop fudging the issue, with the Department blaming CIE and CIE blaming the Department.  The delivery of school transport is a total disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get involved in a debate on school transport but a point of which I was reminded towards the conclusion of Deputy Burke's speech related to school books.  For many years we have prided ourselves on having a system of free education but the Minister should consider an extension of the system in the form of a free books scheme for students.  I know such schemes exist but they should be extended on a universal basis to primary school children.  I strongly believe such a move would be popular with parents and would help the education of primary school children.  Whether the State would become involved in the type of exploitation to which parents are subjected and to which Deputy Burke referred would remain to be seen.</P>
      <P>I broadly welcome the legislation which is the first measure of general application to address the organisation of education since the State was founded.  The Stanley letter supplemented by various circulars regulated the primary sector.  There was legislation at the end of the 19th century dealing with intermediate and secondary legislation. In 1937 when the Constitution was enacted detailed provisions were included in relation to education.  I take it the Bill was framed in the light of those provisions.  I welcome the fact the Minister has modified the approach taken by his predecessor on this subject.</P>
      <P>I extend a particular welcome to the decision not to establish regional education boards.  This is a small State, even with a growing population in excess of three million.  There are many larger states which have a unified educational authority administering a population of that size.  I have always found the Minister and his officers helpful in dealing with representations.  I do not see why the system cannot be administered by a centralised Department as at present.  If we established this regional tier, we would add to the bureaucracy and complication of the system.  Far from establishing genuine devolution of power, parents, patrons and public representatives would make representations to the regional education authority in the first instance and then to the Minister.  We would have an addition to the existing ladder of access to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is refreshing to see a Department and Minister take responsibility for the system they administer. I have often deplored the tendency in recent years for Departments to shuffle off areas of business to bodies which are unaccountable to this House or anybody else.  Appointments are made <Col N="39" /> to the boards of these bodies over which public representative have little real influence.  By real influence, I do not mean improper influence to advance individual or personal cases but influence over the policy and direction of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Minister is accepting responsibility for the administration of the primary and secondary education systems and that he has abandoned the regional boards.  These regional boards would have contributed to an unnecessary escalation in the cost of the education system which would not have added to the level of teaching and instruction provided in schools.</P>
    <P>Another reason I welcome the abandonment of these boards is that our education system is in transition as it was in the 1980s, 1970s and 1960s. We had a clear demarcation in our education structure between the rights and responsibilities of the State, teachers and religious denominations until the 1960s.  Since the 1960s we have experienced a period of great change which has not settled down and the contours of our education system are not yet clear.  We need to provide time for further evolution before we embark on the type of radical measure proposed by the previous Minister.  This is a wise and well thought out measure and I welcome the Minister's decision to drop these regional education boards and retain overall responsibility for the system.  At the same time, the Minister has said he wants to foster diversity within the education system and establish a partnership at board of management level in schools.  A good balance has been struck in the legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the unusual phrase &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; in the definition section which was not in the previous legislation.  It does not relate to an alcoholic substance but to the characteristic spirit referred to in section 15(2)(b).  It shows our schools have developed in different ways and that they have characteristic ethos, although that phrase is considered a little old fashioned.  The Minister wants to conserve that spirit, which is what parents want.  We must respect the wishes of parents in this area.  There was no great demand by parents generally &mdash; I speak of parents as my constituents and not as parents organised in specific lobby groups &mdash; for an elaborate education structure such as that proposed by the previous Minister.  Various educational engineers, if I may call them that, called for such a structure. Parents want quality in education and a good service which is what this Bill is about.  On boards of management, the Minister made it clear the intention is to allow for some degree of flexibility in the evolution of these boards so that parental participation may take place in an ordered framework.</P>
    <P>This entire measure puts education on a statutory as well as constitutional foundation for the first time.  A matter which is not referred to in the Bill and which is important in growing suburban <Col N="40" /> areas is the provision of land for schools.  Local authorities have powers to acquire lands, on a compulsory acquisition basis, for the construction of roads, parks and social housing but the Minister for Education and Science has never had that power.  That is a problem when one looks at developments in suburban areas.  In the formulation of development plans local authorities often reserve lands for schools.  I would like it to be made an express obligation of the local authority and would like a provision where the Minister could acquire lands in exceptional circumstances because that would give him the power to negotiate the acquisition of lands and would mean he could not be held to ransom by developers in relation to the provision of a site for a school.</P>
    <P>A change I have seen in suburban areas in terms of the development of new schools is that there is a demand by parents for a diversity of school type.  Some parents wish to send their children to non or multi-denominational schools, to schools with a particular religious ethos, including Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland or other Protestant denominations or to gaelscoileanna.  This has created problems in relation to the acquisition of sites.  There is a case for the Minister to take powers to acquire sites for educational purposes. It would not be an unconstitutional power because it is predicated on the provision of adequate compensation.  It would mean the Minister could not be blackmailed because he does not have the power to acquire sites.  At present he must acquire land voluntarily.  That is an issue at which I would like the Minister to look on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the functions of the Minister and the objects of the Act in section 6. The primary function is set out in section 6(a) which states: &ldquo;to provide that, as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available, there is made available to people resident in the State a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of those people;&rdquo;.  I notice the crucial provisos of &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;having regard to the resources available&rdquo; have been included.  This matter was considered in the context of special education by the decision of the High Court in the case of O'Donoghue and the Minister for Education.  I understood there was an obligation on the Minister to provide free primary education. That is also the constitutional obligation of the Minister and yet its seems somewhat qualified in that phrase.  Are we safe proceeding in that way?</P>

Will he also bear in mind that pension and child benefit books must be produced well in advance of the year of issue and, therefore, work on generating those books must be done if not late this year at least early in <Col N="44" /> 1999?  Those issues need to be addressed and the House needs assurance that this huge proportion of our population who depend on weekly cheques from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will not be left waiting.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The Government at its meeting on 21 January 1998 appointed Deputy Frank Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, to be also Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and at the Department of Education and Science. <Col N="45" /> The allocation of responsibilities between Departments is not being amended.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will co-ordinate the activities of all these Departments in the child care area.  He will be supported in this task by a cross-departmental team of officials, who will report to him directly.  The Government yesterday made orders to delegate ministerial functions to the Minister of State at the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science.  These arrangements will expedite implementation of the Government's initiatives to address issues in this area.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the report discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, at her meeting with the UN committee at Geneva was submitted in April 1996.  It was Ireland's first report under the UN Rights of the Child Convention, ratified in September 1992.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that co-ordination of child policy is a key element in safeguarding children's rights in our society.  I am satisfied the new arrangements will ensure the efficient and effective delivery of services in the child care area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept the Government has been floundering on the issue of the protection of children, that it has been back-tracking and indecisive?  Will he accept he must bear responsibility for the failure of the Government to address this issue?  Will he accept responsibility for the fact that on day one the position of the Minister of State in charge of children was downgraded?  As a result of the decision in January, the position is the same as the previous status of junior Minister.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept there is a crisis in terms of the protection of children, that there are problems of duplication, lack of decision-making and lack of resources?  Will he accept this issue cannot be dealt with by a junior Minister who is not in a position to face up to the crisis that exists?  The Taoiseach said that 1,000 cases of child abuse are pending in the Eastern Health Board region alone.  Will he accept responsibility and do what a previous Taoiseach did in regard to the drugs crisis?  He took charge of it and dealt with it to good effect.  As leader of the Government, will the Taoiseach accept he must take charge of co-ordinating the various responsibilities within Departments rather than leave the work to a junior Minister who has neither the authority nor the resources to deal with the issue?</P>

      <P>In regard to co-ordination, responsibility for children is held, to some extent, by all Departments.  It is desirable that whoever is responsible for this brief &mdash;0 in this case the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children &mdash; has access to officials across Departments.  The three Departments mainly involved in this area deal with issues such as young offender facilities, availability of places, staffing, funding, child welfare, the Children Acts, the control of children and issues relating to the expert group on child care as well as the pilot child care initiative.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is involved in a range of issues across Departments and he has been doing his job very successfully in recent months.</P>
      <P>On the complaints from the UN, the report which dates back to 1994-6 states that while noting the establishment of various Government bodies responsible for the welfare of children at national and local levels, the committee regrets the lack of co-ordination among those bodies in promoting and protecting the rights of the child. In light of the views of the UN committee, we considered what could be done to ensure the Minister of State would have a better co-ordinating role.  The change made in January and the order signed yesterday subsequent to that change will help in that regard.  We will continue to reflect on what can be done in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is being briefed by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the recent issues in that area and is briefed on legislation from all Departments dealing with this issue.  That is his co-ordinating role.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the issues affecting children in this society are immense, however, I do not accept that they are in crisis.  The figures I mentioned yesterday, while rising, have been prevalent for years.  We must address these issues, including the resources and facilities to overcome the problems.  I am glad to say Governments are dealing with them in the best way they can but will never be good enough; as long as there is a problem Governments will not be good enough.  Nevertheless, there is a seriousness in addressing these issues which was not there in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State had a role in these areas but because he was not delegated Minister of State to the Departments in question that role was not as strong as it might otherwise have been.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, however, the criticism of the UN was based on that situation. Children's issues are covered in all Departments, as recent events illustrate.  It is undesirable that the Minister of State with responsibility for this area should be delegated orders in all Departments. However, he should have responsibility for the Children Acts and the School Attendance Acts when he is attempting to deal with the major problems, including children in crisis who are young offenders.  He must also have the capability to link with officials in relevant Departments. That can create difficulties, which is why the previous and other Ministers of State were not assigned to all Departments.  As far as possible, I would like to see the interdepartmental group have access to a Minister of State with responsibility for children.  I would also like to see him have responsibility for children's issues in so far as they relate to every Department.  That is what we are seeking to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that unlike the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, <Col N="48" /> Deputy Currie was appointed at the outset as Minister of State at the then Department of Justice, the then Department of Education and the then Department of Health?  Would he agree that at a time when it was recognised that it was a desirable development in Government that a single Minister be appointed to all three Departments and have a co-ordinating function in relation to children, it was a major error on his part not to give the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, that co-ordinating function at the outset?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach also agree that the child care system is in crisis because there has been no coherent policy at Government level for more than seven months and that the Government has been locked in paralysis?  In the context of the functions of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, who dealt with the Children Bill before Christmas which amended guardianship and custody laws, is he now advising that she no longer has responsibility in this area and that it has been taken over by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we based our changes to the co-ordinating role of Ministers of State at Departments on the Public Service Management Act, which is good legislation and which allows a Minister to have a co-ordinating role.  It also allows for the establishment of cross-departmental teams to support a Minister of State.  That is still desirable, otherwise it would be necessary to make the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, the Minister of State with responsibility for children at each Department.  I do not believe that is <Col N="49" /> necessary although it is desirable that he be Minister of State at the Departments which cover the main issues involved.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable activity across all of the issues involved in young offending and additional money has been allocated to the health boards to assist them in their work in this area. Money which was previously not provided has also been allocated to the disadvantaged areas to deal with children on the streets, sleeping rough and located in the various detention centres. These measure have been undertaken on the initiative of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>However, there are other issues involved.  We are taking note of the findings of the UN Convention, which make clear, for example, that the level of co-ordination in this area, even when it was across three Departments, was not sufficient.  We are trying to respond to them in the most holistic way possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will do this and if further delegate orders are necessary we will implement them.  At this stage, he has identified areas and responsibilities across various Acts and Departments where he believes he needs powers and we have given power to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that resources have been allocated, which is very worthwhile. However, will the Taoiseach repeat his statement on the critical situation that has arisen over a period?  He must understand and accept that people will be shocked to hear him say, in the great Fianna Fáil tradition, that there is no crisis.</P>
      <P>To load increased responsibilities unto a Minister of State who is not in a position to deliver on his functions because he is not a member of the Cabinet will not solve the problem.  Will the Taoiseach look at the needs that exist on the issue of co-ordination?  We have already had the shaming experience of the Government appearing before the UN committee and being subject to its damning report on the situation today &mdash; not last year, nor the year before.</P>
      <P>The responsibility lies with the Taoiseach to take a serious and over arching initiative across Departments.  He is the only person with the authority to make a real difference to the serious and critical problems which we must all recognise. If they are not even recognised by the Taoiseach we will never succeed in overcoming them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is more aware than I am of these problems.  I deal with them every day in my constituency and I spent much of my political life on the Eastern Health Board.  I do not need people who are less aware of these problems to remind me of them.  The UN report made some harsh points but in fairness to the Ministers, systems and agencies, it also made many positive comments.  The House should not belittle the excellent work done by the children's agencies or <Col N="50" /> the Ministers who dealt with this matter from 1992 until 1996.</P>
      <P>The report said further consideration of the co-ordination role was needed.  It made the point that almost every Department dealt with matters relating to children.  For example, children can be directly related to agriculture because they work on farms and they can also be related to fisheries because they go out on boats.  The report's point was that all these activities should be considered and that it was not good enough to deal only with the Children Acts, the School Attendance Acts and other legislation and ignore the other aspects.  The Government is endeavouring to cover all aspects. The Minister of State with responsibility for children can attend Cabinet meetings any time it is discussing an appropriate Bill or related issues. Incidentally, I have dealt with the delegation orders and other matters relating to children at Cabinet because I am interested in such matters.  I have endeavoured to work under the Public Service Management Act in terms of the necessary changes and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on one matter.  Unfortunately and regrettably, Ireland is at a point, which other countries reached, where events which happened up to 30 years ago are now coming to light.  That is good in so far as people who have lived with misery, fears, difficulties and emotional trauma throughout their lives are concerned. We must deal with these matters coming to the surface.  Most of the people involved in the cases to which I referred yesterday are no longer children.  They are now adults but these matters must be addressed.  The issue of the number of people sleeping rough must be resolved.  The problems of drug and alcohol addiction among young people must also be solved as must the issues of lack of accommodation and education. All these issues are important and every Minister, not just the Minister of State with responsibility for children, must address them.  I assure the House that the Government intends to do so.</P>

      <P>My name has been mentioned favourably in connection with my role as Minister of State with responsibility for children.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was appointed, will the Taoiseach explain why, in view of the favourable reputation I had in that office, the Deputy was not given the same job with delegated responsibilities in the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  The two pressing problems I was dealing with included issues dating back to 1908 in relation to the Children Bill and legislation relating to truancy to replace an Act of 1926.  Why was the Minister of State not given that job initially with delegated responsibility?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is correct that matters relating to children cover more than the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Why did the Taoiseach not follow the example of the previous Government which had a Cabinet committee on children's affairs?</P>

      <P>Why was that committee not continued?  Does the Government intend to re-establish it?  I pose these questions, not on a party political basis but because of the serious situation that exists which should be shared by the House. I am trying to be helpful to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and ensure that he receives extra responsibilities.  Has the Government considered the suggestion made when I was in office that an administrative arm should be supplied to the Minister of State?  This would involve an Assistant Secretary General with responsibilities not only in the Department of Health and Children but also in the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Co-ordination is the key to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-ordination is the key.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, continued to progress the same Bills and has the same responsibilities as Deputy Currie had when he was in office.  The Public Service Management Act was introduced to allow for the establishment of cross-departmental teams and to ensure that officials could answer directly to Ministers, thereby avoiding a position where a Minister was attached to three or four Departments, with different staff and offices.  The Deputy is aware that system does not work well.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Management Act was designed to avoid that type of position. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is responsible for, co-ordinates and chairs the cross-departmental group.  He can go anywhere in relation to children's issues.  Because of the criticism it was deemed more appropriate that direct responsibility be given to him.  Under the Public Service Management Bill he continues, with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, to be able to check children's issues anywhere. Regarding the departmental committee, I do not intend arguing about how often it did not meet as against how often it met.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, reports to the group I chair which looks at issues of marginalisation, social disadvantage and social exclusion.  That group deals with children also, and Deputy Fahey reports on the types of cases mentioned by Deputy Shatter.  The difficulties are not discussed in isolation; we discuss how, through the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Justice, these matters can be resolved.  That committee is doing a fine job.</P>

      <P>Given the scale of abuse emerging now and the scale of abuse in swimming, it seems likely that more and more cases will be reported.  Co-ordination at the highest level is essential, but I want to focus on resources.  Does the Taoiseach intend to ensure that there will be an emergency response to an emergency?  This situation is different because increased publicity and ongoing awareness will lead to more and more reports.  How will the Taoiseach provide resources for front line staff who will deal with those reports effectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that times are different. People are more confident now about coming forward with cases from the past.  We are obliged to investigate such cases, and more resources are required.  That is one reason the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, received part of the resources necessary so early in the new year.  He has received a substantial budget increase for a number of projects undertaken with Barnardo's and other organisations.  There is a lack of resources in the health boards but groups like Barnardo's can have some of their programmes funded by Deputy Fahey.  He has not been slow in reminding everyone of the costs of dealing with this issue, but at least a start has been made.  We are nowhere near resolving this problem; the figures have doubled in less than five years. However, when one examines the figures, it can be seen that quite an amount of cases are dropped as unfounded.  The figure I gave yesterday for overall abuse represents 40 per cent of cases reported, but that figure is still very high. We will have to make more resources available. We have begun this process and will continue it.</P>

      <P>I question the basis of the figures used yesterday by the Taoiseach.  I have not been able to substantiate them within the Eastern <Col N="55" /> Health Board region yesterday.  Perhaps he could clarify this matter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of Deputy Fahey's onerous and wide-ranging responsibilities.  I believe it is not possible for a Minister of State who straddles a number of Departments to do this job effectively.  It needs a senior Minister and I hope this will be accepted in future.  How does the Taoiseach expect Deputy Fahey to carry out his responsibilities properly given he has a staff of only ten?  What proposals does the Taoiseach have to increase that figure substantially to deal with the problem adequately?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of 40 per cent of all reported cases of child abuse being sexual abuse. There is clearly a major problem with regard to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse and neglect.  These are areas of major concern to those working in the social services, and the Taoiseach should consider broadening the terms of reference of the working group set up recently to investigate abuse.  Does the Taoiseach have any other proposals to tackle this growing problem?</P>

The categories were emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect.  The documents go on to categories of cases confirmed and under investigation, unconfirmed cases and unfounded cases.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.  The Government decided yesterday to appoint Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC, Chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, to investigate certain matters relating to the affairs of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, IASA, its Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs.</P>
      <P>In arriving at its decision, the Government took account of all the issues arising, including the concerns of victims, the desire for privacy of a number of victims and their families and the wider public policy issue of how best child sex abuse cases should be handled in such circumstances in future.</P>
      <P>Having weighed up all these issues, the Government took its course of action in the interest of the victims, children currently in swimming and children in sport generally and in order to secure a speedy inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Murphy has been asked to conduct his investigations in private and to report to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation by 10 March 1998.  Subject to the need to preserve the confidentiality of victims, his findings will be made public.  The matters which Dr. Murphy has been asked to report on are the following: the arrangements which the IASA, the Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs, had in place since 1975 for the detection and prevention of child sexual abuse; the procedures, including functional responsibilities, which the IASA, the Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs had in place for securing compliance with these arrangements; the manner in which complaints in relation to sexual abuse made to the IASA, the Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs were dealt with over that period; the manner in which any complaints in relation to two named coaches reported to the IASA, their Leinster branch or affiliated clubs, were handled by them over that period; the arrangements which the IASA, all their provincial branches and affiliated clubs now have in place to detect and prevent child sexual abuse, <Col N="57" /> including arrangements while complaints are being investigated, and sanctions; and the adequacy of arrangements now in place for the protection of children in swimming.</P>
    <P>A code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland, developed by a specially established expert committee under the auspices of the Department of Education was published in June 1996 and issued to all the governing bodies of sport.  The code provides detailed guidelines and assistance for sports organisations in the proper treatment of children in sport.  The National Coaching and Training Centre, having specific regard to the code, subsequently incorporated a module on ethics in sport in its ongoing national coaching development programme, which is run in partnership with the governing bodies.</P>
    <P>It is planned to hold a seminar later this year involving the governing bodies which will include a review of their experience to date with the implementation of the code.  In the interim, while the code of ethics is widely regarded as a model of best practice for the protection of children in sport, I propose to reconvene the expert group who compiled the code to consider the report of Dr. Murphy's investigation in the context of the need for any further additions to the code following his findings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated last Thursday that he would set up a limited inquiry into this matter.  Government sources subsequently stated there would be a judicial inquiry into the matter and on Tuesday last the Minister reversed that decision.  This has hurt the victims and their families.  In view of the Minister's confusion in recent days, does he agree that neither he nor his Department are equipped with the skills and experience to deal with such a serious and sensitive issue?  Does he agree the matter would be more appropriate to the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Many of the families involved indicated their displeasure at yesterday's announcement.  Does the Minister agree the inquiry is flawed given that it cannot compel witnesses to attend or requisition documents?  To add insult to injury he appointed a member of the IASA, a member of a swimming club and a man known personally to many of the people involved in this issue.  Does he agree this casts grave doubts over the effectiveness of the investigation?  Will he reconsider the announcement he made yesterday given that he reneged on the solemn commitment he gave in a press statement last Thursday to consult the families before the appointment of a chairman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a number of matters and based much of his argument on the question of compellability.  There is every indication I will get full co-operation with the inquiry I originally intended to set up.  Who are we trying to compel?  I have no difficulty compelling people.  I have been told all documents will be <Col N="58" /> produced.  Are we trying to compel the people who came to me believing, as newspapers reported at the weekend, that suddenly there was going to be a judicial inquiry and they felt they would be compelled to attend?  The only people that will be compelled to attend are the victims who want the matter dealt with in private and in confidence.  The indications are that there will be full co-operation with the inquiry and that all documents will be presented.  I am prepared to go along with that.</P>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not casting aspersions on Dr. Murphy.  Surely a person who has experience in the sport of swimming would be beneficial to the inquiry rather than a person from the Law Library with no experience in the matter.  I hope the Deputy agrees that the appointment of Dr. Murphy, a man who is beyond reproach and chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, is the best person to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>I met the victims and representatives of the IASA last week.  An inquiry is necessary in the interests of the children participating in the sport today.  There are 5,000 children involved in the sport and 1,500 coaches, 99 per cent of whom are beyond reproach.  I want to ensure the children participating in swimming and coaching on a daily basis are safe.  I would agree to a veto of the chairperson, but unfortunately the victims rejected my proposals out of hand.  Consequently, the Government proceeded yesterday with a private independent inquiry, the terms of reference of which were broadened to make the Government responsible for the person conducting the inquiry.  There is not any confusion about the matter.  The only people left to compel are those who want to attend in private and in confidence to get to the truth.</P>

      <P>I am not sure the Minister understands the complexities of this matter.  Initially he flagged up the possibility of a judicial inquiry.  We had meetings with parents and victims yesterday who told us they will not co-operate with the inquiry.  If those who were abused do not co-operate, what is the purpose of the inquiry?  They were also under the impression that the Minister would consult them about the chairmanship and terms of reference of the committee.  Such consultation did not take place.  Irrespective of the position he held, why did the Minister suggest a chairman whom he knows has a vested interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider Dr. Murphy, who was a chairman of a swimming club at a time when sex abuse was reported, should be appointed to this position?  If the inquiry is to be independent, does the Minister consider it wise to appoint a person without first consulting the <Col N="59" /> people concerned?  The Minister should answer that important question because from our information the people concerned do not intend to co-operate with an inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. Murphy.  It was unfair to name him before consulting the parents and victims.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a publicly funded association that should be responsible to the Minister and to the Oireachtas for the way it carries out its business.  Is it true that notices were brought to the attention of people in positions of influence in those clubs but they took no action or took internal action but did not follow it through?  That is the information we are getting.  The committee which I chair will set up a procedure which I hope will deal with some of these cases so that we can reassure parents that their children will be safe in participating in sporting activities.  I am sure that is what the Minister wants.  We should come clean with the parents and the victims on how we intend to proceed with this matter because they expected something more specific from the Minister in terms of protection.  I do not want to compel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a sensitive issue and the Government and I are trying to deal with it in the best interests of the parents and victims.  Yesterday I was doing a balancing act to try to get everybody involved.  There are two sides to this matter.  There are those who say they will not co-operate with me and those who want to come forward but in confidence and in private. I am trying to include them all and I ask them to co-operate with me.  Given that people can come in private and in confidence I have more than I would have had under the terms of a public <Col N="60" /> judicial inquiry.  They all have a story to tell.

      <P>I have no desire to take legal action.  I do not want press coverage.  I want you to know and discover the facts as they are.  I have no idea how extensive was the abuse meted out to children and youths or how many swimming clubs were involved.  I am pleading with you as my Minister for Sport to hold a judicial inquiry and to investigate the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.</P>
      <P>Please make it possible to encourage every victim to come forward now and give evidence. The extent of this cancer must be discovered.</P>
      <P>I am trying to get every victim to come forward. I say to victims and those who are asking for a full judicial inquiry that in that scenario I cannot get every victim to come forward in my attempt to get to the truth.  In the interests of the families and victims the Government has proceeded along this course.  In the long term there is every indication I will get co-operation.</P>
      <P>As late as this morning a meeting was arranged, through the Taoiseach, at which the Attorney General met the legal representatives of the victims and had a discussion on this matter. I encourage all those involved to come forward and to co-operate with this inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the extract quoted by the Minister &mdash; I could read four or five letters also &mdash; sought a judicial inquiry and in view of the veil of secrecy that has covered so many inquiries in the past will the Minister consider an inquiry that would compel witnesses but preserve the identity of the victims and their families?  That could be achieved if there was flexibility and a willingness to co-operate with the victims.  In view of the opinions given by the families yesterday and today will the Minister reconsider his position?</P>

      <P>As regards the compellability of witnesses, the witnesses are the only people who would be compelled.  I am asking for the co-operation of all concerned.  If the people who previously called for an open judicial inquiry realised what they would get into, they would have a rethink.  We have to get to the truth.  There is a public policy issue here.  If one were to take a case such as this, it is conceivable that we could have a judicial inquiry into every club, organisation and community group into every situation where the <Col N="61" /> courts have not come forward with the answers. The State has not been negligent in this case.  This is different from other areas.  The courts have acted and a man has been sentenced.  As a result of that man's actions the State has realised those victims require help and counselling.  A number of questions remain unanswered.  That is what we are trying to get as a result of the court case.  If we had co-operation from all sides we could get those answers.</P>

      <P>While all of us want to ensure the Minister's efforts have the fullest co-operation, the information coming to us is that the people we want to assist do not want to participate in the procedure set down.  Will the Minister agree that the newspapers intimated that the Minister had said he would consult the families and agree the terms of reference?  I have no problem with the chair but given that he was so closely involved with swimming, being chairman of a particular swimming club, will the Minister agree he put him in an invidious position because of a possible conflict of interest?  The Minister should have cleared his name both with himself and with those whom he is trying to assist.  Will the Minister agree that the people we are trying to investigate were publicly funded?  The State is not negligent.  We gave funds to people who turned out to be negligent in pursuing cases that were brought to their attention.</P>

      <P>I have already informed the Deputy I am continuing, as late as this morning, to have dialogue with the legal represesentatives of the victims.  I would encourage that and I am grateful they agreed to come and have dialogue with the Attorney General on the terms and any questions they may have.  I want to continue to meet these people.  The Government and I respect the wishes of the victims.  If I take one route I am excluding the other.  For a start, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, this is the best initial way to proceed with this very complicated problem. If we can get the co-operation of the parents we will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of opinion but it is of benefit to the inquiry to have an independent senior counsel with a knowledge of the sport of swimming and its structures.  We should not pre-empt Dr. Murphy's findings, we should give him a chance.  The question of whether the inquiry should be established by the Department of Health and Children was raised.  I am responsible for this matter and must ensure the 5,000 children who enter the pool at 5 a.m. each morning are safe.  There are 1,500 <Col N="62" /> coaches who are under a cloud.  Many of them work on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was unfair to Dr. Murphy.  I do not want the issue to be clouded in any way. Dr. Murphy is an outstanding gentleman.  I met him for the first time recently and he has an excellent reputation and a deep interest in swimming.  Given his experience, I am sure we will find the answers that the court was unable to find.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the most effective way to protect children in sport is to ensure full implementation of the code of practice published in l996?  Will he agree that unless the full report &mdash; not an edited version &mdash; containing Dr. Murphy's findings is published the cloud of uncertainty will remain?  How does he intend to ensure the people who may be guilty of abuse are brought before the inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>An inquiry was initiated but it fell on the change of Government.  A pro-active approach has been adopted.  Before this matter blew up a workshop had been organised in Limerick for next October and the code of ethics had been issued to all national governing bodies of sport.  This indicates that the Department has not been reactionary in dealing with this matter.  The report will be made public taking account of the need to respect confidentiality.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the new tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent Management Board for Product Development and conducted in full compliance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC concerning co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September l997.  It was published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intention to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was 5 p.m. on Monday, 2 February.  Bord Fáilte received full tender submissions from five consortia and has now commenced its assessment of these submissions.  Bord Fáilte and the Management Board for Product Development have estimated that it will be late March before their deliberations will be completed.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Operational Programme for Tourism, the agreement of the Government and the European Commission, on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law, will be required in respect of the final selection made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This whole issue is now in its tenth year and I am quite confident that the procedures in place will bring this much needed conference centre to the country.  I am sure the Deputy has the same view as I have on that.  This whole area is vital to the expansion of tourism <Col N="64" /> and to maintaining the incentive for businesses to set up in this country.  We should all strive to make sure that nothing unhitches the plan we now have in place.  I ask for co-operation from all those involved in this area.  Regardless of where this conference centre is built, and it has to be Dublin, it will not only benefit that area but every area in the country.  I do not want this project derailed now by objections from one area or another.  I want it to come to fruition because we have striven in every way possible to ensure this project is in accordance with European Commission rules.  To answer the Deputy, the project is more on the rails now than it ever was before.</P>

The tender documents are currently being studied and it is hoped a decision will be made by the end of March.  With a project of this magnitude there is a period in which a cost benefit analysis is done.  That will take approximately four to six weeks which means we are talking about April.  I am trying to give Deputy Allen as much information as I can.  I hope this matter will be sorted out by May or June this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 34, 51 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department provided funding to 75 national governing bodies to assist them in the development of their sport, including the critical element of providing a safe, secure and positive environment for children.  The Department is currently awaiting receipt of their applications for financial assistance towards the cost of activities planned for the coming year.</P>
      <P>A Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland, developed by a specially established expert committee under the auspices of the Department of Education, was published in June 1996 and issued to all the governing bodies of sport.  The code provides detailed guidelines and assistance for sports organisations in the proper treatment of children in sport.</P>
      <P>The National Coaching and Training Centre, having specific regard to the code, subsequently incorporated a module on ethics in sport in its ongoing national coaching development programme which is run in partnership with the governing bodies.</P>
      <P>It is planned to hold a seminar later this year involving the governing bodies which will include a review of their experience to date with the implementation of the code.  In the interim, while the code of ethics is widely regarded as a model of best practice for the protection of children in sport, I propose to reconvene the expert group which compiled the code to consider the need for further additions to the code in the light of the report of Dr. Roderick Murphy into child sex abuse issues in swimming.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I welcome the Minister's decision to reconvene the expert group set up by me in 1996 which brought forward an excellent set of guidelines.  In the past few days the IASA <Col N="66" /> announced that it was appointing a children's liaison officer.  The announcement of that appointment indicated that the IASA had not adhered to the code of ethics and good practice.  For the sake not only of the children but the thousands of volunteers giving so much of their time to sport and recreation, who are now very fearful because of recent events, I ask the Minister to carry out a comprehensive survey of all the national governing bodies to ensure all aspects of the code of ethics and good practice are being implemented. Will the Minister consider offering incentives to groups that are vigilant in implementing the code and the question of withdrawing funding from groups found not to be implementing the code in an effective way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take on board the Deputy's views.  Offering incentives is one way of addressing the problem, reducing the funding is another. I agree with the Deputy that we rely heavily on volunteers to run our sporting organisations which would not exist without these honest people voluntarily giving their time.  When one considers the number of people involved in sport, I am sure 99.9 per cent of those are honest, hardworking and above board.  It is such a pity that they should come under a cloud of suspicion as a result of these horrific events.</P>
      <P>In regard to the appointment of a children's liaison officer by the IASA, I asked the swimming association to set up an inquiry to ensure that the children in sport are protected.  I am waiting for the swimming association to come forward with that report so that I can be assured it is implementing the code of ethics that has been published.  Before funding will be restored I asked it to assure me that a strategy will be put in place to ensure this will not happen again and to prepare a report on this.  My answer to the Deputy's question on whether I will investigate all NGOs should be given on auto-pilot at this stage because of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  All NGOs should carefully examine their organisations to ascertain how the code of ethics for the safety of children involved in sport is being implemented.  That is vital and, given the high profile publicity this case has attracted, I am sure they are doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's views that it is essential to protect all those involved in sport on a voluntary basis.  Will the Minister support a procedure to assist in that, which I suggested to my committee?  It would involve consulting various federations on how such codes of ethics operate and how effectively they have been implemented to ensure we achieve our objective, a better environment for everyone.  The public are demanding that of us.  The procedure would <Col N="67" /> involve bringing in representatives of the Sports Council &mdash; the main body in this area which has a role to play in the implementation of a code of ethics &mdash; to discuss the matter with it.  In that way the public would know we are taking an interest to ensure that all sporting associations, not only those involved in swimming, follow the code of ethics outlined by Deputy Allen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>I am sure the Sports Council would be only too willing to co-operate with the Deputy's committee in any way possible.  It would then be a matter for the committee as to how it should proceed.  The Deputy could make his views known to the Sports Council, which is an active body and I am sure it would be happy to implement any proposals put to it by that committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28, 30, 35, 41, 46, 47, 60, 74 and 128 together. The sports capital programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sport and recreational facilities in Ireland and comprises the major facilities and the recreational facilities schemes.  The major facilities scheme is a capital programme for major sports facilities and the recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary and community organisations in providing, improving and equipping recreational, leisure and community facilities.</P>
      <P>There is a provision of £9 million in this year's Estimates for my Department for grant expenditure under the capital programme compared with the £5 million provided in 1997.  At the end of 1997 overall capital commitments outstanding under the sports capital programme amounted to £15.7 million to be met in 1998 and subsequent years on satisfactory completion of projects in accordance with current terms and conditions of the programme.  In addition, there were some 1,100 grant applications on hand at the end of 1997 on which a decision, even regarding matters such as eligibility had not yet been given, some dating back as early as 1994.  Against that background I considered it a priority to have completed an examination of all applications currently on hand, including those received up to 5 p.m. today, to be considered in the context of the 1998 round of allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the assessment and allocation of funding to existing applications under the programme has been completed, I have asked my Department to <Col N="69" /> also initiate a comprehensive review of the operation of the sports capital programme.  That review will be undertaken in the context of the formulation of policy for sport and recreation, in line with the commitments in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, including the proposed establishment of a statutory Sports Council.  It will involve examination of the objectives, terms of reference and criteria for the scheme and will have regard to the emphasis in the Action Programme for the Millennium on the role of sport and recreation in combating disadvantage. I expect the review to be completed later this year and when it is details of revised schemes will be widely publicised.  It will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new schemes.  The arrangements for the new schemes will have regard to the Government's commitment to provide a quality customer service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is a sense of panic among those at grassroots level in many organisations throughout the country at his announcement that he was putting a moratorium on grant applications?  Will he give an assurance in the context of the national strategy for sport published in February 1997, which I am glad the Minister is pursuing because it is an apolitical document on which all parties were consulted, that the strong spirit of volunteerism in sport will be reflected in any new arrangement he puts in place?  Will he fulfil his promise to allocate a greater percentage of national lottery funding to sport and that the allocation of those moneys will reflect the great volunteer movement in sport and recreation?  Will he ensure there will not be too much of an obsession with grandiose projects which may give great credit to the Minister to ensure there will be no risk to the spirit and great efforts of people doing real work at grassroots level whether in parishes, teams or local communities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the Deputy that is exactly what I am trying to do.  However, in May 1997 the Deputy when Minister of State threw out taxpayers' money like snuff at a wake, which turned out to be exactly that because it did not result in his party being returned to office.  A total of 515 projects were sanctioned this year at a cost of £8.963 million.  Latest figures indicate there are more than 1,200 projects in the pipeline in addition to £16 million in respect of commitments given which I am legally bound to honour if they fall due.  While an allocation of £5 million in this area was given in l997, I secured an allocation of £9 million in 1998.  I could promise £10 million in respect of commitments, but what would be the point?  I am trying to introduce some organisation to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We faced a number of problems as some of the schemes date back to 1988.  Local community groups approached their TDs, Senators and public representatives and worked hard to <Col N="70" /> secure grants, but many of those clubs and small organisations rested on their laurels because many applications, some dating back to 1994, did not proceed.  They appear to have postponed projects until April, October or the following year.  Having raised a certain amount of money in their local community for a specific project, they then submitted an application to the Department for X amount of money and were handed out amounts of £5,000 or £10,000 here or there which was not of much value to them.  One could give everybody some funds but no projects will be completed.  We are better off to try to have as many projects in as many areas as possible come to fruition.  That is the basis on which we are trying to work at present.  There are over 1,200 applications under the old scheme and £16 million worth of commitments.  I am trying to bring some cohesive strategy to the future of the national lottery scheme.</P>
    <P>There is no need for anyone to panic.  Applications can still be made and they will be treated in the same manner.  New applications after this date will be subject to different criteria in order to aid the cohesiveness of the scheme and to benefit sport properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the allocations made in the past were of great benefit to smaller clubs in particular. Some of the bigger clubs were disappointed because they did not get enough.  I have tabled questions which deal with some of the points the Minister has raised.  Will the applications from last year which are left over, so to speak, and to which no funds are committed, including up to today, get an allocation in this year?  Will applications from then on be subject to the new criteria?  Applications for some of the schemes which the Minister has identified were allocated funds but they were not drawn down for various reasons.  Will there be a review of those applications?  There is no point in having funds which have been committed but are unused.  The Minister is aware of some of the projects involved.</P>

They were dealt with strictly in accordance with the guidelines of the Department and were sanctioned by the Department of Finance.  In contrast with the £15 million which the Minister quoted, I inherited an overrun of £10.9 million in that scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to 1988 when most of those decisions would have been made by people from his party.  In the context of the guidelines set out by the Sports Council about the need to fund at national, regional and local level, how can the Minister justify placing a moratorium on the plans of so many groups, having given in one fell swoop a £20 million handout, albeit to a credible organisation for a credible purpose?  How can he justify giving £20 million in one decision and putting in doubt the hopes of clubs at local and regional levels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what we are talking about.  The newspapers have been full of that case, asking why we did not give money to smaller organisations.  There is up to £18 million in the pipeline for those organisations waiting to be used.  It is not our fault that they have not been able to take it up.  We have made the commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not panic.  There is a long lead in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not panicking.  I do not wish to cause panic among these clubs.  A club which makes an application must get the work on its project under way within a certain period, whether that is six months or a year.  There will <Col N="72" /> have to be a sunset clause, so to speak.  We cannot have a situation whereby applications remain in the pipeline for an open-ended period.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we will instil urgency in people to get projects under way.  They will have their own funds in place and they will receive a decent amount from the national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>I hope to be able to fulfil a large number of commitments that have been made.  The Deputy made an excuse about inheriting a certain situation but the general perception was reflected in the result of the June election.  However, a real effort will be made to give money to clubs which are up and running and which have a real interest in getting their community projects under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has identified types of projects with which we are all familiar, where a club may have been granted only a fraction of the amount it sought and the shortfall removes the club's capacity to carry out a project.  It appears there are many outstanding commitments for amounts which will not lead to the completion of projects.  What does the Minister intend to do, knowing the original amounts sought and knowing that small amounts have been committed which are insufficient to see the projects finished?  Will those sums lie there indefinitely?  The shortfall means the project cannot proceed as intended.  The money sits frozen indefinitely. What does the Minister intend to do to free up the funds?  The clubs should be allocated the balance as a first priority to get the projects out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is relevant.  I hope such a situation will not arise in future.  I agree it has been a problem with allocations in the past and that is why there are £16 million and 1,200 applications waiting.  It is a matter I hope we can discuss in the House at some point.  I could use all of this year's allocation on such projects, ignoring allocations for years to come.  It is an invidious situation to be in.  We are trying to address the issue and to establish criteria to prevent it recurring.  It is a difficult matter that deserves further debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister.  It is long overdue.  It will be the first substantive legislation introduced by a Minister in the 20th century on first and second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the publication of the revised version of the Education Bill, I will refer to the reasons for its revision.  The previous Minister for Education lost her seat at the last general election. The policies pursued in the Department of Education in recent years and the perception of the way the Labour Party ran the Department <Col N="74" /> contributed to that party's downfall at the last election.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill needed revision.  The current Minister has returned to the culture of the Department and the Minister listening to the people instead of dictating to them.  People resented the dictatorial attitudes of the last Labour Minister in the Department.  They resented the high-handed manner of her decision making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair.  She cannot defend herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Education Bill proposed structures which were costly and unnecessary. It sought to undermine the traditional structure of our education system.  The Universities Bill, as initiated, was regarded as dictatorship by the universities and the schools.  It set out to erode their ethos.  I supported the right to recognition as an institute of technology of the college in Waterford.  It was its due.  Unfortunately, it was an act of blatant political opportunism, and it backfired.  It annoyed people in other deserving areas in the education sector which also deserved institute of technology status.  I have in mind Cork Regional Technical College and the other colleges whose standards of excellence have recently been recognised by the Minister.  I commend him on his actions in this matter.  It was left to Fianna Fáil to deliver for Cork and the other colleges when the Labour brass band ran out of music.</P>
      <P>Their implementation of programmes on relationships and sex education was done in a manner resented by many parents and teachers. Complete disregard was shown for those people's rights to information on what teachers were presenting to their children.  All that was needed was consultation.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle programme was a farce in my constituency.  The outrageous and deliberate refusal of the last Government to provide Breaking the Cycle teachers to some of the schools in the north-west of Cork city in my constituency was the single greatest cause of anti-Government feeling at the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Deputy do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the reasons I am here today.  Parents, teachers and university lecturers were out to teach a lesson to the Labour Party and their colleagues in Government.  They lost several seats, including the former Minister's seat in Dun Laoghaire and one in Cork.  Incidentally, following the appointment of Deputy Martin as Minister for Education and Science, Knocknaheeny and Churchfield schools were granted their extra teachers, within three months of my election to Dáil Éireann.  My constituents were not let down by Fianna Fáil or by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Education Bill sets out to provide a legislative framework to replace the <i>ad hoc</i> Administration we have had since the State was <Col N="75" /> founded.  Deputies will notice that in the list of Acts referred to in this Bill, there is reference to only one Education Act, dating from 1930 and dealing with vocational education only.  We have had Government by decree and circular letter in the area of education for 75 years.  It cannot go on like this.</P>
    <P>However, we do not need to spend a fortune on a raft of educational quangos and boards for the appointment of vested interests, cronies and administrators in order to administer education. Fianna Fáil promised to put a stop to the last Government's plans for regional education boards.  This Bill fulfils that promise.  It is the policy of this Government to put money into teachers and equipment.  It will not waste it on unnecessary paperwork and ideology.  The education system has needed a major update for far too long.  Education patterns and needs are changing daily and at a rate never before experienced.</P>
    <P>The Bill's intent to clarify the rights of students, parents and school staff will address a problem that has sorely needed attention for a long time.  Education must keep step with today's technology and tomorrow's needs.  We need to protect our managers and our teaching staff in their decisions.  We must also give the students and their parents the right to question decisions made by management.  I have always felt it unfair that students have had no right of appeal against board of management decisions.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has seen fit to disagree with the concept of introducing an intermediate education tier.  If there is one thing we do not need, it is another layer of bureaucracy in the system. We need to speed up meaningful change, not to establish additional boards to debate the need for change.  Any additional bodies should be set up after we have introduced the changes envisaged in this Bill &mdash; they should be formed as a result of experience gained from the operation of the new system, and they should be local and not national bodies.</P>
    <P>It is right that the Minister has put emphasis on the element of partnership in the setting up of the boards of management.  The element of compulsion in the previous Education Bill ran totally contrary to all current thinking in this and all other fields.</P>
    <P>Schools will be expected to promote the Irish language and culture under the new Bill.  This is a very positive step to promote the use of our native tongue and to ensure the realisation of our policy in regard to our national culture.  The amazing growth in the number of gaelscoileanna is proof positive of the demand for such an enlightened approach.  The Irish language is an essential part of our culture and tradition.  A minority dismiss the language as irrelevant, but in general there is widespread affection for it. The Irish language is basic to our personal development.  It is our heritage and we must cherish it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> I am glad to see the provisions to protect the integrity of our examination structures.  The adverse publicity in this area over a number of years has caused considerable disquiet to students, parents and teachers.  The right to appeal against expulsion from an educational establishment is built into this Bill.  Every person in this democracy has the right to be advised why decisions are made which will have a major effect on their schooling and their future careers.  Individuals will have to pay the price of expulsion from schools for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The role of the patron, whether religious or secular, has been an important one since the early days of the Irish education system and it is right that it is protected.  In this context tribute should be paid to the role of religious orders in providing education.  Many people would never have had the advantage of secondary education if the religious orders had not been there to provide it, and those who could not afford to do so were never asked to pay a fee.  Many who talk today about the privileged position of religious orders in education would be slow to respond if they themselves were asked to provide the same high standards within the limited resources available to the parents of most pupils.  Our religious orders deserve the gratitude of this nation.</P>
    <P>This Bill guarantees the rights of parents to membership of boards.  This involvement is vital to the successful implementation of the aims of this far-reaching legislation.  Parents will now have access to records of their children's progress. They will also be involved in the formation of the school plan, and they must be kept advised of the performance of the school.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the central role played by teachers in the education system.  They have prepared our country for its participation in the present economic boom by ensuring pupils of exceptionally high educational standards are ready and willing to take their places in today's workforce.  The teacher is now entitled to consultation on procedures for the appointment of teachers, the preparation of school plans and the operation of appeals procedures.  The role of the principal is clearly outlined and given just recognition in the new Bill.  We have been lucky with the calibre and commitment of the principals we have had in our school system since the foundation of the State.  It is right that their outstanding contribution is recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the legislation contains practical provisions which have as their objective the elimination of educational disadvantage.  The achievement of that goal is a vital priority.  The establishment of a special education review committee, set up by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, during her time as Minister for Education, focused attention on children with special educational needs.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke of students who experience educational disadvantage &mdash; there is particular need to supply additional remedial services to our schools because those who enter <Col N="77" /> mainstream education do not get the help they should.  Many schools do not get adequate services for remedial teaching.  I know of one case where one-to-one tuition requested by parents was not made available and another where parents were refused the use of departmental aids such as instructional computer disks, which they wanted in order to help their children at home. There must be a rethink in these areas.</P>
    <P>Parents who put children in need of remedial instruction into mainstream education deserve a first class back-up service.  I have seen the progress of children who have benefited from remedial teaching and one-to-one tuition, and the happiness of their parents.  I admire the personnel who work in this field and I have profound respect for teachers and staff support who care for disadvantaged children and adults.</P>
    <P>I give unstinting praise to the Minister for his initiative in making physical education an examination subject.  It was a shining example of his innovative thinking &mdash; he identified a need and acted accordingly.  It would be beneficial to the national community if the use of school gymnasia and sporting facilities was actively promoted and encouraged by his Department.  I congratulate the Minister on the originality and wide-ranging scope of the Bill, which will be welcomed by those who have sought positive change in education for many years.  It is a breath of fresh air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm faoin seans chun labhairt ar an mBille seo.  The context of this Bill, wide-ranging though it may be, is an attempt to respond to many matters outside the strict remit of the Minister for Education and Science.  We must appreciate the difficulty of this job but we must also give the necessary pointers so that other Departments will be cognisant of the effects of their work &mdash; or lack of work &mdash; for which the Minister must pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>Our society faces a number of trends which have a direct impact on education and relate to parents as much as to schooling.  One example is the trend towards longer working hours, which does not affect TDs alone.  The onset of 24 hour shopping has a significant impact on parents raising children and a consequent effect on the children's education.  A UK study during the 1980s, which has parallels here, showed that people in executive jobs, who would be considered quite well paid have to work 20 per cent more time than previously.  The growing gap between rich and poor is acknowledged by all economic commentators, although they may disagree as to its extent.  That impacts directly on children more than on any other sector of society.</P>
      <P>Another factor, which is also relevant to transport matters, is that children are less independent in travelling to and from school.  Fewer children walk or cycle to school and they are more reliant on their parents and guardians finding means of transport to bring them to and from school.  The independence of children is being whittled away due to factors which are not part of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> There has also been an increase in school absenteeism &mdash; days lost to sickness, etc. &mdash; which is becoming more widespread in society.  I could not find an Irish study on this subject but a British study found that the average number of days lost per person due to sickness was 8.8 days in 1962, which had risen to 12.2 days in 1988.  This trend is continuing.  Health levels are relevant to education.</P>
    <P>With the onset of the Amsterdam Treaty, the merits of the free market are often discussed. One must also consider the negative impact which the convergence of salaries at a low level has on children and consequently on education. Food quality has been discussed in this House and that is also a factor in the education and welfare of children.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind the effect on education of the level of advertising in society. Between 1950 and 1986 the budget for advertising increased five fold and that trend is continuing. We talk of education as a life enhancing experience but, advertising also reaches into our schools and in some curricular activities sets the agenda because of the incentives it provides for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>Against that background I will comment on the Bill, because its various parts stand out from each other.  The explanatory and financial memorandum states that the Bill contains a provision for &ldquo;the recognition of schools for the purposes of funding by public funds&rdquo;.  That is an issue unto itself, but the role of the home and parents in education should be taken into account in this provision.  The Minister should be aware of a 12 year study undertaken into 49 schools in Britain. There may or may not be direct comparisons with Ireland, and the position may be more pronounced in Britain, nonetheless we should take note of it.  The study notes a lowering of educational levels generally, for instance in literacy and numeracy.  Mr. Mike Lake, an educational psychologist, measured the performance of children aged seven to eight and detected after 1986 a distinct deterioration in their reading ability.  He ascribes this to a lack of general knowledge, which appears to become more impoverished at that point.  He further attributes this to a lack of discussion time at home, of interaction between parents and children and of linguistic development. Schools take this for granted when children arrive from the home but the Department should be more deliberate in recognising and assisting parents to provide the foundation which is so essential for the full education of the child and the person.</P>
    <P>Section 6 has as one of its objectives that an appropriate level and quality of education is made available to each person in the State.  That is an aspiration because no one would claim it is happening.  Gaelscoileanna in particular lack texts and resources and this puts them at a disadvantage, although they tend to make up for this with a better pupil-teacher ratio and all credit to them for that.  There is also a related reference to <Col N="79" /> extending bilingualism in society.  We must be very careful in how we go about that because a recent <i>Irish Times</i> report indicated that, while the Gaeltacht was becoming more bilingual, the prominence of Irish was deteriorating extremely quickly, which is probably related to the bilingual factor.  We must examine how other Departments can help in that regard, such as by producing forms in both languages.</P>
    <P>Section 10 refers to the recognition of schools, which is a prerequisite for funding under section 12(3).  This refers to the capitation fees, which brings to mind a very painful experience in my constituency where the numbers in a very disadvantaged school have decreased because the demographic profile of the housing estate concerned means that most of the children are now teenagers.  The Minister is well aware of that school, Toberburr national school, in St. Margaret's in north County Dublin.  However, the school still has the same overheads in terms of heating, insurance and other needs.  It is effectively being starved of the necessary capitation fees because its numbers have decreased, but it still must stay open to cater for the remaining children.  It needs £15,000 to clear debts and pay pressing bills.  The annual funding it receives from the Department and the parish amounts to £5,300, with a running cost of £11,000 to £12,000.</P>
    <P>There is a definite need to re-examine how we measure the basic funding of primary education, which is where the foundation stones are laid. When other factors such as the widening gap between rich and poor kick in, such communities are left to fend for themselves without the capacity to so do.  The Minister must deal with that in co-operation with the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust I will never experience that again and I take the Minister's word on the matter. However, the Bill must stress that commitment in stronger terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Section 12 refers to the criteria which &ldquo;may&rdquo; allow for additional funding.  I know from schools such as Toberburr and St. Teresa's in Balbriggan, which has also been looking for disadvantaged status for many years, and schools which teach children with disabilities, that the commitment which &ldquo;may allow for additional funding&rdquo; is not the level of commitment which they need.  I ask the Minister to examine that closely to see whether &ldquo;shall&rdquo; could replace &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Perhaps that should be dealt with by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the inspectorate.  Will the Minister consider requiring that the chief inspector publish a report, as happens in England where Mr. Chris Woodhead reports frequently on various issues, some might say too frequently?  However, a balance could be struck.  In order for schools and the body politic to measure trends in education, such as literacy or the number of inspections per year, we need some form of reporting by the inspectorate.  I ask the Minister to provide for that in Part III.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with boards of management.  The general provisions are those which I would expect to see and they develop what has gone before. Will the Minister consider the boards of management of education centres?  The committees running what were called teacher training centres, and are now known as education centres, do not have the same protection from liability as schools do.  Perhaps that is because they deal with adults who are meant to look after themselves rather than falling and making claims.  There is a need to examine what protection is available in education centres for people, many of whom offer their time voluntarily because of their interest in education and who provide a service which would not otherwise be provided.  They should enjoy the same protection as school boards of management.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the auditing of accounts and the cost of this must be taken into account. It is easy for us to call for accountability and auditing &mdash; both are very laudable &mdash; but auditing can be expensive.  Some schools can avail of the services of friendly accountants who are connected with the school but other schools cannot.  Of course, the schools which can avail of those services are generally those which also have the ability to fundraise.</P>
    <P>Section 20 refers to establishing procedures for keeping parents informed.  I know from my teaching days that attempts to keep parents informed often resulted in reports months later of letters being found at the bottom of schoolbags.  There is a definite need to formalise that communication and to assist schools in making a monthly report, for example.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with promoting co-operation between the school and the community, which is vital.  I taught in one, two and three teacher schools and those schools tend to be more involved in the community, probably through necessity because they depend on the community <Col N="81" /> for their resources.  I support that provision very strongly.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the encouragement of second level student councils in section 27.  Children should learn as part of their education to argue their corner, think for themselves and be the agents of changes which are needed in society and their own lives.  Participating in a student council has a very immediate role but also a wider educational role, which I support.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the establishment of a body to &ldquo;plan and co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to learning and teaching through Irish&rdquo;, which is long overdue.  Such provision has been hit-and-miss until now.  Full credit is due to gaelscoileanna which have managed to overcome the difficulties in that area and attain very high standards.  The problem must be dealt with sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on strategies to tackle educational disadvantage.  That committee will have a great deal of work to do and will need to report more widely to other Departments, given that the social problems with which it will deal will relate to health, housing and transport. These features of disadvantage spread far wider than the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Section 39 refers to bodies involved in primary and post primary education and provides for the composition of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  This area has been narrowly defined in the past and there is a temptation to maintain previous definitions.  The Bill refers to experience and skills, including business and industry skills, which are important.  However, we cannot depend on business and industry skills to provide an educational life-enhancing experience to children and adults who are mature students. These necessary skills include ones which are often overlooked &mdash; for example, parenting, homemaking and conflict resolution.  These are issues which we often speak about in the House but generally in terms of symptoms.  I hope the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will set out a wider vision of the educational needs of children.  These needs are much wider than those which the various interest groups want to promote because their brief is not to promote a wide remit but to focus on their own interests. That should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Minister at Question Time about in-service training which is changing and developing.  The system of in-service training was disgraceful and teachers were encouraged to make use of it during their holidays and were to be rewarded with days off during the year.  I know from teaching in a one, two and three teacher school that one could not do so.  There was no way to deliver on that arrangement.  I hope we are becoming more realistic in relation to in-service training.  Perhaps the Department needs to allocate more resources, particularly if we consider the problems about which I have heard concerning delays in providing in-service training which <Col N="82" /> have meant that teachers have lost out and schools have made arrangements on which they could not follow through.</P>
    <P>Part VIII on examinations does not refer to examination centres.  The legislation should ensure that those repeating the leaving certificate are not obliged to travel long distances. Travelling long distances, which many of those repeating the leaving certificate are obliged to do, is not conducive to a good performance. Note should be taken of examination centres.  I look forward to Committee Stage and hope the Minister takes on board some of the suggestions made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be commended on this legislation which will underpin educational provision into the next millennium.  The Bill is a considerable improvement on that prepared by the Minister's predecessor and corrects the excess of the Bhreathnach proposals in respect of regionalisation and its consequent non-productive cost.  The introduction of this landmark legislation gives us an opportunity to reflect on the quality of our educational provision and to evaluate the proposals contained in it.</P>
      <P>There is a general acceptance that our economic success is directly attributable to the quality of our education.  Yet this acceptance comes somewhat belatedly after years of teacher bashing by some commentators, of whom one of the most conspicuous is a Member of the Oireachtas. It is sad that teacher bashing has had the effect of lowering the status of teachers and teaching to the extent that it is no longer a highly popular career choice for our brightest and best.  We now acknowledge the vital economic role of teachers and schools but the damage done may well be irreversible.</P>
      <P>This debate gives us the opportunity to put on record our estimate and opinion of teachers.  I wish to record my respect for a body of professionals and for a system which has given us one of the most accomplished and gifted workforces in the world.  Much of what has been attained in terms of scholarship and academic excellence has not been as a result of Government support but in spite of Government neglect and underfunding. Teachers have delivered in spite of neglect and lack of appreciation.</P>
      <P>I am not naive enough to suggest all is well in our schools and that they do not require regulation. There are many flaws and faults in our system and perhaps the most glaring and unfair is the exclusion of the disadvantaged from many schools.  No school in receipt of Exchequer funding has the right to exclude a child by the application of an entrance test.  This practice is almost exclusively confined to urban areas but it is significant in that urban areas are the last bastions of class consciousness and privilege.  The opposite to privilege is deprivation and, sadly, many children in our local authority housing schemes in inner cities and suburban areas suffer almost automatic exclusion from some schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Many of the schools which admit only the best claim excellence on the basis of results in State examinations.  Such claims may dupe the public but they do not stand up to objective scrutiny. Good teaching is not about getting good results for exceptionally gifted students but is about getting the best possible results for any student commensurate with that student's objective ability.</P>
    <P>Results and CAO points have tended to dominate educational thinking in recent times.  They have become the main focus of educational concern for most parents.  We seldom track performance beyond the leaving certificate.  Each year we select, through the leaving certificate examination, the best and brightest to go to university. Regrettably, up to 30 per cent of these do not graduate.  We must consider the possible reasons for this and address them if we can.  I hold the view, which is shared by many educationalists, that our second level teaching style does not prepare students for the demands and exigencies of third level.  At second level the teacher takes control of the learning process.  The teacher is virtually the sole source and purveyor of information. The student learns and assimilates the information at the teacher's behest through checking, reinforcing, exercising and testing.</P>
    <P>When the student goes to third level the rigorous discipline of daily assignment and reinforcement exercises is not available.  The student is largely responsible for initiating, organising and assimilating his or her own learning.  Unfortunately, the student is frequently ill-prepared for the demands, lacking the confidence, assertiveness, insight and organisation and information technology skills to cope.  The culture of dependence on the teacher, which pervades the secondary system, provides a short-term payoff in terms of points but it can be an inhibiting and retarding influence on the student when he or she goes to university.</P>
    <P>There is a growing awareness of the need to change the emphasis in secondary education from the traditional didactic methodologies to the more progressive investigative and experimental learning methodologies which have been initiated in new departures such as the transition year programme and the leaving certificate vocational programme. It behoves this House to recognise that curriculum development initiatives such as the transition year programme and leaving certificate vocational programme are largely attributable to the responsiveness of the teaching profession to the evolving needs of their students in an ever changing world.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will not discourage or inhibit the enterprise and initiative of teachers in responding to the needs of students.  In this context, I am conscious of the double-edged potential of the proposed school plan which will become a statutory requirement under the legislation.  I accept the need for accountability and a measurement instrument in the accountability process, <Col N="84" /> but I appeal to the Minister to ensure that school plans do not become rigid frameworks which will manacle and shackle teachers to a bland menu of approved educational experiences and a slavish captivity within a prescribed structure.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the concept of strategic planning for a period of, say, five years and the use of such plans to press for funding for specific projects.  Planning as a prelude to accountability is fine, but if a plan envisages developments which require resources then there must be some possibility of getting these resources.  Otherwise the plan will be a mere sham, a device to trick one into stating one's goals, aims and objectives which will later be measured against one's performance. If this is the route we are going then the Department's inspectorate is the appropriate body to produce the school plan in consultation with teachers and management.</P>
    <P>In many cases schools are in dire need of maintenance action plans, not educational plans.  The Department should bow its head in shame at its disgraceful neglect of some schools.  It is deplorable that some schools still do not have basic sanitation facilities or an adequate heating system.  It is fine to point the finger at management but it does not have the resources.  Even the Department's community and comprehensive schools are neglected.  Many of them are falling into disrepair due to a lack of routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Bill moves us to a new plane in terms of regulating school governance and accountability. However, we must provide the wherewithal to schools so that they can manage their affairs professionally, competently and systematically.  We cannot legislate for change if we do not commit the resources to facilitate this change.  I urge the Minister to give unqualified assurances in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to capitation grants.  I welcome the increase of £5 in the rate of capitation grant in the budget.  I made representations to the Minister on this matter.  Following a radio programme last January I undertook a study of four neighbouring schools in my constituency in County Limerick.  Like other counties, small rural areas of County Limerick have suffered a decline in population.  This has had a knock-on effect on the number of pupils in schools.  Parents do not mind paying for so-called luxuries but they should not have to pay for the basics.  The enrolment in the first school has fallen from 165 pupils in 1992 to 101 pupils this year, while it has fallen from 287 to 170 pupils in the second school, from 170 to 103 pupils in the third school and from 159 to 105 pupils in the fourth school.  At a recent meeting the local authority decided to build more houses in rural areas in an effort to stem the decline in the population and prevent schools closing.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I give a tentative welcome to some of the Bill's provisions but give a big welcome to the exclusion of regional education boards.  I agree with the Minister that these would only serve to add to the <Col N="85" /> level of bureaucracy and cost.  Cost effectiveness is best achieved through a minimisation of bureaucracy.  The model of the community and comprehensive school is clear proof that direct contact with the Department is more economical, more empowering for schools and ensures business is processed more efficiently.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill pays particular attention to those who are disadvantaged and have special needs.  The level of compassion and concern we show to those with special needs brought about by physical or mental disability or social disadvantage is a measure of our humanity.  If we are to err on the side of generosity this is the most laudable error to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá lúcháir orm deis agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>When discussing education we should never lose sight of its main objective which is to give the best possible standard of education to every pupil regardless of ability, disability, social background, locality or any other factor.  All legislation on education should have this as its central aim.  Every child should be given the opportunity to develop his or her natural talents and ability to the maximum.  The education system must be geared towards achieving this objective.  The Bill must be judged on the basis of these criteria.  Its effectiveness in achieving this central objective will be revealed with the passing of time.</P>
      <P>The Bill lacks substance when compared with the Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor. Most of the proposals in that Bill have been watered down or omitted.  Opinion on the effectiveness of regional boards proposed by the previous Minister is divided.  The main advantage of such boards is that they would decentralise decision and policy making to the regions and bring it nearer to those in the system.  Some people were against the establishment of these boards as they would cost £40 million a year to run.  The Minister, when in Opposition, was vociferous in his opposition to the Bill.  Obviously he has carried his convictions into Government and is now implementing his proposals, which is his right.</P>
      <P>The only direct experience of county boards delivering education is the vocational education committees, which have proved their worth in the past 50 or 60 years &mdash; they were established in the 1930s.  I am a member of a VEC board which is responsible for 4,000 or 5,000 post primary students in Donegal.  Many of the schools under the Donegal VEC are flagship schools in their areas and they do excellent work.  Considering the achievements of vocational education committees down the years, I do not know if the Minister's opposition to the boards is entirely justified.  I will not, however, spend time discussing the pros and cons of the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the Bill covers sections 2 to 12 which deal with schools, including matters such as functions of schools, recognition of schools and annual funding, which is dealt with specifically in section 12.  The primary sector, the bunscoileanna <Col N="86" /> or scoileanna náisiúnta, is completely under-funded. The capitation grant per pupil per annum is in the region of £40.  Deputy Collins said there is provision in the budget for an increase of £5 and I ask the Minister to confirm that.  In the post-primary sector, secondary, comprehensive and community schools, the capitation grant is £150 per pupil per annum.  Why is there such a huge gap between the capitation grant for primary and post-primary sectors?  We should not under-estimate the importance of the contribution of the primary sector, where the foundation of education is laid.</P>
    <P>When we compare funding for primary schools here with that available in Northern Ireland we see that the capitation grant per pupil there is almost the same as that for the post-primary sector here.  Those schools, therefore, operate at a disadvantage in terms of funding.  The lack of proper funding for heating, cleaning and other essentials deters pupils from reaching their full potential. It also leads to teachers and boards of management having to organise fund-raising activities throughout the year.</P>
    <P>In the parish where I live there are five primary schools and one could have a hectic social life attending functions organised to raise money for those schools.  On Sunday night there is a trath na gceist in Knockfola for Meenacladdy national school; on Monday night, a whist drive is held in Scoil Mhuire, Dhoiri Beaga; on Tuesday night, Dobhar school holds a whist drive and on Wednesday night Scoil Chonaill, in my area of Bunbeg, holds a table quiz.  As the week progresses the social activities become more hectic in that there are discos on Friday and Saturday nights for the local secondary schools.  I could have a hectic social life, fundraising every night for the primary and secondary schools of my parish, if I had time to do so.  As a former teacher, the Minister will be aware of the importance of funding.  Perhaps during his time in office he will close the gap between the amount of capitation grant for primary schools and that for post-primary sector.</P>
    <P>When an area wants to build a new school or extend, refurbish or renovate an existing school, an intolerable financial burden is sometimes placed on the board of management.  I refer particularly to island schools.  A major refurbishing job is planned in the near future in one school in my constituency.  The school has been told it will have to raise 15 per cent of the total cost of £250,000, or £40,000.  That is a huge sum for an island which has little or no employment, where most people are on social welfare and there is little or no source of funding.  I hope the Minister makes exceptions for islands and economically deprived areas.  I recently had an opportunity to discuss with the Minister in his office the issue of schools for religious minorities, where few families are involved.  To have to raise 15 per cent of funds would be an intolerable burden on such a community.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the inspectorate, an cigireacht.  The three buzzwords in that section <Col N="87" /> are &ldquo;support&rdquo;, &ldquo;advise&rdquo; and &ldquo;evaluate&rdquo;, with the emphasis on evaluation.  The cigire evaluates management, teaching, progress of pupils and so on.  In years gone by I remember looking forward to the visit of the cigire with great trepidation, but the position is now changed and the role of the cigire is of adviser, supporter and evaluator. In a book written by a well-known Donegal Irish writer, Séamus Ó Grianna, a primary school teacher who spent some years teaching on a Donegal island, he said there was such a fear of the visit of the cigire, he had an arrangement with the local boatman that on the day the cigire was visiting the school he would fly a red flag on the sail to warn the teachers that he was on his way. If the Minister wishes to verify the accuracy of that he can check it in <i>Saol Carrach</i> le Séamus Ó Grianna, who was ahead of his time.  He talks about the day he was caught by the cigire when the school was fighting the battle of Benburb, with an armoury of sods, sticks and so on.  When the cigire arrived he almost became a victim.  As a result, the mór thuairisc was negative as far as Séamus Ó Grianna was concerned.</P>
    <P>There was mention recently that a change is proposed in the approach to the inspector's visit to schools, providing for an overall school inspection with the Roinn cigire, the psychologist and so on spending time in the school evaluating the whole system.  I do not know if change is envisaged in that regard.  If so, perhaps the Minister will refer to it.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with boards of management. I taught in a national school which had no board of management.  At that time the sagart paróiste was responsible for matters such as hiring, firing and so on.  In the mid-1970s boards of management were established, on which all the vital interests such as the Church, the patron, teachers and parents were represented.  From my experience, boards of management have worked very well and everyone in the community feels they are involved in the school.  Their establishment generated much comment, some of it adverse.  However, when we consider how boards of management have operated over the past 20 years we can be happy with what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Part V, sections 22 to 24, deals with the roles of principals and teachers.  There are two types of principals, working and teaching, in national and primary schools.  The function of the working principal is to ensure that all his teachers work as a team for the benefit of the school.  The teaching principal exists where the school has less than nine teachers.  He has the worst of both worlds because he must teach a full class every day and administer the school, meet the parents and be on hand when things go wrong.  Not only must he be a principal and administrator but also on occasions a plumber, carpenter and cabinet maker.  He gets little recognition, financial or otherwise, for his labours.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister is a former teacher I hope he will initiate a scheme where the teaching <Col N="88" /> principal will have a day or a day and a half a week to undertake the essential duties of administration, such as meeting the parents and doing what the working principal does full-time.  A roster of back-up staff would allow for this.  I cannot understand how a principal in a seven or eight teacher school can be expected to teach and administer the school while his colleague in a nine teacher school does not have to do any teaching.</P>
    <P>Part VI, sections 25 to 36, covers the school year, week and day, the parent's associations, teagasc trí Gaeilge, and educational disadvantage.  In section 31 the Minister recognises that there are difficulties about múineadh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is minic a sheas mé sa Teach seo ag gearáin go láidir go raibh deacrachtaí faoi leith ag múinteoirí a bhíonn ag teagasc trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sna scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge.  Bíonn deacrachtaí faoi théacsleabhair mar shampla.  Ní bhíonn an réimse céanna téacsleabhar ar fáil sa Ghaelscoil agus a bhíonn sa ghnáth-scoil.  Is minic a bhíonn ar na múinteoiri aistriúchán a dhéanamh ar na leabhair iad féin agus an obair a dhéanamh tráthnona nó ag an deireadh seachtaine.</P>
    <P>Tá an-obair á dhéanamh sna Gaelscoileanna agus tá na torthaí le feiceáil sna scrúdaithe.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire chun gach tacaíocht is féidir leis a thabhairt do na Gaelscoileanna.  Tá siad ag fás ar fud na tíre agus tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó acu ann mar dhuine a bhfuil suim agam sa teanga agus san athbheochan.  Tá dóchas mór agam go dtiocfaidh an Ghaeilge agus athbheochan na Gaeilge chun cinn sna bunscoileanna. Níl aitheantas ceart tugtha againn go fóill don obair atá ar siúl ag na Gaelscoileanna.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh Gaelscoil ag lorg aitheantais as seo amach nach mbeidh an tAire ró-dhian ar na coinníollacha.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh Gaelscoil i ngach áit sna blianta atá romhainn mar go bhfuil an-obair ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí móra ag na scoileanna Ghaeltachta chomh maith.  Nuair a bhí mise ag teagasc sa Ghaeltacht agus nuair a bhí mé ag freastal ar scoil sa Ghaeltacht ní raibh ann ach an t-aon teanga amháin.  Ach tá na Gaeltachtaí iad féin dhá-theangach anois.  Cothaíonn sin deacrachtaí mar tá buachaillí agus cailíní ag teacht isteach sa scoil anois sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil an Béarla mar theanga baile acu agus cuid eile agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga baile acu.  Tá an fhadhb chéanna acu is atá sna Gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Educational disadvantage is a very important area which needs to be looked at carefully. Deputies Connaughton and Naughten will verify that large areas in rural Ireland contain many schools which do not have the advantage of remedial teaching facilities.  I cannot over emphasise the importance of providing remedial teaching and special assistance facilities at primary school level because the sooner remedial problems are identified and addressed the better.  Providing such facilities at second level is often too late because by then the pupil has fallen behind by three, four or five years or even more.  Problems are then much more difficult to address.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> There are seven or eight schools in an area of my constituency, from Dunfanaghy to Creeslaugh to Murroe to almost as far as Letterkenny and to Kimacrenan, without a remedial teacher.  I have raised the matter in the House on a number of occasions.  That should not be tolerated because the children in these schools are as constitutionally entitled to the services of such a teacher as pupils in other parts of the country.  In one area a remedial teacher covers four schools, including the one in which I taught.  This means the teacher can spend a day or a day and one-fifth in each school.  While it is better than nothing the pupils in need of such teaching are left to cope in the classroom four days a week.  Much more needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>Part VIII deals with examinations, which are usually applicable at post primary level.  Examinations are a necessary evil.  I am not aware of a fairer system.  Much criticism is made of the points system, which can be unfair at times. However, as with democracy, it is the worst system except for all the others.  At least all students play on a level pitch.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an industrial difficulty with examination staff in the Department.  This is a cause of concern to students who will sit the leaving and junior certificate examinations this year. It would be a great pity if they were inconvenienced or if their futures were jeopardised.  I hope the Minister will act to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille.  Tá súil agam nuair a raghaidh an tAire trid an Bille arís go nglacfaidh sé le amendments agus go n-éireoidh leis oideachas den scoth a chur ar fáil d'aos óg na tíre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is an appropriate moment to compliment everybody involved in the education sector.  Teachers especially should be complimented on the quality and excellence of the teaching standards that have been attained in our schools.  It would be remiss of me as a Fianna Fáil Deputy if I did not ask the House to note the tradition my party has established in education from Donogh O'Malley's time to the publication of the Green Paper by the former Minister for Education and current Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is continuing a proud tradition for our party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a few of them too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to the same extent.  Fine Gael has not made as major an impression on education as Fianna Fáil since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the result of widespread consultation and the distillation of opinions from many groups since the publication of the Green Paper in 1992.  Its main feature is the practical approach taken by the Minister.  One of the main difficulties identified by my party in the former Minister, <Col N="90" /> Niamh Bhreathnach's Bill was the proposal for regional education boards.  When in Opposition Fianna Fáil opposed this element of the Bill.  The idea of establishing regional boards which would operate side by side with vocational educational committees was nonsensical.  It was bureaucratic and extremely costly.  The idea of wasting £40 million on such bureaucracy defied belief.  I was interested in the reference to the regional boards by Deputy McGinley.  It was almost as if he hid while the first Education Bill was debated and he is now coming out of the corner.  The Deputy obviously shared Fianna Fáil's view at the time and, as a member of a VEC, agreed that the regional boards had no place in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister has underpinned the role of vocational education committees in the Bill.  It is important to note the magnificent role played by vocational education committees over the years. Vocational schools are now community colleges and they are much more acceptable.  The stigma that was once attached to vocational schools has been, by and large, removed and this is most important.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important because it recognises the central role of teachers.  I come from a teaching background and it is correct to say that teachers are consulted on matters relating to schools.  The Minister has ensured in the Bill that teachers will have a say in the running of schools.  Another important feature relates to the autonomy of schools which has been recognised in the Bill. There is statutory recognition of school patrons who will be obliged to appoint boards of management which reflect the interests of all those who hold a stake in the school.  The board must encompass the interests and objectives of the various people involved and this is welcome.</P>
    <P>Accountability is central to the spirit of the legislation.  Boards of management will be accountable to parents, school patrons and the Minister who, in turn, will be accountable regarding the funding provided to schools.  The Minister will also be accountable to the House regarding the quality of funding for schools.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs have been mentioned. This is correct and the Bill states that the needs of these children must be met.  Extra and appropriate money has been made available by the Minister to schools which are particularly disadvantaged. It is appropriate to compliment the Minister on his policy relating to one teacher schools.  These schools are in the heart of the country and they have played important social and educational functions over the years.  The Government will ensure that they remain in existence by providing extra teachers in each school. The Minister also intends to introduce initiatives to increase the number of remedial teachers.  This area has been a bone of contention for many years, not least during the lifetime of the previous Government when the former Minister was harried because she did not provide sufficient funding for remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> An aspect of the Bill which is particularly welcome is the placing of the National Curriculum Assessment Agency on a statutory footing.  The NCAA has operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for too long.  I will refer later to the examinations appeals system which will be put in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned the promotion of the Irish language.  It has a special place in our culture and this is recognised in the Bill.  This should be welcomed.  The growth in the number of gaelscoileanna and the emergence of and demand for all-Irish second level schools is testimony to the fact that parents and children want to be taught in their native tongue.  This must be encouraged in every way.  However, while encouraging gaelscoileanna, we should not over-look the quality of the teaching of Irish and the commitment to the Irish language and culture among teachers in many national schools.  This should not be forgotten because the quality of Irish taught in many schools is excellent.</P>
    <P>When the first education Bill was discussed, it was accepted that rationalisation of vocational education committees was necessary.  The Minister agrees there is a role for rationalisation.  The extent of it can be debated but the presence of two vocational education committees in a small county does not stand up to scrutiny.  Rationalisation in such areas should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The roles of education and enterprise and employment have been pigeon-holed too often in the past.  Each looked after its own sector and there was little interaction.  It is to the eternal credit of the Minister that he recognised the importance of interaction between enterprise and education. When he took office, he ensured that the £250 million programme included interaction between these areas.  That programme is to be welcomed because it meets the demands of industry and the economy.  Career guidance counsellors have played a major role in this area and must continue to do so.  They will have to point out to second level students that traditional courses may not have the career prospects they once had.  I carried out a study of university graduates that showed 34 per cent of graduates had a B.A. or B. Comm., while only 6 per cent had engineering qualifications.  When one considers the amount of hi-tech industry we have attracted to Ireland, such a statistic begs the question of whether educational establishments are geared to and meeting the needs of the economy. The Minister's approach will ensure that there is greater emphasis on encouraging students to consider entering the hi-tech area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the importance of oral capability with languages.  He has asked why we test students' oral ability with Irish and the continental languages but do not test their ability in English.  I am glad he wants oral tests in English to become a feature of examinations.</P>
    <P>Dr. Michael Kelleher published a paper recently on disadvantage and suicide.  There was <Col N="92" /> a belief that the points system was responsible in some way for suicides, particularly among young males.  I was glad he blew that myth away when he indicated that severe disadvantage was more likely to be a cause of suicide among students.</P>
    <P>We seem to have lost the old emphasis placed on the school attendance officers.  They were the barometers that helped to pinpoint those students who were absenting themselves from school. Often there was no follow-through on the causes of those absences.  The school attendance officer is very important in helping to identify the difficulties of students, because if these problems are tackled early they can be corrected.  The appointment of school attendance officers is very important and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We have many schemes for early school leavers, and various groups have been set up to give them a second chance.  We owe them a debt because the system has let them down.  The Minister has built up good relations with industries which might set aside a number of places for those who left school early.  Those people could then be employed in their local areas.  Multinational companies owe the areas in which they operate a debt and should look after such people.</P>
    <P>The Minister plans to continue with the vocational education committees, but those organisations are concerned about funding.  I understand that the schools are to be assigned funding individually.  The vocational education committees are afraid that their administration costs will be deducted from the funding being made available to them.  The Minister should address this issue.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that there may be different curricula for different types of school.  The VEC sector would not like to return to the time when some schools geared themselves for the university sector and others geared themselves for the regional technical colleges and institutes of technology.  I know that is not what the Minister intends, and he should clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill which the Minister should clarify relates to the establishment of sub-committees and boards of management in the vocational education committees.  It has been suggested that it is not incumbent on vocational education committees to ensure that boards of management are in place, though many exist and operate effectively.</P>
    <P>The community and comprehensive schools are affected by sections 7, 8 and 15.  Those sections suggest that the provisions of the deed of trust for community schools and articles of management for comprehensive schools have the same force of law as the provisions of the Bill.  This would mean that while the provisions of the Bill generally would apply to community and comprehensive schools, the provisions of the deed and articles would have precedence where there is a conflict between them the provisions of the Bill.  This would mean the provisions of the deed and articles, about which the Bill is silent, would also <Col N="93" /> have the force of law.  Clarification is being sought on that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides that the Minister may refuse access to information which would permit the compilation of information on results not otherwise available to the public.  Why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; used in that context?  Is it because of the data protection legislation or the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    <P>I will deal with the other matters that concern me on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill, particularly about the disadvantaged and pupils with special needs.  The long title states &ldquo;An Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the education of every child in the State.  ..&rdquo;. If the Bill is taken at face value that means every person counts.  If that is achievable I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</P>
      <P>Like every other facet of Irish life, education is evolving at an enormous rate to try to meet the aspirations of a new generation.  Education is by far the most important tool in society, through which every individual is given an opportunity to make his or her way in life with confidence and dignity.  Almost one-third of the population &mdash; approximately one million people &mdash; attend school every day and the taxpayers pay 42,000 teachers to teach them.  If there are approximately one million pupils, by definition there must be approximately two million parents with a direct interest in what is happening in the world of education.  In other words, there are approximately three million people directly involved in this important subject.</P>
      <P>The Minister has unhitched the bandwagon of the regional boards and the concept has been derailed.  While I saw the need for such boards in the last Government, I did not believe they would come with a price tag of £40 million.  I do not know how that figure was assessed.  I hope there was no double counting which, as the Minister knows, can easily happen in a Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure was conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In his briefing document the Minister stated that £10 million will be allocated for minor capital projects at national schools.  Will he clarify what he means by a minor capital project?  If an extra room is needed in a national school in a rural area, there is generally no difficulty getting planning permission and there is usually a person in the community qualified to draw up the plans to the standards required by the Department.  The local community might also have to put up more money to get the room built quickly.  In such circumstances, it should be possible to short-circuit the torturous route such simple projects currently take.  It can take years to build a room to a national school.  Does that concept come under the Minister's minor capital <Col N="94" /> projects?  If it does he will make many friends.  It would do away with the multi-stranded bureaucracy that currently operates for such minor projects. This is not a political point because most Deputies agree with it.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister is legalising a system that already exists, I welcome the provision which states that teachers should be consulted on a wide range of issues, including appointment and appeal procedures and school planning.  Teachers play a vital role in society and we have been very fortunate with the standard of teachers in the past.  However, like every other profession, 99 per cent do an excellent job and 1 per cent do not.  It is frustrating for parents who have to deal with a teacher they consider is not up to standard.  While I accept the integrity of teachers must be safe-guarded against frivolous complaints and so on, in some cases boards of managers and parents genuinely believe it is not possible to have a teacher removed for very serious matters.  We are lucky to have such good teachers.  It is only right and proper that parents and children have rights under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to special needs children.  I acknowledge that our education system, relatively speaking, has been extremely good and we can be proud of it. Compared with other systems, not alone in Europe but across the world, we stand head and shoulders over the rest.  However, there is a problem in the same way as in the Celtic tiger phenomenon in our economy.  In the past four or five years living standards have improved and a great majority of people are better off.  Equally, for whatever reason, a substantial minority are finding it as hard to live as ever.  I want to equate that to the education system.  I come across young people who, for one reason or another, slip through the net of education and arrive at a second level school neither able to read nor write. We now have a system which proves scientifically that if one can identify the problem at three or four years of age &mdash; I am not involved in education but I am a parent and I know a fair amount about the system from observation &mdash; a great deal can be done in the education system.  Equally, if the problem is not identified and students get into the second stream of education they will get nowhere.</P>
      <P>This is not a political matter because it is a plague on all our houses.  I cannot understand why every national school does not have access to a remedial teacher and a resource teacher or even the cluster system where four or five schools can share such teachers.  The Government of which the Minister is a Member has done its part as did the previous Government when a number of remedial teachers were appointed in east Galway area as in many others.  There are huge gaps in the system.  The problem is there are many competing demands in education but only a small amount of extra money is available for the appointment of remedial and resource teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the mental handicap system is concerned, <Col N="95" /> there is a direct correlation between students who were missed in the infant classes in our national schools and the entry to the mental handicap services of people between 12 and 16 years of age.  Given the amount we will have to spend on special needs children in mental handicap institutions, if they could be accommodated in national schools there would be enormous savings.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal to the Minister, that whatever else we do in the world of education, to put in meaningful resources so that in two or three years' time every national school will have a remedial teacher and, where necessary, a resource teacher.  I understand from the figures available we are a long way from that aspiration.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has been praised, and rightly so, for part of the Bill, politicians from all sides of the House can hang their heads in shame unless we can deliver on the remedial teacher in the next two or three years.  Any grandiose Bills we might introduce are not worth tuppence in the sense that we are turning our backs on a vitally important part of community life.</P>
    <P>If we cannot deliver on the remedial teacher we may need a tribunal of inquiry.  We are at a stage where we have a tribunal for everything.  It appears that is how Irish life and society is geared.  We will soon need to have a tribunal to investigate the education system which may prove that we have abdicated our responsibilities to a very important part of the lives of young people, who missed the education net, for whatever reason.  It is not fair to blame politicians on their own.  We can blame teachers who did not identify them in the classroom and parents who did nothing about it.  I know parents who are aware their children have a learning difficulty and are either afraid or ashamed to tell anyone.  That will not work.  They share a great responsibility for this.  However, we can draw attention to it publicly on the floor of the House.  The day will come when someone will set up a tribunal asking why this was not done.  All the evidence was available and it was clear what would make a difference but nothing was done about it.  I have not had an opportunity to say this for a long time.  I hope that whatever Government will be in office in the next couple of years will deliver.  The need is specific, all the authorities accept it, young people are trained as remedial and resource teachers and we have the schools.  I understand that up to 10 per cent of students in national schools could avail, with advantage, of remedial teaching.  We are a long way from providing the service required.  In areas of Ballinasloe, such as Kilconnell and Aughrim, there are mothers who are making every effort to get remedial teachers. Any Government who turns its back on them will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>The teaching of languages is a hobbyhorse of mine.  In the past five or six, or even ten years, our education system was geared to ensuring that every student leaving second level would have <Col N="96" /> one or two continental languages.  As a trading nation, we have to export to survive.  We rub shoulders at trade fairs with the best salespersons in the world who are highly proficient in languages. If one cannot speak the language of the buyer, one is finished.  If one has to await the arrival of an interpreter, a deal will have been done with somebody else.  There is, therefore, a need for greater interaction between industry and education to ensure people are trained for a particular job.  I only hope we will be more successful than we have been when it comes to the teaching of continental languages.</P>
    <P>Gaelscoileanna have much to offer.  They are not in competition with ordinary national schools. It is incumbent on us to help them.  They are managed and funded by people who have a deep interest in the Irish language.  While they may have been slow in getting off the ground, they are the key to rekindling an interest in the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well.  I am highly impressed by the start he has made.  He has hit the ground running.  I can verify that he adopts a similar live wire approach to all issues.  He has a great interest in his portfolio in which I am sure he will be successful. Since taking office he has accepted many challenges.  It has been mentioned that he tabled 100 amendments to the previous Bill.  I am sure he has included those amendments that needed to be included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is more finance available than at any time in the history of the State to improve the education system.  There is clear recognition of the need for a good education.  It is no coincidence that a similar process of evaluation has been initiated in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.  Society is changing rapidly and we have to keep pace.  We are living in the information age. Telecom Eireann is to be congratulated on supporting the Government's programme by providing an extra £10 million to finance the information age schools plan.</P>
      <P>A number of issues which may have a detrimental effect have been mentioned.  We must ensure that, in the dash for excellence, the gap does not widen for those who are challenged, either physically or mentally, and socially excluded.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the result of a lengthy process of consultation which began with the publication of the Green Paper on Education in l992.  It is based on the concept of co-operation and partnership. That is the key.  The Minister is anxious to ensure a good working relationship at all levels between pupils, teachers, parents and patrons of schools. We can no longer accept the standards of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indictment of all previous occupants of this House that this is the first Bill of general application to deal with the way education is organised.  The system is being placed on a statutory basis.  It is crucially important that the work <Col N="97" /> done by 42,000 teachers in over 4,000 schools, by parents in supporting and motivating students, by the churches and other sections of the community is recognised.  They have forged a successful partnership.</P>
    <P>Everything in the garden is not rosy.  It has been argued that small primary schools are discriminated against in the provision of secretarial and caretaker services.  Schools with over 195 pupils receive a grant of £30 per child to provide such services.  The capitation grant for primary schools is less than one third of that for second level schools.  These issues need to be discussed and debated.</P>
    <P>The weight of school bags has been mentioned. There is no need to waste time by establishing a working group to examine the matter.  Knowing I would participate in this debate, I weighed my son's school sack last Sunday night and it weighed exactly two stone.  It is criminal to expect young people to carry that kind of pack every day to and from school.  That type of handicap would not be put on a horse.  We are talking about a maximum weight of 10 per cent of the person's body weight, but that is a ridiculous target at which to aim.  We must move immediately to rectify this problem by providing proper locker and storage facilities which should be incorporated in the design of schools.</P>
    <P>A sensible suggestion from the parents of one child appeared in a newspaper during the past year, that text books should be published in sections.  That would involve the use of folders and binders but it would allow the child to take to school the section of the text book required on a given day.  I am sure many other methods could be employed but we should not continue to tolerate this problem and say we will examine it in 12 months' time.  Sections of the industrial health and safety regulations prohibit that type of weight being lifted by people of this age.  We should examine this problem and see if we can address it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins mentioned another area that has been debated for a long time, namely, the question of the sloping desk and the physical problems that creates for children.  This problem too has been tolerated for years and its solution would not require the setting up of a new forum or committee.  The people in the Department dealing with educational facilities over the years should be capable of correcting these types of problems.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio is not addressed in the Bill but it will be the most critical aspect of the future of education outside the provision of the required technology.</P>
    <P>Another item on which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is working closely and with which I hope we can deal quickly is the question of school transport.  I will not go into that this evening because I know the Minister of State has already prepared a report on it.</P>
    <P>The question of regional boards is addressed in the Bill.  The Minister has been totally consistent <Col N="98" /> in his approach to these boards.  He objected to them when he was Opposition spokesman and he continues to object.  On the question of the duplication of existing services, a cost of £40 million has been put on that by the Department and the Minister.  I will not argue for or against that figure but it would be quite large.</P>
    <P>Most of our services in the future will be administered by regional boards.  We currently have the health services, the fisheries board, the tourism authorities and the eight regional authorities. Some common area will be found but this was a fairly impractical suggestion from the outset considering the current position.  The Minister was right to drop that from his programme, and he will be well able to defend that.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, referred earlier to vocational education and said there was a type of stigma attached to it.  There is not so much a stigma attached to it as a degree of snobbery.  Literally speaking, the graduates from vocational education built this country.  They were capable of erecting the buildings, equipping them and doing everything else that was required.</P>
    <P>The snobbery about vocational education still exists.  The Department cannot change that attitude in the minds of the public but we must work at changing it because there is now a shortage of trades people.  People working in this area can command enormous fees because of that shortage and we have had complaints from vested interests such as the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>I have been involved with the training of apprentices who have successfully represented this country abroad against the best talent in the world.  The recognition they received here was slight, however, in comparison to the recognition given to people who achieved success in the academic field.  These people did not get sufficient recognition and we will have to change our thinking on that.  In the past, many parents were willing to allow their children accept a lower paid job if it was in the white collar area.  That was snobbery of the worst type.</P>
    <P>The shortage of apprentices was referred to today and yesterday.  The primary reason for this shortage is the changing structure of employment for trades people.  When C2 certificates were issued to every trades person who wished to become self-employed, it more or less did away with apprentices overnight.  From that day builders and others refused to sponsor young people and it was left entirely to FÁS to sponsor apprentices. However, because of financial reasons, FÁS was limited in its ability to do that.  We must address this issue immediately because trades people will always be needed.  The public must recognise the importance of that type of work.</P>
    <P>The question of teacher training is dealt with also.  There must be continuous training throughout every teacher's career, and it must be supported fully by the State.  Those training requirements will change from time to time but training must take place in specialist areas to allow people deal effectively with pupils with special needs, <Col N="99" /> such as those who are mentally or physically challenged or others from particularly difficult backgrounds. Problems can arise for students because of the financial or social problems of their parents. They may be drink or drug related, and teachers must be in a position to respond to the needs of these pupils.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns which I would like the Minister to address when replying is the question of the appeals procedure.  This allows a pupil who is expelled, suspended from school for a short-term or refused admission to a school for reasons other than lack of accommodation to appeal against such decisions.  The reason for my concern is that people can be given the right to be heard, but what happens if the student is expelled anyway?  Do we point them in the direction of Portlaoise, Mountjoy or Limerick Prisons and tell them this is their next port of call?  Some type of follow up procedure must be put in place for pupils who are expelled.  There is a need for psychological examinations and other facilities.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has been totally consistent in his support for the gaelscoileanna.  Like the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who had a particular interest in this area as I am sure had other Ministers, I appreciate his commitment to the gaelscoileanna.  If the Minister was still here I would have been a little parochial and asked him to address the question of Gaelscoil Uí Riada in Bishopstown.  There is some move in that regard. It has taken seven to eight years to establish that school, locate it, get prefabs, secure parental support and establish a good team.  It has been suggested that the facility should be relocated two or three miles to what is hoped will be a vacant school some time in the future, but that will not work.  A characteristic of gaelscoileanna is their identification with a particular area.  Where attempts were made to relocate them they have seldom been as successful.  Gaelscoil Uí Riada in Bishopstown should be examined with a view to allowing work to proceed on it as quickly as possible. Drawings were submitted and it was sanctioned but matters seem to have come to a standstill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with special needs.  Autism was mentioned by a number of speakers, an area in which we have been negligent.  It is shameful that people have had to go to the Supreme Court and that constituents of mine have to run events ranging from race nights to bed pushes to raise funds to send children to a facility in America.  Given the greater level of co-operation and co-ordination of services the use of school facilities should be opened up to the general public after classes finish at 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>As a teacher I would be expected to comment on the Bill given that most Members who are teachers have made contributions. I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome this debate on education as we do not have enough debates on it.  However, the Bill is a watered <Col N="100" /> down version of what we set out to achieve when the Green Paper was published in the early 1990s when the Minister of State present was in office. We then had a White Paper and since then major consultations have taken place between the various organisations and interest groups.  This Bill will not create any waves or bring about much change.  It merely gives formality and structure to what is accepted practice at present.</P>
      <P>It is magnanimous of Deputy Dennehy to recognise the talent of his constituency colleague. No doubt they have enjoyed a good friendship and there has been much mutual admiration.  As a Cork man Deputy Dennehy will recognise that the previous five Ministers had an input to this Bill.  The former Minister in particular spent five years consulting and having discussions with various groups and put forward a much stronger proposal here.  We now see a diluted version of it before us.  Nevertheless there are worthwhile provisions in it that will be welcomed by the general body of educational interests.</P>
      <P>There is a natural love and appreciation of education dating back to monastic, bardic and penal times when penal laws outlawed education, but it survived in the form of hedge schools.  Many young people went to the Continent to be educated, including the great Daniel O'Connell from Kerry, and others left to become priests.  That great love of education has survived to the present day and there is no need to give a long history lesson on that.  Nevertheless we can become complacent about education.  When we are promoting this country as an industrial location we cite as one of our main advantages our young educated workforce.  That is why Hewlett Packard and Intel say that one of the reasons they invested in Ireland was the availability of an educated labour force.  That is a result of our education system, the Department of Education and Science.  Successive Ministers and Governments must take credit for that because they had the foresight to put in place a comprehensive education system.</P>
      <P>Free education was probably the most liberating measure ever introduced.  It gave opportunities to many people to develop to their full potential.  Some of those people are now leaders in industry and members of the medical and legal professions.  If we did not have free education we would not have our current standard of education. We must recognise that credit for that must be given to the late Donogh O'Malley.  The need for it was emphasised at that time in a Fine Gael document on a just society.  There was a common wisdom in the House about the value of free education.  That has driven our economy and given us confidence.  In years to come when that measure will be fully analysed it will be deemed one of the most important measures introduced to enhance the spirit, state and future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference to an OECD study.  Having read previous OECD studies I take note of them as they are usually pretty accurate.  That <Col N="101" /> study showed that 17 per cent of the 16 to 25 year olds who left school without certification have a low level of literacy and numeracy and as a result have found it difficult to get and keep a job.  Studies confirmed that up to 21 per cent of children leave school inadequately prepared and ill equipped to cope with the pressure of obtaining and holding down a job.  From my experience, and I am sure the Minister and Deputy Michael Ahern will agree that from their experience, it is difficult for employers to get suitably qualified staff.  The officials should note that in some cases those young people can barely read or write and have come through the system without the bare essentials, mastery of the three Rs.  While technology is important we should not get carried away with it.  We should not ignore the basics. The three Rs are as relevant now as they have been down through our history.  One would not have to go far to meet an employer who has taken on an employee to work in a supermarket who can hardly read a label and has difficulty counting. Our education system must address that problem.  I do not know if that will be addressed in this Bill.  Whether the framework will be provided to ensure that standards will be set remains to be seen.  The Minister and his Department must face up to this important issue.  In England there has been a return recently to the use of national achievement tests and we may have to consider such a course.  The old primary certificate was an important indication of the standard of young people leaving primary schools.  The teachers' unions would be against testing children at such an age but we must have a form of national standard for literacy and numeracy.</P>
    <P>I agree with the policy of putting a computer into every school and giving young people an opportunity to gain experience using them. However, we should not lose sight of the basics. We can get carried away with grandiose ideas which may leave our children less well equipped educationally.  The American experience has shown that children can find anything on a computer but may find it difficult to write a simple paragraph or to spell.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that a main achievement of the Bill is scrapping the regional boards.  If I were he I would not brag too much about it.  I can see merit in his arguments in favour of scrapping them but there was merit in proposing them.  In a European context there is an increasing emphasis on policy which addresses the specific needs of regions.  There is a shift towards regional policy and regional development. In the southern region a regional education board corresponding with the Southern Health Board would become an important institution in that region.  Children at primary and secondary levels need support from the health boards, especially in the case of children with special needs, as much as from the Department of Education and Science.  As many policies on sex, diet and hygiene education emanate from the health boards as from the Department.  There is an overlap <Col N="102" /> in this regard which might be avoided with regional structures.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that this measure would save £40 million.  If there were regional authorities much of the administrative work carried out by the Department would be delegated to the regional bodies and a saving would be made.  The Minister is a skilled political operator because he and the Fianna Fáil Party put across a skilled message before the election about the regional boards.  While canvassing on the doorsteps it was clear that people were confused about them. They were portrayed as another layer of bureaucratic quangos set up to look after people of a certain political persuasion.  The positive aspects of the boards were not properly explained.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the regional structure concept will be revisited in the future.  The OECD recognises the importance of regionality in education. A region such as the south-west has different needs from Dublin.  It has been a problem in south Kerry, for example, that we have been tied in with national policies, whether for industry, infrastructure or education.  As a result we lose out because our needs for industry, for example, are not reflected fully in the education provided in the region.  It would be a good idea to have a strong regional education policy for the Cork-Kerry region or the SFADCo region.</P>
    <P>The regional concept will be revisited.  It is unfair of the Minister to say that the regional education boards would be bureaucratic monsters which would cost £40 million.  It was Fianna Fáil policy to scrap the boards and it followed through on it.  However, it is wrong not to recognise the advantages which could have gone with the regional boards.  In his speech the Minister advocated co-operation along the lines suggested by the regional boards.  This may prove difficult given the absence of that structure.</P>
    <P>The issue of the appointment of teachers is not addressed fully in the Bill.  Teacher appointments vary between the private secondary system and the VEC system.  I spoke in the House some years ago on the appointment of VEC teachers and I expected the Bill would address this issue.  We advocated that the appointments should be taken out of the hands of the vocational education committees and politicians.  It is not right that teachers should be chosen by politicians because there may be pressure on a political party to choose a member or supporter of that party for a teaching post.  There have been examples of people who were not the best candidates at the interview getting jobs because a particular party had a majority on a VEC and it controlled the appointments.  We suggested that the function should be vested in the Local Appointments Commission.  I will suggest to Deputy Richard Bruton that an amendment to this effect be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has funked the issue of an education ombudsman.  There are ombudsmen for many sectors and the function is widely accepted. It works well.  It satisfies consumers because if <Col N="103" /> they have a grievance there is an individual or body to whom they can refer it.  The Minister should make a stand on Committee Stage on the appointment of an education ombudsman. Deputy Richard Bruton dealt with this matter in some detail.  As he said, the Minister has fudged the issue by making no provision for it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of the Bill seems to cover children with special needs, where it refers to &ldquo;. any child with special educational needs .&rdquo;.  I welcome that provision.  However, now that it is to become law, there are bound to be several court cases on foot of it unless we provide facilities for children with special needs.  Already this week I have spoken to groups representing the families of children with Down's syndrome in Kerry.  They want their children to attend local schools and be integrated in mainstream education. However, because of lack of facilities or lack of training in this area, teachers cannot cope with these children's needs.  We need more resource teachers if we are to cope with the range of disability.  I have submissions from the Irish Deaf Society and other groups representing various forms of special need.  This very day I had a call from a mother whose child suffers from dyslexia. She is caught between the Southern Health Board and the Department of Education and Science, and has nowhere to go.  This provision will enable such people to bring a case against the Department to have facilities provided to look after their children.  We in Ireland have put a lot of money into education.  We are giving free education to millionaires.  Fine Gael introduced free education at third level.  People with special needs need financial resources and they should be targeted more than people who have the means and the ability to learn.  We are not doing that and these people have no voice and not enough power electorally to influence decision-making.</P>
    <P>For a long time mine was a lone voice advocating more health and physical education in our schools.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement that physical education will be part of the leaving certificate curriculum.  That is a welcome departure from original thinking.  It is a futuristic proposal.  I hope it will be implemented.  If it is I will be the first to recognise the Minister's initiative.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  Education, whether vocational or academic, is the cornerstone of the development of people.  Regardless of what walk of life we choose, it is of the essence that we get the necessary education from our youngest days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997 the then Minister for Education introduced the Education Bill, 1997.  It was published about seven days prior to being discussed in the Chamber.  It caused consternation among interested organisations as it gave no meaningful time in which they could give a considered view of the Bill.  Adequate time should have been <Col N="104" /> given to all the partners in education to study the Bill, to reflect on it and to formulate a policy on it.  The Minister tried to push the Labour Party philosophy through before the general election which was looming ahead.  However, the attempted sleight of hand of that Government did not succeed.  On polling day the people passed their verdict on the policies of the Labour Party, with telling results.</P>
    <P>That Bill was fundamentally antidemocratic.  It was the antithesis of true devolution of authority and responsibility.  Control from the centre permeated every section of that Bill.  It attempted to reinforce and strengthen ministerial control over the education system at all levels.  One of the planks of the Bill was the establishment of ten regional education boards.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition totally opposed this extra tier of bureaucracy on the grounds that it would be too expensive and too remote from local education interests and would take control at local level from the schools.  The Bill gave the Minister effective control over the regional boards so that all control flowed back into her hands.</P>
    <P>The Bill also had a bias against denominational schools and the CPSMA were of the view that section 43 of the Bill represented the greatest intrusion by the State into the management by schools which are not established by the State. Denominational schools have been of fundamental importance to the development and growth of education since the foundation of the State and prior to it, and the Bill seemed to have ignored their rights.  Through our spokesperson, Deputy Martin, now Minister, we in Fianna Fáil promised that on our return to Government we would repeal the type of dictatorship from the centre as proposed in that Bill and also all the other obnoxious centrist proposals contained therein.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House, the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, reflects the Fianna Fáil philosophy on how the educational system should grow and develop into the new millennium.  It is universally acknowledged that our education system has served this country extremely well without the strangling, overwhelming central control which some on the left would like.  As our society has become more educated and more sophisticated, the silent partners in the education system, that is, parents and teachers, are taking a greater, more active role in the education system and wish to have their role given formal recognition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it has as one of its key objectives the provision to put on a legislative basis the roles and functions of all the partners in the education system.  Since his appointment as Minister for Education, the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, has not hidden away in his office in Marlborough Street.  He has consulted widely and wisely with all the partners in the education field to ensure that this Bill includes the provisions that will ensure our education system is up to speed to meet the rapidly changing demands in this era of technological development and of need for greater language skills.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> I welcome the decision by the Minister to exclude the setting up of regional boards so beloved by the former Minister.  We have been told since the Minister came into office where he was able to get information, even though the previous Minister was unable to give any idea of the cost of those regional boards.  Now we know they would have cost about £40 million.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan on 10 February 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises:</P>
    <P>that duty free shopping generates almost 2,000 jobs in Ireland,</P>
    <P>that revenue from duty free sales supports investment in infrastructure, vessels, and facilities by airport and ferry companies, that abolition of duty free sales may lead to higher travel costs to and from Ireland,</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the efforts made by Ireland, at EU level, to have the issue of intra-European duty free and tax free shopping re-examined by the European Commission and Council, and endorses the action taken by the Minister for Finance to carry out a study, by independent consultants, of the impact on Ireland arising from the ending of intra-European duty free and tax free shopping.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When we discussed the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill some months ago, many Deputies expressed grave concern at the proposed ending of the duty free trade and called on the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to take every conceivable action to have the decision reversed.  I commend the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke for some of the steps she has taken so far, such as instituting a broadly based study into the effects of the abolition of duty free and in raising the issue at every opportunity in European fora. However, she is a hapless victim in this campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that she has been placed in an invidious position by a decision taken by the Taoiseach a few short years ago.  This Government has become famous in the last few months for its string of U-turns on so many issues. I had to remind the Taoiseach last week about the upsurge of joyriding &mdash; where is zero tolerance?  What happened to the reverse on corporation tax?  Where is the support for the anti-nuclear campaign?  The Labour Party had to take the initiative on public sector pensions to make the Government live up to its election promises. We also had the unbelievable embarrassment for the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, of having to vote against a Bill on Sunday trading which he had drawn up and presented to the House in Opposition.  The Government's decision on duty free is another betrayal of the people, of thousands of suppliers and workers, which endangers the economies of north Dublin, Cork and Shannon. I call on the Minister, Deputy McCreevy to take every possible step to reverse the decision.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta developed the present concept of duty free and blazed the trail in airport shops and management.  In many countries it uses the facility &mdash; through airlines and in its own airport facilities &mdash; as a shop window for key Irish goods. Aer Rianta is a highly successful public sector company and in the debate before Christmas the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke said that about half Aer Rianta's profit comes from duty free and as a result we continue to have one of the lowest rates of airport charges in Europe, despite the rhetoric of some airline operators.  Our industry, particularly the food and drink sector, has been buoyed up by the operation of duty free and at least 2,000 jobs are totally dependent on it. Unfortunately, this Government is telling those people that their livelihood will vanish in the next few months &mdash; there is no hope.</P>
      <P>The northside of Dublin is in all our thoughts at the moment and some of us will spend a lot of time in the pleasant streets of Swords, Skerries, Rush, Balbriggan and other towns.  The airport has 8,000 workers and if one counts the surrounding industrial estates in Finglas, Ballymun, Clonshaugh and Baldoyle, perhaps 40,000 people are directly dependent on the aviation industry &mdash; many of these issues will be raised in tomorrow's debate on aviation.  A key ingredient of the success of that sector has been duty free.  Many famous goods, such as our whiskeys and Bailey's Irish Cream, received an important shot in the arm from duty free sales. There are still areas of deprivation in the northside and agencies such as Nordubco, the partnership company of Ballymun, Finglas, Coolock and Baldoyle, have tried to set in motion many enterprise and employment supports.  However, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy is pulling the rug from under the efforts of north Dublin communities over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> Who is responsible for this?  Last night the Minister for Finance blamed Commissioner Monti and said the matter was out of his hands, all we could do was hope.  However, the person clearly responsible is the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern.  As Minister for Finance in 1991, at an ECOFIN meeting for which he may not have been well prepared, where a unanimous decision was necessary to abolish duty free, he sold out the nation and the duty free industry in a disgraceful abnegation of duty.  He could have followed the past example of politicians from France, Germany and Britain by leaving the meeting but he refused to do so.  He took the popular, consensus route which was not in Ireland's interest.</P>
    <P>There were attempts last night to present the 1991 decision as almost inevitable but it was only a proposal.  Some conservative countries had ideological commitments to a single market, as we have seen from some of Commissioner Monti's recent pronouncements.  Nonetheless it was up to the Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Finance, to alter that decision but he failed dismally.  I hope the voters of Dublin North and Limerick East will bear this in mind and that Dublin North returns my colleague, Senator Ryan, to the House.</P>
    <P>We have seen widespread popular support throughout Europe for the retention of duty free. There was a massive demonstration in Brussels recently, attended by people from all 15 member states.  Some 140,000 jobs are endangered by this mad decision of the Finance Ministers.  Following the Luxembourg Summit, we are enjoined by the leaders of all parties to campaign for the success of the referendum on the Amsterdam treaty, but how can we sell that treaty when a key industry for this nation, which is heavily dependent on air transport, is endangered?  It is imperative that we tap into the groundswell of popular opinion in Europe opposing this measure.  The Minister for Finance said that only Finland would support us in taking on the crazy ideologues in the single market.  That is a useful start and other Nordic countries may support us also.</P>
    <P>Over the next few months we will have significant debates on European integration.  Distinguished commentators such as Mr. Damien Kiberd, Mr. Matt Cooper and Mr. Paul Tansey have indicated they would like us not to join the euro.  They outline why we should not give up our monetary independence, that it would be crazy in light of how well the economy has fared in the last three to four years, but at the end of their articles they leave the matter hanging.  Those gentlemen should be frank with us and spell out their considered view.  Those of us who supported European integration over the years find it more difficult to do so because of this crazy decision on duty free.</P>
    <P>From the middle of next year we will suffer a catalogue of negative economic consequences of this decision.  There will be higher charges at our airports and on our ferries and the price of consumer <Col N="108" /> goods will be subject to inflationary spirals. It could turn out to be a very negative economic force for our economy in many ways.</P>
    <P>In the current dispute, which will probably feature heavily in tomorrow's discussion on aviation policy, many people have said the success of Ryanair is due to the fact it could take advantage of duty free sales.  I commend the Minister for her sincere efforts at European level but I ask her, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to strengthen those efforts, to not give up the ghost and to continue to fight for an extension of our duty free sales industry.</P>

      <P>This afternoon I arranged a meeting with my German Transport Minister counterpart, Matthias Wissman, for Tuesday, 3 March, in Bonn.  There are growing indications the German Government may back the campaign for the retention of duty free sales after June 1999.  I also hope to meet the UK Deputy Prime Minister on Monday, 23 February.  I will underline the loss of jobs, dearer air fares and access costs if duty free sales are abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> Duty free sales began in 1947 with the passing of the Irish Customs Free Airport Act which installed the first duty free sales outlet at Shannon Airport.  It was a most imaginative step which grew from a small kiosk in Shannon Airport to a major business which, as Deputy Broughan rightly said, underpins much of the profits of Aer Rianta and provides much needed employment and a showcase for Irish goods.  In 1995 world-wide duty and tax free sales through airports and on ferries and airlines amounted to £13.1 billion. The EU is the largest market for those sales.</P>
    <P>In Ireland and elsewhere the existence of duty free sales has been crucial in helping many quality brands to become established or to be revived. Products such as crystal glass and cream liqueurs owe much of their success to the exposure they received in duty free outlets, which acted as showcases.  New lines were developed which became successful through duty free sales and word of mouth.</P>
    <P>As every speaker has said, we must highlight the link between duty free sales and transport. Ireland is an island beyond an island.  We have a small open economy which is heavily dependent on air and sea links with our trading partners.  The Irish experience has been that profits from commercial activities, particularly duty free sales, have enabled the transport sector to minimise access costs.  Deputy Yates spoke at a committee on which we both sit about the importance of this competitiveness.  We do not see this as a distortion of competition.  As we do not have the luxury of land borders with other member states, we see it as sound commercial practice to reduce access costs, both for exports and imports and for tourism.</P>
    <P>The position of our Government is that the duty free sales industry has been shown to make a major contribution to the economics of the travel industry.  My unrelenting call at Transport Council meetings of the European Union is that the European Commission must conduct a study into the economic and social impact of the implementation in 1999 of a decision taken in 1992.</P>
    <P>Time is short.  Reversal of the present decision requires a proposal from the Commission and agreement by ECOFIN.  I think they are afraid to conduct the study.  We unearthed a commitment to undertake a study by the then Commissioner of the European Parliament &mdash; a solid spoken commitment which was recorded in the minutes. This is also occurring against the background of the harmonisation of tax, which has not been realised and was a right wing, ideological stance at the time.</P>
    <P>The primary reason for abolishing duty free sales is that such sales are inconsistent with an internal market.  However, it is simply untrue that they are a distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that many elements of the single market will not be in place by 1999.  Huge disparities remain between the levels of excise duty applied in member states and will continue to do so for a long time to come.  The Commission is <Col N="110" /> no longer saying those rates must be harmonised, so why does it insist that duty free sales cannot exist in a Single Market?</P>
    <P>It has become a matter of dogma which should give way to a more practical, pragmatic approach. Customers want duty free sales.  Some commentators adopt the line that duty free sales are élitist &mdash; why should people &ldquo;subsidise&rdquo; the élite who travel?  That argument must have gone out 25 years ago.  The idea that one must be part of the élite before one can travel on an airline is élitist in itself. Did they never hear of ordinary people &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; going on package holidays for a week or travelling to see their folk around the world?  They have some harmless fun spending money in the duty free shops.  I have heard this argument from commentators who have a degree of influence on radio and television.  This argument about a travelling élite smacks of élitism itself.</P>
    <P>The latest argument I heard for abolishing duty free sales is that cigarettes and drink are bad for people.  Thank God we have not yet adopted a policy of forbidding people to smoke or drink.  All cigarette packs carry a Government health warning and advertising has been reduced, which is quite proper.  However, the idea of a nanny state telling people that they cannot buy a bottle of whiskey or wine because drink is bad for them is undesirable.  What about perfumes, make up and glassware, which are also available in duty free shops?</P>
    <P>People do not want to come home from holiday with money in their pockets which they could spend on the aeroplane.  On their journey out they are in good form and in a holiday mood&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and would like to spend some money.  They are not large sales but are modest impulse buys.  However, they create good employment in the duty free outlets and the companies which produce the goods.  They also reduce airport charges, which have been kept stable by Aer Rianta for 11 years.</P>
      <P>That all adds up to a good story.  However, the miserable, overly bureaucratic determination of Europe says that because a decision has been made it must be stuck to.  It upsets their &ldquo;neat&rdquo; minds to have what they allege is a distortion.  A recent survey showed that people in the UK are becoming disenchanted with Europe, although that has not happened yet in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is about employment but at one stroke it will take away much employment. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Cabinet agree with me on this matter and I have <i>carte blanche</i> to trumpet the cause of duty free sales in Europe, which I will do.  The Germans have a general election coming up and I hope they act.  I will ask other countries to rally to our cause.  I would like to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments so eloquently expressed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.  This debate has been useful and fairly constructive on the issue of the ending of duty free sales.  I am sure some of the confusion on the subject has now been cleared up.  In contributing to this debate, I echo and emphasise some of the points made last night.  It is crucial the House is at one on what is an important issue. Duty free sales have had cross party support in the past and it is important that it continue in the future if we are to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>The issue should not be a target for electoral point scoring and I am sorry to see that emerging. If we cannot convince ourselves on a single point of action &mdash; indeed, on a single cause &mdash; we stand no chance of convincing our partners, let alone a Commission that is hostile to the idea of reopening the duty free issue.  As we know, the Commission has stated that it regards the issue as past, settled and enacted into law.  The task before us is to change its mind and there is little value in dividing our forces.</P>
      <P>We should join in a clear effort to press the Commission to change its mind on duty free sales. This action is not the sole responsibility of this Government, although we will continue to keep up the pressure.  As was mentioned yesterday, Deputies opposite have also been in contact with the Commission, our Commissioner and, indeed, other Commissioners.  The more contact made with the Commission, the more it might get the message that we are serious about the potential impact of the ending of duty free sales on Irish travellers.</P>
      <P>As we are an island on the periphery of the EU and cannot drive directly to Europe, we are disproportionately dependent on air and sea travel. We need sea ferry routes available and we need them throughout the year, not only during the peak holiday months of the summer season. Any consolidation of routes as a result of this deadline would not be helpful to business and industry.  The leisure traveller would also be discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our network of regional airports, including my local airport at Waterford, all play an important part in local economies.  They help to underpin activity in the regions by making access for business and leisure travellers much easier.  Without <Col N="112" /> direct air services a weekend tourist trip from England to Dunmore East, for example, is hardly likely to be practicable.  The duty free issue is important not only for Dublin and Shannon, but for the whole country.</P>
    <P>We have led the running up to now and must continue to do so but we need allies, as the Minister for Public Enterprise outlined.  At this point I would like to turn to a misconception which is being put about that Ireland alone could have secured the permanent retention of duty free sales while agreeing on the tax arrangements for the Single Market.  It is not reasonable to allege that the Minister for Finance signed away duty free facilities in 1991.  A valuable agreement that paved the way for the Single Market was reached in ECOFIN.  The Single Market has been good for the economy, for jobs and for Europe also.</P>
    <P>We are now much clearer on the procedure required to change that decision.  How we got here in the first place is still the subject of some inaccurate reporting.  It must not be forgotten that the original Commission proposal was to end duty free sales on 31 December 1992.  Faced with this proposal for the immediate ending of duty free sales and the requirements to reach an agreement on central aspects of the tax arrangements for the Single Market, to achieve a seven and a half year extension against the views of the Commission must be recognised as a success for negotiating skills.  This meant reaching a compromise in the ECOFIN Council against the strong opposition of others who sought an immediate, or a very early end to duty free sales.  The common reaction at that time was pleasure and relief that a deal had been agreed.  The Opposition last night tried to argue that we should never settle anything at Council but veto every issue.  It seems to recommend the &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; approach that it criticises in others.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that Ireland came to the defence of the duty free industry and, with others, was instrumental in obtaining a delay in the abolition of duty free sales.  The seven and half years delay has provided a unique opportunity for the industry to prepare.  Seldom has such a long early warning been given.  Most industrialists would be delighted with such certainty as to market conditions. It is particularly regrettable that during that time the industry, which has spent considerable sums on publicity at home and abroad, has not mobilised much support in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The other misconception mentioned last night concerns the linkage with a possible harmonisation of excise rates.  Although the differing excise rates may well have been discussed, there was no agreed linkage between harmonisation and the extension to duty free sales.  The extension of time was to enable the industry to adapt. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, said yesterday that considering our strategy for taking this issue forward is crucial.  We know the Commission is strongly opposed to reopening this subject and we must avoid overplaying our hand and <Col N="113" /> being seen as the Irish eternally singing the same old song.</P>
    <P>One thing that may cause the Commission to reconsider is a well thought out and carefully documented and professionally substantiated impact analysis.  Rhetoric and emotional claims of doom have not made any impression on the Commission. We need to be able to show hard numbers to the Commission, not only figures based on particular pessimistic assumptions.  It is for this reason that the study being carried out for the Department of Finance by independent consultants is running somewhat behind the original schedule.  We have stressed the need to get this study right.  The consultants have very diligently gone back to those who provided some of the source data to be absolutely sure that all the information is complete and can be backed up under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We owe it to those affected to give our best even if this means a small delay.  We must also recognise that in the scale of issues in the European context in the run up to EMU, duty free sales are still a low priority for many of our partners. ECOFIN will be heavily involved with economic and monetary union over the next few months and would be more than irritated at a discussion on a case that is not well thought through, or one that does not have the support of several other member states.</P>
    <P>We need allies at the table and it is reasonable to suggest that will be central to Ireland leading the charge to reverse this decision on duty free sales. There are signs, because of the pressure from Ireland through various Ministers and the Taoiseach, that there is a rethink taking place.  Putting in place the hard evidence which will be available to us when the report is complete very shortly will be the key to making our case in a determined way and will enable us to substantiate all the issues which have been genuinely raised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which might help us to understand the attitude of the Commission.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, spelled out yesterday the main reasons put forward by the Commission for its approach to this subject. The abolition of duty free sales may be for the Commission a very visible sign of a leap forward in the progress towards a true single market.  For the Commission, the stakes are high.  If it rows back on this decision, its objective of a truly open and transparent Single Market is delayed, or set back if a permanent extension to duty free sales is agreed.</P>
    <P>We will continue the campaign at every opportunity. We must support the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise and those involved in pushing forward the issue.  There is nothing to be gained in electioneering on a national issue of common interest. I hope the House sees the wisdom of a united front on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Killeen.  I am disappointed that the EU is <Col N="114" /> pressing ahead with its stated intention to abolish duty free shopping at air and sea ports.  The group which formed the EU sold membership to states on the basis that it would benefit citizens.  I do not understand why the EU is now demanding that we conform to selected internal market rules. We are all more than aware of the disparity in excise and VAT within the EU.  Why is there a demand for conformity in this area only?</P>
      <P>The EU has not honoured its commitment to undertake a study into the consequences of the abolition of duty free shopping and Ireland has had to commission its own study.  The European attitude is a classic example of double think.  The bureaucrats are demanding that we meet a timeframe which is being imposed on us in the context of tax harmonisation within the EU.  We are all aware that fiscal parity within the Single Market is not a reality.  Tax harmonisation has not been achieved, but the EU has chosen to ignore this and is insisting on the abolition of duty free shopping which was only one part of the package of tax measures agreed in 1992.</P>
      <P>Will the EU compensate us for the loss of jobs and revenue we will suffer if we do not get a further derogation?  We should be given a derogation until such time as all member states are really equal in terms of taxation.  No recognition seems to be given to our dependence on the revenue generated by the tourism industry, of which duty free shopping is an integral part.  In this context, it would be more correct to refer to duty free shopping as travel shopping as it can only be availed of by those who travel.  Tourists generate much revenue and the loss of any portion of this will lead to a loss of employment.  There are 25 people employed in the duty free shopping section of Cork Airport which earns £2.5 million from duty free sales.  The abolition of duty free sales will also lead to the loss of vital advertising and selling outlets which act as a shop window for all that is best and beautiful in Ireland.  We could not pay for the publicity provided by duty free outlets.</P>
      <P>Duty free shopping was supposed to have been phased out as far back as 1987 but it was decided to defer implementation until 1993, following which we were given a final derogation until 1999. It is very difficult to understand the hard line being taken on this tax source given that a blind eye seems to be turned on many existing tax anomalies in Europe.  Ireland is a small nation and entitled to fair play.  The fact that duty free shopping is not a priority issue in Europe does not mean we should have to pay the price in terms of the loss of many hard earned jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be intervention by the Government at the highest level in actively canvassing European Heads of State, members of parliaments and MEPs.  However, we must adopt a unified approach and not be divisive.  I commend the Taoiseach on his efforts to prioritise this issue at last year's EU summit on employment.  He rightly highlighted the impact of the abolition of duty free shopping on employment in this and other <Col N="115" /> states.  While the Minister for Finance must adopt a proactive approach, he needs to be armed with the facts, which is why he is awaiting the study.  It is demoralising to realise that we are raising this issue more or less in isolation.</P>
    <P>I commend the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, for raising this issue during our Presidency of the EU.  Unfortunately, he did not succeed in his excellent presentation in convincing the Commissioner of the importance of the retention of duty free shopping.  I wish his colleagues in the Labour Party would follow his example and exercise their minds instead of their mouths.  The Labour Party was in Government from 1992-7 and the vocal professional knockers who spoke last night should produce their submissions during that period so that they can be fairly judged on their work record in regard to duty free shopping.  They should also invest in hand basins and towels so that they can perform their Pontius Pilate act in public in a more convincing manner.</P>
    <P>The bureaucrats in Europe are preoccupied with ensuring that all states market the same size potatoes and tomatoes.  They have even suggested that producers should market a straight cucumber of a standard size.  It would be better if they focused on the reality instead of being enthusiastic and voluble about such mind-boggling matters. They would be well advised to devote a similar amount of time to studying the jobs market.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the leader of the Fine Gael Party and his colleagues for their honesty in tabling this motion which acknowledges their inaction on this issue during their term in office.  They have been unfairly critical of the record of the Government and of their partners in the rainbow Government. While I am sure they made many inspiring speeches on this vital issue, I do not remember them.  I sincerely hope they are not suffering from a degree of lassitude.</P>
    <P>I support the Government amendment and urge all Members to do likewise in the national interest.  We should go forward together to fight at European level for a further derogation for duty free shopping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">

      <P>The proposed abolition of duty free sales poses a huge threat to tourism, industry and trade and will lead to an inevitable increase in sea and air fares and a loss of jobs.  A constructive approach to the issue is required.  Those who are serious about the issue should support the Government and put forward suggestions on how best to deal with it.  Unfortunately, some people have made a political football of the issue and used the opportunity of the debate to hurl insults at each other.  It is too late in the day for this and what we need is a constructive approach.  I am not impressed by the efforts from whatever quarter to belittle the importance of jobs in my constituency through silly point scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put on the record the background to duty free sales.  The setting up of duty <Col N="116" /> free shops at Shannon Airport in 1947 was the brain child of Dr. Brendan O'Regan.  As I am sure my colleague on the other side of the House is aware, he is still very active on this issue and has put forward several suggestions on how to deal with it.  Prior to 1947 the airport enjoyed custom free status under the Chicago Convention. Dr. O'Regan was successful in persuading the then Government to accept his revolutionary proposal and allow duty free shopping at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The revenue generated by duty free shopping was extremely important and provided the seed capital for setting up the Shannon industrial estate and the Bunratty medieval banquets.  I am sure many people thought this was a daft idea at the time.  Unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity to read the Dáil Official Report on the issue.  Dr. O'Regan had an uncanny knack of turning impractical ideas into major successes.</P>
    <P>Regardless of how successful State companies and agencies are, they can never fully address the problem of unemployment, particularly during times of recession.  Dr. O'Regan has suggested that the profits from duty free outlets should be linked with local community employment development initiatives.  As this is consistent with its policies, we should be able to persuade the EU to go down this road.  This initiative worked well in Britain in the 1980s when British Steel carried out much work in various unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>Duty free shops are very important in terms of employment and providing companies with a global window for their goods.  Many companies have gone on to achieve greater success as a result of this.  If duty free shopping is abolished the effects will be most keenly felt in the surrounding areas.  Direct employees are deeply concerned, as are suppliers of local craftspeople who depend on the outlets.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that at a time when unemployment is by far the greatest problem in the EU, this proposal is put forward by the competition-driven section at EU level.  Dr. O'Regan's advice was that confrontation between the Commission and the duty free sales lobby is not the way to proceed but rather to suggest initiatives, which to some extent would take the Commission off the hook and allow it to fit the various duty free shops into a European network to help local communities.  Dr. O'Regan did enormous work in that regard.  For instance, Dr. Stewart Evans, with whom he was in contact, suggested a levy on duty free outlets &mdash; in many countries they are private enterprises, here they are semi-State companies and in other countries they are State companies &mdash; and that it be directed, with European agreement, at specific employment funds as seed capital. That is entirely consistent with the EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, 1993, which envisages the development of work and employment, sustainable and internationally competitive, at local level.</P>

      <P>The contributions I have heard from the Fianna Fáil benches tonight indicate that it supports the motion put forward by the Opposition.  The best way to ensure a united House on this issue is for the Government to drop its amendment to the Opposition proposal and go to Brussels with a united House behind it. The arguments I will make and those made by the Opposition last night are precisely the same as those made on the other side of the House. There is no reason, therefore, for conflict and division in the lobbies tonight.  I appeal to the Government parties to withdraw their amendment and allow the House to pass the motion unanimously.</P>
      <P>The move to abolish duty free sales within the European Union is a reflection of the rigid and inflexible decision-making process that makes so many people in so many European countries cynical about the whole European project.  Someone, somewhere in the European bureaucracy decides that the concept of duty free sales is incompatible with the principle of the Single Market and that it must go, irrespective of the implications for jobs, the impact on the cost of air and sea travel and the consequences for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>As an island nation on the periphery of Europe, with a high level of travel between here and other European countries and a tourism industry that is crucial to our economy, the proposal to abolish duty free sales was clearly a matter of vital interest.  Most disappointing is not that we seem to have lost the battle to save the duty free industry, but that Fianna Fáil seems to have thrown in the towel so easily.  Duty free shops grew out of the idea of the custom free zone at Shannon airport pioneered in the 1940s by people like Dr. Tim O'Driscoll and Dr. Brendan O'Regan, in the face of the usual opposition from the Revenue Commissioners who warned that it would not work and insisted that the custom zone would have to be surrounded by a 20 foot high wall, barbed wire and flood lighting.  It was a short logical step from the first custom free zone to the first duty free shop.  The concept of duty free sales was one of the many fine things Ireland brought to the world, yet the Fianna Fáil Government seems content to see it washed away with little more than a token protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is justifiably regarded as a shrewd operator with his finger on the political pulse.  Yet his decision as a member of the Council of Finance Ministers in 1991 to agree to the abolition of duty free sales must rank, alongside his decision to introduce the tax amnesty, as one of the greatest political errors of his career.  Make no mistake about it, the damage was done in 1991 <Col N="118" /> when the then Minister, Deputy Ahern, went in and surrendered without a struggle.  Since then we have been fighting an uphill battle to recover ground.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how any Government or international body like the EU would deliberately put people out of work.  Sometimes governments have to make difficult decisions leading to job losses where, for instance, a State-owned industry is a huge loss maker with no future and costing taxpayers an excessive amount of money.  It defies belief that any institution would decide purely for dogmatic reasons, to jeopardise 11,000 jobs in this country and 140,000 in the wider EU by imposing a death sentence on an industry that is successful, viable and popular with the general public.</P>
    <P>The ideological basis on which the decision of 1991 was based &mdash; the assumption that full harmonisation of tax rates in EU countries would be in place by 1999 &mdash; no longer holds water.  Tax policies in member states are more divergent than ever.  Duty free sales have been an important element in air and sea travel for almost 50 years. They have stimulated trade, created jobs and helped keep travel costs down.  As night follows day, their abolition will reduce trade, jeopardise jobs and increase travel costs.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is one of Ireland's most successful and go ahead companies.  Its expertise is in demand all over the world and it runs airport shops in the most unlikely of places, but its core business is running Irish airports.  Duty free sales account for about 40 per cent of Aer Rianta profits. If that revenue goes, it will have to be made up in other ways.  Car parking charges are likely to increase, as are landing and handling charges for aircraft &mdash; according to Aer Rianta's commercial manager, Frank O'Connell, they will increase by 50 per cent &mdash; and these will inevitably be passed on to the public though higher air fares.</P>
    <P>The same is likely to happen in regard to ferry travel, an area where much of the travel is for leisure purposes, often day trips.  Ferry companies estimate that every 10 per cent increase in fares leads to a decrease of about 10 per cent in the numbers travelling.</P>
    <P>The knock-on effects on the tourism industry are likely to be quite dramatic.  The Irish Duty Free Association has estimated that the abolition of duty free sales could lead to an increase of 30 per cent in travel costs and a consequent loss of 760,000 visitors to Ireland each year.  Even if, as a group with a vested interest in this area, that association has painted the worst possible scenario, even if it is only half right in its estimates, the consequences would be catastrophic.  Some £50 million worth of goods were sold by Aer Rianta in duty free shops in Ireland.  The total Irish duty free market is double that.  A huge proportion of this consists of Irish made products. Some 20 per cent of Irish Distillers' whiskey sales are made through duty free shops.  Duty free buying is virtually all discretionary spending.  People <Col N="119" /> buy a bottle of whiskey or a bottle of perfume because the duty free shop is there, but if the duty free shops are gone, they are not likely to go down to the supermarket and make the same purchase. Trade will suffer and jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>The free movement of people is one of the cornerstones on which the EU is supposed to be built.  Is it not a great irony that the EU is now proposing to do away with something that makes travel cheaper and more accessible to the majority of people?  Time is ticking away, but it is not too late to act, if action is taken immediately. There are 16 months before the June 1999 deadline is reached, but a far more aggressive and proactive approach is required on the part of the Government.  The Taoiseach promised to raise the matter at the pre-Christmas EU summit, yet nothing happened.  He must grab the attention of the other leaders and ensure they know how important this matter is to this country.  If this requires banging a few tables, that should be done.  The motion before the House suggests the Taoiseach should contact each head of government in the EU.  That is the minimum that must be done.</P>
    <P>We are discussing an issue that has the potential to do significant damage to the aviation industry and it would be inappropriate to finish without briefly referring to another issue that has the potential to damage the aviation industry, that is the dispute at Ryanair.  It is appalling that we are standing aside and allowing the Ryanair company and its chief executive, Mr. O'Leary, to rubbish the social partnership on which good industrial relations have been built in recent years.  It will be catastrophic if the disease of refusing to negotiate with legitimate trade unions in a company is allowed to stand.  I appeal to the Government to do everything possible urgently before this dispute escalates out of control.</P>

      <P>The decision to abolish duty free and tax free sales was unanimously adopted by the Council of Ministers representing EU member states in 1991.  The Taoiseach represented Ireland at that critically important meeting in his then role as Minister for Finance.  He is the only person who now has the opportunity to right that wrong.  If he had used his veto in 1991 we would not find ourselves in this position.</P>
      <P>Duty and tax free sales are a major international business.  For example, in 1995 global DTF sales were valued at $20.5 billion.  In that same year, DTF sales by the principal Irish owned operators exceeded £85 million, which is small in the context of the global figures. However, it is of major importance to Ireland for two reasons.  First, Irish DTF sales per head of population are the fourth highest in the EU. Second, intra-EU duty and tax free sales comprise almost 80 per cent of total DTF sales in Ireland.  Abolition would, therefore, have major repercussions for the travel business here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> Cessation of DTF would deprive travellers within Europe of access to cheaper goods.  More important, duty free abolition will increase passenger fares to and from Ireland and will increase the international transport costs facing Irish exporters.  For example, Aer Rianta estimates that it will need to raise charges and fares by as much as 50 per cent to restore profitability to preabolition levels.  This would have serious implications for the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Reductions in access fares have played a key part in initiating and consolidating the tourism drive that Ireland has fortunately experienced over the last decade.  The abolition of intra-EU duty and tax free sales will halt and reverse reductions in access fares, making it more difficult for tourism to expand in the future.  In addition, Irish exporters will be unable to avoid these increased charges by substituting road or rail deliveries for shipping or air freight because of the absence of a land bridge with the UK and Europe.  It must be clear to the Minister that higher passenger fares and increased freight rates will have negative implications for the tourism and export sectors of the economy.  It cannot be overlooked that revenue from duty free sales supports investment in infrastructure, vessels and facilities by airport and ferry companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An even more potentially serious consequence for regional airports supplying duty free airgas and Jet A1 aircraft fuel is the inevitable reduction of airport business opportunities.  In the case of Donegal International Airport, with which I am familiar, duty free sales constitute a significant percent of earnings, but the greater concern for the company would be the threat to airline routes and future route development arising out of increased fuel prices.  The fuel volumes consumed within aviation represent a major overhead.  The impact on the bottom line for all companies involved in international travel, transportation and tourism resulting from the proposed change would be very negative.  The resulting differential on fuel rates from intra-EU transportation will cause a huge cost burden on airlines.  A review of such services, especially on regional routes comprising mainly fare sensitive leisure and tourism markets, is likely to follow.</P>
    <P>Passengers using Donegal International Airport are mostly Scottish and Irish visiting friends and family.  They enjoy the fun of getting a good deal in duty free shopping.  If such purchasing enables airlines and other vital industries to gain cost savings by spreading charges in a more beneficial and universal way why change it?  The significant loss in revenue to airport and airline companies, highlighted in the recent report on the status of duty free sales by Tansey, Webster and Associates, is of major concern to regional airports.</P>
    <P>Overall, the abolition of duty and tax free sales would be a major blow to our regional airports and would result in lost revenue, significant fuel increases to international airlines, increased air <Col N="121" /> fares, reduced employment and lower traffic growth rates.  The Minister and the Government have a duty to undo the damage inflicted by the 1991 agreement in which they participated.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in expressing my regret that the Government does not appear to be taking this matter seriously.  I read the speech by the Minister for Finance and listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, earlier.  They appear to concede that the decisions on duty free sales are almost irrevocable.  The Taoiseach conceded as much during Question Time.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minster for Finance said:</P>
      <P>Naturally, the more Heads of Government and Finance Ministers call for a discussion on this subject, the greater the pressure on the Commission to bring forward a proposal, but I sometimes wonder if the pivotal role of the Commission in the handling of EU business is fully understood.  It is the Commission who must be persuaded in the first instance, not the Government, Finance Ministers nor Heads of Government.  The Commission must be persuaded of the need to keep duty free.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, indicated how they propose to change the Commission's position.</P>

      <P>The most disconcerting moment in the House yesterday was Deputy Noonan's reference to two letters, one from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the other from Commissioner Flynn.  As they have not succeeded in even getting Commissioner Flynn to listen to their case I am not convinced that the Minister and Minister of State are serious about helping the duty free interest.  The Commissioner offers no comfort to anybody.  Coming from County Mayo he knows most about the impact of peripherality.  There is even a reliance on duty free sales in County Mayo, at Knock.  The Minister for Finance never mentioned the role of the Commissioner in his speech.</P>
      <P>The real problem is a lack of understanding of the aviation industry.  When the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, removed the transatlantic status of Shannon Airport no preparation was made for the future.  It was known at that time that the abolition of duty free sales was inevitable.</P>

      <P>As time is limited I will not repeat the many significant and important points made by other speakers.  However, I ask the Government to take them on board.  Duty free sales are as vital to Ireland now for economic reasons as when they were first set up.  Two of the most significant and important developments in the economy are the promotion of tourism and the production and export of high quality products.  Duty free sales at air and sea ports contribute greatly to the success of this business and I hope this will expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sea and almost all air traffic from Ireland is to EU countries.  The trade is not peripheral although Ireland is peripheral and, therefore, the damage to the sale and marketing of Irish products and the indirect business associated with them is almost impossible to calculate and predict accurately.  The employment and increased travel resulting from the attraction of duty free sales are most significant as is the concentration of employment in certain areas which is beneficial to the entire community.  For example, Aer Rianta <Col N="123" /> estimates that at least 250 jobs at Dublin Airport can be attributed to its duty free business.  In my constituency, Dun Laoghaire, the ferry services are substantially subsidised and supported by duty free sales.  They are the life blood of the area and in turn add to the network of business and tourism flowing from the throughput of passengers.</P>
    <P>Duty free outlets are the sales windows for good quality Irish products.  Most of the cosmetics and perfumes sold are made abroad but there is a huge increase in production in this area and duty free is the outlet in which they could market their products.  Half the alcohol, two thirds of cigarette and three quarters of jewellery and glass sales are Irish made products.  Suppliers to duty free outlets who manufacture in Ireland and sell directly to them depend to a significant degree on those sales.  Deputy De Rossa and others referred to the high level of duty free sales of Irish Distillers and Gilbey products.  Some specialist companies rely almost entirely on duty free outlets. They might go under because a higher percentage of their sales and marketing depend on duty free outlets.  As other Members pointed out, travellers also gain.  I will not repeat the points about the increase in the costs of fares and services and that improved standards will be denied to passengers if the subsidy provided by duty free profits is abolished.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a good case to make in Europe and I hope, as Deputy De Rossa said, that the House will act collectively on this matter.  There is also a collective feeling among other EU countries which will be adversely affected by the abolition of duty free sales.  These countries include Finland and Sweden which as a result of their location will be seriously affected.  This aspect also applies to Ireland.  The difficulty is to get across the point to the mainland Continent that the ease of travel there in terms of car and train journeys is not afforded to Ireland.  We must stress our reliance at every level of business, tourism and social activity on transport by water or air in terms of people travelling from Ireland or attracting tourists.  This aspect must be made clear.</P>
    <P>Regional differences and disparities have always been recognised in the European Community. This is one of the most positive aspects of the EU.  Many battles have been fought and won with regard to the harmonisation of the production of sausages and cheese.  We must win this battle.  If other countries and cultures can make their points, stress the practical good sense of their arguments and win, Ireland has a powerful argument to make.  I appeal to Members to work collectively.  The House should run with this motion and ensure that the Legislature and all elected representatives are full square behind the case being made in Europe.  The Government should use its lobbying potential and Commission contacts to get the other countries which will be adversely affected on board.  We cannot allow the <Col N="124" /> abolition of duty free sales.  Reversals and revisions have already taken place in the EU. This is what a community is supposed to involve and I appeal to the Government to take this matter on board.  It is not partisan because it involves everybody and our future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is fine except for the part which condemns the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with two specific aspects.  I did not think Ireland would reach the depths of the debate which took place in Britain on its sausages or the curvature of a banana. However, this type of maniac tendency has unfortunately gripped the public's imagination.  The public in Ireland and in the EU supports a basic and fundamental part of travel in modern Europe.  The issue has clear public support and it is obvious that a certain number of jobs are provided in the EU as a result of duty free sales.  A turnover of approximately £4.5 billion a year in the EU is generated and 140,000 jobs are provided. The entire European Union wins if the <i>status quo</i> in relation to duty free sales continues. Yet a maniac decision to abolish it was taken some time ago by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>European institutions must get a handle on the issues which are important to people in the EU. I condemn the European Parliament in this regard.  I read its six page report but it is all over the place on the issue.  If the European Parliament has any teeth and is supposed to represent European citizens and advocate their case, it should have the clear position that it is opposed to the abolition of duty free sales in June 1999 by the Commission.  The Parliament must get its head round this issue, take a clear position and respond to the popular view in the EU.  The case for the retention of duty free sales has popular support.  Countries such as Ireland are winning as a result of duty free sales and it would be ridiculous to change the <i>status quo</i> which has created so much extra revenue and jobs.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment calls on the Minister for Finance to carry out a study and to do everything possible to lobby against the abolition of duty free sales.  However, that is not the view of the current chairman of ECOFIN, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown.  He is very clear in his views.  After the first meeting since Britain took over the Presidency on 9 January he said:</P>
      <P>There is no widespread move to revisit that decision.  I have not seen any evidence of support for duty free among the member states.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister doing if the Chancellor says no opposition to this matter is being raised at ECOFIN meetings?  The British Chancellor has stated that our Government has not done enough to raise this matter where it counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because, like all Members, I support duty free.  I recognise <Col N="125" /> that duty free is not about the £7.99 bottle of whiskey, cheap perfume or great value in aftershave. It is a £13 billion industry world-wide that is worth £100 million to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members should support the amendment.  The Government is correct in undertaking a study of the economic impact of this decision.  It is the only way we will be able to convince our partners in Europe.</P>
      <P>That is where the problem lies.  It is difficult to have this matter raised at ECOFIN.  Duty free is not as important to other European countries as it is to us.  We are the only country without a land bridge to the rest of Europe, and we are heavily dependent on the export industry.  Other countries can maintain duty free for travel outside the EU, which is an option we do not have apart from with America.  It will not affect Heathrow, Amsterdam or Frankfurt, which are hubs to the rest of the world.  Duty free is not important to some of the southern European countries because alcohol and cigarettes are cheap there. It is not important to other mainland European countries because they have land borders.</P>
      <P>However, it is a showcase for Irish products. Duty free is directly responsible for 1,500 jobs and a further 6,000 jobs in manufacturing and services. It helps to maintain our ferries and airports. We cannot afford to have our tourism drive affected by higher fares.  Aer Rianta claimed that charges would rise by 50 per cent, which would restrict the numbers coming to Ireland.  Dún Laoghaire, my constituency, depends on ferries which, if duty free were abolished, would suffer a £9 million loss based on last year's figures.  There would be higher fares, and Dún Laoghaire benefits from 150,000 to 170,000 day trippers each year who come over on cheap fares and take advantage of duty free shopping.  Duty free revenue is reinvested in developments like the HSS ferry, which crosses in 99 minutes.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of investment needed by the ferries and by towns like Dún Laoghaire, which is a thriving port.  For that reason I support the Government's efforts.  The Dáil should call on the rest of Europe to support our efforts and not condemn the Government.  This decision was taken some years ago and now seems to be catching us unprepared.  There is a criticism that duty free only affects the élite &mdash; those who travel.  There are six million people among that élite, because that is the number of people who benefited from our duty free shops.  If this means the cheap whiskey, perfume or whiskey, so what?  It also means high employment, high reinvestment and high tourism figures.  That is an industry we cannot afford to lose.</P>

      <P>The abolition of duty free will have a severe effect not just on the national economy but in local areas such as Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  The loss of 1,500 direct jobs and 6,000 jobs in manufacturing and services would be very hard.  The Government must ensure this does not happen and must fight all the way.  Europe cannot dictate that these jobs will go.  A Fianna Fáil Government sold out on duty free in 1991, and a Fianna Fáil Government must now recover this facility in the interests of the economy and the families of those depending on it.</P>
      <P>Duty free has been part of international travel for decades.  The world-wide turnover is approximately £13 billion and the Irish turnover is approximately £100 million.  The abolition of duty free would have severe cost implications for travel, as Deputy Hanafin said.  An increase of 50 per cent in air charges would adversely affect travel costs, tourism, commercial efficiency and international trade.  Business is now an international activity, and businessmen travel around Europe on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The abolition of duty free would be another nail in the coffin of Shannon Airport, which has been fighting a rearguard action for decades to preserve what it has created over 50 years.  The removal of the stopover has had a severe effect. Figures are bandied about, but there is a noticeable reduction in activity in Shannon now compared to the situation before the stopover was abolished.  I do not know where the air traffic authorities are getting their figures, but Shannon has been severely affected.  Recent hints from Aeroflot that its business may not continue in Shannon suggest another blow.  If duty free is abolished, Shannon will have another nail in its coffin.</P>
      <P>I implore the Government to fight tooth and nail for the retention of duty free for the benefit of those employed in that area, the economy and the regions directly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important motion, because the future of our airports depends on duty free.  Our airports will not survive without duty free shopping outlets.  The Government cannot approach this matter with kid gloves.  When this move was first mooted, the Taoiseach was in the driving seat to lobby support from his counterparts in the EU to nip it in the bud. However, he threw in the towel at the fateful EU meeting and accepted the termination of duty free facilities by the end of 1999.  We appear to be acknowledged as the goody goodies of the EU. We are quick to accept EU laws without fighting for our rights in that forum.  We must impress on the EU that we are the only island nation in the EU since Great Britain was joined to mainline Europe by the Channel Tunnel.  Surely the status of an island nation should ensure we get preferential treatment in so far as duty free is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach to lobby his counterparts in the EU to retain our duty free facilities.  I urge the Government to support the motion because <Col N="127" /> united we stand, divided we fall on this issue.  It is well known that the viability of our three major airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, will be seriously jeopardised if we do not maintain our duty free image in Europe.  We are not at the crossroads in Europe where major airlines meet. It is important that we show a united front.  I appeal to the Minister to support the motion and fight to retain our duty free facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Our spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Noonan, clearly outlined the political reality of this matter in his speech last night.  At best one could describe the Taoiseach's performance as half-hearted, at worst he must be accused of being disingenuous.  When there was unanimity on the matter in 1991, not only did he sign away our duty free facility, we now have evidence that the British, the Spanish and the Portuguese sought a 15 year derogation, which would have run to the year 2007.  Yet we sought only a five year derogation and they averaged out what happened in the peripheral states.  The evidence shows that the Government's sympathy on this issue extends only to the polling day for the two relevant by-elections.</P>
      <P>The real effect of the abolition of duty free became apparent yesterday in the statement by the commercial manager of Aer Rianta, Mr. Frank O'Carroll, on the consequences of the abolition of duty free for his business.  It is significant to note that between 1987 and 1997 there was no increase in airport charges.  Passengers travelling through Dublin Airport increased from 3.5 million in 1987 to 10.5 million last year.  It is evident that the majority of travel is discretionary and lower fares in Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in conjunction with the freeze on charges, were pivotal to that increase.  If, as Aer Rianta claims, a 50 per cent increase in airport charges applies from 1 July 1999, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, which are number 46 on the competitive league table of a standard 737-400 Boeing aircraft, will move to the top ten in charges in Irish punts on a 70 per cent load factor.  The cost for such an aircraft to land will increase from £1,048 to approximately £1,800 Irish punts.  That will be one major impact of the decision to abolish duty free.</P>
      <P>The fastest growing segment of the passenger market in the marine sector is the day return trip to avail of duty free facilities.  There will be a major hole in our revenues when our tourism industry is underpinned by cheaper and more competitive access transport.  Ireland will suffer disproportionately as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the procedure at Council of Ministers' meetings in Brussels.  There is a facility for a member state to table an item for discussion 14 days before a meeting takes place.  When I was Minister I frequently used the facility to raise questions about sheep compensations, APSs and export refunds for beef and grain in the agriculture <Col N="128" /> sector.  Did the Minister ever table a text or a formal debate, as opposed to an <i>ad hoc</i> addendum to a speech that merely shows he raised the matter at Commission level?</P>
    <P>If duty free is abolished the future will be dismal. Airports like Heathrow that deal with large volumes of traffic travelling outside the Union will still be able to sell duty free.  The average sales per person in US shops is approximately £3 per head whereas in Europe it is approximately £13 per head.  Our duty free business will shrink to a quarter of its existing rate.</P>
    <P>The matter should be raised at prime ministerial level.  We share many common interests with the UK, which currently holds the EU Presidency, there is increasing support from Germany on this matter and the peripheral Scandinavian states experience many access problems.  When all those matters are considered it is obvious what we should do.  When we were in Government we inherited beef fines of the order of £192 million, but every week the Taoiseach contacted Mr. Santer and his permanent secretariat to make a concerted effort, which involved Iveagh House and DG VII, to resolve the matter.  It is possible to devise a strategy with our Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The Government has accepted defeat on this issue.  What will happen to those selling goods in the duty free shops and those involved in the manufacture of them?  The Government has not sought compensation for those who will be affected.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is paddling a canoe and pretending to put up a valiant fight, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are simply sitting on their hands.  This motion had to include a condemnation of the Government's lassitude because it is not fully engaged.  The letter from Commissioner Flynn to Deputy Noonan clearly indicates the lack of sympathy the national commissioner has for this issue.</P>
      <P>This is a national priority.  I have never seen the Commission neglect an issue where the national interest of a member state was at stake.  The Commission will fight for the rights of small member states.  I do not accept the crocodile tears, the explanations or apologies that are going nowhere.  The ground is being prepared politically, we did our best but nothing more could be done.</P>
      <P>I commend the motion to the Independent Deputies.  We will not forget this issue, given that people's livelihoods and jobs are at stake.  We must maintain the underpinning of our aviation, marine and tourism sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated the punctuality rate on the Sligo line is 94 per cent on average. This is not disputed but she ignored the fact that travel times can only disimprove because of deteriorating track quality.  She has not disputed the assertion that the track is reaching its expiry date.  This has led to speed reductions.  An investment of £30 million is required to upgrade the remaining 80 miles of track.</P>
      <P>The target travel time specified in the operational programme of two hours 45 minutes on the Sligo-Dublin line will not be achieved by 1999.  It takes the same length of time to travel from Mullingar to Sligo as it did in 1863.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that £12.5 million is being invested in track work on the Sligo line but this is confined to the Dublin-Mullingar section with the bulk being spent on the Dublin-Maynooth section.  The Minister stated that between 1991 and 1996 sections of the track between Sligo and Mullingar which were becoming dangerous were improved.  That was a fire hosing exercise. There are speed restrictions on two thirds of the line.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that over £800,000 is to be invested per year in track renewal in the period 1994-8.  At this rate of investment, it will take 40 years to improve the track in line with modern standards.</P>
      <P>I would like clarification from the Minister on the £800,000 fund.  My information is that a considerable portion of this fund is spent on areas other than track and that of the £800,000, only £200,000 will be spent on track.  That is of major concern and I would like an assurance that the £800,000 will be spent on track.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of new carriages on the east coast but we have two carriages on the Sligo line which are past their lifecycle.  They require complete internal refurbishment and repainting but preferably replacement.  The investment on the overall rail network is £275 million but sadly on the Mullingar section we are only receiving 2.5 per cent of that.</P>
      <P>The proposed curtailment of the number of people who can travel on a Friday is of concern. No encouragement is given to people to travel on a Friday and this will result in a major loss of tourism to the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's categoric assurance that the line will not be closed but that is not sufficient. <Col N="132" /> The Minister must ensure we get some funding from the Exchequer.  We depend too much on the Cohesion Fund and I understand from a report that the possibility of obtaining funds from the Cohesion Fund is very much under question.  I appeal to the Minister to allocate some funding from the Exchequer because Iarnród Éireann has indicated it cannot afford the investment on the line.  We have all heard about the Celtic tiger but it is not on the Mullingar-Sligo line, not even the cub.  I ask the Minister to allocate some Exchequer funding at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing time with me on this important issue.  Industrial development in tourism in Sligo, Leitrim, Longford and Roscommon is being seriously inhibited by the lack of any initiative on the Sligo-Mullingar line.  Iarnród Éireann is now seeking EU funding for the Athlone-Westport line but that is only a small step in the right direction. Must we have another accident similar to that in Knockcroghery before funding is approved for the Sligo-Mullingar line?</P>
      <P>Two rail lines pass through my constituency and the upgrading of those has stopped just at the border of the constituency.  I thank the Minister for ordering a review of safety in Iarnród Éireann but when will the report be published?  Will the Government give a commitment to allocate the necessary funding?</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry raised an important issue in that £800,000 should be spent on rail upgrading but that has not happened.  The money is being spent on repairs to parts of the existing line and on railway gates that have been damaged, etc. I ask the Minister to allocate funding for this work because both the Westport and the Sligo lines are badly in need of funding to ensure we do not have another accident similar to that referred to earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interest in the matter.  The conclusions of the CIE investigation outlined the exact reason for the accident at Knockcroghery.  It was not as stated by Deputy Naughten but I do not wish to go into that.  The conclusions of the investigation are available.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of clarifying the position in relation to the allocation of funding for the development of the rail network, including the Sligo line.  The funding currently comes from both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and from CIE.  The bulk of the funding for the Sligo line comes from the Cohesion Fund.  There is also the earlier funding from EU supported programmes approved by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>Over the years financial constraints have led to significant under-investment in the renewal of the railways.  This is reflected in the fact that in 1993, the investment needs for the entire railway network were estimated to be £800 million over a 30 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> The Operational Programme for Transport recognised that the railway required an integrated investment and development programme in order to maintain and improve its competitiveness. Under the operational programme we started a substantial railway renewal programme, the first since the lines were originally built.  Total investment will amount to £275 million and this investment is being focused on track renewal, signalling systems and rolling stock.  All major lines are included and the work being undertaken will result in increased safety.</P>
    <P>The main part of the funding for the Dublin-Sligo line, and indeed for track and signalling, comes from the Cohesion Fund.  The lines must be included in the trans-European rail network. The Dublin-Sligo line was successfully included as part of the trans-European rail network and consequently is benefiting from this fund.</P>
    <P>A total of £14 million has been allocated to the signalling system on four routes, including Dublin-Sligo. This money is being used to replace the old mechanical system with a new, modern, cost effective and centralised control system.  The Maynooth-Sligo section of the route will benefit from that.</P>
    <P>In relation to track work, EU supported investment is currently being concentrated on the Dublin to Mullingar section.  The background to this is that a socio-economic cost benefit analysis must be undertaken before any investment proposals are approved by the EU.  In the case of the Dublin-Sligo line, independent consultants, retained by the EU Commission, recommended that the EU co-financed investment in track work should be undertaken on the Dublin-Mullingar section. As a result, £12.5 million was allocated to upgrading track on the Dublin-Sligo line between Dublin and Mullingar.  This work involves the replacement of life expired jointed track on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on prestressed concrete sleepers.  This allocation, however, should not be seen as being to the detriment of other sections of the line.  Subject to the limitations imposed by EU cost benefit considerations, this represents the best use of available funds because it maximises the benefit in terms of improved quality of service to all users of the line.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, additional work has been carried out by Iarnród Éireann and funded from its own resources.  I understand from the company that in the period 1994-7, critical sections of track on the line between Mullingar and Sligo were improved at a cost of almost £3 million.  Iarnród Éireann has also assured me that track work on the Mullingar-Sligo section of the line will benefit from another £1 million plus in 1998.  This is again being funded from the company's own resources, and that would include the subsidies which taxpayers paid to Iarnród Éireann of over £100 million per year.</P>
    <P>It has already been acknowledged that substantial investment is needed but it must be planned and prioritised.  The 1994-9 programme represents a tremendous start and shows a renewed <Col N="134" /> commitment to the railways.  We must now look to the future.  I have asked CIE to prepare and prioritise investment plans for both the mainline and suburban rail networks in the context of securing future EU or other funding.  That work is now nearing completion and will provide the basis for the next programme of investment.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring that our rail services are operated safely.  That is my first priority.  The company has given an assurance that safety is its main priority. Securing the safe operation of railways is a primary factor in determining how the company uses the financial and other resources at its disposal. Achieving acceptable levels of safety is a complex task, as we all know.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that although investment in new equipment and in the proper maintenance of the existing equipment is vital to safety, it is only one element in the company's overall strategy.  Following the Knockcroghery accident, Iarnród Éireann carried out a special detailed examination of all jointed track throughout the country.  This was completed before Christmas and additional resources are now being made available by the company to implement recommendations arising from that examination. An engineer or an engineering member of the staff of Iarnród Éireann walked every mile of the jointed track operated by Iarnród Éireann throughout the country, both before and after Christmas.  The company has also reviewed its inspection process and strengthened both its frequency and quality.</P>
    <P>As a result of my concern about the incidence of recent rail accidents I am in the course of appointing independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety.  We applied in the EU journals, as required, and received a total of 16 bids. They are now being evaluated and the consultants will be appointed by the end of this month. This review will be the first to be carried out in this State.  Based on that I hope we will prioritise future needs.  The railways have served this country well.  I am interested in the railway system as is the Government and it will not close railway lines as presaged and forecast in l985 when the then Fine Gael led Government raised real fears along the western sea board that this rail line would be closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming to reply to this Adjournment debate.  I was knocked for six when I discovered the position that prevailed in two meat plants in Carlow.  I had some involvement with Ballon Meats when it did what it was asked to do, to spend money upgrading its plant.  It spent £1.5 million on upgrading it to the required European standard.  Last November it was visited, checked and passed as having reached that standard.  The difficulty is the Minister's Department, through the fault of the Minister or that of the Minister for Finance although that is immaterial at this stage, will not appoint a vet that will allow that private company, which has invested £1.5 million in upgrading its plant, to export meat.  That is penny pinching of the worst kind.  It is a prime example of being penny wise and pound foolish. Why should anyone believe Department officials who say if a meat plant upgrades its facilities it will be allowed export meat when the Minister will not appoint a vet who will give that plant the freedom to do that and get EC numbers.</P>
      <P>Fair Oak Foods Limited took over a plant that was closed for five or six years.  It opened last March, employs 100 people and has one permanent agricultural officer and three temporary officers who come and go.  It will have to let workers go if there is not stability soon.  One permanent agricultural officer is not enough.  We want to sell meat and export it to Europe.  There is no justification for any saving in that regard.  It is an injustice to those who have taken up the call and set about providing employment and a market for farmers for beef.  The farmers have done their bit as has the meat plant, but the Department, the adviser, the one who sets the standards, has fallen down badly on the job.  I hope the Minister will have a solution to this problem because it is too serious for anything other than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter.  I assume he is referring to local abattoirs <Col N="136" /> which were under the control of the local authorities and now, having reached the required standards as set down in the EU Directive 64/433/EEC, come under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>That directive governs the production and marketing of fresh meat for intra-community trade. It was amended to extend the rules applicable to export approved meat plants to all fresh meat producing establishments in the Community including those which heretofore traded only on the domestic market.  That amendment came into effect from January 1993 and was transposed into Irish law in 1997.  Under those regulations all abattoirs slaughtering in excess of 1,000 livestock units per year and cutting plants producing in excess of five tonnes of meat per week must meet the full standards of the directive.  Premises complying with these regulations are entitled to engage in domestic or international trade.  As a result a number of premises previously under the control of the local authorities must now reach the full standards of the directive and be approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Any premises approved under the directive must be supervised by the veterinary inspectorate of the Department.</P>
      <P>Some of the new EU approved plants may slaughter only one day a week.  This slaughtering capacity does not warrant the full-time presence of a veterinary inspector from the Department. These are supervised by departmental vets located in larger meat plants in that region.  In addition, the Department employs, on a temporary basis, vets in private practice in those meat plants.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 a total of 37 slaughtering and cutting up establishments have reached full directive standard and have been approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In addition, two further premises meet the required standards but cannot be approved due to staff constraints. There are a further 26 premises in the process of upgrading and it is anticipated that those premises will reach full directive standard and be ready for approval within the coming year.  When approved it is a requirement of the EU directive that supervision is provided by the competent authority, the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the key information.  The Department of Agriculture and Food, like all other Departments, is obliged to carry out its functions based on a fixed number of staff.  The policy of capping civil servant numbers was initiated some time ago.  Accordingly, the Department of Agriculture and Food must prioritise its resources to ensure the most effective delivery of services to the public.  I am aware of the pressure being put on our veterinary services at present and am ensuring that veterinary numbers are <Col N="137" /> maintained at the maximum allowed by the capping policy.  I am also mindful of the problem this situation causes for the plants in question.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is currently engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance in relation to employing temporary agricultural officers to enable the newly approved meat premises to export and I will do everything possible to alleviate the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a very reasoned case.  There are two plants in Carlow and a number of others around the country which have expended substantial amounts of money on upgrading their premises to the standards set out in the directive and they require supervision.  I will take a personal interest in the matter raised by the Deputy to see if the problem can be resolved.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sale of Irish Beef by British Multiples.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me time to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Agriculture and Food for coming to reply to it.  It is important not only for farmers but consumers and the country as a whole.  It has fairly serious implications because of the effect this type of unilateral action at national level can have on the European Community Framework for competition and the availability of a level playing pitch.  As Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture, food and rural development and coming from a midland county where beef production is the paramount farming activity, anything that appears to impinge or have a negative influence on that activity can have a detrimental effect on confidence in an industry that has been rocking and reeling for the past four years.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Buy Home Produced Beef&rdquo; campaign launched in Great Britain in recent weeks, focusing on the larger multiples, has created a major marketing problem for our beef industry.  This occurs when the dry stock industry, made up of 120,000 dry stock farmers, is trying to come to terms with a dramatic fall in incomes and when winter fatteners are facing into their fourth year of income loss.</P>
      <P>What we have witnessed is the spectacle of the renationalisation of the market for beef re-emerging within the EU.  This happened in the French and German markets in 1996-97, reversing progress made in earlier years.  In 1997 only about one third of our total beef exports were sold within the EU.  This renationalisation policy makes a mockery of the proclamation of the European ideal which underpins the free movement of goods, capital and people under Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem of renationalisation has now been accentuated by what has happened in the past two weeks or so in Great Britain where we have what amount to anti-competitive practices contrary to the spirit of Article 85 of the EU Treaty.  These arise because a number of large retail multiples who previously sold Irish beef <Col N="138" /> from their retail outlets appear to have entered into an agreement with their domestic suppliers whereby they sell only those suppliers' produce, which is to the detriment of other EU suppliers. This is clearly in breach of Article 85 which was designed to protect and guard against what is, in effect, a concerted practice to prevent competition.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Great Britain is leading to a distortion of trade and intra community trade has been disrupted for some weeks.  There was a significant trade between these undertakings and Irish suppliers and it is being disrupted for no apparent or stated reason other than nationalistic reasons.  These are easy to decipher when one examines, even superficially, a recent advertisement placed by Tesco which indicates that it has a &ldquo;pro-British&rdquo; policy and will not &ldquo;profiteer by opportunistically buying abroad&rdquo;.  Irish beef is 20 per cent cheaper to purchase than its UK equivalent and is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>Total retail sales of fresh beef in Britain in 1997 amounted to 327,000 tonnes.  Sales of fresh beef through Tesco, Sainsbury, ASDA, Safeway and Somerfield, totalling 200,000 tonnes, account for approximately 61 per cent of fresh meat sales in Britain.  Tesco alone accounts for about 20 per cent of beef retail sales in Britain.  These are significant figures in terms of the action now in train in Great Britain and the knock on effect for Irish farming. Irish supplies to these main multiples currently amount to an estimated 40,000 tonnes &mdash; 20 per cent of their total requirements or 5 per cent of the total market.  The main retailers take the following percentages of retail fresh sales: Tesco takes 20 per cent; Sainsbury takes 14 per cent; ASDA takes 14 per cent; Safeway takes 8 per cent; Somerfield takes 6 per cent and others take 38 per cent.  In the past year or so Safeway, Somerfield and Sainsbury have been the major purchasers of Irish beef in volume terms.  I understand Somerfield is still buying our beef as of today.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Britain amounts to a curtailment of choice for the consumer.  This is tantamount to making the consumer's choice for him. This is an amazing usurpation of the &ldquo;freedom to choose&rdquo; principle and, in particular, where an excellent quality product such as Irish beef is available for the consumer to exercise his free choice as to whether he wishes to purchase it. British beef production will only meet about 78 per cent of British requirements and about 220,000 tonnes, or the equivalent of 22 per cent of their requirements, will have to be imported in 1998.  We have traditionally been the leading supplier of this market and it is essential that we put in place a clearly focused strategy to ensure that our top quality beef is able to maintain its traditional presence on the UK market.  We have an excellent quality product with a deep understanding of the market requirements and an ability to service this market.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to meet the senior executives of all the major retail chains in Britain and to work in conjunction with Bord Bia, the meat <Col N="139" /> producers and the farming organisations to launch a vigorous and sustained marketing campaign to regain sales of our beef to the major multiple retailers which have been a key traditional market for us.  What we seek is a level playing pitch where the free market principle, the cornerstone of EU policies for many years, prevails.  We want no more and we demand no less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for his well researched contribution on this matter.  Most of the major retail multiples in the UK have decided not to source beef from outside Britain for the duration of a recently launched British beef promotion campaign.  I am very concerned at this development which presents an immediate difficulty for the beef industry.  The beef industry has had a traditional and orderly outlet in the UK.  It supplies up to 100,000 tonnes of beef each year, valued at about £200 million.  The UK is a valuable market for high quality beef cuts and provides a good return to farmers.  However, the major multiples have turned us out all of a sudden. Market share loss of the order of 100,000 tonnes or £200 million would have serious repercussions for Irish farming and the economy in general.</P>
      <P>I am tackling this problem on a number of fronts.  As an immediate response, I have instructed Bord Bia to intensify direct contact with the multiples concerned.  I have met representatives of the largest of the UK multiples, Tesco, to explore ways of restoring normal trading practices.  Tesco has a major involvement in the retail business in Ireland and it trades, as do other companies, in our open economy without hindrance in the interests of consumer choice.  We have an open economy and export almost £5 billion in goods and services to the UK.  We import in excess of that so there is a balance of trade in favour of Britain.  Yet, as a member state of the EU we are entitled under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome to unimpeded access to various markets.  Our traditional market is in the UK.  We were prevented from having that access two months ago with a blockade at the ports when good food was dumped into the sea.  That blockade has extended to the boardrooms of the supermarkets.</P>
      <P>At my request Bord Bia is preparing a detailed, costed and focused strategy to regain our position on the supermarket shelves.  In the past ten days we have had two meetings in the Department with Bord Bia and representatives of farmers, producers and meat factories to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the political level I am using all appropriate contacts in the UK and the EU to express my deep concern about the campaign under way in Britain.  This campaign has resulted in the decisions by supermarkets to remove Irish beef from their shelves.  I understand and sympathise with the plight of farmers in the UK.  However, the protest campaign is against the spirit of free <Col N="140" /> trade embodied in the Treaty of Rome.  Ireland has a long tradition of supplying top quality beef to the British market in an orderly manner.  I am confident that the efforts now under way will lead to a restoration of normal trading.</P>
    <P>The UK is not self-sufficient in beef so it will need to import beef.  It is particularly reprehensible that some of the campaigns were so negative as to single out Irish beef for particular mention. That was preposterous and unfair.  Such action goes against the Treaty of Rome, the spirit of free trade and the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have a major task at the political, commercial and promotional levels.  The task will require the deployment of a significant amount of additional resources.  However, there is goodwill among British retailers and consumers and with a renewed and intensified promotional effort we can defend and, eventually, expand our market share in the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crisis in the orthodontic treatment services in St. Finbarr's hospital in Cork.  I have tabled a number of questions on this matter in recent months.  On 14 October 1997 the Department of Health and Children informed me there were 4,900 people awaiting assessment and 2,200 awaiting treatment, a total of 7,100.  On 3 February, four months later the numbers had gone up dramatically from 4,900 to 5,915 awaiting assessment and from 2,200 to 2,432 awaiting treatment, an increase of 1,247 in four months. There are now more than 8,000 children awaiting orthodontic treatment in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork and the number is growing.  The Department has made resources available to the health board and the health board is in the process of appointing a senior registrar.  It had major problems recruiting a registrar and is now trying to appoint a dental surgeon instead.  However, that will only serve to keep up with the increased numbers because a senior registrar will have to look after up to 250 children per month just to keep up with the acceleration I have just outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I praise the staff at the clinic in Cork who are doing an outstanding job.  Any time I contacted them they were more than gracious and more than helpful.  I also thank the Minister and staff of the Department for being so helpful and courteous in making the figures available to me.  However, the situation must be addressed. Children are having to wait four or five years for treatment.  That means a child of ten will be 14 or 15 before receiving treatment.  Worse, 211 of these children were told, having waited an average of two years, that they could not be treated because the Department of Health and Children had issued guidelines to the effect that they were now ineligible and would have to get the work done privately at a cost of, perhaps, £3,000.  This is not good enough.  We cannot treat children like this, because children of 13 or 14 can be sensitive about their appearance.  We heard much talk in <Col N="141" /> the House about suicide in the last while.  I am not suggesting for a moment that having teeth out of line could lead to suicide.  However, it does not help self-esteem.  In addition after two or three years the cost of treatment goes up, and it will cost the State even more in the long-term to treat this problem.  It will also be more painful for the children concerned because they will be older. Hardly a week goes by that I do not receive representations of some sort on this matter.  The Minister needs to take urgent action to deal with the problem.  The measures suggested at the moment will barely serve to keep up with the rising numbers and will not serve to deal with the extremely long waiting list.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming here tonight. I hope he will have something constructive and imaginative to say and he will not read from a prepared script and send us home none the wiser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I briefly describe the general background to the provision of orthodontic services by the Southern Health Board under the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
      <P>In common with other developed countries, the demand for orthodontic treatment in this county is high.  Treatment is also very expensive, and no country which provides orthodontic treatment free of charge can provide treatment for all who seek it.  Available resources must be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department issued guidelines in 1985 to health boards on the classification of cases awaiting treatment in descending order of severity.  Children are assessed for treatment under the direction of the consultant orthodontist in accordance with these guidelines and, where appropriate, placed on a waiting list.  These guidelines are currently under review.</P>
      <P>The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the development of a consultant-led service by each health board.  In addition to his or her direct involvement, a primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training for health board dental staff.  This enables the board to provide a greatly increased volume of service of a high quality.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board are being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  There is now a specially designed and fully equipped orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's hospital.  Five dental teams are attached to the unit working under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit also has a hygienist, dental surgery assistants and radiographer, and secretarial support. Treatment is being provided for close on <Col N="142" /> 2,000 patients.  Outlying satellite clinics are provided in the board's community care areas.  Since the introduction of the consultant-led service, the board is providing a greatly improved level of service. The Southern Health Board agreed to the appointment of a senior registrar on a sessional basis at the end of 1997 following which arrangements were made to have the restructuring of this post approved by the Specialist Advisory Committee for Higher Training in Dentistry.  The committee has now approved this arrangement and the senior registrar will commence working with the board this month.  As a result, it is now possible for the board to hold regular clinics in West Cork, an area which has not had such a service before.  The position of registrar was also advertised by the board but regrettably there were no applications and the board is now making arrangements to fill this position by seconding a dental surgeon to the unit.  The board is confident these additional appointments will result in a further improvement in the level of service.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that the current number of patients awaiting assessment at the orthodontic unit at St. Finbarr's hospital is 5,915, while the number awaiting treatment at the unit is 2,432.  The current waiting period for assessment varies, depending on the community care area in which the patient is resident.  The waiting period for assessment in South Lee, North Lee and west Cork is approximately two years.  The waiting period for Kerry community care area is approximately six to nine months, and in north Cork it is three months approximately.  The recruitment of the senior registrar will, in addition to providing regular clinics in West Cork, also enable the board to provide an overall improvement in waiting times for assessment throughout the board's area.  I have raised with the board the desirability of ensuring as far as possible that assessments in all areas are carried out within the same approximate timeframe in the interest of equity in service provision.</P>
    <P>Children in category A, the category of greatest need, receive immediate treatment.  For other children on the treatment waiting list the waiting period for treatment is approximately two years. While there is room for further improvement, we should also acknowledge the improvements achieved in recent years through the consultant-led service.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that the existing service is not adequate.  It is being addressed by the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter tonight.  I hope that within a short time we will see further improvements in the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 February 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Government outlined in its press statement at the time of the publication of the recent NESF report, it welcomes the various recommendations of the forum and appreciates the important contribution that it has made through its wide-ranging reports and opinions, as evidenced by its work over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The Government is very conscious of the importance of addressing the continuing problems as outlined by the Deputy.  There are a number of measures in place to do so, as outlined in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  These are monitored on an ongoing basis, and the various social partners are involved in the process.</P>
      <P>The Government has also taken specific measures to ensure programmes and resources are directly targeted at areas of disadvantage to combat the very real problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  I refer in particular to the decision to establish a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion, which I am chairing, and the new co-ordinated approach to supporting young people at risk in disadvantaged areas, which I announced on 21 January.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the NESF also commented in their recent report that they remain &ldquo;satisfied and encouraged with responses received and the actions taken by successive Governments on its recommendations&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met last Thursday with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland &mdash; Dr. Marjorie Mowlam MP.  We had a useful discussion which focused on developments in the multi-party talks.  We are pleased that the process is now progressing in all three strands.  We discussed how we might accelerate this.  We are in complete agreement that the best way forward is to focus on the process itself. Consequently, I do not propose to elaborate further, other than to say that relations between both Governments are excellent.  We are convinced that by genuinely focusing on all of the core issues involved, we can, with the engagement of all the talks participants, achieve &mdash; by the pre-Easter target &mdash; a balanced settlement, based on agreement, to put to the people in referendums, North and South, by May.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the multi-party talks sessions which will take place in Dublin Castle later this month.  I will meet with the talks participants on Monday next and as part of the programme, I will host a reception for the participants in Dublin Castle that evening for which invitations will issue to appropriate representatives of opposition parties.</P>
      <P>As I said last week, the Government is carrying forward work on elaborating its views on the details of a settlement.  Deputies will be aware that the general practice in the negotiations has been for the two Governments to act jointly, including in presenting any papers.  Whether and when to present the results of the work under way will be determined by the Governments in the light of progress in the three strands.</P>
      <P>I replied to Mr. Trimble's letter yesterday.  I do not propose to discuss my response other than to make the point that I do not accept the parallel he has drawn between the events in question and the new inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.</P>
      <P>I welcome the affirmation by President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair of their continuing commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.  I would join with them in condemning the recent sectarian killings and urging all of the parties to show their vision, forbearance and determination to succeed.</P>
      <P>I met last Wednesday with Mr. Alexander Downer, the Australian Foreign Minister.  We had a very positive meeting covering a number of issues.  I was pleased to be able to inform him of the progress in the multi-party talks and, of course, to thank him for Australia's continued contribution to the International Fund for Ireland and in particular, the contribution of $1.5 million for 1998.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Young Ireland Revolt of 1848 at a national level.  There was a very comprehensive commemoration of Thomas Davis's death and the Young Ireland Revolt in the 1940s on the occasion of the centenary. While this year we are concentrating our resources on the commemoration of 1798, we will not entirely ignore the 150th anniversary of 1848 in respect of ceremonies as the two events have some natural links.</P>
      <P>I also understand Limerick County Council is at present considering various proposals in its plans to commemorate this anniversary and in particular the role of William Smith O'Brien. Work is also to commence shortly on the new area offices of Limerick County Council in Newcastle West, quite near Ardagh, which will be named after William Smith O'Brien.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the new tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, and is being conducted <Col N="148" /> in full compliance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997, and in the Irish media on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within this deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, &lsquo;invitation to tender&rsquo; documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was at 5 p.m. on Monday, 2 February.  Bord Fáilte received full tender submissions from five consortia, and has now commenced its assessment of these submissions. Bord Fáilte and the management board have estimated it will be late March before their deliberations will be completed.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will then be required in respect of any final selection made.  It is hoped that the grant offer can be made to the successful candidate by mid July, who will then be able to proceed with construction plans.</P>
      <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the Government and the European Commission, on foot of a cost benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law, and matters such as planning permission are in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 32, 40 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>A central element in my Department's policy for sport is to encourage national governing bodies to strengthen their organisational capacity and structures, to improve their management and administrative systems, to raise standards in coaching and competition and to increase participation in their sports.  An essential component of this policy is the development of strategic planning within the organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>Towards this end, I provided additional funding to a number of organisations in 1997 towards the purchase of IT equipment.  I also made special funding available to selected governing bodies to enable them to introduce improvments in their management, administration, coaching and in participation levels.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I have introduced a new application format for annual funding which places a strong emphasis on strategic planning on the part of the national governing bodies.  An information seminar has already been provided for the organisations and a series of joint planning meetings will be held over the coming months between the governing bodies and the Irish Sports Council which will focus on the strategic development of the various sports.</P>
      <P>I intend that the concept of strategic planning and performance measurement will be a feature of future funding and of the development of sport in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government decided yesterday to appoint Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators to investigate certain matters relating to the affairs of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association &mdash; IASA &mdash; its Leinster branch and affiliated clubs.</P>
      <P>In arriving at its decision, the Government took account of all the issues arising, including the concerns of victims, the desire for privacy of a number of victims and their families and the wider public policy issue of how best child sex abuse cases should be handled in such circumstances in the future.</P>
      <P>Having weighed up all these issues, the Government took its course of action, in the interest of the victims, children currently in swimming and children in sport generally and to secure a speedy inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Murphy has been asked to conduct his investigations in private and to report to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation by 10 March 1998.  Subject to the need to preserve the confidentiality of victims his findings will be made public.  The matters which Dr. Murphy has been asked to report on are the following: the arrangements which the IASA, the Leinster branch and affiliated clubs had in place since 1975 for the detection and prevention of child sexual abuse; the procedures, including functional responsibilities, which the IASA, the Leinster branch and affiliated clubs had in place for securing compliance with these arrangements; the manner in which complaints in relation to sexual abuse made to the IASA, the Leinster branch and affiliated clubs were dealt with over that period; the manner in which any complaints in relation to two named coaches reported to the IASA, their Leinster branch or affiliated clubs were handled by them over that period; the arrangements which the IASA, all their provincial branches and affiliated clubs now have in place to detect and prevent child sexual abuse, including arrangements <Col N="151" /> while complaints are being investigated, and sanctions; and the adequacy of arrangements now in place for the protection of children in swimming.</P>

      <P>The spread of tourism throughout the regions is a matter, in the first instance, for the regional tourism authorities who were established by Bord Fáilte, under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, to <i>inter alia,</i> promote and develop tourism in the regions.  The available Bord Fáilte estimates on tourism revenue show that growth rates have been achieved in all regions in Ireland in recent years which are better than international and European averages. However, although all regions have shared in this growth, there have been variations in performance.</P>
      <P>Prospects for this year are good particularly in the light of the additional resources of £8.5 million allocated by the Government for tourism marketing in last year's Supplementary Estimate and this year's budget.  The focus of this additional funding is being largely directed at developing tourism throughout all the regions so as to ensure that the benefits of overall increases in tourism are spread countrywide.  Bord Fáilte has devised a multi-layered approach which consists of enhancing existing programmes, introducing new regional initiatives and exploiting opportunities which are coming on stream.  The intention is to have a strong regional dimension in the activities proposed and to maximise the return by integrating activity at local, regional and national levels.  Details of the specific activities involved were contained in my address to the Dáil Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation on 11 December, 1997.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry also has a primary role to play in promoting the development of tourism in their areas and in putting in place sound business strategies to successfully market their own areas and facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>In response to an invitation by the Egyptian Tourism Minister, Dr. Mamdouh El-Beltagui, I paid an official visit to Egypt, from Saturday 3 to Tuesday 6 January.  My visit was intended to further the Government's political commitment to strengthening economic and diplomatic relations with Egypt.  Egypt's tourism industry had been adversely affected by a perceived security threat and I felt strongly that it was important to show our solidarity.  In this regard, I believe that my visit to Egypt was especially timely, taking place so soon after the horrific massacres at Luxor last November.</P>
      <P>Egypt has successfully marketed its unique heritage and antiquity.  There is increasing interest in Ireland in promoting our heritage and history.  We have made great progress in the promotion of special activity holidays in Ireland. Clearly there is scope for sharing our experience, capabilities and key market information.  During my meeting with Dr. El-Beltagui we discussed the potential for co-operation between both countries and considered the possibility of an exchange of expertise in tourism marketing and training.  I invited Dr. El Beltagui to visit Ireland officially during 1998 and he has indicated his intention to do so.</P>
      <P>During my visit to Egypt, I also met the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Youssef Walli, and raised the issue of live cattle exports from Ireland to Egypt.  I also met a number of Egyptian businessmen who trade with Ireland, including Egyptian meat importers.  Overall, it was a very constructive visit from the viewpoint of both Governments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in its joint programme An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, decided late last year to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals. The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. Under Article 22 of the Directive, candidates will be selected for invitation to tender from among those qualified in accordance with Articles 24 to 29 thereof.  These requirements were outlined in the Tender Procedure Notice for the project which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday, 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media the following day. The invitation is open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>My Department is requesting developers to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers will be required to demonstrate that they have the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.  The final date for receipt of candidatures is 5 March 1998, and invitation to tender documentation will issue to qualified candidates on 26 March.</P>
      <P>On the question of location proposals from all parts of the country will be considered, provided they meet all relevant requirements, which will be set out in the invitation to tender documentation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Government's decision in November 1997 to provide grant <Col N="156" /> assistance up to a maximum of £5 million towards the cost of implementing Ireland's bid for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003, a formal bid was submitted by the organisers, Special Olympics Ireland, to the official governing body, Special Olympics International.  I understand that a decision on the bid is not expected before May next.</P>
      <P>If the bid is successful, responsibility for raising the balance of the £16 million bill for the games will rest with the organisers.  I understand that some companies have already pledged financial support for the project and I have already urged the Irish business community in general, in the strongest possible terms, to consider coming forward as sponsors in order to build on existing sponsorship commitment and to secure the success of the project.  I now take the opportunity to do so again in this House.  This project would be a significant capture for this country and it undoubtedly offers potential for the kind of good commercial profile that goes with any major international event as well as enhancing the tourism potential of the country.  I assure the House that I will continue do to my best to encourage the widest possible commercial interest in this project in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>As with all parts of the country, coastal and other resort towns and villages are the beneficiaries of the very substantial investment which has taken place in tourist amenities under the previous and current Operational Programme for Tourism.  Other EU funded programmes which provide support for smaller tourism  initiatives are the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There is also the local urban and rural development programme under which, <i>inter alia,</i> the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's county enterprise boards operate.  In the Border counties, limited assistance is also available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  Attractive subsidised loan schemes have also been available to a wide range of tourism projects.</P>
      <P>It has been policy for some time, of course, not to provide direct grant support for tourist accommodation projects, on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> As the Deputy is no doubt aware, however, there is in existence a scheme which is targeted specifically at coastal resorts, namely the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas, which was introduced on 1 July 1995 on a pilot basis for three years.  The purpose of the scheme is to assist in the renewal and updating of tourist amenities and facilities in the areas designated.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development is at present reviewing the impact of the scheme.  The review will assimilate all key data concerning developments currently taking place in the designated resort areas.  When I receive the review findings, I will examine them in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>In our large cities there are many areas with high level of deprivation and severe social problems.  Recent years have seen an increasing level of activity and resources devoted to those areas but problems continue to persist in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believes that one of the major stumbling blocks to the effectiveness of existing initiatives is a history of insufficient co-ordination between organisations in the State-funded sector.  The Government has, therefore, decided that a priority is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities to the need of urban communities <Col N="158" /> with the growth levels of disadvantage as a basis of a model for best practice.</P>
    <P>New procedures to achieve the objectives are being developed, under the auspices of the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood.  Four pilot areas will be targeted initially; Dublin's north east inner city; the canal communities, Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House; Jobstown, Tallaght; Togher, Cork.  The project will involve consultation with local communities about the needs of their areas; existing services and resources; the extent of integration between them; and development mechanisms for greater co-ordination and integration.  A budget of £750,000 has been provided, in 1998, for this pilot initiative on the integrated delivery of service in disadvantaged urban areas.</P>

      <P>The URBAN programme represents an integrated, strategic approach to addressing the economic, social and environmental needs of the selected areas and the actions funded give practical effect to this strategy.

It is under these action plans that individual projects are approved.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to decommit the funds allocated towards the development of a national conference centre under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new tender procedure for a national conference centre was initiated last year and is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development.  The procedure is being conducted in full compliance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997.  The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 <Col N="162" /> November.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was at 5 p.m. on Monday 2 February. Bord Fáilte received full tender submissions from five consortia and has now commenced its assessment of these submissions.  Bord Fáilte and the management board have estimated that it will be late March before their deliberations will be completed.</P>
    <P>The mid-term review package of the Communty Support Framework for Ireland, CSF, established a reserve list of projects in respect of which consideration will be given to decommitting funds at the 1998 mid-year meeting of the CSF monitoring committee.  The package indicated that if it could be proven, at that time, that sufficient progress had been achieved to secure the likely completion of the projects within the existing agreed time scales, all or part of the funds allocated would be decommitted.  It was further indicated that national roads would be one of the main priorities in the consideration of the usage of any ERD funds which might become available from this exercise.  The national conference centre is on the reserve list.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the CSF monitoring committee at which the matter will be addressed is scheduled for 25 June 1998.  In preparation for that meeting, my Department will, following full consideration of the matter by the monitoring committee of the operational programme for tourism, forward a detailed report on progress up to then to establish the national conference centre.</P>

      <P>The Community Employment programme is targeted at a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments such as lone parents in receipt of one parent family payment (OPFP).</P>
      <P>Its objective is to provide temporary opportunities whereby they can update their existing skills, develop new skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience that will enhance their prospects of securing a mainstream job.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of deserted wife's benefit are not eligible to participate in Community Employment. However, they can apply to revert to one parent family payment, and if awarded same, they would then be eligible to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, Deloitte &amp; Touche have recently been appointed to carry out a full review of the Community Employment programme. The review will include an evaluation of the programme in terms of its success in meeting its objectives and an analysis of whether Community Employment is an appropriate measure in current labour market conditions including comment on how it might be improved or further refined as an effective labour market integration measure.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that the dispute between Ryanair and some of its ground handling staff is continuing. Unfortunately, the dispute has been characterised by claim and counter-claim from the respective parties to the dispute.  The most important thing at this stage is to establish the facts, and to find a way forward so that the dispute can be resolved as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing contact with all parties involved in the dispute with a view to finding the means towards a resolution.  The Minister Deputy Kitt in particular has been unstinting in his efforts in this regard.  In addition, the chairperson of the Labour Court has indicated that the Court &ldquo;will continue to keep the matter under review and is prepared to facilitate the parties in any way it can to assist in resolving the dispute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would have no hesitation in utilising powers available under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act if I thought that this would be likely to produce a positive response.  I will continue to keep this possibility under active review.  I would again urge both sides to reflect carefully on the best means to achieving progress towards settlement.</P>

      <P>A total of 47 community training workshops have been established of which 45 are being funded by FÁS.  Two others have ceased to operate as CTWs and their role, functions etc. have been taken over by the VEC in each case.</P>
      <P>Community training workshops have been in operation since 1977 when FÁS, then AnCO funded a community group in Dublin's inner city to provide training for young unemployed persons in the city who were not involved in the education or training system.  During the early 1980s the number of community training workshops was expanded as a response to the increasing difficulties which young persons who left school without any qualifications were experiencing, in relation to the labour market and in transition to adult living.  Progressively, and as local community groups identified local need, the number, geographical spread, and capacity of community training workshops was expanded and by 1988 a total of 47 were in operation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Staff working in community training workshops are employees of the boards of management who operate these workshops.  Each workshop is an autonomous unit, very much locally based and sometimes involved in the areas of local development and receives an annual grant from FÁS in respect of the community training workshop activity.  The question of severance pay is a matter for each community training workshop.</P>

      <P>Preliminary proposals to construct waste water treatment works and a pumping station were submitted to my Department in August 1996 by Sligo Corporation in conjunction with an application for a foreshore lease.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with the Department and other interested parties including Sligo Harbour Commissioners, it was decided in October 1997 that the site of the proposed development should be relocated and a lease of a different area of foreshore was sought.  This required Sligo Corporation to undertake a revision of the environmental impact statement which, I understand, is nearing completion and is scheduled to be published within the next month for public comment. Upon its publication, the statutory consultation process will follow.  All of the views expressed by interested parties will be carefully considered by me before I decide on the application for a foreshore lease in connection with the proposals.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1997 suckler cow premium on 71 animals.  At an inspection of his herd on 19 August 1997 two of the animals listed on his application, and described as simmental, were absent.  Following further office checks it was discovered that the two animals were ineligible breeds &mdash; while they were not tested in the herd of the person named they were tested in his father's herd in 1994, 1995 and 1996 as Friesians.  The person concerned was deemed to have made a false declaration and consequently was disqualified from the 1997 and 1998 suckler cow premium schemes.</P>
      <P>The person named sought a review of that decision based on documenation which purported to show that the two animals were not Friesians. A review was carried out by a person other than the person who made the original decision.  The result of the review was communicated to him on 22 January 1998 and he was given an opportunity to lodge an appeal with the appeals unit of my Department if he was dissatisfied with the outcome of that review.  No further appeal was lodged.  If such an appeal is lodged, it will be considered by the appeals unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the deterioration in the quality of beef carcases which is evidenced by the increase in the number of carcases falling into the higher fat classes.  There are a number of reasons for this development, most notably the increased usage of holstein breeds in the dairy <Col N="168" /> herds and the practice of flat pricing adopted by meat factories.</P>
      <P>As far as breeding practices are concerned, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation which was formed last June will, when fully operational, be responsible for expanding the recording, testing and genetic evaluation systems with a view to improving the genetic merit of the beef herd and thereby improve the overall quality of our beef production.  Funds will be provided both through the Structural Funds and industry contribution to facilitate this development.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, however, the introduction of suitable quality related price differentials would be the most effective mechanism for effecting an improvement in the quality of our cattle.  My Department is currently involved in discussions with the beef industry on this matter. I hope there will be positive developments in this regard in the near future.</P>

These are the development of transparent and integrated production and processing protocols &mdash; standards &mdash; applicable to all parties in the food chain, i.e. producers, processors, livestock marts and animal feed compounders; the enforcement of these protocols through a registration and approval process; and a bovine animal identification and tracing system.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will back the call of the Danish Government for an EU ban on in-feed antibiotic use in view of the recently reported link of antibiotic resistance being passed on to humans through the presence of antibiotics in food.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorisation and use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs for growth promotion purposes is regulated under the Feed Additives Directive (70/524/EEC).  The directive lays down strict criteria for the authorisation of additives. Manufacturers are required to carry out detailed studies, in accordance with established guidelines, to enable evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of products.  In addition to the assessment carried out by member state experts, the EU Commission always consults the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition &mdash; an independent body of experts set up to advise the Commission on the safety matters relating to feedingstuffs &mdash; where authorisation of an antibiotic is concerned.</P>
      <P>There are ten antibiotics currently authorised throughout the EU for use in feed, subject to specified conditions of use, e.g. category of animal, dose rate, etc. The Danish Government has not proposed a ban on the use of antibiotics as feed additives.  Rather, under the safeguard clause in the directive, on 16 January 1998 it prohibited use of one of the antibiotics currently authorised, virginiamycin.  This provision enables member states to take action at national level where new information shows dangers arising from the use of a feed additive. Under the terms of this provision, Denmark is required to provide other member states and the Commission with the detailed grounds for its decision.</P>
      <P>When this information becomes available, the Commission, in consultation with other member states, will examine the data and take appropriate measures.  If during this process, evidence of a risk to human or animal health is established I will have no hesitation in supporting the Danish position on this feed additive.</P>

      <P>Section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 relates to capital allowances on industrial buildings.  The buildings covered by paragraph 1D are buildings used as hotels or holiday camps, which are entitled to capital allowances of 15 per cent per annum and 10 per cent in year seven, and registered holiday cottages, which are entitled to capital allowances of 10 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would provide an estimate of the cost of capital allowances for hotels, holiday camps or registered holiday cottages as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Various tourism projects can gain relief under the business expansion scheme.  Until 1991, when hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation were excluded from the scheme, hotels received most of the BES tourism funding.  It is estimated that the tax foregone on investment in the tourism industry under the BES since 1987-88 to 1996-97 is in the region of £77 million.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the definition of qualifying trading operations for regional airport enterprise areas in the 1998 Finance Bill to allow for a wider scope of industries to be included.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1995 Finance Act provided for various tax reliefs to be given to six enterprise areas located in the Dublin, Cork and Galway urban areas.  The 1997 Finance Act extended the enterprise area reliefs to two further areas in Dublin and to areas in Rosslare Harbour.  Provision was made in that Act for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas.  The airports in question are those at Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The designation order will be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations.</P>
      <P>Qualifying trading operations are manufacturing companies which qualify under the Finance Acts for 10 per cent Corporation Tax and internationally traded service activities &mdash; as designated under the Industrial Development Act, 1986 &mdash; i.e. data processing, software development, technical and consulting, commercial laboratory, healthcare, research and development, media recording, training, publishing, financial and administrative headquarters.  Companies must also have been approved for financial assistance by the State industrial development agencies &mdash; Forbairt or IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>The approval of qualifying companies is given through a certification process involving, <i>inter alia,</i> Forfás and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission raised queries last year about the State aid aspects of these enterprise areas.  I issued a statement to this effect on 23 July 1997.  It was only on 18 December 1997 that I was in a position to announce that the Commission had decided to approve the tax reliefs for the enterprise areas in the context of State aids. However, this approval does not cover the enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports. The designation of these regional airport areas depends on specific projects being proposed for each area.  When such projects come forward and are approved by the Irish authorities, the individual <Col N="173" /> enterprise areas concerned will be designated and submitted to the EU Commission for its approval.  It should be noted that under the Commission's decision the provisions for all of the enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act will have to terminate on 31 December, 1999 instead of 30 June 2000.</P>
    <P>The approval which was received from the EU Commission was based on the information supplied by my Department relating to qualifying trading operations as outlined above.  Any additions to that list would have to be approved by the EU Commission and in present circumstances this approval is unlikely to be forthcoming. Consequently I have no plans to amend this list.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 gives powers to the health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes.  The Act also introduced a new system of nursing home subventions so that dependent people most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The scheme is intended to assist persons in meeting the cost of nursing home care but it is not intended to meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £6.9 million was allocated in 1997 to the health boards to meet the increasing demand for subventions towards the cost of care of older people in nursing homes, i.e. increasing numbers of applications and the higher level of dependency among applicants, with the increase in cost associated with the amendment to the Nursing Home Regulations in July 1996. This amendment included a provision which permitted health boards to pay a nursing home subvention above the maximum rate applicable to the level of dependency of the applicant.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the levels of subvention and this will be considered within the context of resources available to the health services.</P>

      <P>National data on hospital discharges for all patients in publicly-funded general hospitals are compiled through the hospital in-patient inquiry HIPE system.  HIPE provides for up to six separate diagnoses to be recorded in each case.  The following table indicates the number of hospital discharges with a diagnosis of either dependence or abuse or both for each of the specified substances. If a particular case falls into more than one category, for the purpose of this analysis it is reported under the category which appears first in the diagnoses list.  The most recent year for which complete national data are available from the HIPE system is 1996; prior to 1995, the system was not sufficiently comprehensive to report national totals reliably.</P>
      <P>In interpreting these statistics, it should be noted that several of the categories include more than one specific substance and that it is not possible to break down the figures any further.  The category &lsquo;opioids&rsquo; includes heroin and methadone as well as other opiates; &lsquo;hallucinogens&rsquo; refers to LSD, mescaline and a range of other hallucinogenic substances, &lsquo;amphetamines&rsquo; encompasses psychostimulants, including ecstasy.  It should also be noted that &lsquo;tobacco&rsquo; relates to cases with a specific diagnosis of &lsquo;tobacco use disorder&rsquo; indicating impairment of health or social functioning due to tobacco dependence.  This should not be taken as an estimate of the numbers of hospitalisations due in full or in part to nicotine.</P>

      <P>The beneficial effect of optimal water fluoridation in the prevention of dental caries is well established in Ireland and internationally.  Dean and co-workers, 1946, concluded that this beneift was obtained with a known risk of questionable or mild fluorosis based on Dean's index of fluorosis &mdash; normal, questionable, very mild, mild, moderate, severe.</P>
      <P>Studies of 8 year old children were conducted in the western, 1991, north-eastern, 1993, eastern, 1993, and southern, 1995 regions.  The results show that in the Southern and Western Health Boards between 91 per cent of children showed no signs of dental fluorosis in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.  In the east and north-eastern region approximately 75 per cent of 8 year olds had no evidence of dental fluorosis, 19.5 per cent had questionable fluorosis which is not detectable to an untrained eye, with 5.5 per cent in the very mild or mild category.  Other studies in the mid-west, north-west and south-east are incomplete.  Overall, the levels of fluorosis are still lower than that predicted by Dean in 1946 and in similar communities in the United States with fluoridated water supplies.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive statistics on the operation of the planning system are published annually by my Department and are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Summary statistics are similarly published on a quarterly basis.  The statistics are not compiled on a basis that distinguishes between applications for permission to carry out development. While the statistics set out the number of planning applications by area and class of development, they do not identify the number of applications for telecommunication masts. However, in reviewing the scope and content of the planning statistics now collected, my Department will consider seeking the type of statistics referred to in the questions.</P>

      <P>The selection and purchase of a site for a public sewage treatment plant is primarily a matter for the local authority for whom the plant is to be built.  Designation of a site is included as an integral part of the preliminary report, which is prepared by the local authority or its consultants for the particular scheme and is then submitted to my Department for approval.  However, where an environmental impact assessment is required, as in the case of the Sligo main drainage scheme, an environmental impact statement has to be certified by the appropriate body or bodies before approval is given by my Department to the preliminary report.  Sligo Corporation submitted a preliminary report for the Sligo main drainage scheme on 17 November 1993.  Following consideration of the report, the corporation were asked, <i>inter alia</i>, to re-examine the proposed site.  As a result, the local authority confirmed on 29 July 1994 that they proposed to seek approval to an alternative site, namely, the site which had been identified in the 1992-97 Borough Development Plan as the site for a new sewage treatment plant.  However, the local authority then advised my Department on 28 November 1997 that they are unable to procure that alternative site and have identified another alternative site.  I now understand that the corporation expects to publish this month an environmental impact statement based on the latest alternative site.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that Athy Garda station is open daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. When the station is unmanned I understand that a direct communications system linked to the district headquarters at Carlow comes into operation. In addition all telephone calls to Athy Garda station outside of opening hours are routed to the district headquarters.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the members attached to Athy Garda station carry out regular patrols of the sub-district and that these patrols are augmented, as required, by units based at the district headquarters.  They further inform me that the policing arrangements in place for Athy are continually monitored.  However, they add that there are no plans at present to change the existing policing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in Athy with the current deployment of resources.  However, I understand from them that when additional personnel next become available for allocation the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In determining whether and to what extent maintenance should be paid the <Col N="184" /> court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the income, earning capacity, if any, property or other financial resources of either spouse and any children and the financial and other responsibilities of the spouses towards each other and the children.  The maintenance creditor or the maintenance debtor may apply to the court to have an order varied on the basis of a change in circumstances since the order was made.  The maintenance order may also be discharged on the application of either party.</P>
      <P>In determining an application for variation of maintenance payments, the courts have ruled that judicial notice may be taken of a reduction in the value of money due to inflation and that the court may grant a related increase in maintenance.  It does not follow, however, that the courts will, as a matter of course, increase maintenance in line with inflation because the main circumstances of earning capacity and liabilities of the maintenance creditor and debtor must still be taken into account.  The same principle would apply were increases in maintenance payments to be linked to social welfare payment increases.  In the absence of dispute it is open to the parties to agree maintenance arrangements and so avoid the need to go to court.  I have no proposals to change the law in the way that seems to be suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the training being provided by CERT and the Department of Education and Science under Sub-Programme 4 of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for which the European Social Fund provides 67 MECU in grant assistance.  I do not believe it would be appropriate to change that method of delivery at this time, particularly as many of the key training courses provided run for periods of more than one academic year.  As required by the CSF Monitoring Committee, my Department will examine the scope for implementing changes in the longer term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this year.  The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997-98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the <Col N="189" /> university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>I requested the chairman of the Higher Eduction Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  Submissions would have been considered by the working group as part of their deliberations.  The working group has now completed their work and the Higher Education Authority has recently issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.  I have asked the authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
