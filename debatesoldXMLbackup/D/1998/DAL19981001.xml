      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Spring, Gay Mitchell and De Rossa.  I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31 I move the Adjournment of the Dáil on a matter of national importance, namely, the implications for the conduct of the State's foreign policy arising from the dispute between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and senior officials in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give notice of a motion under Standing Order 31 to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern: to seek an explanation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to why established procedures for the appointment of diplomats have been bypassed, giving rise to an unprecedented public row between the Minister and his own senior diplomats at a time when major issues are at crucial stages of negotiation; to seek an explanation from the Minister why the Secretary General of his Department has had to write to him seeking a meeting on this matter given that they are both located in the same building on St. Stephen's Green; and why so many officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs have been posted and reassigned without their consent, giving rise to widespread unrest, all of which has been brought about without due cause or explanation.</P>

      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest, namely, the crisis in the Department of Foreign Affairs arising from the decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to depart from the accepted procedures in the appointment of certain <Col N="714" /> staff, the consequent reported breakdown in the relationship between the Minister and some of the most senior officials in the Department, and the consequences of these developments for the Department and its work at a time when it has a crucial role to play in the peace process in Northern Ireland and the further development of the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9a, motion re Priority Questions, No. 2, the State Property Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 3, the Western Development Commission Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, No. 9a shall be decided without debate and any division demanded today on the Second Stage of Nos. 2 or 3 shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 6 October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I agree to vote for the proposal, I want to know whether the Taoiseach intends to allow or request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain to the House exactly what is going on in the Department of Foreign Affairs and to answer questions from this side of the House on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first issue before us, I wish to be helpful to the Chair.  It would facilitate all in the House before we agree to anything if the Taoiseach would indicate the willingness of the Government to allow a full explanation today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this fiasco.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the House that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we decide on the procedure before us, it would be helpful if the Taoiseach would indicate the Government's view on having time today for a full explanation of this affair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach does so, I point out that it is in order before the order of the day is agreed for any Member of the House to ask for a change in that order.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach and his colleagues already discussed this matter before they came here.  He should allow a debate today in the House so that the matter can be clarified.  We are heading into the weekend break and this matter will be allowed to fester.  It is necessary for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify to the House today exactly what is going in his Department.  I ask the Taoiseach to amend the Order of Business and to agree to the suspension of business for a period today to discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not amend the order in advance because I did not know what view the Chair would take on the Adjournment of the Dáil.  Since he has disallowed it, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is happy today, either on the tabling of a Special Notice Question or some method agreed by the Whips, to make a statement to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter could be dealt with by the Minister making a statement to the House and the Opposition parties being provided with an opportunity to put questions to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two sides to this problem as the Deputy well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is a matter of urgent public concern, that so many delicate issues are being discussed and that the Minister says there are two sides to the problem, we should probably also invite the Secretary General to hear his side of the story.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would indicate to the House what procedure he intends to allow for us to have an explanation from the Minister on this matter which should not be let fester further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be in the interest of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the Minister to come to the House at 12 o'clock today to explain exactly what has happened in the Department in the past 12 months.  It would not be in anyone's interest to let this fester over the weekend, either the Minister's or the Department's.  Will the Taoiseach allow the Minister to come to the House at 12 o'clock?  There is another procedure whereby the Minister and the Secretary General can come before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and they can both give their sides of this event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take the Order of Business, there should be an understanding that there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always the trouble that, when one says something, people do not listen. This morning, there were three requests to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31.  The Ceann Comhairle refused those, which is the normal precedent.  I have stated that, by Special Notice Question, a Statement or some other device arranged by the Whips, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is prepared to come before the House.  I said that five minutes ago, yet three people have since stood up and asked for that in different forms.  The matter can be worked out by the Whips and the Minister is clearly happy to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is to make a statement, will he take questions as part of the normal procedure of a Minister answering questions after making a statement?  There is no point in his coming here and giving one side of the story.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must proceed with the business of the House.  The Taoiseach has made a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's helpful approach.  It is in the interest of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the administration of the country and its role in international affairs that <Col N="717" /> this matter be explained in the House.  Is it the case that there is an agreement that one hour from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. will be allocated to this matter and that the mechanism will be agreed between the Whips between now and 12 o'clock?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally disorderly to make arrangements on the floor of the House.  I put the question that No. 9<i>a.</i>  be agreed to.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The second proposal deals with the postponement of divisions.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach could easily have approached the Opposition Whips once he knew the requests for adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Orders had been tabled to avoid this row on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's discussions this morning before he came into the House, was any consideration given to amending the Public Service Management Act, 1997, given what has happened in the Department of Foreign Affairs? Does he intend to bring a proposal before the House to amend the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated the Whips can agree to it.  Regarding the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is it proposed that time will be made available to discuss it in the House or is it to be referred to a committee of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate procedure to deal with that would be to refer the report to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service where it can be properly debated.  Having listened to its conclusions, the Government can take whatever action is appropriate.  The report covers a period over successive Governments so it should be debated by that committee.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Bill, which is to enable an Irish contribution to be made to the enhanced structural adjustment facility, the successor of IMF, when does the Taoiseach expect it to be brought before the House?  Will he take into account the serious reservations expressed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs about this U-turn by the Government?</P>

      <P>We were promised an inspectorate of child care services Bill so that these issues could be investigated and reported upon.

      <P>Where does it appear on the Government's programme of promised legislation? We were promised this legislation in January. It is not included in the list of Bills expected to be published before the end of December, nor on the list of Bills for 1999 or 2000.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Fahey, stated that this legislation was being given priority.  The production of this Bill was given as the explanation for the Department of Health and Children's failure to produce any other child care legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The Bill before the House essentially proposes to amend the State Property Act, 1954, to remove references to the National Stud Farm from the First Schedule to the Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment is of a technical nature and is designed to address current circumstances which were unforeseen when the National Stud Act, 1945, was enacted by the Oireachtas.  That statute vested the National Stud Farm in the Minister for Agriculture and while it did not prohibit the sale of any part of the National Stud Farm it did not contain any provisions providing for the sale of such land.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the State Property Act, 1954, provides a general power to a Parliamentary Secretary with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to sell, exchange, make a grant gratuitously or lease any State land for the time being vested in that Minister.  However, the first subsection of section 10 of the Act provides that this power shall not be exercisable in respect of the State land mentioned in the First Schedule to the Act. Among the properties listed in the First Schedule is the National Stud Farm.</P>
      <P>The issue of the power to sell part of the National Stud Farm has been brought to a head by the ongoing work on a motorway to by-pass Kildare Town.  The motorway will go through the lands of the National Stud Farm.  The part of the National Stud Farm required for the motorway amounting to 16.58 hectares has been acquired by Kildare County Council by way of a compulsory purchase order.  A further 21.66 hectares of the National Stud Farm will be severed by the motorway from the main stud farm and will no longer be useful for the purposes of the National Stud.</P>
      <P>While no decision has been taken as to what to do with the severed land I consider it desirable that all options be available to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including the option to sell the land.  While I appreciate that a power to sell the severed land only would meet the present situation, there is now no good reason for continuing to exclude the farm from the scope of the State Property Act and this opportunity should be taken to include it.  The efficient management of the farm could require from time to time the flexibility which this amendment will provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State Property Act, 1954, also includes general provisions regarding the leasing of State property; thus when it is amended it will confer on the Minister for Agriculture the power, <i>inter alia</i>, to lease the National Stud Farm or any part of it.  More restrictive provisions regarding leasing are contained in section 7 of the National Stud Act, 1945.  Since the Minister for Agriculture and Food will have a general power to sell or to lease under section 10 of the State Property Act, I consider that the retention of section 7 of the <Col N="725" /> National Stud Act, 1945, would be inappropriate and the Bill includes a provision repealing it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels to the south, through Kildare and Monasterevin will be well aware of the need for the Kildare town by-pass.  My main concern regarding it was to ensure as little disruption to the National Stud as possible.  It would have been ideal if the by-pass could have bypassed the National Stud also but I have been assured by Kildare County Council that there was no other feasible route.  In the circumstances I am pleased with the measures which are being taken to ensure that the environment in which the National Stud operates will be maintained and I thank Kildare County Council for its co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will give some background information on the National Stud because it is a tremendous national asset.  This is the view also of about 100,000 people who visit the National Stud each year.  It is appropriate in the context of the proposed amendment to reflect on the origins, history and character of the National Stud.  During the past 100 years, since its inception as a stud, Tully has been the nursery of so many world-famous race-horses that its name is almost a household word, synonymous with all that is best in the thoroughbred. Many people will remember Lord Gale, Crash Course, Sallust, Ahoonhora and many more outstanding international thoroughbreds. Shortly before the opening of this century a Colonel William Hall-Walker acquired possession of Tully for the purpose of training his horses there.  However, it was soon realised that its resources were more suited to the breeding and rearing of thoroughbreds.  It was, therefore, developed as such, until it is now one of the best equipped studs in the world.</P>
    <P>During that period, Tully was being laid out as a model stud with every convenience.  Many boxes of the latest design were erected, paddocks prepared and fenced, an indoor riding school was built and there were 12 completely enclosed boarded paddocks, each with its own box adjoining. These were, and still are, a unique feature of Tully.</P>
    <P>Sometime during 1915, Colonel Hall-Walker decided, in view of the difficulties caused by World War I and increasing age, he would give up his interest in the stud at Tully.  He decided to offer the bloodstock at Tully as a gift to the nation to form a National Stud.  A condition of this gift of bloodstock to the nation was that the Government of the then United Kingdom and Ireland should purchase Colonel Hall-Walker's interests in the Tully estate at valuation.  This interest consisted of the freehold of about 195 acres and a judicial tenancy in respect of the remaining 674 acres and which was subject to the payment of a rent of £813 per annum to the landlord.</P>
    <P>In 1922 the Irish Government pressed its claim on the British Government for the possession of Tully.  Negotiations continued between representatives of the two Governments from time to time <Col N="726" /> until it was finally decided in 1943 that the British Government would hand over its interest in the National Stud at the end of that year.  Things did not change a great deal from 1922 to 1943. However, 1943 was a momentous year, the stud farm being handed over to the nation.  On the same date the Irish Government took over the farm equipment and livestock at an agreed valuation, while the bloodstock was transferred to England.  The British Government agreed to pay the Irish Government an agreed sum in lieu of rent of the Tully premises from 1922 until 1943.</P>
    <P>In January 1944 the Government decided to establish a National Stud at Tully and approved the preparation of legislation to form a company to which the possession of Tully would be handed over in due course.  The National Stud Act was passed by the Oireachtas in August 1945 and thus the Irish National Stud Company Limited was formed.  Rents continued to be payable to Colonel Aylmer until 28 March 1958 when his interest in the estate was acquired by the State which now holds the freehold to the entire farm.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Bill provides the House with an opportunity of reviewing the state of the horseracing industry, particularly from breeders' point of view.  It will be realised from the account I have given that there is a great tradition at Tully which must be maintained and perpetuated.  I and my colleagues in Government are committed to the future development of the horseracing industry and in particular to the continued existence of the Irish National Stud.  This support manifests itself in a concrete fashion through direct funding to the Irish Horseracing Authority, the operation of the National Stud by the State on behalf of the industry and the taxation system.  This year we are contributing £10 million to the IHA, an increase of £1.5 million on 1997.  Since 1994 much needed capital has been injected into the National Study Company to restore it to profitability and ensure it continues to provide top quality stallions for Irish breeders.</P>
    <P>It is universally accepted that the structure of the thoroughbred industry in Ireland is unique. On the one hand there is a relatively small number of stud farms with large numbers of mares and stallions.  On the other hand there is a substantial number of farm breeders most of whom have one or two mares producing foals for flat and national hunt racing.  While the past few years have been satisfactory for these breeders, they came through a difficult period with very little financial reward from the marketplace. Their involvement, however, is one of the strengths and stabilisers of the thoroughbred breeding industry.  They combine a passionate interest in horse breeding with a more traditional farm enterprise such as cattle or tillage.</P>
    <P>These breeders must be responsive to the message coming from the marketplace in recent years. With no support or safety net system in place it is vital to concentrate scarce resources on the production of quality stock which will bring long-term benefits.  Overall production is tending to <Col N="727" /> increase and returns for 1997 show that thoroughbred foal registration increased by 574 on the 1996 figure, giving a total of 7,130.</P>
    <P>In view of our reliance on exports the tax treatment of stallion fee income has been one of the major factors in ensuring Irish breeders have access to world class stallions.  Revenue has agreed on principles to be applied in respect of valuation of registration through a brood mare scheme.  This matter has been a worry for many breeders and I am pleased it has been resolved as it is necessary to keep the brood mare stock within the country.  We have the most outstanding thoroughbred blood lines and the taxation regime has proved very beneficial since its introduction 30 years ago.  Comparisons between the roster of stallions and brood mares prior to its introduction with that which exists today shows we have moved from a relatively small country-based operation to one which is outstanding and competitive in an international context.</P>
    <P>Breeders have to be patient and often must wait year after year for a decent price for a yearling or foal.  The past two years, however, has been a time of cheer for breeders as there were significant increases in yearling prices.  Yearlings at Goff's commanded an average price of just over £33,000 last year as opposed to almost £21,000 in 1996.  Average yearling prices at Tattersalls remained at the 1996 average of almost £7,500.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to and thank the board of the National Stud, particularly Mr. David Shubotham whom I appointed chairman a number of years ago.  He and the board did a superb job in building the stud, getting quality stallions and giving it international recognition. They also improved the financial structures of the stud.  There also exists a very fine visitor centre at the National Stud, including the Japanese Gardens, which is visited by more than 100,000 people every year.  Mr. Shubotham and the board decided to mark the millennium, something which was both visionary and imaginative.  They are now finalising the construction of St. Fiachra's Garden which will be one of the country's gems and a fitting memorial to the millennium celebrations.</P>
    <P>Following Mr. Shubotham's request not to be reappointed, I appointed Mrs. Chryss O'Reilly as chairman.  I pay tribute to her for the manner in which she used her encyclopaedic knowledge of international thoroughbred bloodlines and her unique international connections to aid the National Stud and the breeding industry as a member of the board over the past five years and now as chairperson.  Her husband is Dr. Tony O'Reilly who has been one of the handful of outstanding Irishmen who at international level have served the country well over a number of decades.  The very significant services done to the State by Dr. O'Reilly is attested to by political, cultural, industrial and literary figures throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We have an internationally renowned and historically <Col N="728" /> strong breeding industry.  Its economic importance has been recognised in the support it obtains nationally.  Export performance remains a critical barometer of the health of the sector. Perhaps of greater importance to the sector is that it is based on a thriving and vibrant racing industry.  For many, including owners and breeders, racing is an important industry.  It contributes significantly to employment, exports and the tourist trade.  The esteem in which our horseracing industry is held internationally and the importance of the industry to our domestic economy cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>In recent years the IHA has suffered badly from underinvestment and competition from other leisure sports.  Today's generation has got used to being offered a very high class range of facilities at entertainment venues.  Gone are the days when people are prepared to put up with second class facilities and services.  The horseracing industry has a significant job on hand to attract newcomers, male and female, young and old from all walks of life.  I have some interest in horseracing as a means of recreation.  It is an exciting sport and I am satisfied that the potential exists for significant growth provided there is proper marketing and facilities are maintained at a leading international level.</P>
    <P>I have been most impressed by the work of the IHA since I established it in 1994 and I pay tribute to its chairman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, and the board.  All the people I mentioned have very important jobs in their own right and are very committed in industry, enterprise and commerce. Yet they put much time aside for the service of the State.  They get little enough by way of compensation for their work and they deserve our appreciation.</P>
    <P>The board and chairman of the IHA have done a tremendous job in developing a strategy for the thoroughbred racing industry.  The board has produced a plan up to 2001 which deals comprehensively with all aspects of the industry from the manner in which it is administered to how difficulties concerning racecourse development, betting and prize money should be tackled.  It is an ambitious plan which has already got a kick start with the opening of the ulta-modern racecourse at Mallow, County Cork, and the provision of a new stand at the course in Galway.  There are also new facilities in Ballinrobe while my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, opened new facilities in Clonmel.  Early this year I opened new facilities in Listowel and Tralee.  In Tramore when the racecourse seemed to be in jeopardy people put their hands in their pockets and ensured the facility was maintained.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important element of the plan was the establishment of the capital development fund which will see an investment of up to £42 million in racecourses over a relatively short period.  This initiative represents a key turning point for the sector and I am confident it will <Col N="729" /> ensure its ability to expand and develop in a planned manner.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to introduce the Bill.  It will be helpful to the National Stud which is a national treasure.  The board of the stud has been doing a great job while the manager, John Clarke, and his assistant, Annette Boland, and their staff have been doing an outstanding job.</P>
    <P>The race apprentice school, a facility adjacent to the National Stud, is doing a tremendous job and producing some world class jockeys.  I am aware of many young people, some from difficult backgrounds, who have trained at the school and have reached the top of their professions.  While we have a very good academic system in Ireland, there is scope for schools such as this.  I commend Stan Cosgrove and Derek O'Sullivan who are involved in that enterprise and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael has no problem with the Bill.  I have not heard any complaints about the proposal from anyone outside this House, nor have I had consultation with anyone about it.  I have visited the National Stud on a number of occasions.  For an enterprise so dependent on space, it is unfortunate the stud is losing approximately 100 acres between the severed portion and the land for the dual carriageway.  We have no problem with the proposed measures; the last thing one would want to do is haul stock across a carriageway.</P>
      <P>The severed land is now State property and I assume it will fetch a fair price.  Would it not be a sensible proposition to commit the moneys realised from the sale back to the stud?  I am sure there are many things it could do with the money, given its varied range of activities.  On the occasions I visited the stud, I noticed that space was at an absolute premium.  When mares from outside the country come to the stallions, they have to stay in the stud for a period of several weeks.  I have not spoken to management at the stud, but it would be very serious if in future land adjacent to the stud came up for sale and the stud was unable to purchase it.  There is no reason the proceeds of the sale should not be diverted back into the stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud is run by very enlightened and intelligent people.  I fully subscribe to the Minister's view that it is a valuable national asset, particularly as a tourist attraction.  On the day I visited Tully last year, there was a shortage of parking facilities as people from all over the world and from Ireland were visiting the stud. There are many other attractions such as the Japanese Gardens for people who do not have an interest in horses, I am not <i>au fait</i> with the manner in which the legislation will operate once it passes through the House, but I hope it will state clearly that if the severed portion of land is sold, the funds realised from the sale will be reinvested in the stud and its various activities.  I am sure all Members would be in agreement on that.  I am not sure whether <Col N="730" /> the severed portion of land is currently being used by the stud.  If not, what use is it being put to?  Will it be used in some shape or form until a decision is made?  One should not allow 50 acres of good land to lie idle.  I hope there will be a return to the State on this asset.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate the dual carriageway had to pass through the stud.  I recall that many members of Kildare County Council expressed dissatisfaction about the carriageway and Deputy Power will be aware of that.</P>
    <P>One could be forgiven for thinking that Ireland is a world leader in the thoroughbred and horse racing industry.  Stallions and mares from all over the world were present in the stud when I visited it last year.  A large number of people are employed in the stud, which is an industry in its own right.  I am not involved in horse racing to any great extent but, as a sport, there is none better. It might not be as exciting as Galway beating Kildare in football, but people derive many hours of pleasure from it.  Horse racing is a sport for the poor as well as the rich; everyone is entitled to a flutter from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a capital development fund.  I am delighted a Galway company has decided to carry out work on the stand at Ballybrit racecourse.  That represents a huge commitment, but the Galway Races is one of the biggest events on the racing calendar in July and August. Unless proper facilities are provided, people will not attend race meetings, football matches and so on.</P>
    <P>High standards prevail in regard to the breeding of horses at the National Stud.  I know people who are involved in horse breeding in a small way but none of them will ever become millionaires as a result.  However, if one hits a good bloodline and sells to a continental or international buyer, it is like winning the lotto.  When that happens, it is a happy time to be a horse breeder.  We acknowledge the effort many horse breeders have made over the years.  Many of them never made a penny.  They were close to hitting the jackpot on several occasions but something always went wrong.</P>
    <P>I remember one occasion when a small horse breeder in County Galway sold an animal to a German buyer at an excellent price.  The horse passed all veterinary tests and its bloodline was right.  When the horse was loaded onto the transporter its hoof got caught in the runway and it was never sold.  It was worth thousands of pounds and then five minutes later the transaction went up in smoke.  No insurance covers that.  One must compliment the men and women who have spent so many years and so much of their talent on horse breeding They are very important to thoroughbred breeding and horse racing.</P>
    <P>Although this is enabling legislation, I presume some Department has a policy to sell this land.  I ask the Minister that the proceeds should be given to the company which runs the National Stud at Tully so it can be used for further expansion <Col N="731" /> or for continuing its core principle.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this enabling legislation.  This Bill provokes crucial questions.  In order to expand and improve our national infrastructure, should we put all other considerations aside and persist with the development in hand?  In such developments should we ensure other considerations associated with natural surroundings or places of national interest are prioritised above the most efficient and effective mechanism of putting new infrastructure in place?</P>
      <P>As anyone heading west via Kildare knows, work is under way on a motorway which will by-pass Kildare town.  The need for this by-pass is overwhelming.  Kildare town is a bottleneck which plays havoc for residents and business people.  If the town is to develop, the sooner the by-pass is completed the better.  Kildare is a historic town with many interesting features.  The by-pass will also help businesses.  The possible sale of Kildare barracks will allow further development.</P>
      <P>However, the further development of the by-pass will result in the carving up of the National Stud which contributes enormously to our growing equestrian industry through its breeding, training and educational facilities.  Kildare County Council has already acquired some of the land contained in the National Stud compound for the purposes of developing the motorway.  As a result, the stud has been severed.  The area of severed land is no longer useful for the purposes of the National Stud.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has no power to sell or lease the land under current legislation, hence the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed, I want a number of assurances from the Minister to ensure the status of the National Stud as our most important equestrian centre is not weakened.  Like Deputy Connaughton, I ask that the money from the sale of this land be given back to the National Stud, for the development of present facilities or the possible purchase of an out farm.  Training facilities and land are needed for foals, mares and stallions. It is important that every possible piece of land available is kept in the remit of the stud.</P>
      <P>While anyone passing through Kildare in the past few weeks may have thought that football was the only passion of the county, Kildare is the heart of the horse industry.  The National Stud has given this industry huge national and international importance and I hope it will not be undermined by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, the IHA has been good to Kildare as regards the development of horse racing facilities in the county.  Next Monday a new stand will be opened on Naas racecourse. Punchestown and the Curragh have also been developed.  These three magnificent facilities give a focus to horse racing in Kildare which is the envy of everyone in Ireland.  Praise should be <Col N="732" /> given to the IHA for the development of these facilities which are 20 minutes drive from Dublin. It is important that we have such facilities for the development of the horse racing industry.  Everyone involved with those three developments is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reassure us that the sale of these lands will not be to the detriment of the National Stud and that it will be compensated. There is no reason wider powers should be vested in the Minister as regards the remainder of the National Stud property.  The powers given to the Minister applying to the sale or rent of the property should be limited.</P>
    <P>There are other implications arising from the development of the Kildare by-pass.  I am seeking a reassurance that every step be taken to protect the Pollardstown Fen.  This was the most contentious issue as regards the by-pass.  Everyone in Kildare agreed it was necessary but many saw the possibility of damage to the Pollardstown Fen, which is of international renown.  From an environmental point of view, it is vital that this is protected.  I am sure the effective officials of Kildare County Council will ensure that is done.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Japanese Gardens has access to the motorway.  I am delighted a second garden will be developed as a millennium project.  As Deputy Power and I know from passing through that area many times during the week, it is marvellous to see the number of tourists who visit the gardens.  People may not realise how many people visit them.  I congratulate the National Stud for ensuring the further development of a magnificent tourism attraction.</P>
    <P>Kildare is one of the worst bottlenecks in the country and it is time a by-pass was constructed. Everyone living and working in Kildare will have a more peaceful life because of the motorway which is a much needed comfort.  Kildare is lucky as regards infrastructure.  Practically the entire county is served by either by-passes or links. Further development of the N7 to include by-passing Monasterevin will result in an unbroken run of good road between Dublin and the Portlaoise bypass.  That will allow the towns on that route to develop further, as was the case with Newbridge and Naas.  I hope Kildare and Monasterevin will experience similar development.</P>
    <P>However, there is a problem on the other side of the county.  Kilcullen has been bypassed but we await the alignment of Crookstown and Timolin to join the alignment of Bolton Hill and the bypass of Castledermot.  That would complete the necessary infrastructure in County Kildare to allow its main towns to develop.  The only other town in the county with major traffic problems is Athy where there is a need for an outer or inner relief road.  Controversy over which option is best is currently raging in Athy.  The National Roads Authority should arrive at a quick decision on the issue because Athy, like the other towns, has a right to develop.</P>
    <P>County Kildare acts as a corridor for a vast amount of the country's traffic.  Even when the <Col N="733" /> bypass is constructed at Kildare town it will not serve the town or county effectively unless the rest of the infrastructure is put in place.  Furthermore, the bottleknecks in Athy must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the racing industry in Kildare town.  I, too, congratulate everybody involved with the equestrian school.  Some of Ireland's top jockeys were trained at that school and it is important that the jockeys who currently attend it are given a proper academic education in addition to an equestrian education.  I am delighted at how the school has developed.  It is renowned throughout the world and attracts interest both as a structure and as a school whose places are highly sought after by foreign students.</P>
    <P>The equestrian school is a major factor in the development of the equestrian industry in Kildare.  That industry is probably the major industry in the county in terms of employment. Everything possible must be done to ensure its continued development.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation.  However, if finance becomes available as a result of this legislation the Government should ensure it is either returned to the National Stud to develop its facilities or to purchase an out farm on which those facilities could be located.  It is essential that the development of the National Stud is not hindered by the removal of this stretch of land.  The legislation will be of great benefit to Kildare, particularly to the development of Kildare town, the Japanese Gardens and the provision of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the development of all towns in the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>As a regular visitor to the National Stud and the Japanese Gardens, I was disappointed to learn it would be necessary to divide the facility to build the Kildare town bypass. However, the county council believes it is the only real option for the town so the division must be seen as a necessary evil.  Anybody who travels through Kildare town, particularly at weekends, will be aware of the necessity for a bypass of that town and of Monasterevin.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that there is so little co-operation between local authorities on planning matters. The need for a bypass of Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin and Portlaoise was known for some years but the local authorities involved have basically pursued their own projects.  There was little co-operation between them whereas if the bypasses concerned were worked on jointly there would have been a significant reduction in the overall cost.  Large tranches of funds came from Europe for this infrastructure and it could have been constructed at a cheaper price. However, the bypasses of Kildare and Monasterevin are under construction and motorists will be keen to see them completed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that some of the land being divided will not be suitable for or be required by the National Stud.  While no decision has been made about that land, I urge him to consult <Col N="734" /> local organisations before he decides on it. The barracks in Kildare town were closed recently and there will probably be major changes in the town in the next few years.  I hope the Minister will consult local people to see if the land can be used for the benefit of the community rather than being sold.  The area involved is 21.6 hectares so it is a valuable parcel of land.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people who have served on the board of the National Stud.  It went through some difficult periods but in recent years it has been an outstanding success.  The stallion Indian Ridge has stood there for a number of years and he is considered one of the most successful stallions in Europe.  He has sired a number of winners. Members who are familiar with the horse sales will be aware that the foals and yearlings from Indian Ridge are much sought after.</P>
    <P>Racing is a gamble at any time.  The National Stud displayed great foresight in acquiring Desert Prince in June.  The stud purchased the horse after it won the Irish 2,000 guineas.  Unfortunately, the horse was beaten in Ascot but since then it has won the Prix de Moulin in France and, last week, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in Ascot.  It is an extremely valuable property and if he wins his final race, the Breeders Cup, the National Stud will have a bargain.  Members are often critical of the decisions of State bodies or boards but in this case the gamble by the National Stud will pay huge dividends in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The stud has also acquired Croco Rouge which is the current favourite for the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe next Sunday.  While there will not be any Irish trained runners in the race there will be great Irish interest in the performance of that horse.  Let us hope he produces the goods on the day.  The chairperson of the board of the National Stud Mrs. Chryss O'Reilly, has taken great interest in its activities.  She has wide connections on an international level which she has used to the advantage of the stud.</P>
    <P>The racing industry is an important industry which provides much employment in County Kildare.  Kildare is seen as the home of horse racing and long may that continue.  The visitors' centre in the National Stud has been a great success. It attracts an increasing number of visitors each year, with more than 2,000 people visiting it each week.  That has a tremendous spin-off for the town itself and I hope it can be improved upon after the by-pass is opened.</P>
    <P>I thank those involved in the National Stud for their association with the Kildare football team. Anyone who drove through Kildare town last week will have seen a big sign which stated: &ldquo;The National Stud for the fillies and the Sam Maguire for the lilies&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, it did not work out that way and I know there were many disappointed people in Kildare last Monday evening when the team came back to the town square without the Sam Maguire cup.  No doubt, we can rectify that next year.</P>
    <P>The racing industry is a very important part of Kildare, although we may take it for granted <Col N="735" /> when we live there.  Apart from the jobs aspect, which is important in putting food on the table in many County Kildare homes, as a leisure activity it is supported by a large number of people in the country and we are grateful for that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to encourage, if that is the right word, more horses to run in the President's colours.  Previously, we saw the President's colours being carried on racecourses, but this has not happened in the past couple of years.  The Minister should examine the matter to see how he can improve it.  A previous President had a horse called Seskin Bridge which finished second in the Grand National.  The President's colours offer a great window of opportunity for the racing industry and it is something we should avail of.  I would like to see the colours being carried in the near future, particularly in the national hunt area which is not as expensive as flat racing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned small breeders. People who speak with authority on the subject say that one sure way of making a small fortune in racing is to invest a large one, and there are many who will bear out the truth of that statement. Many people are involved in racing, not in the same league as Coolmore Stud but in a small way.  We must acknowledge the tremendous contribution the Coolmore operation has made to racing, bringing it to a level unparalleled anywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>The industry is growing all the time as more people become interested in racing.  During the summer I read that a new racing syndicate has been formed in Leinster House with a few new owners.  I wish them well with their investment and I hope that when the day comes they will let us in on it.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Irish Horseracing Authority on the professional manner in which it has handled its brief to develop racing.  We have far too many racing days, however, and we do not have the population to sustain them all.  Something will have to be done to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>Over the years many people have been critical of the fact that facilities at race courses were quite poor.  To a large extent that has now been rectified at nearly all race courses.  As Deputy Wall outlined, we have seen major improvements, particularly in County Kildare at the Curragh, Punchestown &mdash; which is unequalled in Europe &mdash; and Naas racecourses.  At Naas next week we will all get to see the progress that has been made there.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in racing must realise that they are competing with other attractions and unless they provide proper facilities people will go elsewhere.  There are all sorts of attractions, sporting and otherwise, and racing must provide proper facilities and services if it is to attract the customers that are so badly needed at race tracks.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the Race Centre in Kildare, the brainchild of Mr. Stan Cosgrove. It has had tremendous success over a number of years and has been well supported by <Col N="736" /> trainers and a number of owners also.  In the past, if a young person wanted to become involved in racing they were apprenticed to a trainer and history shows that a small percentage of them made the grade.  It is a bit like a vocation, however, because many tend to stay in the industry.  Apart from the horse racing aspect, the Race Centre has succeeded in educating apprentices in all aspects of racing.  A number of them who do not manage to become jockeys take up employment in other areas of the industry.  Apprentices from that school are currently employed all over the world in every area of the racing industry.  It has been a great success and many of the top jockeys riding both in Britain and Ireland today have gone through the Race Centre.  A young man from Kerry, Mr. Timmy Houlihan, is one of the youngest apprentices currently at the school.  On his first ride in his native Kerry he rode a winner, so they are still managing to produce them in Kildare.  I thank everyone involved in the Race School for their great work in improving the lot of those involved in racing and I wish them continued good luck.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the interest he has shown in the racing industry generally, and particularly in Desert King.  Someone thought for a while that the Minister was the stable lad, but he has taken a great interest in the horse and I know he is on a winner.  I wish him well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate affords us to have a discussion not just on the proposed Kildare by-pass but also on the wider subject of the National Stud and the racing industry.  I have no difficulty with the legislation which, presumably, is very necessary from the point of view of allowing the by-pass to progress. I trust that over the next few years all of us will benefit from being able to by-pass the town of Kildare, not that Deputy Dukes's local town causes me any great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the people there are very pleasant but at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon it can be pretty congested so the quicker we can move around it the better.</P>
      <P>As we are discussing the National Stud and the racing industry generally, I wish to make a number of suggestions to the Minister, Deputy Walsh. I recognise and appreciate his own personal interest in the development of the racing industry. When discussing horseracing, we cannot ignore the fact that it is more than the so-called sport of kings; it is an industry that employs thousands of people at various levels such as breeding, training and race courses.  We are talking about a major sport which is a jewel in the crown of Irish industry. It is an industry which can employ more and more people in the future and we must continue to develop and expand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peak at which the racing industry stands today internationally is due in no small measure <Col N="737" /> to the success of the National Stud.  The Minister provided us with an interesting background and history of the National Stud.  The involvement of many people with the National Stud over the years has brought the racing industry to its current high level.  It now looks as if moneys will become available from the sale of some National Stud lands over the next year or two.  We must ensure that the suggestion of Deputy Connaughton is taken up &mdash; that this money should be available for reinvestment in the National Stud and in the horse industry generally.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is now competing at a very high level.  There was a time when only a few international studs attempted to purchase the best stallions.  We have now reached the stage where top class stallions can cost up to £20 million each and resources must be made available for the National Stud to compete at that level. The National Stud is basically dependent on the taxpayer and I hope that moneys raised from the sale of these lands will be made available to ensure the National Stud will have the required purchasing power.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is competing with big players, not just at home but abroad, and it will need those resources to allow it to purchase the top quality stock with which it has become synonymous. The National Stud must consider other aspects of the industry.  The situation in which the racing industry now finds itself has altered dramatically over the past 20 years.  Substantial money is now available to racing industries in the Middle East. While we welcome them into the horse racing industry, they are a major challenge to the National Stud, Coolmore Stud, Rathbarry Stud and our other major stud farms.  If the Irish industry is to survive and expand, we must support it in every way possible.</P>
    <P>We must support small breeders.  The National Stud has played an important part in helping small breeders to develop their enterprises over the years.  However, because stallion fees are so high &mdash; they must be to justify the large purchase price paid for stallions &mdash; we must ask ourselves what we can do to assist small breeders.  We must ask the National Stud what it can do to assist them as it is the mainstay of the racing industry.</P>
    <P>I recently studied the fees being charged by the National Stud for its stallions.  Deputy Power mentioned the stallion, Indian Ridge, for which the fee is 30,000 guineas.  Small breeders would not be able to pay such a price.  The lowest fee charged for a National Stud sire in County Kildare is £2,500.  That is a substantial fee for a small breeder to pay.  We should ask the National Stud to look more sympathetically at small breeders who cannot afford to pay stallion fees of £2,500, let alone £5,000 or £10,000, particularly if it is given more resources.  If we cannot support small breeders, we will suffer in the future.</P>
    <P>Large breeders have financial resources but small breeders, who are the mainstay of the industry, need support and encouragement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> There is support and assistance for almost every other type of agricultural activity, yet small breeders are given no State support.  We must be as sympathetic as possible to small breeders so that their lives are made a little more bearable.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the relatively high prices of foals and yearlings.  However, two or three years ago prices were at rock bottom.  I attend a number of horse sales each year and I have seen foals making £600 or £700 and yearlings making £1,000 or £1,500.  No profit is made on such sales and that is why we must try to protect the small breeder in whatever way we can. The National Stud can play a part by making top quality stallions available at economic prices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the National Stud is standing a number of its stallions in smaller stud farms throughout the country as many small breeders do not have the transport or the resources to travel 100 or 150 miles to where a stallion of their choice might be available at a reasonable fee.  I would like the National Stud to co-operate with smaller stud farms and to stand a large number of their stallions in centres throughout the country where they would be more accessible to smaller breeders.</P>
    <P>I would like the National Stud, in conjunction with Teagasc, to organise seminars for breeders, particularly small breeders.  The National Stud runs courses which are attended by students from all over the world.  The interest being generated world-wide suggests they are top class courses. These courses are needed by many smaller breeders. If they could be organised on a more regional basis, in conjunction with Teagasc as horse breeding is a rural enterprise, we could assist small breeders.  I ask the Minister to discuss that possibility with the National Stud.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the past year thoroughbred foal registrations have increased by 574 up to 7,130.  While that suggests a growing industry, we must remember that quality and quantity do not always come together.  We must be careful not to confuse an increase in numbers with maintenance of quality.  As a result of the low prices being paid two and three years ago, many breeders and owners had no option but to sell animals cheaply.  They put stock on the market which might not have been of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of what happened in the half-bred and showjumping industries over the past ten to 20 years.  The showjumping industry was affected by poor quality horses. Some 20 to 30 years ago the showjumping industry was the best world-wide.  As a result of poor breeding policy and an oversupply of poor stock, that situation changed.  Only for the remedial action taken in recent years the half-bred and showjumping industries would be in severe difficulty.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to allow the same thing to happen to our racing industry.  Competition has never been higher not just from the Middle East, but from Australia and New Zealand.  The</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> Japanese and Indians are now taking a fresh interest in racing and they have huge financial resources.  We must ensure that our breeding stock is of the highest quality.  We must be careful that we do not confuse an increase in quantity with an increase in quality.</P>
    <P>It was suggested a number of years ago that a scheme should be introduced to get rid of poor quality stock in the half-bred industry.  The public reacted strongly as it believed the proponents of such a scheme favoured the shooting of every second mare.  However, that was not the proposal. We must consider giving incentives to breeders to trade up rather than trade down.  We should encourage a breeder who has a mare that is not of top quality and has produced a foal worth 500 to 1,000 guineas a year to take it out of commission and to invest his money in better quality stock.  It could be a once-off scheme but it should be considered because we cannot afford to run down our quality brood mare stock and replace it with a larger quantity of inferior animals.</P>
    <P>I support the retention of the tax exemption on stallion fees.  This measure was introduced many years ago and it has produced dramatic results for those working in the bloodstock industry.  We cannot afford to change it.  With international competition from the Middle East, Japan and the United States, unless we retain that incentive our stud farms will become second class.  I fully support the retention of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the introduction of a scheme for the owners of brood mares because it is not acceptable that all the incentives fall on one side of the equation?  Many breeders own one or two mares, an expensive occupation which yields low profits.  I hope the Minister will consider introducing an incentive, tax-based or otherwise, to cater for the owners of brood mares.  A person who owns between 15 and 30 animals operates at a certain level but farmers in rural areas who breed from one or two mares must be provided with incentives.  I hope the Minister will consider some proposals in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the horseracing industry and I agree with his statement that facilities in this area require further improvement.  The racecourse and facilities at Mallow have been transformed as a result of investment from the Irish Horseracing Authority.  However, many similar projects are required in locations throughout the country.  People who attend race meetings are no different from those who attend other sporting events and they require and demand top class facilities.  I hope what has been achieved in Mallow in recent years will be reflected in improvements to other racecourses throughout the country in the future, which will help to increase the numbers of people attending race meetings.</P>
    <P>Attendance at race meetings is not as good as it should be.  One of the worrying aspects of this problem is the age profile of racegoers.  We are failing to attract new and young spectators to race <Col N="740" /> meetings.  Young people represent the future life-blood of the industry.  Consideration must be given to this problem and measures put in place to resolve it.  The advertisement of the greyhound industry in recent years has been effective and it has resulted in an increase in attendance at greyhound race meetings.  We must take similar action in respect of the horseracing industry and try to attract younger people.  I would like to see increased advertising, be it on radio or television or in newspapers, to encourage people to attend race meetings.  Further promotion is required.</P>
    <P>My final point regarding the horseracing industry relates to prize money.  I know the Minister does not hold the purse strings in this regard but the prize money on offer in horseracing is totally inadequate.  I am sure it averages only 40 to 50 per cent of the prize money available in the past. Some major owners such as the Aga Khan and the Godolphin Organisation have complained about the level of prize money available in British and Irish racing.  If multi-millionaire owners claim that prize money is insufficient, what must be the position regarding smaller owners and breeders? I hope the Minister can discuss with the powers that be the need to increase the level of prize money.  If it is not increased substantially in the next 12 months to two years, increasing numbers of people will drift away from the industry.  We need the involvement of more, not fewer, people.</P>
    <P>We have a strong industry, but there are problems on the breeding, racing and prize money fronts which must be addressed as soon as possible. If the Minister can encourage the appropriate personnel in his Department, in the Irish Horseracing Authority, racecourse managers, etc., to consider these problems, I am sure the industry will be strengthened, more people will wish to own horses, either individually or as part of a syndicate, attendances at race meetings will increase and further jobs will be created.  We have a strong national industry.  Horseracing is the sport of kings but it is also the sport of the common man and woman.  Those who attend at their local betting office on Saturday evenings are not necessarily the people who will be in the parade ring on Sunday afternoons.  However, they are all part of the same industry and we must do everything possible to support their efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the horseracing industry of which I have no great knowledge.  Deputies Bradford and Connaughton and Deputy Dukes, who lives in County Kildare, have dealt or will deal in greater depth with issues such as the National Stud, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important Bill in terms of State property and the fact that it will facilitate the construction of a by-pass in Kildare.  Given the need for a by-pass in County Monaghan, I hope the provision of funds for the Kildare by-pass will not have a detrimental effect on projects in my county.  If I believed that would happen I might not support the Bill.  The Bill is part and parcel of the overall process of making necessary <Col N="741" /> improvements to our road structure.  When I travelled from my home to Ferns, County Wexford, earlier in the week, my car reached an average speed of 40 miles per hour.  In the past, even travelling within the speed limit, one could average 50 miles per hour for the same journey.  That is an indication of the dramatic increase in traffic on our roads.  We must use the Bill to facilitate necessary improvements to the road structure.</P>
    <P>The horseracing industry is very important to Ireland.  One need only consider the Horse Show at the RDS, the Galway Races or other events to see the effect the industry has on the profile of the nation.  Ireland benefits greatly from the international publicity such events attract.  The industry's knock-on effect in terms of tourism is extremely important.  That is one of the areas on which we must concentrate our efforts in the future.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I hope the continuation of the peace process will add to the growth of tourism.  An active and progressive horseracing industry will improve available sports facilities and provide added impetus to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the industry is important not only to larger farmers and horse owners but also to smaller farmers and those who breed only one or two horses.  I am familiar with a breeder of advancing years who is crippled and one of whose horses competed in Belgium in recent days.  The level of bureaucracy was such that if he did not attend the show in Belgium and his horse won he would not be able to collect his prize.  Thankfully, we resolved this matter &mdash; which represents bureaucracy gone mad &mdash; through the use of diplomacy.  Small breeders who are hard pressed financially or whose health is not good should not have to endure such difficulties to obtain that to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>One of the issues to which reference has not been made is that of cull horses.  The Minister will be aware that I raised this matter with his Department on a number of occasions.  We may not like discussing it but horses, perhaps because of old age or some other reason, must be disposed of. There was a valuable facility designed for this purpose in my region, based in Dundalk, but it is no longer available.  Given the raft of regulations governing the live export of horses, many small and medium farmers face serious problems in finding a means to attract a reasonable price for animals or to dispose of them.  Will the Minister give further consideration to this issue?</P>
    <P>The main reason I wished to make a contribution to the Bill was to obtain clarification because the Bill not only deals with the agriculture industry but also with State property. What other State property is dealt with under the Bill?  I specifically refer to the army barracks in Castleblayney and others that might be affected. Deputy Power said in light of the stud issue in Kildare, he wished to see consultation with the people involved locally.  Subject to clarification on who has the right to sell, I wish to see the <Col N="742" /> Government fully consult with people at local level regarding the sale of Castleblayney army barracks or perhaps take kudos from the individual who handed over the National Stud as a gift to the nation.  The Minister for Defence might agree that the army barracks be given also as a gift to the nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still State property, which is specifically referred to in the Bill.  We have the right to know whether this property and many others qualify under the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the horse industry, it is important that support be given to smaller breeders and others involved in the training and upgrading of horses. I appreciate that Leader and other schemes can provide help in this area.  However, it is vital that small and medium sized breeders be given the help necessary to retain them in the industry. There are not many other options.  The Minister and others in the past promoted such industries as deer farming, etc.  but the equine industry is the most relevant in terms of an alternative enterprise for small breeders in light of the great difficulties in the market.</P>
      <P>Unlike others from the Kildare area who are interested in making sure another property is purchased from the sale of the National Stud and in light of the dire circumstances of farmers nationally I realise this might give the Minister the necessary funds to create a proper rescue package for them, especially small dairy farmers and others not included in the package he produced. That might be a less tenuous link to this Bill, but it is still very relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Minister is looking for the authority to sell State lands in the form of lands comprising the National Stud.  He essentially wants the Dáil to give him <i>carte blanche</i> on what to do with the National Stud at any point in the future despite the fact that only a small proportion of the land is affected by the Kildare by-pass decision.  I am disturbed that he has given no hint about the plans he or the Government might have for those lands.  He wants a totally unrestricted power to dispose of or use them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That raises serious difficulties.  I do not know for what the land might be suitable, but I have noticed a highly disturbing trend in recent times where agencies of the State enter the land market on the same basis as private speculators.  This is totally reprehensible and should be knocked on the head.  An example is the Eastern Health Board site at Blanchardstown Hospital.  The hospital was built in the days of the late Dr. Noel Browne as a tuberculosis sanatorium in a wonderful parkland setting, unusual for an urban medical facility.  However, instead of the Department of Health providing the necessary funds for the hospital to carry out a very necessary upgrading <Col N="743" /> and modernisation of the facility, the EHB was pushed into the land market to speculate essentially on that wonderful asset, which has been sold to private developers for a price in excess of £30 million.</P>
    <P>This relates to the ethics of the State moving into the private property market on the same basis as private speculators and, therefore, being a part of the disastrous situation that obtains where houses are priced completely out of the reach of ordinary people.  For example, if the EHB lands are sold for that price it will work its way through to the price of the houses, which will, of course, be astronomical.</P>
    <P>The Government comes into the House on the one hand professing concern about the increase in house and land prices while, on the other, State agencies participate in that reprehensible speculative market.  I seek clarification in this regard. Has there been discussion on the lands that comprise the National Stud and what they would and would not be used for after the by-pass <i>tranche</i> is removed?  Is it proposed to speculate on them as has been done elsewhere?</P>
    <P>There is little confidence in many quarters in some agencies of the State and the question of political involvement or influence on the terms under which State lands are sold.  For example, there is the scandal of Glending Wood in County Wicklow.  It was an invaluable State asset sold a number of years ago for a fraction of what it was worth in terms of its sand and gravel to a major concrete producer and quarrying company.  It was sold for a pittance which bore no relation to the real value that lay underground.  It was a grotesque abuse of State lands and one which local action groups saw fit to refer to one of the tribunals currently taking place.  The Minister should address these issues and be much more precise in this regard in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been raised by the Minister and previous speakers is that of the racing industry.  While glowing tributes have been paid to the industry, nobody alluded to the reprehensible tax scam in it.  It is an incredible fact that millionaire owners of prime stud farms do not have to pay one penny in taxation on a significant part of their activities.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> When we have a political system in which powerful vested interests, particularly the millionaire section, contribute vastly to the two main political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the interests of ordinary people are distorted and come second.  I want the Minister or the Minister of State to tell me their plans for the National Stud, in which they seek to have a free hand in its sale or lease. Do they intend yet again to bow to powerful private interests and use a State asset for the enrichment of a few individuals?</P>
      <P>A worker who is actively involved in the horseracing industry told me that employers in the industry cannot find enough workers with the necessary training and ability to take up the jobs that exist here and abroad.  There are many young people in urban and rural areas who have a passionate interest in horses.  However, instead of developing that interest in working class communities, as a conduit for young people to move into permanent employment, there has been a one-sided repressive enactment of the Control of Horses Bill.  That Act seeks to snatch horses from young people in the working class communities without putting in place structures and support mechanisms to provide horse and pony clubs and training in veterinary care, which would have been a means for those young people to develop their interests and build a career in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister waxing lyrical about the merits of the horseracing industry does not sit well with what I see in working class communities, young people who would like to build a career in the industry not being given an opportunity to do so. The Minister and the Minister of State said they will make funding available to support those clubs.  I accept that, but the majority of the money <Col N="746" /> that was allocated by the State to county councils in Dublin to deal with this issue was used to round up and dispose of horses.  It is not appropriate for horses to graze on public greens or to roam the streets.  That is dangerous and no one wants that.  If, however, instead of a purely repressive mechanism, money had been invested in setting aside lands, providing facilities for horse and pony clubs and training, which I advocated on a number of occasions here, the social benefits would have been immense.  It would have assisted a section of our youth to overcome alienation. Instead they have become even more alienated because of the activities of the State and local authorities, which they perceive to be very one-sided.</P>
    <P>As the Minister's remarks on these issues were wide-ranging, the points I raised should be addressed by the Minister or the Minister of State when replying.  Since this Bill is specific and relates particularly to many hectares of the National Stud, the Minister must tell us if there have been discussions on the purposes for which the severed land will be used.  What does the Department intend to do with it?  I assume the Minister would not have introduced the Bill unless he and his Department had something in mind for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Bill. To ensure Deputy Higgins is aware of my stand-point, I admit I am biased about the Bill because I have great personal affection and respect for the National Stud for many reasons.  I live approximately one mile from it and it is a pleasant place to walk, particularly in winter, to see what is happening and collect one's thoughts.  I have a special affection for the National Stud because in 1983, when life for me as the then Minister for Finance was difficult, I remember the lift I received late one evening when I was presented with an envelope which contained a dividend cheque for the State from the stud.  This was at a time when dividend cheques from semi-State companies were as rare as hens' teeth.  I have had an affection for the stud ever since which has continued undiminished. I hope the National Stud will continue for a long time to be a centre of excellence in the horse racing industry in the manner many of my colleagues mentioned.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill arises from a technicality, as the Minister explained.  In the rush to legislate, we and our predecessors over the past 70 years have often introduced measures that did not hang well together in terms of the combined effect of several different Acts.  In this case, there is need to rectify a slightly anomalous provision of an Act governing the National Stud that does not sit well with the current position.  The Minister should be commended for taking this sensible step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads me to reflect on comments I heard last night from a respected political correspondent. He once again came out with the canard that the performance of Deputies should be judged on the amount of legislation passed each <Col N="748" /> session.  I made the point previously that I wish some of the commentators would sit back and consider the position for a moment.  Although it will never happen, we would do our fellow citizens a great favour if we spent two years rectifying the contradictions and conflicts in existing legislation and codifying statutes rather than passing new legislation.  The Bill is a small example of an anomaly and there is also much to be tidied up in the licensing Acts and other areas. I am not impressed by people who measure the record of a Dáil by the amount of legislation passed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will open up the way towards rationalising a position in the National Stud.  This is necessary because there will be a motorway by-pass of Kildare town.  It is a pity the National Stud will be discommoded.  The Minister probably shares that view, but the route that will be taken by the by-pass is one of three that was given detailed and careful examination.  It was chosen as the best accommodation of all the interests involved.  A number of people will be discommoded by it, including the National Stud and others, but that is the price that must be paid for progress.</P>
    <P>Detailed and comprehensive consideration was given to all the effects during the public inquiry which was properly held.  The conclusions of the inquiry were well explained and motivated. However, my colleagues in Kildare South will agree the tactics that have been used recently to reopen the issue of the route appear to be questionable. There are legitimate interests and concerns about ground water flows in the area and particularly the effect on Pollardstown Fen. However, the public inquiry procedure is designed to deal with and elucidate such issues. It is not good for the process when people who had every opportunity to make their case and raise questions at the public inquiry find a stratagem for reopening the issue after it has concluded. I hope this type of tactic is not used often in the future.  If legitimate questions arise, the public inquiry is the place to raise them.  If questions are properly raised and submitted in that context, I have no doubt they will be properly examined.  Whatever else one might say about the process, there is no doubt the full available level of technical expertise is brought to bear on the preparation of proposals.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the National Stud to have a substantial chunk of land chopped off.  However, such difficulties were inevitable given the type of conclusions which had to be reached regarding the by-pass.  This makes it even more imperative, as Deputy Connaughton and others said, that any proceeds from the sale of a valuable piece of property in a prime development area near a motorway by-pass should be used to provide more jobs for people in Kildare or more houses for people who may get jobs in the area.  It is essential that any gain realised is reinvested in the National Stud and made available for its continued development to ensure it continues to be <Col N="749" /> a centre of excellence in horse breeding and perhaps other areas.</P>
    <P>The National Stud has shown that it can bring to bear a good deal of imagination and creativity on the way it does its business not only in horse breeding but also, as Deputy Wall said, in its contribution to tourism in the area.  A magnificent job was done in recent years.  If one looks today at the National Stud and its associated features and compares it to the position ten years ago, one will find an enormous difference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a good sign and showed imagination.  Unfortunately, the reality did not live up to our imagination.  Deputy Wall has measures in hand to rectify the matter for next year.</P>
      <P>The funds that will become available from the sale of the land &mdash; that is the likely outcome &mdash; should be reinvested in the National Stud to develop the industry.  It is the recurring fear of small breeders throughout the country that the Minister will conspire in introducing a system under which a levy will be placed on foals.  That would be inimical to the interests of small breeders. I do not know what the Minister has in mind but I urge him not to contemplate such a scheme. He should tell those who would like him to do so that he will not do so.  His colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has been approached about the issue.</P>
      <P>The use to which the land can be put should be looked at in terms of the contribution it can make to the overall development of Kildare town and its hinterland.  As Deputy Wall said, development opportunities may be offered following the closure of Magee Barracks as a Defence Forces installation.  A determinedly developmental approach should be taken to the use of McKee Barracks and the land that will no longer be used by the National Stud.  We have been presented with a rare opportunity to kick-start economic and social development in Kildare town and its hinterland.  The construction of a motorway bypass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;offers a perfect opportunity to devise a well articulated, concerted development plan for the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Defence briefed public representatives about his intentions in relation to McKee Barracks in Kildare and Devoy Barracks in Naas I proposed that Kildare County Council should take the lead in devising a set of proposals concerning their use and that of the National Stud given that it has a legitimate interest in the development of its functional area.  It is well placed to bring together the various actors who can contribute.  The Minister for Defence, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Kildare <Col N="750" /> County Council and community interests which should be consulted should combine to produce a well articulated development plan to exploit the fact that the by-passing of Kildare town will make economic and social development easier.  This should be followed by a rapid commencement of work on the Monasterevin by-pass and the link with the Portlaoise by-pass.  The effect of extending the motorway out of Dublin has been to move the bottleneck from Naas to Newbridge to Kildare.  It will eventually be moved to Monasterevin and Ballybrittas.  To those, including Members of this House, who find Kildare town a thorny problem on Friday evening, to use slightly vulgar language, &ldquo;they ain't seen nothing yet.&rdquo; Monasterevin will be an even bigger knot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power informed us that the Minister is sometimes mistaken for one of the stable lads at the National Stud which he visits regularly to admire his property.  He is to be commended for his enthusiasm.  I am sure he enjoys every one of his visits and receives a nice welcome.  On his next visit to Tully, when he has admired the birthplace of Patrick Sarsfield, will he avail of the opportunity to meet some local livestock farmers?  It would do him good to talk to them for an hour. He would return to his office firmly determined to add a great deal more to the package announced yesterday.  What he announced was the string.  It was a pitiful and pathetic reaction to a problem being felt throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the existing State Property Acts under which in cases where a business goes into liquidation and has not produced the normal company reports the property of the business reverts to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister has the power to waive this right.  In one case the Minister elected not to do so, although there is a successor who was not involved in the original business and is prepared to put a viable business in place.  This amounts to expropriation of a kind Deputy Higgins and his philosophical soul mates would be familiar with but which is out of place in a parliamentary democracy.  There are ample remedies under tax and company law. The time has come to look again at this provision.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate in such a positive way.  A number of interesting points were made.  Everyone spoke eloquently about the performance of the National Stud and about the way it is run.  It is a national asset and makes a major contribution to the thoroughbred breeding industry.  Its visitor centre is unique.  I commend the National Stud on being one of the first State bodies to devise a first rate project to celebrate the millennium, namely, St. Fiacre's Garden which will be an additional attraction at the stud as well as the Japanese Gardens, the Visitor's Centre and the museum where various artifacts can be viewed.  Memorabilia concerning Arkle is on display although it is said by some people that Shergar is not too far away.  I will pass on the comments about the performance <Col N="751" /> of the stud to the management, John Clarke, and his staff.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the outset, the Bill before the House essentially proposes to amend the State Property Act.  Under that Act a number of lands are excluded from sale by the State.  They include Johnstown Castle, the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park and the National Stud.  I assume these properties were included because they were bequeathed to the State as gifts.  Because the roadway is going through the property of the National Stud, we are simply removing the National Stud from the First Schedule.</P>
      <P>In regard to property being bequeathed to the State, it is some coincidence that in the year in question, 1943, the current Minister and the National Stud were both bequeathed to the State.</P>

      <P>The issue of the power to sell parts of the National Stud farm has been brought to a head by the ongoing work on the by-pass to Kildare town.  Unfortunately, the by-pass goes through the National Stud where there is approximately 800 acres of very fine land.  I visit the area on occasion to take a stroll and meet various visitors, including farmers.  I met about 60,000 farmers in Wexford yesterday that I did not know but I had a pleasant time there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a pleasant interaction with them and they appreciated that the taxpayers, through the Government, agreed to provide several millions of pounds to help them with fodder for the coming winter.</P>
      <P>A number of items were raised by Deputies. Deputy Power suggested that the President's colours should be seen more often on the race tracks.  We have had Giolla Mear and Seskin Bridge in the past and, more recently, Ridge Pool but it is an expensive business and I am not sure whether it would be prudent to spend taxpayers' money on race horses.  It might be more appropriate to stick to breeding, at which they are excellent, but there may not be much harm in doing that on occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton, Deputy Wall and others asked if any proceeds from the sale would be put back into the stud.  I am in favour of that.  I do not intend to do anything other than what the State body recommends which is also subject to approval by the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance is very sensitive about the proceeds from the sale of State bodies and it is not simply a question of putting those back into the various bodies.  The Department insists on having its say in these matters.  It is important that <Col N="752" /> adequate resources and finance are made available to the State body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton and other Deputies suggested that in regard to any future decision there should be consultation with local bodies in the Kildare region if either the council or the Kildare community wanted to use a portion of a property that had become available for recreation, housing or whatever, including the race training school. That would be desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes raised the question of the foal levy.  As I understand it, the foal levy proposal was put forward by the Irish Thoroughbred Racing Board which is composed of Irish thoroughbred breeders but there was no question of the Minister for Agriculture and Food promoting it in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford raised the matter of the National Stud becoming more involved in holding seminars and symposia on the industry.  The training courses run by the National Stud are excellent and many people at a very high level in the breeding industry worldwide are graduates of the National Stud.  I will bring the matter raised by Deputy Bradford to the attention of the Equine Institute Faculty in the University of Limerick which runs an excellent third level course on equine studies.  It also holds a number of seminars but Deputy Bradford was of the view that they should be held on a regional basis, and we can do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford also asked that more advertising, promotion and prize money be made available. Prize money is inadequate and many race courses are now availing of substantial sponsorship from commercial companies.  That is the right way to proceed because taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the equine industry generally with income foregone through taxation policy and the provision of a substantial development fund to the IHA of approximately £10 million per annum.  It is a matter for the directors of race courses to promote their races by getting sponsorship from commercial companies in their region.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the positive attitude of Deputies to this legislation.  It is a technical matter but it allowed Deputies to comment on the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<Col N="754" /> I have pleasure in introducing to the House the Bill for the establishment of the Western Development Commission on a statutory basis. The Western Development Commission has its origins in the &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo; initiative, which produced a report entitled A Crusade for Survival in 1994.  This report highlighted the problems of the region and began the process of identifying solutions.  Subsequently, a Government task force which was established to examine the report identified the need for a &ldquo;strategic focus which would provide direction to the activities of the various agencies operating in the Region, in partnership with the efforts of local communities.&rdquo; In its report, the task force recommended the establishment of a Western Development Partnership Board with a mandate to produce an action plan for the economic and social development of the region &mdash; defined as the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Clare &mdash; with the objective of achieving population stability before the end of the decade at 1991 census levels on a county basis.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Partnership Board was established by the Government in October 1994 and its action plan, The Challenge: a Positive Future Through Action, was published in May 1995.  The action plan's key recommendations were the establishment of a Western Development Commission and a western investment fund.</P>
      <P>On 14 May 1995, the Government approved the establishment of both a Western Development Commission, to replace the Western Development Partnership Board, and a western investment fund.  The Western Development Commission was subsequently established by the Government with effect from 1 January 1997.  The function of the commission essentially is to promote the economic and social development of the western region by collaborating with and promoting strategic linkages between the existing agencies operating in the region.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the commission on a statutory basis is evidence of the Government's ongoing determination and commitment to promoting the economic and social development of the west.  I believe that the commission has an important role to play in that process in co-operation with the other agencies and bodies and the various programmes which are being implemented in the west.</P>
      <P>The commission's role in working closely with the other economic and social actors in the region will facilitate the elaboration of a specific regional response to specific regional problems.  In addition, the western investment fund, which will be operated by the commission, will provide financial support for social and economic projects being implemented in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In brief, the Bill provides for the establishment of the commission on a statutory basis as well as the establishment of a western investment fund to be operated by the commission.  In the drafting <Col N="755" /> of the legislation I was particularly concerned to avoid duplication or competition with the activities of other agencies.  The commission is being established to further enhance, not undermine or dilute, the development efforts of other agencies operating in the region.  The functions of the commission, as defined in section 8, have been so drafted to ensure complementarity and to avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>Exchequer funding to cover the administrative and operating costs of the commission are provided for in the annual Vote of my Department. In addition, £25 million is being provided for the western investment fund on the basis of £2 million this year and £5 million in each of the years 1999 and 2000.  A review of the operation of the fund will be undertaken commencing in late 1999.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate only on those sections which I consider it important to comment on before the House.  Part 1 contains standard provisions relating to the short title, interpretation of the main terms used, penalties arising from disclosures by members or staff of the commission and provision for expenses incurred in administering the Act to be made from voted moneys.  I believe that these are self-explanatory and do not require further comment.  Part II of the Bill deals with a range of matters relating to the establishment, organisation, procedures and functions of the commission. Section 7 establishes the commission on a statutory basis with the legal status of a body corporate.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the commission are set out in section 8.  These include promoting, securing the promotion of, fostering, encouraging and assisting in the economic and social development of the western region.  In general terms this involves developing an overall strategy for achieving the commission's primary objective of economic and social development, working closely with Government Departments and agencies to co-ordinate and seek to refocus as necessary their priorities and programmes in support of the commission's primary functions and working closely with the private sector and representative business organisations to create the conditions to encourage investment in enterprise and job creation.</P>
    <P>More specifically, the functions of the commission include providing assistance for business and social enterprises and projects and encouraging the establishment, maintenance and expansion of such activity.  The realisation of the co-ordination and promotion functions assigned will require administrative support structures at both regional and national levels.  At the regional level the commission is developing both formal and informal contacts with the regional authorities and relevant State and non-State agencies and bodies operating in the region.  Close collaboration with Government Departments and their agencies is essential also if the commission is to successfully implement its mandate of monitoring progress of performance.  In practical terms, with <Col N="756" /> these objectives in mind a national liaison network and forum of western Ministers have been established.  The national liaison network comprises representatives of Government Departments and State agencies.  The purpose of the network is to provide a link between the Western Development Commission and senior officials of Government Departments and State agencies.  It provides a forum for policy discussion on targets and objectives for the seven western counties, as well as influencing the activities and policies of State agencies and Departments.  In order to provide additional momentum to the work of the national liaison network, I will contact all Government Departments shortly to confirm the nomination of a high level officer to the network. My Department will also arrange meetings and briefing sessions between these officials and the commission.</P>
    <P>The forum of western Ministers was established, at the suggestion of the Taoiseach, to facilitate contact between myself and ministerial colleagues from the west on matters of concern to the commission.  I am convinced that Ministers from the region have an invaluable contribution to make in helping the commission realise the strategy it is developing for the regeneration of the west.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating fora will permit the elaboration of a coherent regional strategy with appropriate consultation and contact between the various State agencies, Departments and the Western Development Commission.  Such positive co-ordination will, as I have mentioned, help ensure complementarity between the various State agencies and avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also provides that financial assistance will be in the form of the purchase of shares and the provision of loans in suitable investments. Grant aid is already being provided under various programmes operating on a national basis.  Where strategic sustainable projects, of an economic or social nature, are being developed the commission will be able to provide a further complementary means of financial support by taking out equity or providing loans.  This intervention will result in development projects being undertaken which otherwise might not have been launched.  The Department will also arrange meetings and briefing sessions between these officials and the commission.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 13 deal with the appointment and remuneration of the commission.  Provision is made for 11 ordinary members and a chairperson. I believe a board of this size should be highly effective in allowing geographic and sectoral representation without becoming unwieldy.  I will be appointing additional ordinary members over the coming weeks in line with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The requirements of developing a strategy, identifying priorities and co-ordinating and integrating regional and sectoral responses will necessitate the establishment of several advisory groups to assist the commission in its work.  These <Col N="757" /> are provided for in section 19.  It also allows persons other than members of the commission to be included in these committees.  This is because such persons may be able to provide the expert input and analysis required by the different committees. The commission will appoint the chairperson and pay any relevant expenses incurred by the committee members.  The current commission has already established five sectoral advisory committees.  These will provide advice in the areas of natural resources, manufacturing and services, tourism, the arts, marine and information technology.  These sectors were identified as strategic ones in the partnership board's action plan.  The committees comprise representatives of State agencies, third level institutions, local development organisations and the private sector. Their broad representative structure will further ensure synergy and co-operation between the various social and economic bodies operating in the region and will facilitate the elaboration of common regional development priorities.  Further committees will be established where they are considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Part III relates to finance and staffing.  Section 20 provides for the establishment of a western investment fund to be operated by the commission. This fund has an important role in providing financial assistance to facilitate investment in developing companies in the west and in supporting the Western Development Commission's function of promoting and encouraging investment by the public and private sectors.  As already indicated, some £25 million in Exchequer funding will be provided over six years.  In addition, the commission may, under section 25, accept gifts of money, land or other property provided that any conditions attached are consistent with its functions.  I am confident this investment fund will provide a major source of funding for small and medium enterprises in the west.  Several projects are already being examined and I have no doubt that additional jobs will arise as a result. Enterprise and jobs are the basis for economic and social development, allowing as they do people to remain in the west and build sustainable local communities.</P>
    <P>The commission is required, in accordance with section 22, to keep all accounts and to submit them to the Comptroller and the Auditor General for audit not later than three months after the end of the accounting period to which they relate.  Copies of the said accounts will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 23 also requires that the commission submit a report on its activities in the preceding year on or before 31 March each year.  This report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 and 27 deal with the staffing of the commission, including its terms and conditions, remuneration and allowances.  A staffing complement of nine was recently sanctioned for the commission.  This staffing provision, which is appropriate to its needs, will facilitate the implementation of its mandate.  I am pleased that the <Col N="758" /> question of staffing levels has been resolved before the establishment of the commission on a statutory basis.  As already indicated, administrative costs will be funded from an annual grant-in-aid from my Department.</P>
    <P>I propose to table three amendments on Committee Stage which clarify the original intention of the legislation.  The first of these is a technical change to section 8(1)(e)(i).  The draft Bill has the wording &ldquo;to consult with such Minister of the Government as it considers appropriate&rdquo;.  A change is required to delete the word &ldquo;Minister' and substitute the word &ldquo;Ministers&rdquo;.  I propose this change to indicate clearly that the Western Development Commission may consult with any Minister, as considered appropriate, rather than just a single Minister.</P>
    <P>In section 8(5), I will propose that the wording read:</P>
    <P>Financial or other material aid provided to enterprises or projects by the Commission shall be in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time (at such times as may be specified by the Minister) by the Commission with the consent of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, and the amount thereof, in the case of any particular enterprise or project, shall not exceed £250,000 without the consent in writing of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In other words, the commission can spend up to £250,000 but it will have to gain permission or have further consultation to spend more than that.  Detailed examination of the original wording suggested that it might be construed from it that ministerial approval would be necessary for each individual project being funded by the commission. This was not my intention as such a procedure would be unnecessarily cumbersome and bureaucratic.  The revised wording states more clearly that only projects exceeding £250,000 must be referred for approval.</P>
    <P>Regarding the powers of the commission to become involved in infrastructural works, I propose that the wording of section 8(2) be amended to read:</P>
    <P>The Commission shall not provide financial or other material aid for the infrastructural projects referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) or (d) of subsection (1) unless they are subsidiary and ancillary to business or social enterprises or projects.</P>
    <P>The intention was that the commission would not be involved in the funding of major infrastructural projects such as national roads.  The revised wording will however ensure that the commission can fund all works relating to a specific project where they include minor infrastructural works such as access or services which are an inherent part of the project.</P>
    <P>The more general role of the commission in relation to identifying and promoting developments involving infrastructure remains <Col N="759" /> unchanged.  The relationship between the commission and other State agencies operating in the region is clearly defined in the legislation, in particular section 8.  Section 8 (1)(b) empowers the commission:</P>
    <P>to identify business and social enterprises and projects, and infrastructural projects related to those projects that . should be accelerated</P>
    <P>and later:</P>
    <P>to promote, foster and encourage the provision, maintenance and, if appropriate, the enlargement of, and procure the provision of assistance for such infrastructural projects, both local and regional, as it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of economic and social development in the Western Region.</P>
    <P>This co-ordinating role will provide a cohesive focus for the various State authorities in the region in relation to infrastructural requirements. It can be seen that, while the commission has an advisory and co-ordinating role in relation to infrastructure, it is primarily involved with assisting business and social enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission is being established on a statutory basis to provide a body for the west which will answer the needs of the people there.  It will ensure a regional focus by national authorities, foster enterprise at a local level and, furthermore, co-ordinate the excellent work already being done in the area by various organisations both private and public, especially at local community level.  It will also work with State agencies to provide cohesion and foster a spirit of co-operation which will maximise the benefit to the entire region.  The western investment fund will provide funding to help people in the west to help themselves, and also to encourage investment in the west by others.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will give a new impetus to western development and promote the well-being of communities in the western region. I welcome this and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, in welcoming this Bill.  The proposal for a western development commission originally came from the Department of the Taoiseach and I was involved with it so I am happy the Minister of State was able to publish this legislation.  The heads had been proposed in early 1997 and were accepted by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the Government.  The delay in publishing this measure has resulted from the Taoiseach's lack of insight and understanding of rural communities.  He did not seem to have any plans when he took office.  Responsibility for the Western Development Commission was taken from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and finally landed on Deputy Davern's desk.  I am glad the Deputy has had the courage to go ahead with this <Col N="760" /> proposal and, by and large, our proposals are included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will trace the history of this issue.  Originally it was a group of small farmers near Loughrea who cried &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  They wanted to stay at home and their families to do likewise.  They also wanted a reasonable standard of living.  They did not turn to politicians to address their difficulties. Instead they went to their local church leaders who campaigned strongly for proposals to achieve a population balance.  They wanted self-sustaining economic activity and partnership between local, county and regional interests.  A period of idea generation followed which examined the skills, expertise, interests and experiences of people in the region.</P>
      <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, set up the Western Development Partnership Board which undertook a fuller study, a process continued by Deputy John Bruton when he became Taoiseach.  He recognised the leading role played by the Department of the Taoiseach in this area.  Deputies Reynolds and Bruton were correct to keep responsibility for this matter within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am critical of the present Taoiseach.  This is a matter of confidence in the west and the lack of confidence has led to horrific emigration and migration which has virtually denuded the west of its population.</P>
      <P>Many areas were pulled together quickly due to the leading role played by the Department of the Taoiseach.  This Bill attempts to address the difficulty and I wish Deputy Davern well, but my experience is that Departments are not forthcoming with ideas when asked to take part in interdepartmental groups dealing with infrastructure. The best example of this problem involved Deputy Andrews when he was Minister for the Marine.  He set up a commission to examine the difficulties faced by offshore islands.  The study was headed by the Department of the Marine but it also involved other Departments.  However, it failed to come to any conclusion even though Deputy Andrews had an interest in reaching a conclusion.  It was not until the issue came under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach that all the leading Departments involved in island development came together.  The same model should have been used in the case of the Western Development Commission.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach has a leading responsibility for some areas of social exclusion, an issue which will be dealt with by the Western Development Commission.  The commission represents the first attempt to establish regional development in an area which has sadly lagged behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the House yesterday the Taoiseach spoke of the lack of income in certain areas.  The highest unemployment rate is in County Donegal and that is a matter of social exclusion.  The lowest income <i>per capita</i> is also in the west &mdash; 64 per cent.  Tackling this problem involves many Departments.  However, the Taoiseach has <Col N="761" /> brought a Department of Finance mindset to his job.  That is not the generous role that his predecessors, Deputies Bruton and Reynolds, sought for the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is necessary to develop a model under which other regional development authorities can be established. It is a huge job to co-ordinate such a process which involves so many interests and Departments.</P>
    <P>John Higgins was appointed chief executive of the Western Development Partnership Board by Albert Reynolds and co-ordinated a series of feasibility studies which culminated in a report entitled The Challenge: A Positive Future Through Action.  This plan identified three key areas of need.  First, the need to close the gap between the high level of expertise and support systems to be found and the linkage of this support to produce self-sustainable development. Second, the need to build new partnership models for vibrant economic and social development at a local, county and regional level and for a mechanism with the specific role of integrating the proposed development initiatives.  Third, the need to broaden the investment base of the region to attract more indigenous and external investment and to close equity gaps.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses the third point by establishing the western investment fund.  The Western Development Partnership Board identified the need for innovative, structural state and sectoral initiatives as an additional means for achieving economic and social development in the region. The board also highlighted the need to establish the Western Development Commission; a programme for identification and linkages of opportunities and initiatives or innovative approaches and technologies, PILOT; the western investment fund; local enterprise networks, LENS and the establishment of a western social development unit.</P>
    <P>LENS was already under way when this Government took office.  There were pilot schemes in Athenry and south Donegal and I am glad the banks played a leading role in this initiative. Other initiatives were also taking place.  Venture capital was being encouraged, particularly by Sligo Corporation and Chamber of Commerce which were working well towards establishing such initiatives.</P>
    <P>However, the programme announced by the Minister of State seems to reduce the number of initiatives expected by the Western Development Partnership Board's report.  The Minister announced an amendment to section 8(2) which states:</P>
    <P>The Commission shall not provide financial or other material aid for the infrastructural projects referred to in paragraphs (b)(ii) and (d) of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>He also announced another amendment. However, these amendments will restrict the role of the chief executive officer.  Kick starting venture capital projects in the west will depend on <Col N="762" /> the quality of the projects which come before the commission.  The previous Government examined the possibility of renewing the western rail link from Sligo to Limerick providing an opportunity of regenerating towns in the area.  This was a vibrant rail link in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was very good.</P>
    <P>During the late 1950s and early 1960s the Government rationalised the railways and the west Clare railway was closed down.  The west Clare railway, if it existed today, would be an outstanding tourist amenity.  I am not talking only about providing a tourist amenity from Limerick to Sligo, I am also talking about it in economic terms, a partnership which would involve the investment of funds by the Western Development Commission, local interests and, perhaps, an outside fund.  The western development fund was to attract funds from overseas.  It had even identified holders of substantial capital in America who would be willing to invest in western projects. This would mean the upgrading of the rail link thus alleviating much pressure on the roads. Those roads cannot take the heavy trucks using them.  It appears the National Roads Authority has no plans to upgrade the western corridor which is vital for the economic survival of the west.</P>
    <P>In the original talks at the Department of the Taoiseach it was envisaged the Western Development Commission would consider a major infrastructural investment, together with manufacturing investment or a quasi-manufacturing social investment as a means of raising venture capital. We have a real problem with venture capital here.  There was a huge provision for venture capital previously but it was not taken up.  This is an area where the Western Development Commission will need to take a lead role.  I am pleased the advisory committees are working.  They were to be set up in the areas of natural resources, tourism, arts and heritage, information technology, infrastructure, marine, manufacturing and services.  Those on the advisory committees have substantial knowledge.  A partnership needs to be developed between groups already on the ground in the area of education.</P>
    <P>We had envisaged that the Western Development Commission might involve itself in technology parks at the institutes of technology in Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Athlone, Galway and Limerick, similar to those at the University of Limerick where there are developments in tandem with Shannon development.  These business parks would relate to indigenous industry developments which people would know are in the area but do not have either the training or the expertise to get on with it.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister of State there was a broader picture about the Western Development Commission when it was under the Department of the Taoiseach because that Department could bring Department heads together.  Once the Taoiseach cracked the whip, the Departments responded.  In his contribution the Minister has <Col N="763" /> carefully treaded his route.  He does not want to step on the corns of those in the Department of the Environment and Local Government who may be jealously looking at their infrastructural problems and road development.  If that care was taken about the limitations of the west when the Structural Funds were being applied, the National Roads Authority would not be lumbered with the population criteria which it is required to apply before putting in roads.  We are suffering in the west because of the decline in population.  We cannot meet the heavy population demands of the east but we have other economic difficulties which are not measured.  That is the reason I commenced by criticising the role of the Taoiseach. He does not seem to have a broad vision of what happens in rural communities in the west.  He visits Castlebar by helicopter and is back in Dublin every night.  This is not giving the impression that he has the real interests of rural communities at heart.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, well.  He is interested in rural communities having come from an area in south Tipperary which has had its ups and downs with emigration, small farms and many other difficulties.  He has been given a portfolio that requires major decisions in the Departments of Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  He is asked to seek the goodwill of all these busy Ministers, not to impose solutions.  Were he in the Department of the Taoiseach, three doors down the corridor, he could impose his will.  This is an indication that the Taoiseach has no idea of the emerging model needed for structural and regional development. As Minister for Finance he negotiated the Structural Funds with the minimum of fuss and that has been his role ever since.</P>
    <P>So far as projects are concerned, very good people were nominated to the advisory councils. Given that I am not privy to the current membership, will the Minister of State outline the participants and how often they meet?  It is important that these people steer the Western Development Commission on formulating a plan on income and the many other problems in the west.  If we are to get the maximum aid from the Western Development Commission in the new Structural Funds deal, all the various statistics will be needed for this area.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the Taoiseach because he has irritated me on this matter.  Yesterday he said there were no plans.  Had he looked to the advisory councils he would have got any information he needed to obtain Objective One status for the west.  However he chose to ignore it.  He has his own agenda which I do not think includes a very wide perspective.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister of State referred to social enterprises.  I am puzzled about what is a social enterprise.  There is a need for social development in the west and there is a critical <Col N="764" /> role for women.  I do not know whether the Department is still upset over the sexist reference by a former Minister to &ldquo;farmerettes&rdquo; and ladies in agriculture.  There is a role for women in agriculture, particularly in the west.  As Minister of State I found, particularly in Border regions, that it was women who wanted to progress social development.  Retention of the population of such areas would be assisted if women had a full role. The biggest objective of the Western Commission is to maintain population balance, although the Minister did not say what year he would take as a reference point in this context.  However, even if he succeeds in maintaining the population balance from the start-up year, he will have achieved something.</P>
    <P>The Minister faces another difficulty in trying to bring together the disparate groups and people from the relevant counties.  The hope was that the county strategy groups, established throughout the west from Donegal to Clare, would be brought together in consultation with the Western Commission and that partnership boards, enterprise boards, tourism committees, county and city managers, etc., would come together with their extensive plans for the entire area.  It was hoped the outcome of such a coming together would form another part of the submission to Brussels if the Government believed a reasonable submission could be made on Objective One status.  Some of the strategy groups had been meeting fairly regularly while others had not met at all.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food has a particular role here as there are Leader groups in every county which have close associations with partnership boards and rural and urban development programmes.  In this context has any progress been made in amalgamating the key issues identified by county strategy groups from Clare to Donegal?  Some groups have involvement with INTERREG, IFI and other funds.  If all the groups had been brought together there would be a better plan.  Also involved are rural development groups in which the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, takes a particular interest.  I met him at Feakle at the launch of the Feakle bus when he did well and had a successful photocall. Great effort was put into the bus project which has resulted in the using of a school bus, which laid idle during the day, to take old folk and people from remote rural areas of north Clare to Ennis for shopping at least once or twice a week. I commend the Minister and the people of Feakle who got this admirable project up and running and which shows proper utilisation of State assets.</P>
    <P>I hope all rural development and rural renewal programmes which are now the responsibility of the Minister of State will be sustained and further developed.  I hope the Minister is given resources to ensure final reports are developed.  I do not mean that rural development or rural renewal schemes should be a source of funding <i>ad infinitum.</i> I understand that groups must eventually <Col N="765" /> be self-sustaining.  There seemed to be a stagger in the progress of the groups.  I would like the models to be brought up to date and more resources made available.  They could be further expanded and I am sure the Minister of State has ideas for other rural renewal programmes which could be very progressive.  My idea was that county strategy groups and the commission would get together to build the overall plan.  Each group has integrated plans upon which decentralisation can be developed.  Decentralisation will give confidence to the people in the west.</P>
    <P>I am glad this issue has not become a political football.  When I was responsible for the Western Commission and the Western Development Partnership Board we tried to ensure development was neutral in political terms as most Deputies from the west fully understand the difficulties. They always despaired regarding the future.  In recent times the clergy and the bishops have been renewing their calls for initiatives to be taken in this area.  There has been a delay of 18 months in progressing, but I do not think the Minister of State is responsible for this &mdash; I lay the blame squarely where it belongs.  I hope in progressing the Minister of State will act quickly to set up the structures and that before he brings the Bill to committee stage he will review the restrictive section he referred to.  There should be a more open hand and greater decision making should be given to the commission.</P>
    <P>The people on the commission are representative of the west and were chosen for their personal skill and not for any political purpose.  They include two representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry, a trade unionist, a farmer, representatives of the county councils and a county manager.  All these people are deeply involved in figuring out how to fully integrate the west.  Mr. Michael McLoone, the county manager in Donegal, is one of the most progressive people in local government and it could not be said that my appointment of him to the commission was a political decision.  The reason he was appointed was that he had successfully decentralised in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I considered whether 11 members should be included but decided on the smaller figure on the basis that I wanted to make progress as quickly as possible. The Minister has a great hurdle to jump as there are bureaucratic fences at every turn.  Despite the delay &mdash; I understand who was responsible &mdash; I am glad progress is now being made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the work of the commission and wish the Minister of State well in this and other initiatives he may want to take in relation to rural <Col N="766" /> development.  It is important to place the legislation in context.  Since the 1960s in particular there has been a long line of special studies addressing the problems of the west.</P>
    <P>I should mention some scholars who preceded the Loughrea initiative and their lordships' welcome interest in the west of Ireland. Fine work has been done by people such as John Scully who studied the 12 western counties.  A study was also carried out by two people named Higgins within An Foras Talúntais as a result of which indicators on agricultural production were published.  Studies were also carried out by Dr. P.J. Drudy and by Professors Cuddy and Boylan who attempted to establish an input/output model.  All of these precede the welcome response to the needs of people in Loughrea who may have felt they were not being heard.</P>
    <P>Discussion on the west began at the end of the 1950s and continued through the 1960s with Dr. Scully's work.  Some painful truths were being hidden from communities in the west of Ireland. After Irish accession to the EU which resulted in enormous benefits to agriculture, the concentration on guarantees rather than guidance enormously favoured large volume producers.  Thus the benefits of Irish membership of the EU always flowed disproportionately to those who had the greatest capacity to produce and take advantage of price.  This fact is often obscured and not accidentally.</P>
    <P>There was always a qualitative difference between the 12 western counties, to use Dr. Scully's terms, and other areas of agricultural production. Three sets of factors mitigated against the capacity of farming and agriculture in the west of Ireland.  The first was physical in that soils were poor and badly drained; second, social factors meant the population involved was quite elderly and very often had lower levels of education than was available in the rest of the country when examined on a socio-economic basis; and third, farms were not held in one lot with more than 60 per cent being fragmented.  As much as 80 per cent of the holdings were less than 50 acres and more than 50 per cent were less than 30 acres.  Fragmented agriculture showed there was a desperate need for concentration on guidance measures but successive administrations focused on the guarantee side with the result that there was a fall in incomes.  The period following Ireland's entry to the EU saw benefits being distributed disproportionately between smaller and larger farmers.  Larger farmers could switch from one product to another because they had the capacity to do so but smaller farmers could not.  I was reared on a small farm in County Clare and am aware of the inbuilt inflexibilities and limitations on production.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the word &lsquo;commercialisation&rsquo; in the literature on the commission and in the Bill.  I previously encountered the word in discussions on the politics of agriculture. Commercialisation led to the withdrawal <Col N="767" /> of agricultural advice from smaller farmers as the delivery of such advice had to be paid for.  The structure of agricultural planning and the absorption of the benefits of entry into Europe, the continuous concentration on the commercial rather than the social, the absence of linkages and the withdrawal of support meant that agriculture in the west was always at a disadvantage.  That resulted in a set of very obvious social consequences. There was a high migration rate in the western counties.  In the 1950s and 1960s, if one took a 15 to 19 year old cohort and looked for its members in the 20 to 24 year old cohort five years later, the average figure for out migration was of the order of 55 to 70 per cent.  The matter became more complicated when one looked at where people had gone.  Successive censuses since the 1970s have shown that, like Europe, there has been a drain from rural communities into regional towns.  The only benefit has been the rising population in places such as Galway city but there has been a contraction in the populations of towns in County Galway.  There has continued to be a significant drop in the level of migration to rural parishes.</P>
    <P>A figure published five years ago forecast that 100,000 villages within the EU would have lost viability by the year 2000.  I understand the figure has been revised by the research sections of various directorates in Brussels and that the real figure is much higher.  At the same time as we are experiencing a growth in economic performance in different parts of the EU, we are experiencing a complete collapse in rural social life.  Regional policy became fashionable in the 1970s &mdash; I was a member of the Regional Studies Association committee &mdash; and three bases were offered for regional policy.  The first was that it made more sense to have an even distribution of growth in the economy and the second was a moral one in the sense that it was felt everyone in a community had a right to benefit equally in education, health services, housing and so on.  The third reason was that one was witnessing a combination of two disasters &mdash; as rural depopulation and degradation of services were occurring, urban diseconomies were also being experienced.  The history of regional policy shows that the concentration on the needs of rural areas usually occurs when urban diseconomies have reached a point where they are causing enormous and costly problems. Through out migration and population decline, schools and other services were falling into disuse and enormous pressure was being experienced in regard to new services in areas which were already overcrowded.</P>
    <P>There has been a long and continuous interest in the problems of the western counties and, to some extent, the response has been merely rhetorical.  One cannot easily consider the problems which have obtained in those counties without looking at the structure of agricultural policy and the way in which we have handled our membership of the EU.  One must also consider the <Col N="768" /> manner in which benefits to the fishing industry were comprehensively sold in return for benefits in regard to volume milk production.  I have spoken about this issue in many coastal communities in the west of Ireland.  The abandonment of fish for milk and beef has had a huge effect on those communities.  The commission's work will probably work best in the context of a regional approach towards planning, an area in which successive Governments have had a poor record.</P>
    <P>This is because of the obduracy of permanent staff in the Department of Finance.  The beginning of this is highlighted in Ronan Fanning's book on the history of the Department of Finance, which includes the gem of opposing electricity because it would never catch on in Ireland. The book then moves on to cover its other glories. However, it is interesting that the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach saw off the Department which was briefly headed by Martin O'Donoghue in so far as it dealt with planning.  There was hostility towards planning and total antipathy to regional planning. This was exceeded only by hostility towards the concepts of innovation and flexibility.  A deadly eye was directed towards all these problems, to which the commission will now turn its attention.</P>
    <P>The welcome report of the Bishops was seriously remiss in making no reference to the Irish language or culture.  The same number of people &mdash; more than 32,000 &mdash; work in the culture industry as work in the banking sector.  A large number of jobs could be created from the cultural diversity which would arise from activities built around the language.  However, the Minister said social is inclusive of cultural, so I presume social development includes cultural development, including linguistic and cultural enterprises.</P>
    <P>The commission would have benefited if there had been greater clarity in regional policy.  I saw a letter from a senior official in the Department of Finance asking about the proposed changes in regionalisation which contains a disturbing phrase.  It states:</P>
    <P>In any case, whatever approach is ultimately adopted where Ireland remains as a single region in transition or as we constituted it to two new regions, the Government will ensure that the ensuing national plan is attentive to the needs of all regions of the country.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about this is that I am not sure from where the conclusion came to have two regions. I know the stated purpose is to have one region 75 per cent above GDP and the remainder below. There is an inbuilt fragility to the consideration this will receive from the commission, as it will be seen as two categories of benefit rather than true regionalisation.</P>
    <P>It would have been better to develop the Western Development Commission in three areas, the commencement of regional planning, a definition of regions and the designation of priority regions. I will give a practical example.  I have spoken about the indicators to which regions must adhere <Col N="769" /> as regards agricultural production, industry and social provision.  It is a pity other regions which could be defined under these indicators are ignored.</P>
    <P>There are other disadvantages to a crude indicator like GDP in the western region.  I am leaving aside the factors of external influence on GDP and artificial transfers which inflate the GDP figure and have always been a disadvantage for Ireland.  For example, the GDP measure includes those who describe themselves in a census as commercial farmers who own more than 1,000 acres in the same group as smaller farmers, 80 per cent of whom own under 50 acres, 50 to 60 per cent of whom own under 30 acres and some of whose holdings are widely fragmented. It is a crude indicator.</P>
    <P>It would have been of benefit to the area covered by the commission and of further benefit to urban areas to approach Eurostat with a set of indicators which would include participation in education, long-term unemployment, dependence on a medical card, etc.  These indicators, inserted in spatial maps, would have achieved densities which would have indicated the basis of a wider region of deprivation.  This would carry social indicators and would be much better than GDP.</P>
    <P>The western counties suffered from the crude way in which guarantee defeated guidance. People will remember the guidance directives.  If someone had suggested to those heading farming organisations in Brussels that they leave aside the question of price to concentrate on guidance &mdash; to do what the Loughrea farmers wanted to assure the future of farm families on the soil &mdash; they would have been told what to do with themselves. It is a pity both horses were not travelled properly.</P>
    <P>In exactly the same way, the GDP single indicator is madness as regards constructing a regional policy.  It is a pity the three approaches I suggested are not being taken on board.  We should aim for true regionalism, with regions specified by factors separate from GDP.  We should express both rural and urban priorities. The last thing we need is an urban-rural conflict.</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings in favour of Objective One status for western counties and I have supported the way in which they have tried to make the case against those who have benefited more than them, for example, as regards agricultural production.  However, they are also sensitive to the fact that there are urban poor &mdash; those who leave school early and do not have employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>This is ridiculous at a time of enormous unpredicted surpluses, even though the Department of Finance can never get the figures right.  It is extraordinary that we are heading towards a 9 per cent growth rate when in some rural areas and parts of Dublin, the number of people participating in second and third level education is not rising significantly. This is a function of the tyranny of the single indicator.  It will be argued that we would be making a case on our own.  This is not so.  The <Col N="770" /> reality is that a number of different procedures have been suggested to both the commission and the methodological body which supports its thinking.  These procedures should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I agree with Deputy Carey that his heart is in rural development. There are many policies I would have liked to implement in the Department for which I was responsible when in Government.  However, they were not in my remit.  I recall the European Commission indicating that more than 100,000 villages would no longer be viable by 2000.  It would have been possible to do an enormous amount of good work for rural communities by turning abandoned cinemas all over the country into multi-purpose arts centres, with one screen for indigenous films, one for imported films, as 90 per cent of films viewed by Europeans come from the US, and one for art films.  One could take a central building, give it life and create viability.</P>
    <P>I do not want fall into the trap of suggesting that the reason there were so many problems in the west and such huge out migration levels was only economic.  It was not just economic.  Many people left to pursue the curiosity that is part of human nature and to escape from a dull life that did not offer a variety of options.  That is a fact but one will not hear it often stated.</P>
    <P>Those who thunder against politicians about this should bear in mind how much they did to create an atmosphere in which a person could live a diverse life, free from inquisitorial interference. Nobody who believes in rationality would support the awful blackthorn stick invigilation of those who should have had something better to do in the 1930s, 1940s and the 1950s.  They sent practically every decent writer fleeing from rural Ireland.  The benefit of that was to literature. People should look at the mote in their eye in that regard.</P>
    <P>When discussing the Western Development Commission we should discuss not simply the economic but the social fabric that must be created and repaired.  The social fabric must also be extended.  This might consist of small things.  I listened earlier to the description of the bus that was used to bring elderly people shopping in the evening.  It is the thousands of such small things that are important.  Deputy Carey mentioned the west Clare railway.  When I was a child in County Clare that train was one of the few connections women had to the market.  They travelled on it to Limerick to sell eggs, daffodils and butter.  When the train stopped running these women were locked up at home because they had no connection or way out.  That was part of the anti-rural thinking at the time.</P>
    <P>However, while there is no point in being judgmental about it, it raises other questions.  One question is whether we were inevitably on a path to a better way of life when it would leave rural areas, not just in the counties affected by this legislation, with communities that were no longer viable.  The other aspect was that it created a non-sensical suggestion that there were such things as <Col N="771" /> purely urban and purely rural people in Ireland. Most people in urban areas were migrants from rural areas and the concept of the long-term urban dweller who would not know which end of a cow to milk was always a myth.</P>
    <P>There is great need for clarity about what every body and agency is doing in these counties.  The country is awash with agencies and bodies.  I have often tried and failed to draw a map of the bodies to which one should turn for various things and clarity is essential in this regard.</P>
    <P>The area of Galway city which comprises Inisheannagh, Galcarraig and Camilaun Parks has an unemployment rate of over 65 per cent. At the same time people in other areas of the city enjoy two and three foreign holidays and change their BMW every year.  The GDP for the Galway area is an absurdity.  It hides the fact that these pockets of high unemployment exist.  In some cases, families are in their third generation of unemployment.  I started holding clinics in Galway in 1968 and I have now reached the third generation of people who have unemployment problems associated with low educational attainment, poverty in the home and so forth.  That is why I am using this occasion to make the case for the proper construction of indicators that can be inclusive.</P>
    <P>There is no point in yet more windy statements about everyone's support for inclusiveness and opposition to exclusiveness.  We must now set about the task.  I hope the commission will give a lead in trying to use these indicators to give a true picture of what is happening in the counties for which it has responsibility.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the commission will report on its activities and it specifies the reporting procedure.  I have no difficulty with those provisions or with the Minister's amendments in that regard.  However, it is important that a dimension of the commission's report should comment on the degree of co-operation it found with other agencies and Departments. Deputy Carey and I tried in the past to promote co-operation among agencies and bodies with regard to the Irish language but it was a mixed experience.  The commission should report on such matters and on the attitudes it encounters, and they should be a matter of debate in this House.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; could be used more frequently.  I worry about the commission's description of itself and its function to recognise things that have commercial viability.  One wonders if this carries the danger of a chicken and egg situation where in order to be or become a success one has to be a success.  What about where there is an initial idea that offers a link between existing activity but which cannot be demonstrated in the short-term?  That is an important issue.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that cultural industries are included.  The project that comes to mind is the Gaillimh na Gaeilge <Col N="772" /> one which was based on a linguistic definition of a city.</P>
    <P>Everybody has been extremely polite in the past about how the banking system was a net drain on the regions.  All the evidence demonstrates that it was like a sponge soaking up deposits and sending them out of the region.  It showed little commitment to regional development across the board.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the commission on a statutory basis, it might be useful if the Minister of State convened a conference of all bodies with which the commission will have a relationship.  He should seek an assurance of co-operation from them so the commission will have the best possible chance of succeeding.</P>

      <P>In deference to Deputy Higgins I will try to avoid making windy statements. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, on bringing this legislation before the House and establishing the Western Development Commission on a statutory basis.  It demonstrates the commitment of the Minister of State to this issue. Although he is not from the west of Ireland he has, over the last year, visited the area on numerous occasions and is well acquainted with the problems there and the need for social and economic development.  In the past few months the western region has generated much media attention and debate as a result of the negotiations for EU Structural Funds and Objective One status.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission is being established to promote economic and social development in the five counties of Connacht and in counties Clare and Donegal.  In December last year the ESRI produced a report which highlighted the lack of development in these counties. The debate on this issue has been ongoing for years and people from the region did not need a report to be made aware of the need for development. I am delighted the Government is taking the initiative and doing something positive about the problems in the west through the establishment of the fund and the commission.</P>
      <P>The board of the commission will consist of a chairperson and 11 members.  It is important that each county is represented on the board.  County Mayo, in particular, should have one if not two representatives on it.  It is also important that different sectors as well as the different counties are represented.  That is important if development is to take place in these sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fund of £25 million is being provided over a five year period &mdash; £2 million initially and £5 million per annum thereafter.  This fund is totally inadequate.  The sum of £25 million will go nowhere towards addressing the major problems we are experiencing, both socially and economically, in the west.  While I welcome this fund, it is important the money is spread fairly between the seven counties involved.  I will be monitoring that <Col N="773" /> over the next few years.  I also note that the Minister will be reviewing the fund in 1999.  I hope that at that time more resources will be given to the western development fund because it is totally inadequate at its present level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.  The purpose of the decision was to remove from the <Col N="774" /> Defence Forces the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations and will result in considerable savings in security and maintenance costs at the locations concerned.  It will also release troops for operational duties which will have a positive impact on the security duty capacity of the Defence Forces and will free up resources for necessary re-equipment.</P>
    <P>With regard to further closures, you may be assured that there are no plans in relation to the closure of any barracks other than those announced on 15 July.  The sale of lands and barracks will proceed as soon as possible.  The proposed sales will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial needs in the areas concerned and I intend to maximise the potential of all the properties involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but he has adopted a confrontational approach to the barrack closures.  He had no consultation with the people directly affected and he ignored the two legitimately established representative associations.  He also ignored communities that have welcomed the Army into their midst over many years.  These days participation and consultation are expected and the Minister promised as much while in Opposition.  He should go back and read his own words, which he has failed to live up to.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing about the need for some closures, but the way the Minister did it.  There are all sorts of rumours at the moment about the future use of these lands and barracks.  A suggestion was floated that they would be used for illegal immigrants.  Was the Minister's Department approached about that appalling suggestion? Does the Minister intend to adopt the same approach?  The Minister appears to be the second member of the Government today who is making a virtue out of not consulting with senior people. He did it also in the Price Waterhouse report. Does the Minister intend to consult local communities and people who have an interest in the future of these lands?  These are valuable State assets.  Will he have some consultation in relation to their future use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> In his reply, the Minister seems to suggest that he intends to go ahead with the sale quickly.  I suggest there is room for some necessary consultation and discussion with people in the areas to work out what is best for each site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme of relocation and the closure of barracks was done on a selected basis, primarily to minimise the effect on civilian and military personnel.  I was in no position to consult with the representative associations until such time as I had a Government decision. Immediately following the Government decision I proceeded to meet the associations and discuss the decision the Government had taken.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, all previous efforts to close barracks which belong to a different era, and which were inherited by the State on its foundation, caused inordinate problems in terms of collective training and wastage of resources on security and housekeeping.  This has been on the political agenda for about 20 years so to suggest that there has been no discussion about a matter which has been realistically expected for that length of time is unreal.</P>
      <P>I have already had consultations at local level in relation to the disposal of sites.  I intend to have further consultations with local authorities, commercial and other organisations in the various towns, first, to maximise the value of the sites in the context of re-equipping the Defence Forces and, second, to ensure the most suitable preparation for advancing the interests of the towns concerned through integrated plans.  The widest possible consultations have begun and will continue until the matter is satisfactorily resolved. When I say they will be disposed of quickly, I intend to realise the assets as quickly as I can but that will be done in concert with local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the commitment to consultation because it has been singularly lacking in the Minister's approach to a number of issues &mdash; this is not the only one.  Has the Minister put procedures in place and does he have any planned approach?  My understanding is that there is a complete variation in the approach in each of the areas concerned.  For example, there is a suggestion of using McKee Barracks in Kildare as an open prison.  Other people are talking about some economic development taking place there.  The Government should put in place an approach in each of these areas that will reassure local people it is taking account of the contribution they have made to Army barracks over the years.  Such an approach would reassure local people and their communities that the Minister has a detailed plan in place that is workable and in which they will be involved.  That is the least the Minister owes these communities.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in reaching agreement with local communities on the basis of <Col N="776" /> the proper development of the respective towns. I am not going to deal with rumours here.  The Defence Forces is a great place for rumours at times, but I will certainly not deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from all the public statements I have made that, first and foremost, I intend to sell by public tender the various sites that become available and to maximise their value by having integrated plans discussed with the local authorities, planning authorities and the various commercial and community organisations. I will proceed on that basis.  I require the money to avoid the necessity of continually leaning on the taxpayer to provide the necessary funding for the equipment and infrastructural development necessary for the enhancement of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I reject the implication that I do not consult because I do so widely.  This was a primary matter for successive Governments which had been totally ignored.  I am glad of the dignified way in which the military and all personnel involved have been able to execute those closures.  They deserve this House's congratulations for the manner in which they have conducted that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that the decision on closures was made some months ago, what consultation has taken place to date with the local authorities and groups in each area?  As I understand it, very little consultation has taken place in the interim since the decision was made.  What is the position about land which, in some areas, has been specifically zoned?  How will the Minister handle such land, for example, Devoy Barracks in Naas, which is specifically zoned for educational purposes?  How can he put that up for sale on open tender if the land is zoned for a particular purpose?  Has there been consultation with Kildare County Council or Naas Urban District Council in relation to the specific zoning of that land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary concern since the decision was taken was to ensure that it was executed properly and that the developments in the alternative installations, such as the Curragh, Collins Barracks and Kilworth Camp, were adequately prepared to take the personnel who were being relocated.  Considerable investment was made in time and by the various military authorities and others to ensure they were completed in time.  Once the site is available to me, discussions will be intensified with the local authorities. Some preliminary discussions have already taken place with the local authorities and others and are proceeding this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had an exercise with the Department of Education and Science in relation to Devoy Barracks.  Its officials have been at that site on three occasions and we are awaiting a response <Col N="777" /> from them.  I appreciate that it has been zoned for educational purposes.  Consultation with the Department of Education and Science is essential to resolve whatever problems may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the arrangement to move the Army Apprentice School to the Curragh?  How far advanced is the move?  What is the position with regard to the apprentices in the Army Apprentice School? Does the Minister envisage further apprenticeships being granted when the school moves to the Curragh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the subject matter of another question.  My first obligation is to ensure that the 28 apprentices in Devoy Barracks are enabled to complete their courses on time.  I also want to deal with the teachers who were involved in Naas.  These matters are proceeding.  The facilities for a number of apprentices have already been organised and they are ready.  There is some delay in completing the arrangements for a number of the specialities but the apprentices will be able to complete their course within the defined time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>During his visit to Naas, the Minister said that those stationed in the barracks due to be closed would get the option of voluntary early retirement.  Can the Minister confirm that this is the case?  Perhaps he could clarify if the personnel in these barracks will be relocated within their operational area or will he allow people from Castleblayney, for example, to relocate to Dublin or Cork where they grew up?</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall mentioned local authorities in relation to the rezoning of land.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm if the local authorities have visited these barracks with a view to rezoning the land.  If so, will the Minister stipulate that a certain amount of the land must be kept for local industries or sites which can be sold privately through the local authority?</P>
      <P>It now appears that the Army Apprentice School will close once the students finish their courses.  Did the Minister know when he visited Naas that the school would be closed and, if so, why did he not announce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Timmins is aware, a military board sat a number of years ago to determine the advisability or otherwise of maintaining the Army Apprentice School in Naas.  When that board reported, the Chief of Staff at the time decided there was no further need for the Army Apprentice School in its old style because of the various changes in the educational and training system.  The school was established in 1956 when there were few alternative arrangements for apprenticeship or other training.  However, regional technical colleges, technical institutes and FÁS training schemes now provide an alternative and cheaper system of training.  There were 28 apprentices in Devoy Barracks and at a cost <Col N="778" /> of £2.85 million a year over a three year span, this would represent approximately £285,000 per apprentice.  That could not be sustained or justified.</P>
      <P>On the voluntary early retirement scheme, I was concerned to introduce a scheme which would facilitate those members who met its criteria and wanted it specifically designed to cope with any problems which might arise in the five barracks facing imminent closure.  Some 117 inquiries were made, of which 84 final applications were completed.  Some 64 applications were accepted, 11 are still pending consideration and the balance have been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that apprentices can be supplied from outside the Army Apprentice School at a time when the building industry is going through an unprecedented boom and it is difficult to get people with trades to work?  Were personnel in the various barracks given the option of voluntary early retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone who applied for voluntary early retirement and met the criteria has been accepted.  Some have withdrawn their applications and there are a number still under consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards consultation with local authorities about the sites, we have prime and valuable sites. It is important that an integrated plan for those sites is agreed in consultation with the planning authorities and other local interests so that we can enhance the towns we are leaving.  The tradition and loyalty of the Defence Forces in these areas is highly respected.  I have no interest in a haphazard development; I want a good integrated plan.  There will be consultations about that with the local authorities.  Some of them are developing as we speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand, the Minister seems to be saying that the sale of these lands will depend on market forces &mdash; we know what they will be like in the years ahead &mdash; but, on the other hand, he is saying there will be an integrated plan. Which is the case?  Will he consult with the local communities and consider the housing needs of the area?  Will he try to put something back into the communities or will he opt for a quick sale?</P>
      <P>As regards the Army Apprentice School, the Minister said that consultation was not necessary because its closure was known about for many years.  I disagree with that.  Families had almost no time to prepare for these changes.  I accept the dignified way they have dealt with the situation but the Minister gave them little time to prepare. He did not consult anyone and that is not a good way to do business.</P>

      <P>Having considered the report of Price Waterhouse Management Consultants on the reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the future development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service critically depends on the input of all of the relevant stakeholders.

First, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on Defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report.  Second, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible.  It will, in the final analysis, be the task of the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to present plans for my consideration to address these matters.</P>
      <P>I recently wrote to my colleagues in Government requesting participation by their Departments in the consultation group which I will chair since I am directly responsible to the House for these matters.  The consultation group will include senior military officers including the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service.  The group will be tasked with making relevant input to the planning process leading to the finalisation of implementation plans to give effect to the Government's decision as outlined already.  The group will meet as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Has the implementation group met?  Why did the Minister appoint himself chairman of the independent group?  I understand the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy and the Air Corps requested that an independent person should be appointed to that position, which would clearly be in the best interests of driving the plan <Col N="781" /> forward.  The Price Waterhouse report states that, based on the consultants' experience in conducting the review and its predecessor in 1994, the best structure to oversee implementation of the plan would be through the appointment of an independent third party chairperson.  It also states that given the difficulties in the Defence Forces over the years, external driving and professional support would be required to focus efforts to bring about the sort of change necessary in the three services.  However, the Minister appointed himself chairman of the group.  Was that due to pressure from the Department of Finance or from within his Department?</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not accept the strong recommendation from the Price Waterhouse consultants, who spent a number of years studying the Navy and the Air Corps, that the group should be driven from someone outside the Department if real change is to emerge?  Did the Minister appoint himself chairman because decisions are being delayed until the publication of the White Paper is finalised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of education and training, the Naval Service currently avails of courses at the following institutions: NUI Galway, Dublin Institute of Technology, Cork Institute of Technology and FÁS.  Certain specialist courses are also attended from time to time by the Naval Service at British Royal Navy colleges. In addition, courses are provided by the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers in respect of drugs interdiction.</P>
      <P>Attendance at educational courses by Naval Service personnel is kept under constant review so that the best possible opportunities in terms of education and training are made available to members of the service.  On the question of interaction with educational establishments, a naval officer delivers a number of lectures on fishery conservation and protection at NUI Cork on an annual basis at the request of that college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Institute of Technology &mdash; CIT &mdash; commissioned a study by consultants, Deloitte and Touche, some time ago concerning the possible establishment of a joint Naval Service/CIT national maritime college to be located on a site owned by my Department adjacent to the naval base in Haulbowline.  The question of the provision of such a college is a matter for the Department of Education and Science in the first instance.  This proposal has most recently been considered, along with a range of other issues, by the ministerial task force on seafarer training and employment, which was established in February of this year by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  The task force, which includes a representative from the Department of Education and Science, has submitted an interim report and is due to submit a final report shortly. My Department will consider whatever recommendations emerge from the work of the task force in so far as they might relate to the establishment <Col N="783" /> of a national maritime college as proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.</P>
      <P>However, as an island nation, does he believe that Ireland should be at the forefront in terms of developing seafaring skills?  I note the involvement of the Cork Institute of Technology in this process and I welcome the proposal which has been put forward.  What is the Minister's view on the proposal?  Is he in favour of it?  The Departments of Education and Science and the Marine and Natural Resources seem to be at the forefront on this issue.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Navy.  I note that 50 personnel were enlisted earlier this year but only 42 of them remain.  There has been a haemorrhage of personnel out of the Naval Service because of a lack of career and training opportunities. Will the Minister push for the establishment of a college of excellence in seafaring in Cork and ensure that the Naval Service plays a major role in that college?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Problems involving people leaving the Naval Service are consequential on the number and range of alternative opportunities developing throughout the country.  We must face down these problems.  It is not a bad thing that so many alternative opportunities are becoming available.  The Deputy will appreciate that recruitment to the Navy in the past 18 months has been quite successful.  Recruitment of a further 70 personnel will be advertised in the near future. There have been a number of promotions from Lieutenant to Lieutenant Commander, a number of personnel have been promoted to NCO, 13 cadets have joined the service and a number of vacancies for apprenticeships will be advertised shortly.  We are addressing the recruitment needs as quickly as possible.  I appreciate that difficulties arise as staff leave and we are trying to fill those gaps, bearing in mind that people must be allowed to leave the service from time to time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am particularly interested in the development of seafaring and advanced training facilities.  In the past I stated that, on a number of occasions, we have ignored the potential resources of the sea.  I will support an agreed proposal between the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Education and Science if it is envisaged that it will enhance current facilities.  If that proposal goes through, Cork is the only location I see for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year one fifth of those who joined the Navy have left.  A total of 52 personnel were enlisted and of these 42 are still serving.  An extra £1 per hour for the sea faring allowance is not acceptable.  There are people in the Navy who want to take up apprenticeships but cannot because they are barred on the grounds of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Will the Minister consider changing the regulations to allow them to take on apprenticeships? Serving personnel want to stay in the Navy and advance themselves.  Because they are more than 22 years they cannot avail of the courses although they are loyal and proven.  I thank the Minister for his reply on the seafaring college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Training facilities must be reviewed constantly because of the changing requirements for the naval force as a whole, some of which have been significant in recent years. There have been significant developments in terms of promotions this year.  This involved training so that people were ready to take up promotions. I am not aware of the case to which the Deputy referred.  There is ongoing recruitment but, equally, there is a constant haemorrhage, which is associated with the alternative job opportunities available in the economy generally. We have succeeded in increasing the patrol allowance which representative associations recommend to their members.</P>

      <P>On 24 August 1998 during the Tall Ships Race in Dublin Port an accident occurred which resulted in a number of Naval Service divers being injured while engaged in a display involving a civilian owned helicopter.  I am pleased to report that seven of the nine personnel involved made a full recovery.  The other two remain on sick leave and I am sure the House will join me in wishing them a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>Following the accident the Naval Service instigated an investigation which is ongoing.  An investigation is also being undertaken by the Department of Public Enterprise as this is essentially an aviation accident.  The Naval Service is not in a position to finalise its investigation until the outcome of the one being carried out by the Department of Public Enterprise is known.</P>

      <P>Why is it taking so long to conclude a report which one would imagine is a simple matter?  According to press reports the Garda has a video of the incident.  The helicopters owners indicated, according to press reports and a statement issued by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, that the exercise was carried out in accordance with agreed procedures. Why is the report not yet available?  Does the Minister intend to publish it?

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that sometimes these investigations take longer than those of us who are not involved in these technical areas envisage.

I will have no hesitation publishing the report when it becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the strictures and regulations governing these matters are well advanced and safe.  All the information we have in this and other areas is gathered to the highest standards.  However, accidents occur and when they do we need to investigate them properly.  I agree with the Deputy and wish I had the report but a Minister cannot pressurise any group to try and finalise reports before it is ready to do so.  It may be that it is encountering difficulties in finding out exactly what caused the accident and it may take a little longer. I need to wait for the results and make whatever changes are recommended in the report based on what took place rather than ensuring the report is produced quickly.  I want the exact position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister review the way in which investigations are carried out in his Department?  Over the past year there has been a series of incidents where Members have asked for information and on each occasion he said he would come back and give us the report of the investigation, that reports were not ready.  Will he try and establish a timetable for investigations?  I share Deputy De Rossa's worry that lessons may not be learnt and valuable lessons may be missed if the investigations take up to one year to conduct.</P>

It should be borne in mind that there are technical considerations and sometimes there is scant evidence upon which specialised people can make decisions.  I do not want to make any unwarranted intervention but I will seek an improvement in terms of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 38 and 168 together.  It is expected that EU funding totaling £26.5 million in respect of fishery protection will be made available from 1998 &mdash; 2000 inclusive.  Of this amount £7.9 million relates to 1998, £10.4 million to 1999 and £8.2 million to 2000.  In addition, EU funding for the national civil defence exercise in 1999 is being pursued with the European Commission and a decision is awaited.</P>
      <P>A number of equipment projects included in the overall fishery protection programme 1996 &mdash; 2000 had to be assessed from a technical and financial point of view.  Expenditure on these projects had to be deferred as this assessment took time.  Consequently, the EU funding drawn down to date has been less than originally contemplated. However, a number of the deferred projects have been included in the final three years of the programme and subject to these projects meeting appropriate technical and financial requirements final expenditure under this aspect of the programme may be in line with that originally planned.</P>
      <P>The most significant project covered is the supply of a new fishery protection vessel, due for delivery in September 1999.  EU assistance in support of this project is £5.3 million, which represents 65 per cent of funding.  The programme agreed by the EU in 1995 also provided for the refund of additional operational costs incurred by Ireland between 1996 and 2000.  However, as progress on recruiting personnel for the Naval Service has been slower than expected the full amount available under this heading may not be drawn down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>Has the Minister any intention of including further requests for funding under these headings in the Government's submission for the next EU funding period from 2000 onwards?  Is funding available for any of these activities under the Partnership for Peace programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan for the draw down of the next tranche of funds is being developed, but we expect there will be a sharp reduction in the total amount that will be made available to this country.  It will be up to me on my side of the fence to ensure that the provision for these areas is maintained at the highest possible level.  We expect the level of expenditure required to equip and modernise our vessels and for the purchase of others in the future will continue to be significant. I hope we will be able to purchase a new vessel every four to five years to reinforce our patrol capacity, but the Deputy, who was former Minister, will appreciate these are early days and battles have to be fought to secure funds.  The problems we face in drug interdiction, fishery surveillance, monitoring and with regard to other responsibilities will require an ongoing level of expenditure from EU or domestic sources, which will have to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the patrol of our seas is under resourced, is the Minister considering an option of acquiring a second ship, which could be taken out under the contract for the new ship? Will he confirm if the issue of crewing levels has been resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second question, that will fall within the remit of the implementation plan that will be developed.  Part of the Price Waterhouse report deals with efficiencies and we will have to examine alternative arrangements in other similar type countries. However, we have a multi-tasking arrangement and, therefore, it is not possible to make comparisons with efficiencies that are possible in other countries.  That multi-tasking arrangement will continue to be the policy for the future and it may not be possible to secure significant reductions in this area.</P>
      <P>I hope we will be able to purchase a new ship every four to five years so that we will not face the problems we now have where too many patrol vessels are nearing the end of their lifespan and their replacement requires massive resources.  It is much better to purchase vessels on a staggered basis.  Having regard to competing demands for resources, it will not be possible to secure anything like the type of resources that some people expect will be made available for this area. However, our fleet will have to be maintained and new vessels purchased and I will do the best I can in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to avoid answering the question, but the findings in the Price Waterhouse report reveal the level of finances that would be required for the purchase of new aircraft over a span of ten years and 18 years.  I had <Col N="788" /> preliminary discussions on this matter, but it will have to be addressed having regard to the prevailing budgetary circumstances.  As in the case of the Navy, some aircraft are nearing the end of their lifespan.  I will have to work within the context of the implementation plan to see what additional resources will become available that can be used to improve and enhance our overall capacity. However, we have a significant number of aircraft that are nearing the end of their lifespan.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 55, 192, 193 and 194 together.  As part of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces a National Defence Forces Training Centre is being established at the Curragh.  The centre will serve as the main military training centre for the Defence Forces.  It is my intention that the apprentices currently in training will complete their course of training at the Curragh and suitable facilities for that purpose are being established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing need for apprentices will be reviewed regularly and apprentices will continue to be recruited as required.  The number and type of apprentices recruited are determined by the Defence Forces requirement for particular skills. <Col N="789" /> It is intended that in future apprentices will be trained externally and only very specialised apprentice training will take place within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it is his intention that in future apprentices will be trained externally. Can I take it that is confirmation from the Minister that when the 28 apprentices currently in training finish their course there will be no Army Apprentice School?  What does he mean by apprentices being trained externally?  Referring to a previous answer, does the Minister seriously expect us to believe that FÁS can provide the type of training the Army Apprentice School provided up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In a number of specialties there is in-house capacity to train apprentices and that will continue to be the case.  Regarding the facilities available in FÁS, Deputy Dukes will appreciate a number of important specialist courses are provided for the Naval Service through FÁS.  A number of specialised courses are also provided for the Naval Service by Cork University, Galway University, Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and regional colleges.  Based on that experience, that the type of specialties required in the Naval Service can be supplied from outside at a much more economic cost, that in-house additions have to come out of our resources and the cost of the apprenticeship scheme as it developed during my term of office, it seemed much more appropriate to look outside to take advantage of the growth in the education and technological sector in terms of enlistment to the Defence Forces.  In terms of our experience, particularly in the Naval Service in recent years, I am sure there is no economic argument that would persuade anyone to hold a different view.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that there will not be an apprenticeship school in the future, but the courses provided will relate specifically to the specialties we have developed, which will operate from the Curragh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer any of the four questions I tabled.  Will he explain if he undertook a review of the importance of the contribution of the apprenticeship school in Devoy Barracks to the wider economy outside the Army?  Is he aware of the commendations and the general recognition apprentices who graduated from that school have received in the wider community?  Did he undertake an evaluation of the negative impact of the loss of such a school, having regard to the high calibre of the apprentices who graduated from it, on a town like Naas which has a military tradition, or did he slavishly follow the findings of the Price Waterhouse report which seemed to be at variance with most of the indications coming from his party colleagues in my constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Independent of the Price Waterhouse <Col N="790" /> review, a military board examined the apprenticeship requirements in the Defence Forces some years ago.  Following that report the then chief of staff recommended the closure of the apprenticeship school in Naas.  That military decision was not executed on the political side. My examination of costs for the number of apprentices in Naas showed it was not possible, in terms of my responsibility to the taxpayer, to continue an exercise which was leaning towards a cost per apprenticeship of approximately £300,000 over three years.  That would be totally unsustainable.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Durkan's point regarding the calibre of the training and the capacity of the teaching profession there.  Everything was perfect in that regard, but the exercise was not sustainable in economic terms.  Alternative ways of recruitment and the availability of expertise which has developed in the educational and technological spheres ensures the Defence Forces are capable of providing apprenticeships at a much reduced cost.  This allowed me to put the money to much better use in the Defence Forces generally. This course has been chosen, but a number of specialised apprenticeships will continue in the Curragh.</P>
      <P>I understand the point about loyalty to local communities in terms of the participation of the Defence Forces.  However, that belongs to a different era.  It was inherited by the State at its foundation and there was considerable wastage of personnel regarding security, housekeeping and other duties.  I have responsibility for collective training and ensuring the best use of resources. The decision was taken on that basis having regard to other considerations.  It was not taken lightly.</P>
      <P>All the considerations involved led me to the view that the closure of Devoy barracks ultimately would be in the interests of the Defence Forces.  The proceeds of the sale of the site when finally arranged will enhance the facilities in the Curragh and address some of the problems there which are unacceptable, including the overall accommodation, the condition of the swimming pool and various other matters.  Resources will be now available to deal with these problems without the need to resort to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not increase the throughput of apprentices to improve the efficiency of the school?  This would have also addressed the argument made by the Minister. Was such a proposal considered?  If so, why was it not implemented?  Does the Minister agree that if the school was inefficient to that extent, any changes now will not make the procedures more efficient?  Did the Minister consider the possibility of increasing the importance of Devoy barracks by establishing an academy to handle apprenticeships and a range of military support activities which may have to be supplied from another source in any event?  Did the Minister consider such aspects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have considered the apprenticeship requirements of the Naval Service.  There has been no substantial increase in the number over many years.  Even when the number was significantly higher, the economic cost per apprentice of completing courses was totally out of line with what is available in alternative educational and technological institutions.  This must be borne in mind.  Following its investigation of the position in Devoy, the recommendation from the military authorities, which are responsible for indicating the apprenticeship and training requirements for the future, was to close the barracks.</P>
      <P>The military, strategic and economic points of view and the issue of reinvestment in the Curragh, which is dilapidated although it should be one of the primary institutions of the Defence Forces, contributed to the decision.  Additional resources are now available to carry out the main tasks without lessening the capacity of the Defence Forces to recruit, train and educate personnel in concert with other educational and technological institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister addressed public representatives in Naas on the day of the announcement of the closures, he gave the impression that facilities would be made available at the Curragh for the entire apprenticeship school.  I have met many tradesmen who trained in the apprenticeship school and subsequently left the Army.  They are well able to account for themselves in their respective trades in the private industrial sector.  Given that the school was to be retained at the Curragh, I considered that at least all the expertise involved in training personnel would not be lost.  However, I am amazed to discover that the goalposts have been moved and that only in special cases will personnel be trained at the Curragh.  The impression was given in Naas that the school would move intact to the Curragh and the facility would continue to be used to train all Army apprentices.  I am flummoxed to discover that the goalposts have been moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on a number of occasions that the apprenticeship requirements of the Defence Forces is a matter for the military authorities.  They must indicate the requirements to me.  The military board which considered the retention or otherwise of Devoy barracks decided on the basis of the reduced requirement for apprentices that it should be closed.  My concern is to ensure that the future apprenticeship requirements are met through national facilities and in-house strengths that are available at an effective economic cost.  This was not the position in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Wall's comments, there is no doubt about the calibre of the people who completed their apprenticeships in the school. They can hold their heads high.  However, it is clear that it would be possible to train a greater <Col N="792" /> number to the same standard at a lower cost.  I must consider average costs in terms of the strata of educational and technological institutions that exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct that the Minister is now saying, contrary to the comments he made when he met public representatives in Naas to which Deputy Wall referred, that the Defence Forces do not have a large enough throughput of persons to be trained to justify the maintenance of an autonomous training institution?  Will the Minister confirm that the training provided by a number of third level institutions to Naval Service and other Defence Forces personnel involves training people who have already advanced to a certain point in their skills and trades?  The training courses offered in UCG and other institutions are not for basic trainees but people who have already a degree of skill.</P>
      <P>When the training unit in the Curragh closes down, which now appears to be in prospect, will the Minister indicate where the Defence Forces will get basic training for their members in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, radio and radar engineering and maintenance and the simple but important area of ordnance maintenance? From where will the Defence Forces get this expertise?  Does any institution elsewhere provide it?  If these basic skills are not provided from resources within the Defence Forces, is the Minister suggesting the time will come when the Defence Forces will seek to recruit people who already have skills in these areas which can be built on by the in-house specialities to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a mixture of the two areas mentioned by the Deputy.  In the recruitment of Defence Forces there are opportunities for enlisting people with certain existing specialties. The Deputy will appreciate the general educational standard that is available and the advances that have been made at second level, where the number of participants continues to grow.  The opportunities in terms of recruiting people with advanced skills from all sectors of education have grown enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows from his time in Government, the number of apprentices being trained by the Army has been in decline for a significant time on the advice of the military authorities. There has been no lack in the completion of training or the availability of skills.  I am aware of this from visits to United Nations operations and elsewhere.  Ireland is able to compete with the best in the context of specialised operations and this will continue.  Many of the specialist posts to which the Deputy referred, including radar, will be provided at the Curragh where there are advanced training facilities, the long-term future of which is secure.  Ten or 12 of the 28 apprentices will be based there.  In regard to apprenticeships in engineering, carpentry and so on, alternative training facilities are available in many colleges <Col N="793" /> and through FÁS.  It is much more cost effective to avail of these facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>How much will it cost to provide facilities to allow the 28 apprentices from Devoy Barracks to complete their training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the specialist posts there is no additional cost involved.  As the Deputy is aware, there are advanced training facilities at the Curragh which we will try to enhance as much as possible.  In the case of the other posts I do not know what the figure is but I intend to ensure the apprentices concerned complete their training on time.  The necessary resources, financial or otherwise, will be made available.</P>

      <P>Eighty-six personnel based in barracks being closed have applied for the voluntary early retirement scheme.  To date 84 have been made an offer under the scheme.  Sixty-four have accepted the offer, 16 have refused and replies are awaited from four.  Twenty-two of the 86 personnel are from Fermoy, all of whom have been offered voluntary early retirement.  Fourteen have accepted the offer, six have refused and replies are awaited from two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position concerning the individual whom the Minister promised voluntary early retirement when he addressed over 70 personnel in Castleblayney?  I have written to him about the case.  The Minister accepted full responsibility for the closure of barracks and claimed the individual concerned would be entitled to seek voluntary early retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are criteria which have to be met before one can qualify for voluntary early retirement.  Significant numbers have availed of the scheme.  I am familiar with the case to which the Deputy referred and have received representations from the Deputy and his colleagues in the constituency.  The individual concerned does not meet the criteria laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have known when he addressed personnel in Castleblayney what the criteria were.  He told the individual concerned that he would be offered voluntary early retirement.  I have been assured by a number of the personnel who were present on the said occasion that what the individual concerned said is correct.  Is the Minister saying he made a mistake?  If so, what is he prepared to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give any individual any commitment.  I said I was interested in introducing a scheme to facilitate those who wanted to retire from the Defence Forces.  There are certain criteria, including age, which have to be met.  It is not open to me to change the terms of the scheme in a particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>During discussions the Minister indicated there would be flexibility in the operation of the voluntary early retirement scheme. So far as the individuals affected are concerned, this was an indication the Minister would be willing to look at the terms of the scheme in particular cases.  I am aware of one individual in Fitzgerald <Col N="795" /> Camp, Fermoy &mdash; he is 39 years of age and medical grade C &mdash; who has been told that he does not qualify.  It was his expectation and that of many others the Minister would look sympathetically at cases such as his.  I am aware from correspondence I have received from the Minister that there will be an extra 100 places available. As this is a once-off offer, will the Minister interpret the regulations liberally and ensure a degree of flexibility?  The individuals concerned should be dealt with humanely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy appreciates, given the substantial costs involved, it was generous to extend the voluntary early retirement scheme, which is attractive, to those affected by barracks closures.  I have received representations from a number of Deputies.  Without giving any commitments I undertake to examine whether there is scope to assist in the cases to which the Deputies referred.  The terms of the scheme are generous and cannot be extended too far.  Otherwise, anomalies would be created for others who believe they are in a similar position.  I do not want to create a precedent which would cause enormous difficulties for others.</P>

      <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme, which has been in operation for three years, will end this year.  When it undertook to introduce the scheme the previous Government was faced by some difficult problems.  The scheme is a blunt measure but has produced results. While the numbers in the Defence Forces have been reduced, many areas have not benefited.  I have no wish to provide for the extension of the scheme.  Some changes may be needed in the future in that area but we will examine that when the time comes.  As far as the broader scheme is concerned, however, it is at an end.</P>

      <P>As part of the Defence Forces Review process, the Government approved the substantial delegation of financial authority, accompanied by budgets, to the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General.  In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to enhance the efficiency of the Defence Forces by delegating all day to day administration from the Department of Defence to the Defence Forces.  I am pleased to report that good progress has been made towards fulfilling this commitment and that delegation continues to work well.</P>
      <P>To date, 64 per cent of the non-pay element of the Defence Vote, amounting to over £77 million, has been devolved to the military authorities.  The delegation of day to day supply procurement is nearing completion and discussions are continuing with the military authorities regarding further budgetary delegation.  In addition to delegating these budgets, the associated administrative processes have also been delegated.</P>

      <P>I welcome the commencement order signed by the Minister yesterday following the legislation we passed in this House.  I take the opportunity also to welcome the new Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Dave Stapleton, to whom that order was assigned.  Does the Minister intend to make further progress on delegation, particularly in relation to the Naval Service and the Air Corps where there is serious dissatisfaction about the centralised nature of much of the decision making in which they are involved and the lack of autonomy in regard to budget, staffing and PR management?  What actions will he take in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, 64 per cent of the non-pay area has been substantially delegated.  If we examine all the resources available to me, 60 per cent of the total budget goes on pay and 18 per cent on compensation.  We do not have much of a say over these two areas as they are decided at other fora.  There is an agreement on pay &mdash; national, local or otherwise &mdash; and then we deal with the judicial decisions taken on the claimants' cases.  Approximately 78 per cent is out of our control &mdash; there is no question of delegating to anybody.  Sixteen per cent of the <Col N="797" /> total Defence Vote is now delegated and the balance is quite small.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct as far as the Naval Service and the Air Corps are concerned.  The scope that exists in this respect needs to be examined but there are a number of aspects to this.  The military has to train personnel to be the successful receivers of this new administrative opportunity for dealing with these issues.  The military is not used to doing that so it will be done on a phased basis.  We all want to have a more enlightened approach to management in the future and delegation to the lowest possible point is the most effective way to go forward.  We will continue that within the narrow range that remains.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in the past seven or eight years there has been a reduction of approximately 150 in the administrative strength of the Defence Forces, but in tandem with this change an area which has grown out of all proportion, and which could not have been anticipated, is the administrative requirement of dealing with the new claims.  I have had to move significant numbers of personnel to meet the growing requirements in that area.  The Deputy is probably suggesting that the overall economies produced by that action have not materialised because of the need to allocate people to new areas but account should have been taken of the significant drop in the overall numbers in the Defence Forces administrative area in the past number of years.  I want to ensure we have enough personnel to deal with future critical areas and any reallocation in the Department is clearly the way to go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A report which was commissioned from consultants to establish the condition of the Curragh swimming pool has been considered by my Department in conjunction with the Corps of Engineers.  The report identified the problem areas associated with the existing facilities and recommended closure of the pool.  Major refurbishment of the pool will be needed to remedy the deficiencies and to bring it into line with modern standards.  The process of drawing up the technical documents on which the eventual works contract will be based is now in progress.  Because of the specialist nature of the facilities the engagement of external technical expertise will <Col N="799" /> be necessary and steps are being taken to secure that assistance.</P>
    <P>The necessary funding is available and it is my intention that the necessary works will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>

A concern expressed to me by numerous schools is that if the pool is refurbished, the number of schools using it would not be the same as in the past.  I ask the Minister to give a guarantee to the House that all the schools in the locality wishing to use that facility will be able to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>Funding is not a problem and we are making provision for that.  It appears that the cost will be somewhere in the region of £2 million.  All of the public facilities available in the country to different organisations should be open, as far as possible, to the wider community because it is the taxpayers who put them there. Members should not have any doubt about my insistence that what has been the tradition will continue and be improved.</P>
      <P>It is a cause of some alarm to me that we do not have the in-house engineering capacity to do this ourselves and that we have to engage outside consultants.  I was alarmed to learn there are not many opportunities in that area.  I had the option earlier to do a &ldquo;fix job&rdquo; but for safety and other reasons I ruled that out.  I hope to have designs and planning for this project completed by the end of this year.  It will probably be an eight or nine month contract after that and no time can be lost.  I know the public is disappointed but the closure had to be done for safety reasons.  I am under pressure from many fronts on this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the Private Notice Questions of Deputies de Rossa, Mitchell, Spring and Sargent together.  I welcome this opportunity to explain to the House the background to some of the issues that appeared in the media yesterday and today in relation to my Department and to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last year has been one of great achievement in which the hard working and dedicated officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs played a central role, and I am extremely happy with the progress that has been made since coming into Government.  I will mention a few of the areas in which they have been involved.  Without their work there would not have been a British-Irish Agreement.  A few months ago Ireland joined seven other countries to bring forward an initiative within the framework of nuclear disarmament. The ideas for that initiative emerged from within my Department.  My officials have <Col N="801" /> also been intimately involved in the crucially important Agenda 2000 and EU enlargement negotiations.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited New York and Washington. In New York I spoke to the United Nations General Assembly and also had 25 meetings with individual Foreign Ministers, either by direct invitation or on the margin.  Among other things I was pursuing the Government's desire to win a seat on the Security Council of the United Nations.  In Washington I briefed the President's senior policy adviser on Northern Ireland on the latest developments in the peace process.  These are but a few of many examples of how my Department and I were able to represent very effectively Ireland's international interest during the past year, which has been generously acknowledged.</P>
    <P>This contradicts the assertions that there is a breakdown of relations between me and some of my most senior staff.  There have been strains between the Secretary General and me.  Such strains can occur in any relationship.  I assure the House that I have very good relations with all the other senior staff in my Department and I am in constant contact with the heads of the various divisions including Anglo Irish, economic, political, administration, development co-operation and so on across the broad spectrum of the organisational framework of the Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matters that have been raised, I will clarify the issues.  There are two issues involved: ambassadorial appointments and promotions within the Department.  Ambassadorial appointments are decided by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is advised by the Secretary General. Nothing has changed in this respect and all of the recent appointments were made on this basis.</P>
    <P>Regarding promotions, up to the coming into effect of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, a Minister had ultimate responsibility for all promotions in his Department.  The Public Service Management Act redefined the respective role of a Minister and a Secretary General in each Department.  The Secretary General now has exclusive responsibility for promotions to a certain level &mdash; assistant principal.  In exercising his powers under the Act a Minister may give written instructions in respect of other promotions.</P>
    <P>During this year the Secretary General recommended to me the promotion of six persons to counsellor and three persons to assistant secretary. I accepted all six recommendations on promotion to counsellor, and I also directed that two other first secretaries be promoted to counsellor. I accepted two of the three recommendations on promotion to assistant secretary and directed that another counsellor be promoted to assistant secretary.</P>
    <P>I emphasise to the House that these promotions were all decided by me in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, following recommendations made by the Secretary General.  In <Col N="802" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs the custom is that these recommendations follow from discussions in the Management Advisory Committee, or MAC, whose function <i>inter alia</i> is to advise the Secretary General in these matters.  Four of the promotions to counsellor arise from my decision to upgrade our representation in the United States to meet increasing demands resulting from the Northern Ireland peace process and from Ireland's economic profile in the United States.  Another two arise from the decision taken in the light of the British-Irish Agreement to open consulates in Edinburgh and Cardiff.  These openings have led to improved career opportunities for the staff of the Department.</P>
    <P>These are the basic facts.  I welcome the concern expressed by Deputies about the morale of officers in my Department.  Many of these officers have been at their current grades for a very long time.  The vast majority of the 94 first secretaries and 11 assistant principals are very capable of serving in a higher grade.  The upgrading of the consul general posts in the United States also provided a promotional outlet for some of these long serving and dedicated officers.  It would be my intention to seek further promotions in the Department of Foreign Affairs through the development co-operation offices throughout Africa.  It would also be my intention to examine the possibility of reopening our embassy in Nairobi.  These are some of the efforts I have made and continue to progress in the Department in terms of improving morale and strengthening and providing promotional opportunities.  I will continue on that road as long as I am in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Association of Higher Civil Servants wrote to the Secretary General in July saying that it warmly welcomed the personal initiative I took to upgrade the consul general posts in the United States of America.  The Secretary General also wrote to me saying that it was a positive development and that he and his colleagues on the management advisory committee were very appreciative.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that appointments at senior level in the Department of Foreign Affairs are handled in a different way from those in most Departments in the Civil Service and are not done on the recommendations of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  I wish to clarify that such appointments do not involve the Civil Service Commission.  Discussions have taken place on introducing a TLAC type system in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Government agreed in April last that this should be positively explored and there have been some consultations at senior level in that regard.  I am awaiting a progress report in respect of that.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies share my regret that the names of individual civil servants, all of whom <Col N="803" /> have given long and outstanding service to the State, have been mentioned in the media.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister regrets that names have come into the public arena.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, civil servants will have to become used to the fact that their names will be in the media on a regular basis.  Their obligation to come before Dáil committees also guarantees that they will be increasingly mentioned in the media.</P>
      <P>No one objects to civil servants being promoted. That is not the issue and I hope the Minister finds ways of promoting more deserving civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs. What is at issue is the manner in which the Minister seems to have overridden the recommendations of the MAC.</P>

Has the Minister on any previous occasions directed the Secretary General to promote a member of staff of the Department?  Prior to directing the Secretary General to promote the three persons in question, did the Minister interview them?  If not, on what basis did he judge them to be more appropriate for appointment than any of the other 1,000 staff in the Department?</P>

If he wants to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain their names, he is entitled to do so and he should avail of that facility if he wishes.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the last time I was in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Regarding the second individual, I knew his reputation, what he had done, that he had been in hardship posts, what were his qualifications and that he had been stuck in the position of first secretary for 18 years. That is the type of problem I am trying to resolve in the Department of Foreign Affairs, people being stuck for years at third secretary or first secretary level.  In this instance, the individual concerned served 16 to 18 years at first secretary level.  Is that fair?  As for the third individual, the assistant secretary, I have known him for a long time on a personal basis.  I know his qualities and have seen him operate, welcoming Presidents, Ministers and groups of Dáil Deputies visiting the countries in which he has served.</P>
      <P>I did not interview the people concerned but I knew their qualities for a long time and that is the way I bring my judgment to bear on people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to dispense with the procedures within the Department of Foreign Affairs for the promotion of staff and apply his own insight, feelings and experience of individual staff members as a means of promoting staff in general?  Does he feel it will create good industrial relations within his Department?  If he feels staff who deserve promotion are not getting it, would it not be more appropriate for him to seek to change the system of selection rather than interfering personally on the basis of his feelings and experience?  How does he think that makes staff feel who have not had the opportunity of being in his company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to do that under law.  I also point out that I accepted all six recommendations on promotion to counsellor.  I decided in my wisdom that there were three deserving individuals who had unfairly been stuck for a long time at certain positions in the Department. The Deputy mentioned the Association of Higher Civil Servants.  I have a letter from the association addressed to the Secretary General and copied to me which gives a rounded and fair assessment of how it views my actions.  I will not leave anything out.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>I am writing to place on record the views of the Committee of the Foreign Affairs Branch of the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants in relation to the recent round of promotions and upgradings and to future developments in relation to such matters, in so far as they affect the interests of our members of First Secretary/Assistant Principal or Counsellor grade.</P>
      <P>First of all, it should be emphasised that we deplore the media coverage of these developments. I wish to assure you that no member of the committee has conveyed any view or information to any of the journals which have reported or commented on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We warmly welcome the personal initiative taken by the Minister to upgrade the posts and <Col N="805" /> consulates in the United States.  The association has long held that selective upgradings of this kind are not only objectively justified in the national interest, but also have the potential to contribute significantly to the easing of career blockages within the Department, in particular at First Secretary level, which have had a serious impact on morale in recent years.</P>
    <P>Ninety seven people are stuck at this level.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>We would welcome further such upgrading and other positive developments which would help to restore the morale of the officers.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are also anxious that consequent transfers to, from or within the US should be effected in a flexible and sensitive manner, with full account taken of the individual personal and professional circumstances of the officers affected, and following adequate consultation with them.</P>
    <P>Account was taken of these considerations.  There was a suggestion that the upgrading of the offices would affect the people <i>in situ.</i>  There was also a suggestion that they remain for one or two years. I suggested 18 months and that was acceptable.  I thought it was the decent thing to do.</P>
    <P>The letter continues:</P>
    <P>However, it would appear that two of the promotions arising from these upgradings were decided upon by a procedure which departed from the usual practices.  This is a matter of considerable concern.</P>
    <P>The association favours a transparent and equitable promotion system based on specified criteria and procedures.  This approach was set out in our operational conclusions paper of February 1995 (a copy of the document is attached for ease of reference).  In particular, and irrespective of what particular procedures may be employed, we believe that all promotions should be determined in a consistent and uniform fashion, and would urge that this approach be maintained in all future cases.</P>
    <P>The question of whether a new system preferable to that which was customarily operated, and which would be acceptable both to our members and to the Department, could be devised is, in our view, one to which the association and the Department should urgently return in the early autumn, with a view to resolving the matter as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that section 2 of the Public Services Management Act provides for staff issues to be dealt with by the Secretary General, while section 7 provides for the Minister to deal with policy issues?  This is the first time I have heard of a Minister creating positions in the Civil Service.  That usually comes about from civil servants seeking these posts.</P>

      <P>Why did the Secretary General of the Department say to the Minister on 14 May that the Management Advisory Committee also agreed to the offer of promotion of a named first secretary consequent on the departure?  This is not just about senior people.  MAC also agreed to the promotion of a first secretary.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the morale of the Civil Service has not been dealt a blow.  Is he aware that the Secretary General wrote to him on 26 May stating:</P>
      <P>In view of the deep unhappiness and concern expressed in writing by the majority of officers involved, I respectfully request you to inform the Taoiseach of the reaction to the transfers envisaged.  It is unprecedented that so many senior officers in this Department should be transferred or appointed unwillingly to positions despite their formal misgivings.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree his actions have destroyed morale in the Department of Foreign Affairs? We are pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council; EU enlargement is on the horizon; we are in the latter stages of preparation for EMU; we are negotiating Agenda 2000 involving Structural and Cohesion Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy, and Northern Ireland is at a crucial stage. Will the Minister agree that at such a time it is extraordinary that he and the Secretary General of the Department have to correspond in such a manner and that the most senior civil servant in the Department must seek an appointment with the Minister to discuss matters which are his responsibility under section 2 of the Act and does not receive a reply?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, far from upsetting some alleged old boy network, as he has implied, he has politicised that network?  I would not be so upset if the Minister stated that he had promoted people in technical grades and given them opportunities. He has not replaced an old boy network, he has politicised that network.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> MAC?  This is in the documentation released. Why was this done without transparency?  When we sought information we got 36 pages, 12 completely blank with marks through them and 12 partially blank.  Is this how any Minister should appoint civil servants?  Where is the transparency in the appointment of civil servants to fairly administer the affairs of the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the blanks to which the Deputy referred, he will be aware that an officer has been appointed within the Department under the Freedom of Information Act.  I had nothing to do with the publication of that information.  In this case the information was sought by the chairman of Fine Gael for reasons better known to himself.  He got as much information as was required to be given by the appointed officer.  I saw the response when it was issued but I had no hand, act or part in it.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from the Secretary General advising me to see the Taoiseach, to be a good boy and take on board the concerns expressed about the locations to which people were to be sent.  I should read the correspondence.  However, if I put some of that correspondence on the record of the House it would come as a surprise and a disappointment to the Deputy.  I do not intend opening that correspondence.</P>

As regards the recommendation from MAC, I accepted most of the recommendations, there were some which I did not accept. The people whom I sent to the various missions have outstanding commitment and ability.  Those who have gone to other missions are officers who will serve the State with the utmost integrity.  I have no problems in that and I have no apologies to offer.  If the same happens next May or June I will take the same position and will not change. I saw what was required.  With great respect, a politician brings a broader view to matters and problems of this nature and I brought that view to it.</P>

Has the Minister communicated with the individuals who were recommended by the management committee and whose recommendation he did not accept?  In relation to his recommendations <Col N="808" /> for ambassadorial reassignments, did members of staff refuse to accept his recommendations in the initial stages?  The Minister said there was no breakdown in the relationships, but from what he has just said it is obvious there is an extreme degree of breakdown in his relationship with the Secretary General's Department. The Secretary General has served this country with dignity in both Washington, Brussels and in the Department.  What steps does he intend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the usual disdain he has for this House it was good of him to come in.  Has the Minister at any time since his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs either offered his resignation or threatened to resign?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where the Deputy is getting his information but I can only speculate.  When the Deputy speaks about honour and so on, one can think of other words but we will not go down that route.  On the question of being concerned about the individual who was suggested by the MAC to be assistant secretary, he is now in Cairo.  I felt the position in Ankara deserved somebody of the very highest quality and reputation and a man who had served this country well in other missions and I appointed the head of protocol to Ankara.  We have an immensely successful diplomat in that mission.  In the meantime the individual in Cairo who was promoted to be ambassador in Cairo is next in line for an assistant secretary post.  I have undertaken to make that appointment and I understand it is acceptable to him.  In the meantime, I have called another individual, whom I appointed as assistant secretary, to be the new head of protocol. What is wrong with that?  I had to get somebody to go to Ankara and I had to make this judgment myself.  The individual I sent to Ankara has accepted the position and I genuinely believe I have the best man for the job.  He has served in other difficult missions in the past.  I am not suggesting Ankara is a picnic but I do not think it can be seen as a hardship post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it necessary for a senior civil servant who is supposed to be working <Col N="809" /> closely with the Minister to write repeatedly to secure a simple meeting?  When was the last time the Minister had an ordinary conversation with the Secretary General?  Will he agree it is particularly damaging that the Department of Foreign Affairs is the most notable where diplomatic relations have broken down?  This is a sad message to send out.  Will he agree the genesis of much of the problem, to which he alludes, of people being stuck in various positions over a period, has to do with the large intake of personnel in 1979-80 which has had a knock-on effect of many civil servants being stuck in apprenticeships?  Is it only those among that cohort of civil servants who happen to be friendly with politicians who can aspire to promotion when that person assumes office?  That is an important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the Secretary General writing to me on a Wednesday requesting a meeting on the basis of his need to discharge his position, I responded to that request by meeting him at 8 o'clock the following Monday. I recall vividly the purpose of that meeting which was to discuss with him the whole question of the upgrading of the consulates and whether we should keep the individuals in charge there for a year or two years; I suggested 18 months, as I have already said in response to an earlier question. The second part of our conversation dealt with the position of the press officer in New York, in the light of the upgrading.  The third part of the equation dealt with the matter of Ankara and who would go there.  In fairness to the Secretary General he proposed a number of options which I did not find acceptable and I asked him to go back and find more options.</P>
      <P>So far as keeping in touch with the Secretary General is concerned, the Secretary General, like the rest of us, takes his holidays during the month of August.  He returned from his holidays in August and went to do his duty with the President who was visiting Australia for two weeks. He subsequently visited China with the Taoiseach, the secretary to the Government and the other entourage that follows him, including the media.  The Secretary General was out of the country for a long time.  When he returned, I went to the United Nations general assembly for a week and, coincidentally, I am no longer back than I am off for a few days only with the President at the beginning of her Canadian visit.  That is the sort of Department it is.  I was in touch with the Secretary General, through a high official in the Department, during his travels on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that on 2 July he told the House he did not want to cause a revolution in the Department of Foreign Affairs which might well happen if he proposed what Deputy Timmins said he proposed.  He said he thought he might find himself being ducked in the pond in St. Stephen's Green.  Does the Minister agree he has caused a revolution in his Department?  Was the Taoiseach informed by the Minister of the deep concern of the Secretary General, as requested, and of the concern of officials in the Department regarding their unwillingness to serve?  Was the Tánaiste involved at any stage in these decisions?  Did the Taoiseach respond either directly or indirectly to the Secretary General when made aware of the concerns?  Was the Tánaiste informed by the Minister of the deep concern of the Secretary General?  Did Mr. MacKernan and senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs at any stage threaten resignation because of the Minister's procedures in this regard?  Did the Tánaiste make representations to the Minister regarding any of the decisions?  Does the Minister agree that given the serious departure from the practices set out by law in the Public Service Management Act, 1997, it would be appropriate in the circumstances for the person charged with staff matters, namely, the Secretary General of the Department, to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs to answer questions so that Members can hear both sides of the story before deciding what is behind the politicisation of Civil Service promotions?</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmins, who spoke of starting a revolution in the Department of Foreign Affairs, was proposing at that time that Deputy Albert Reynolds should be appointed as a roving ambassador.  I have the greatest regard and respect for Deputy Reynolds.  He gave me an opportunity which I gratefully accepted.  It was my first opening having served on the back-benches for 13 years.

      <P>Yes, I think it was.  The person in question was a terribly efficient private secretary who served his country very honourably in Boston.  Members of the House will be aware of the person to whom I am referring and will have been treated extremely efficiently and well by him.  Trade delegations which have visited Boston have sent notes of gratitude for the work he has done.  He served as my private secretary for a long time and I found him to be hugely efficient. One of his principal wishes at all times was to serve every Deputy who approached him in the Department.  He will now represent this country in the new consulate in Cardiff which is a deserved reward for his work on behalf of this country.  The three people to whom the Deputy referred were considered by the then MAC which did not consider any of them to be up to the mark.  I would like to think that, within the next 12 months, there will be a huge added value programme in the Department of Foreign Affairs as far as promotions are concerned.  I will do my utmost to improve morale in the Department and believe I can do so successfully.</P>

      <P>I was outlining the importance of the Western Development Commission and the need for the Minister to put it on a statutory footing, in particular in relation to the five counties in Connacht and in Clare and Donegal.  I also referred to the need for social and economic development in the west at this time.  This issue is currently in the public domain because of the ongoing debate in regard to Objective One funding and whether such funding should be implemented on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable debate on this issue in the media in recent weeks.  I wish to point out a number of facts which are of particular relevance to the west.  <i>Per capita</i> income as a percentage of GDP in the west is less than the 75 per cent EU average which comprises the requirement for Objective One funding.  That indisputable fact was borne out by the ESRI report published last December.  Economic and social development has taken place at a far greater pace in the eastern part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I only have a few minutes in which to deal with one of the major tragedies of our time.  The situation has come to a head once again with the disclosure of appalling further massacres, including significant numbers of women and children, in Kosovo in recent days. According to official figures, the total number of ethnic Albanians murdered in Kosovo by Serbian forces since March of this year is 1,472, of whom 162 were women and 143 children.  In addition, 1,255 ethnic Albanians have been kidnapped by the Serbs and are listed as missing.  I regret that the majority of them are probably dead.  Some 1,700 Albanians have been arrested on charges of plotting against the State and most of these are likely to have been tortured.  We can be certain that the total number of casualties will, on investigation, turn out to be higher than the official estimates. More than 450,000 people in Kosovo have been displaced from their homes and it is impossible to make contact with many of them.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the western world and the European Union can stand back and fail to take action in regard to Milosevic.  He is the most evil political individual to appear on the European political scene since the death of Hitler in 1945.  His activities in Bosnia are proof of what he is capable of doing in Kosovo if he is allowed to.  For more than three years, the West stood back and allowed more than 250,000 people to be murdered and thousands of others to be tortured and permanently displaced from their homes.  We are witnessing a repeat of this in Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Activity in Bosnia ceased only when the West took strong military action against Milosevic.  Not <Col N="815" /> until the West takes similar action against him in regard to Kosovo will he stop his activities there. The Security Council resolutions which people are waiting for will probably never be passed because they will be vetoed by Russia or China or both.</P>
    <P>Much has been written in recent months about events in Kosovo.  One of the most valuable was an article in yesterday's <i>Guardian</i> by Paddy Ashdown, MP, leader of the Liberal Democrat Party in Britain.  I do not have time to quote from that article but I urge the Minister, Members of the House and the public to read it as it provides a picture of current events in Kosovo.  Earlier this week, the author asked an elderly man displaced from his home and living in a forest what he would do once the fierce Kosovo winter sets in. He said that Kosovars would die in the forest rather than return to their villages if the Serbs were still in occupation.  He also said there would not be much point in returning as the Serbs had looted and burned their houses, killed their cattle and destroyed their grain stocks.</P>
    <P>This is an appalling situation and I plead with the Minister not just to press for the kind of action which the EU is good at calling for in words, but to press for military action to be taken against Milosevic and his regime.  Otherwise this will not stop.</P>
    <P>Ireland is due to play a soccer match against Serbia in the next couple of weeks.  The proper reaction of this country would be not to play that match.  It is appalling and deplorable if we are prepared to line out against these people.  Sanctions were implemented before and no-one played against them in any sporting contest for a number of years.  In view of what they are now doing to innocent people in Kosovo, it is appropriate that the Irish team boycott the match.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this important issue in the House today.  Yesterday I responded to a written parliamentary question on the matter and I issued a strong statement, although I am not sure whether it saw the light of day.  I fully share the sense of outrage at eyewitness reports over the past 48 hours of atrocities perpetrated by security forces in Kosovo under the authority of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>I join with others, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in condemning these evil deeds.  The pattern of terror, including the most recent wanton killing of women and children, is totally unacceptable to the international community.  I understand the UN Security Council is being convened in New York to meet in emergency session later this afternoon to consider what further steps can be taken to ensure strict compliance by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with its obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has spoken of the need for the international community and the European Union to take action against the Milosevic regime <Col N="816" /> to put a stop to these continuing massacres and the displacement of large numbers of people in Kosovo.  I will set out what the Government is doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a question in the House yesterday, the situation in Kosovo is a cause for the utmost concern.  We are witnessing the prospect of a humanitarian catastrophe which could replicate the horrors of Bosnia.  The latest atrocities which have just come to light, with the mutilated bodies of men, women and children being exhumed, make a nonsense of the assertions coming from Belgrade that Serb forces have been withdrawn to barracks.  These atrocities must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and the perpetrators brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for the Government's concerns to be conveyed directly to the authorities in Belgrade. In addition, the Austrian Presidency of the EU yesterday made a strong protest on our behalf in Belgrade about the killing of innocent people and the need to bring those responsible to justice.  The EU has also demanded that international forensic experts be allowed immediately to examine all sites of reported mass graves and executions.</P>
    <P>The terrible events which we are witnessing follow on from the policy of repression in Kosovo which Belgrade is following.  Clearly this policy is targeted at the civilian population.  The latest UN estimates of refugees and displaced persons now total more than 300,000 and approximately 50,000 of these are without shelter and other basic needs as the harsh Balkan winter rapidly approaches. The sufferings of these people can only be compounded by this recent wave of terror.</P>
    <P>In my address to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York last week, I indicated my most profound concern on this issue and I called on the international community to take urgent and effective action, within the framework of the United Nations, to ensure that our worst fears are not realised.  That call has to be repeated today with even more urgency.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1199 of the UN Security Council, adopted on 23 September, provides a basis for putting an end to the present intolerable situation and reaching a solution.  Its terms set out in detail the steps to be taken to stop this conflict and to provide relief for the suffering civilian population. It is important that all parties to the conflict adhere to its demand that hostilities cease immediately, and this demand must now be implemented by Belgrade.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the intensive efforts being made by the international community to ensure the start of the dialogue between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership should now be pursued with determination.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1199 also addresses comprehensively the widespread abuse of human rights in Kosovo, including summary executions, kidnappings and mistreatment of civilians.  In particular, it sets out what has to be done by the International <Col N="817" /> Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  The work of the International Tribunal has to be facilitated by the Yugoslav authorities, who must assume their responsibilities to bring to justice their agents guilty of such crimes.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1199 further calls on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to enable effective and continuous international monitoring in Kosovo by, <i>inter alia</i>, the European Community Monitoring Mission, ECMM, to which Ireland contributes.</P>
    <P>While the early start of political dialogue is essential, the provision of humanitarian aid and the implementation of measures to allow the safe return of refugees and displaced persons are equally pressing priorities.  Resolution 1199 spells out clearly to the Yugoslav authorities what they are now required to do so that these objectives can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government has already provided £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for Kosovar refugees in Albania and is actively considering additional assistance.  The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has announced an aid package amounting to 8.55 million ECUs in response to the crisis.  An appeal for assistance has just been launched by the United Nations Inter Agency mechanism and I hope that this will quickly set in place the necessary measures and programmes.</P>
    <P>The solution to the conflict in Kosovo has to be brought about by negotiation and political means. Resolution 1199 decided that, should the concrete measures which it demanded not be taken, further action and additional measures would be considered to maintain or restore peace and stability to the region.  In the light of the latest reports of atrocities and the evidence of non-compliance with its decisions, the Security Council must now consider what further action is called for.  I hope that the council will be able to act decisively in that regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the pressure which the EU can exert on Belgrade, the Deputy will be aware that the EU is already implementing certain sanctions against the FRY.  These include a freeze on new investment in the FRY, a freezing of Yugoslav assets held abroad, and a ban on flights by Yugoslav airlines.  We must now look at further measures to demonstrate our determination to ensure that Serbia complies fully with its international obligations.  I will ensure that this issue will be raised at the General Affairs Council on Monday.</P>
    <P>It is clear that over the past six months the situation in Kosovo has been dramatically transformed. The future of Belgrade to restore Kosovo's autonomous states has resulted in a new situation in which it is hard to conceive how Kosovo Albanians can ever have confidence in the protection which the authorities in Belgrade should afford them.  We believe that nothing less than enhancement of the earlier status of autonomy will suffice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the commitment of the <Col N="818" /> Government to do everything possible, both at national level, at that of the European Union and also in the United Nations and the OSCE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this very important issue about which public representatives in the six southern Border counties are concerned.  Recently voluntary organisations and other interested parties have expressed their support for our efforts.  The retention of Objective One status for the period 2000-06 for the Border region is essential if regional imbalance and disparities in economic performance are to be eliminated.  The case for Objective One status is economically and politically justifiable. The infrastructural deficit suffered by the Border region must be addressed.  This will only be achieved through the drawing down of the maximum level of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Structural Funds exercise the minds of public representatives and bodies in the region.  At recent meetings in Belfast, Derry and Omagh of the sub-committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body we learned that this issue is one of key concern for public representatives in the six northern Border counties.  Last June the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, launched the Border regional report, &ldquo;The Border Region after 1999: The Case for Special Status&rdquo;.  It outlines in a comprehensive manner the numerous valid and cogent arguments for the retention of Objective One status and has been submitted to the Department of Finance.  I trust the Minister and Government have had the opportunity of studying it.  It outlines the poor performance of the region in socio-economic terms and articulates the region's unique status in the Irish and EU context.  Subsequently, a more detailed report was submitted to the Department by the Border Regional Authority, who I commend for its active role in this campaign.</P>
      <P>It must be accepted that the prolonged northern troubles had a devastating effect on the economy of Border counties and the seemingly intractable situation inhibited the normal pace of economic growth and development in the region. The Border created an economic divide, with towns being cut off from their natural hinterland and rural areas being cut off from their natural towns.  The area suffered from security problems and from a general lack of development in social and economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, 14.7 per cent of the labour force in the Border region was unemployed.  This was the highest unemployment rate recorded in any region and well above the national average of 11.8 per cent. Fortunately, employment here increased in the period 1993-97 and unemployment fell.  However, the Border region's performance again lagged behind that of other regions which meant that fewer new jobs were created and the reduction in <Col N="819" /> unemployment was lower than anywhere else in the country.</P>
    <P>Urbanisation is a feature of economic growth and the Border region is hindered in its potential development due to its largely rural nature.  As a region it was unable to achieve the full benefit of the Objective One status the country has enjoyed to date because of the political difficulties in the North.  The region looks forward to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  The ongoing peace process must be underpinned by large scale investment in infrastructure, inward investment and the creation of employment.  Now is the time to redress the economic difficulties the region has suffered over a period of almost 30 years.</P>
    <P>The region faces new opportunities for the future arising from the peace process but it also faces a new challenge in being on the exchange rate frontline when Ireland enters EMU without Britain.  The region has benefited from Structural Funds expenditure, funds which were successfully negotiated in 1989 and 1992 by Fianna Fáil Governments.  However, it did not achieve the success rate of the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The report by the Border Authority clearly outlines why the region should retain full Objective One status.  The region is clearly below the 75 per cent of GDP threshold which determines eligibility for Objective One status.  It continues to be remote and peripheral in EU terms and it has special status regarding the historic political and economic opportunities arising from the peace process.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to favourably examine the merits of the case advocated by the Border Authority.  With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and my Fianna Fáil colleagues in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and other Border counties, I lend my support to the arguments outlined in the authority's report.  I wish to see the region achieve its potential in economic and social terms. That can only be achieved by large scale and early investment in our roads, water and sewerage services, industrial buildings and telecommunications. The region will only enjoy an increase in employment and a halt to rural depopulation when such investment occurs.</P>
    <P>West of the Bann suffers from lack of development similar to the southern Border area.  The implementation of the British-Irish Agreement should add considerably to economic convergence on this island.  The retention of Objective One status for the southern Border region and north of the Border is needed so the necessary economic development can take place to under-pin the peace process.  We need investment on a large scale.  This is an opportune time to show that our Government and the European Commission are committed to economic and social progress in the Border area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for listening to the case I put forward.  I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the current position on regionalisation. As was announced on Tuesday, the Cabinet is considering a paper prepared by my Department for the Ministers and Secretaries General group. The paper deals with this issue not only for the Border area but also in the wider context of the entire country.  The Cabinet will continue to consider the matter in two weeks time when I return from Washington following my attendance at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund next week.</P>
      <P>The House will understand that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Cabinet's consideration but I can explain some of the background.  Ireland is currently treated for Structural Funds purposes as a single region under Objective One.  Objective One channels Community support to the most disadvantaged regions of the Union which are lagging behind economically.  The criterion for this eligibility is a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms of below 75 per cent of the Community average. Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> now exceeds this figure so, as a region and member state, it no longer qualifies for Objective One status.  This is the first truth we must recognise.</P>
      <P>If it were the case that strict eligibility had to be applied, Ireland as a single region under the relevant regional statistical map of Europe &mdash; which comprises more than 200 regions across Europe &mdash; would simply not qualify for Objective One status and would have to settle for much lower levels of transfers from the outset.  The European Commission in its Agenda 2000 proposals recognised that it would be undesirable for a region which had been receiving assistance to be suddenly cut off from that asistance.  This would create a shock to the economy which could threaten progress already made.  Therefore &mdash; the Government had been lobbying for this &mdash; some arrangement was essential to avoid such an economic shock.</P>
      <P>In Agenda 2000, the Commission proposed that regions such as Ireland who were &ldquo;graduating&rdquo; from Objective One status would be given transition status.  This means in practical terms a gradual reduction in EU funding over the period of the next Financial Perspective, that is, the years 2000 to 2006.  Initially the region in transition from Objective One will enjoy the full benefits of that Objective.  From then on a gradual reduction in support levels would occur until by the year 2006 the lower Objective Two levels of funding will be reached.  This is the Commission's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious that the prosperity which has been achieved has not applied uniformly throughout the country and is committed to addressing this problem.  Undoubtedly certain sub-regions have not done as well as the rest of the country in terms of GDP growth.  The sub-regions of the Border, the west and the midlands currently have a <i>per capita</i> GDP of less than 75 per cent of the EU average and are likely to be <Col N="821" /> below 75 per cent for the reference period to be used for the next round.</P>
    <P>In this context a possible approach is to address and to adopt a regionalisation approach to the next round of Structural Funds.  Under the most straightforward regionalisation approach, the existing single region of Ireland would be reconstituted as two new regions, of which one could consist of those parts of the country whose <i>per capita</i> GDP is below 75 per cent of the EU average. If such an approach were taken, the region with a <i>per capita</i> income below 75 per cent of the EU average would qualify for full Objective One status, while the rest of the country would still be a transition region covered by Objective One but on a diminishing scale.</P>
    <P>The Government is currently considering an approach to EUROSTAT, the Commission's statistical office, with a view to having Ireland reclassified from its present single region status. This move, if it is decided upon and accepted by EUROSTAT, could mean that a region comprising the west, Border and midlands regional authority areas could qualify for Objective One.</P>
    <P>We must be clear and precise about what this would mean.  The first criterion for eligibility for Objective One is a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms of below 75 per cent of the Community average.  Ireland's overall GDP <i>per capita</i> now exceeds this figure.  Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations we must anticipate a substantially lower transfer overall to Ireland. Regionalisation could help this situation for part of the country.</P>
    <P>However, being below 75 per cent for a region is not the whole story.  Other criteria are equally important, for example, population.  In the final analysis it is not just the region which determines levels of assistance but its population, relative prosperity, unemployment levels and so forth. The bottom line is that whatever way the decision goes, no part of Ireland will enjoy transfers at levels it previously enjoyed when the whole country qualified for Objective One status as in the current round.</P>
    <P>My Department has already started preparations for the next national plan and has invited submissions on this from all regional authorities. Whether we go the single region or regionalisation route, the key must be that we are positioned to make good and effective use of the funds we receive from Europe, especially against the background of a drop in the overall level of transfers.</P>
    <P>I will allay some misapprehensions that have been mooted recently.  If a part of the country were to qualify for Objective One status as a result of the proposed reclassification, this would not mean that the rest of the country would be treated any less favourably in EU transfer terms than it would have been anyway under the transition regime currently proposed for the country as a whole.  The Government would insist that the non-Objective One part of the country would qualify fully for the transition regime and we have <Col N="822" /> no reason to believe otherwise.  In consequence there is no loss involved for the rest of the country from a proposal which results in one part being Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The problems of the west, Border and midlands have been well ventilated and are recognised. These regions have not achieved the same development as others.  This is why the Government programme &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; undertook to seek a better deal for these regions in the next round.  In other areas, particularly urban blackspots, there are pressing problems to be addressed and a special focus on these need not suffer or be diluted through the adoption of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The Government decision in this matter will be taken in full appreciation of the interests of all those involved, both in the regions such as the Border which still have some catching up to do and in those parts of the country where problems of infrastructure, unemployment and social blackspots remain.  There is no question of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The interests of all regions will be looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the crisis in the health care services and the urgent need to open the new St. Clare's nursing home, which is currently lying idle.  It is regrettable that, yet again, the Minister for Health and Children has chosen not to appear in the Dáil to answer for his area of responsibility.  It is becoming quite common for the Minister to go missing when important issues arise, even though he was so vocal in Opposition, being on the airwaves practically every day of the week spouting about mismanagement of the health services.  He has gone from being a bulldog to being a poodle in this Government.  It is quite regrettable that he is not taking his responsibility seriously.  There is a worsening health crisis which has been escalating over the summer months, but the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has been silent on all these issues. It is with regret that we are here to discuss this matter today and, unfortunately, the Minister is not available to answer for his stewardship.</P>
      <P>Many people will be forgiven for thinking that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is the senior Minister in the Department because he is pushed out when RTE wants to speak to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who is not prepared to face the music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services are rapidly reaching the point of chaos.  There are long waiting lists for operations; the most recent figures show that more than 34,000 people are waiting for operations. Meanwhile, the Minister for Health and Children is putting the squeeze on hospitals and health boards to get them to close beds, which further exacerbates the problem.  It is unacceptable that, at a time of economic boom, the Minister for Health and Children should be <Col N="823" /> closing hospital beds and forcing people to wait even longer for necessary operations.</P>
    <P>Major problems are arising from the acute shortage of nurses in our health service.  We have now reached the point where many of the hospital beds the Minister closed over the summer months cannot be re-opened because staff cannot be found for the hospitals.  I and many others raised this issue with the Minister earlier in the year but it seems he was oblivious to the problem.  He had no plans and no facts or figures to show that this major shortage was going to occur.  We now find ourselves facing into a winter when further pressure will be put on health services and, yet again, we will not be able to respond adequately to those needs and demands.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter because more than 34,000 people are awaiting operations and that figure is growing all the time.  When consultants, politicians and the public complained about this during the summer, the Minister responded in his usual fashion by setting up a review group.  The Minister has had the review group's report for several months, yet we have not seen it.  Is he waiting until after the Cork by-election to release the report?  He is spending far too long in considering it.  What we want now from the Minister is action and we need to see that action before the winter months come.</P>
    <P>The problem is particularly acute in the Dublin area where 15,000 people are awaiting operations in the Eastern Health Board region.  The main part of that problem relates to the north side of Dublin.  The Mater Hospital, which has the longest waiting list, recently issued a report revealing major problems.  The situation is similar in both Beaumont and Blanchardstown hospitals.</P>
    <P>Up to 25 per cent of operations are being cancelled at the moment because of bed shortages. One main factor is that many elderly people who need nursing home care are occupying acute hospital beds at great expense.  This is happening because there is insufficient forward planning in providing nursing home places.  I do not blame the health boards for this and there is no excuse for the Minister in this regard.  He has received several reports telling him the exact demographic requirement for hospital beds.</P>
    <P>There is a state of the art, 50-bed nursing home in the Glasnevin area which is lying idle.  Meanwhile, operations are being cancelled throughout the north side of Dublin.  I call on the Minister to make funding available to open that nursing home so it can come on stream as quickly as possible thus freeing up beds in acute hospitals.  In that way we can begin to make some impact on the waiting lists.  It is an absolute scandal that facilities like this are available, yet the Minister is not prepared to provide the necessary funding to staff them.  I call on him to indicate his intentions in this regard as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Shaping a Healthier Future, the strategy for the health services, recognises the challenge to the health services of a rapid increase in the population of older people.  The achievement of the health strategy's targets to reduce premature mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer and accidents will enable more people to reach old age.  The care of older people is clearly going to be one of the key issues to be addressed by the health services in the next decade. The challenge is to reorganise existing services and develop new ones, to ensure that older people get the most effective care available.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines how services will develop to meet the health needs of this population.  It endorses the principles and recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> which are to: maintain older people in dignity and independence at home; restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent; encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every way possible; and provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, services for ill and dependent elderly people have improved, both in hospital and in the community.  Respite and day care have eased the burden of caring for many relatives. There has been a significant increase in the number of specialist departments of medicine of old age attached to general hospitals. <Col N="825" /> The appointment by health boards of directors or co-ordinators of services for older people has helped to ensure better liaison between primary services, acute hospitals and long stay care and to overcome difficulties experienced by the people availing of the services, carers and service providers in getting the right service at the right time.</P>
    <P>Many long stay units or hospitals have developed active rehabilitation services and offer day and respite care to dependent older people and their carers in the catchment area.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act has provided a new framework for registering nursing homes and for the payment of subventions to people in need of nursing home care.  The total annual cost of implementing the scheme is now in the region of £24 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has made considerable resources available to the Eastern Health Board in recent years to improve services for older people, particularly those who have completed the acute phase of their medical treatment and require transfer to a level of care which is more appropriate.  New facilities have been provided at Navan Road, Sir Patrick Dun's, South Circular Road, Cherry Orchard, Peamount and St. Monica's, Belvedere Place.  This has resulted in the availability of many hundreds of additional respite, convalescent, rehabilitation, extended care and day care places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Treacy, for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say.  I also thank the Department for listening to me earlier in the year when I raised this matter.  I was delighted to learn over the summer that an additional bus was provided to bring special needs children from Youghal to Cork.  The parents of these children welcome this development.  I also thank the officials in the Department and in Bus Éireann who were extremely helpful and courteous to the parents and to me when we discussed this matter with them.</P>
      <P>These special needs students &mdash; God's children &mdash; suffer from various types of difficulties.  They are mildly, profoundly and severely mentally handicapped.  It is not possible to provide the specialist education they require near their homes so they must travel long distances every day on buses.  Some of these children have behavioural problems.  Bullying has become an issue on the buses as the children vary in age.  I was told by parents that some children are pinched, kicked and punched on the buses.  It is dangerous to expect the driver to supervise these children while driving the bus.  The parents are extremely anxious about this situation.</P>
      <P>When the children arrive in school they are often in a severely distressed condition.  I spoke to the principal of one of the special schools today and she told me they are extremely distressed and dishevelled when they come to school.  If some of these children indulge in one type of behaviour, others will copy them.  If some children start removing their clothes on the bus, others will do the same, particularly if there is no one there to supervise them.  I ask the Minister to provide the relatively small amount of funding necessary to enable adult escorts to travel on the buses to supervise these children so they can arrive in their place of education in a happy and safe state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these children have medical problems, including heart conditions.  I was told by the principals in some of the schools that they have care notices on the walls of the schools telling them what to do in an emergency.  However, what would happen if such an emergency occurred on the bus?  There is no oxygen or trained personnel on the bus.  The bus driver does not have a mobile telephone to call for help.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this case deserves his attention and <Col N="827" /> finance.  These people have no one to speak for them.</P>
    <P>These are accidents waiting to happen.  I was told of one incident where the back door of the bus was opened and one of the children fell out. Fortunately, no one was injured.  An adult supervisor on the bus would have prevented that happening. The last thing I want is to come into the House to ask whichever Minister is in power why an accident was allowed to happen.  Now is the time to act and to provide funding.  There are people willing to do this work.</P>
    <P>These children's constitutional rights could be affected.  If their parents cannot allow them on the buses because their safety and physical and mental health will be at risk, they will have to keep them at home and they will be deprived of their right under our Constitution to specialist education.  The Minister will probably tell me why escorts cannot be provided, but I implore him to make an effort to ensure this segment of our society is treated with the compassion and sympathy it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his positive statement and I will convey his appreciation to the officials in my Department for the work they have been doing in collaboration with him on behalf of these children in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that we are aware of the need to extend the existing escort scheme on special school transport services.  The Department is currently giving active consideration to possible measures in this regard.</P>
      <P>The overall operation of the school transport scheme is constantly under review to ensure that the best and safest possible service is delivered. Bus Éireann, which operates the service on behalf of the Department, places special emphasis on safety and has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. However, we are aware that difficulties arise from time to time in supervision of special needs pupils on some services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1995 an annual allocation of £150,000 has <Col N="828" /> been provided to fund the pilot scheme of grant aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  All applications for support under the scheme were carefully considered in the Department.  It was decided that the pilot phase should focus on facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools for children with physical disabilities and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts of pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.  These schools are located in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the school transport review committee undertook a comprehensive study of the school transport scheme.  The committee's report, published in January of this year, was circulated to all relevant and interested parties for their views.  The recommendations set out in the report dealt with a broad range of transport issues, including the question of escorts on special services.  The report estimated the cost of providing an escort on all special transport services at £2 million per annum.  The contents of the report have given rise to extensive debate and a number of responses to it have been received. These are currently under consideration in my Department.  The outcome of this consideration will provide a basis for determining future approaches to the question of escorts on school services.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Deputy has raised a number of issues concerning transport provision for certain special needs children travelling to special schools from the east Cork area.  I understand the standard of service has improved since the start of the current school year, following the introduction of an additional bus to cater for the route.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that.  We were delighted to facilitate the children in the area.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be considered in the context of any proposed expansion of the escort scheme as soon as the relevant funding becomes available.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 October 1998.</P>

      <P>I ask that Members of the House join me in extending sympathy to the family of the late Private Michael Dowling on their sad loss.</P>
      <P>While serving with the 83rd Infantry Battalion, UNIFIL, Private Michael Dowling was seen by the Battalion Medical Officer on 5 August 1998, he was complaining of a sore throat.  Normal treatment was given including antibiotics.  He went home on leave to Ireland in mid-August.  I understand that the following is the series of events following his return home.  He attended a local GP because of a continuing sore throat. Private Dowling was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny on 30 August 1998.  His condition worsened and he was transferred to Waterford Regional Hospital on 1 September where he died on 16 September 1998.</P>
      <P>I further understand that during his illness it was considered that the diagnosis might be diphtheria but that tests have so far failed to confirm this.  As a precaution, swabs were taken from the throats of personnel who would have come in contact with Private Dowling in Lebanon.  All tested negative for diphtheria.  The results of some post mortem tests on Private Dowling are still awaited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 56, 60, 70, 78 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The recently published Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps recommended an overall strength of 930.  The strength of the Air Corps on 30 June, 1998 the latest date for which figures are available, was 1,026.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of pilots, there are at present a total of 88 flying officers in the Air Corps.  Thirteen Air Corps cadets were recently recruited.  There are also a total of ten senior cadets in their second year of training who are due to be commissioned as fully trained flying officers in 1999.</P>
      <P>The ongoing training of cadets combined with the introduction of the Service Commitment Scheme for Air Corps pilots which was introduced in 1997, is designed to help alleviate the difficulties in regard to pilot numbers which have arisen due to the unprecedented level of retirements from the Air Corps in the past year.</P>
      <P>The question of training non-commissioned personnel as pilots will be further examined in the context of implementing the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report.  It is open to non-commissioned personnel to apply for Air Corps cadetships and a number of such personnel have been commissioned in the past having successfully completed cadetships.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 58, 98 and 111 together The Government considered my proposals for the preparation of the proposed White Paper on Defence in late July.</P>
      <P>The Government approved the following objectives for the White Paper: to provide a medium term policy framework within which Defence policy can evolve to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide a framework to include the input of the Minister for Foreign Affairs deriving from the overall international security context and the Minister for Justice with regard to the national security environment; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme, already commenced under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, of Defence services especially in relation to the future size, configuration, deployment and resourcing (financial, infrastructural and equipment) of the Defence Forces consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the on-going development of the management of Defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the Strategic Management Initiative centrally; and, to provide a medium term programme for the evolution of Civil Defence policy and as a follow-up to the present Towards 2000 Strategy.</P>
      <P>There is no delay in the publication of the White Paper.  I made it clear from the outset that as this is the first White Paper on Defence, it should be given adequate time.  Important decisions in the Defence area are proceeding in relation to, for example, barracks rationalisation, the on-going reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces Review Implementation plan and of course the need to tackle the hearing loss compensation issue.</P>
      <P>The necessary work required by the Government's decision on the White Paper is proceeding. This is based on the work of my own Department, civil and military, as well as appropriate inputs from other Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>As this is the first White Paper of its kind, I wish to ensure that all of the issues raised are reflected upon adequately.  The timetable for work is provisional but I would see the on-going consultations being undertaken over the coming months with the intention of being in a position to put a draft for consideration by the Government by the summer of next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 21, 31, 44, 53, 63, 102, 106, 129, 151, 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of Price Waterhouse Management Consultants on the Reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, the Government decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the future development of both the Air Corps and the Naval Service critically depends on the input of all of the relevant stakeholders.  In particular this includes the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources as well as the Department of the Taoiseach, given the cross-departmental nature of the State's air and sea requirements.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Defence, I am responsible for the development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service and I will ensure that the civil and military branches of my Department do what the Government requires of them in putting together the necessary plans to give effect to the Government's decision on the recommendations made by Price Waterhouse.  This work is now proceeding.</P>
      <P>There are two broad dimensions to this work. Firstly, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on Defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report.  Secondly, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible.  It will, in the final analysis, be the task of the General Officer Commanding, Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding, Naval Service to present plans for my consideration to address all of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently wrote to my colleagues in Government requesting participation by their Departments in the consultation group which I will chair myself since I am directly responsible to this <Col N="834" /> House for these matters.  The consultation group will include senior military officers including the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service. The group will be tasked with making relevant inputs to the planning process leading to the finalisation of implementation plans to give effect to the Government's decision as outlined already. The group will meet as soon as possible.  The aim would be to ensure that plans for the effectiveness and efficiency measures can he finalised by year-end.  Detailed issues including the location of the headquarters of both services will be considered within these plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to Questions Nos. 19, 30, 33, 34, 81, 83, 87, 97, 116, 119, 126, 153, 159, 175, 190 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.</P>
      <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the immediate sale of the barracks. Of the proceeds, 60 per cent will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment.  The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place.</P>
      <P>The military authorities fully support the proposed closures and consultations with the representative associations were held in the days following the Government decision.  The consultative process with representative associations regarding all defence matters is well established and will continue into the future where matters of mutual interest arise.  Consultations with other interested parties including trade unions, local organisations and community groups have also taken place.</P>
      <P>The programme of closures announced on 15 July was carefully considered to minimise impact on military and civilian personnel and you may be assured that there are no plans for future closures.</P>
      <P>The Government remain committed to the development of the Defence Forces as a modern and effective organisation staffed and equipped to effectively fulfil the roles assigned to them and to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 176 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Expert Group on Hearing Disability Assessment, otherwise known as the <Col N="837" /> Green Book, was published by the Department of Health and Children on 9 April 1998.  The Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998, which was subsequently passed by the Oireachtas, gave the Green Book a statutory basis, by requiring the courts to take notice of the Green Book and to have regard to the handicap assessment formula contained therein.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, the Green Book was subject to a test case &ldquo;Greene <i>v</i> Minister for Defence &amp; Others&rdquo;.  In the judgment on this case, Mr. Justice Lavan stated in relation to the Green Book and associated legislation that &ldquo;what is provided for here is a fair and reasonable method for assessing these litigants hearing disabilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, another judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Johnson, questioned the Green Book's treatment of the effect of age related hearing loss and a second test case was required; Hanley <i>v</i> Minister for Defence &amp; Others which was heard in July last.  In this case, Mr. Justice Johnson also accepted the Green Book &ldquo;as a fair and reasonable means of calculating disability&rdquo;.  However, he went on to say that &ldquo;the Green Book is not complete and there are some very serious gaps in it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Green Book has been favourably received by leading international medical experts.  Because of the major policy implications and the need to ensure that the full range of national and international medical opinion is taken into account, these issues will be fully addressed again when the matter comes before the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>The strength required for the next Irish contingent to serve with UNIFIL is 620 personnel of which 68 are officer appointments.  Most of the officer appointments have been filled for the next contingent, the first element of which is due to depart for Lebanon later this month.  The selection of volunteers from other ranks personnel of which there are currently 521, will be completed by the military authorities by 5 October 1998, the day of activation of the contingent.  The military authorities are satisfied that the full complement of contingent numbers will be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26, 28, 41, 47, 77, 122, 150, 160, 161 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>The number of promotions by rank within the Naval Service in the years 1990 to 1998 are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Systems and general criteria governing promotion are matters which come within the scope of representation.  Where Naval Service officer promotions are concerned, arrangements are agreed for each competition with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers.  Both sides have agreed to enter into discussions on a long-term system governing promotion in the <Col N="840" /> Naval Service and it is anticipated that this system will be in place early in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association has submitted proposals at the Conciliation Council regarding career development and promotion for NCOs. These proposals are under consideration at present with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.</P>
    <P>I intend that there will be further promotions in the Naval Service later this year as agreed with the representative associations.</P>
    <P>The overall question of structure and staffing of the Naval Service will be addressed in the context of the implementation of the Price Waterhouse review.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse.  The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years.  Through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse. The school has, down the years, provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, while acknowledging the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have been a consistent feature of international teams over many years. Army riders have also participated with distinction in Olympic Games, most recently at Seoul in 1988 and Los Angeles in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equitation school has at the present time two horses which are competing at international level and which are expected to be suitable for <Col N="842" /> consideration for selection for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.  The selection of horses for the Irish team travelling to Sydney will be made by the International Committee of the Show Jumping Association of Ireland in the period leading up to the commencement of the games.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to source high quality Irish bred horses for the Army Equitation School for competition at home and abroad and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.  Funding for the Army Equitation School is currently provided from the national lottery.  There is a total allocation of £550,000 available this year which includes a provision of £260,000 in respect of the purchase of horses.  I am committed to maintaining funding at existing levels in the coming year and also to continue to explore possibilities to ensure that horses of the appropriate standard will be available to the equitation school for possible selection on an Irish showjumping team which, it is hoped, will travel to Sydney in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 118 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 12 on 4 June, the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, RACO and PDFORRA operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme.  This scheme and its enabling legislation and regulations provide the mechanism through which consultations with the associations are carried out.  The C &amp; A scheme also provides a means for both sides to discuss issues which are of importance to them and to arrive at mutually acceptable resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C &amp; A schemes have traditionally been adversarial in nature and did not lend themselves easily to the management of change.  In this regard, discussions with both RACO and PDFORRA on a revised scheme of conciliation and arbitration for members of the permanent defence force are now coming to a conclusion.  It is the intention of all parties to arrive at arrangements which will provide a more transparent and realistic system than <Col N="843" /> has been in place hertofore and which, in keeping with modern industrial relations thinking, will place greater emphasis on negotiation rather than adjudication to resolve issues.  These arrangements will, of course, have to be consistent with the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness advocates building more open, co-operative processes on existing arrangements.  The terms of the Partnership 2000 have been offered to both associations and will, I understand shortly go to ballot.  The provision of a forum to complement the C &amp; A structure and at which issues such as the implications of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces can be raised is under examination at present.  Consideration is also being given to partnership structures for RACO and PDFORRA and I do not want to preempt the outcome of that process.  In general however, I believe that employment relationships can be very much improved by an acceptance by both sides that substantial support of each other is necessary to make progress.  Both sides must also accept that each has a legitimate role and interest in the organisation.  Such steps should lead to higher levels of mutual respect for and trust in each other positions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions, Nos. 37 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>An incident occurred at the Air Defence Range, Gormanstown Camp, on 7 July 1998 which led to ground to air firing being terminated. A board of inquiry into the incident was convened on 7 August, 1998.  The board which will inquire into the circumstances which led to the shoot being terminated and make recommendations, is due to report shortly.  Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed.  Any changes in the undertaking of firing practices recommended by the board of inquiry will be implemented.  In more general terms, the problem facing the State is that the courts have awarded large damages for levels of hearing loss which in other jurisdictions would not be considered a serious handicap and which would attract little or no damages.  It is the relatively high level of court awards, combined with the large number of existing and potential claimants which gives rise to the huge bill the Exchequer now faces.  I am continuing to examine any options which are open to the Government to deal with the hearing loss litigation in a way which will ensure that genuine cases are suitably compensated while the impact on the taxpayer is as limited as possible.  In this regard I will be bringing further proposals to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 57, 65, 73, 90, 94, 114 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>By 29 September, a total number of 13,538 claims for Army hearing loss compensation had been received.  Settlements have been reached in a total of 1,635 cases and court awards following hearing have been made in 123 cases.  A further 93 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately: £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and, £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  A total estimate for administrative costs is therefore £2,395,000 per year.</P>
      <P>Cost projects for the likely eventual cost of Army hearing loss litigation have fluctuated up and down over the past number of years, particularly as various &ldquo;milestones&rdquo; have been reached. Given the current and potential scale of the problem, allied to the complex legal and medical variants, it is impossible to give an accurate computation of the future cost.  What is clear however, regardless of how the problem is approached, is that we are dealing with a cost burden of huge magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the award made in the <i>Hanley</i> test case last July, my Department has estimated that the cost for loss of hearing on the 11,500 claims which are currently outstanding would be of the order of £550 million.  If legal costs and damages for matters such as loss of earnings are included, the potential bill is of the order of one billion pounds.  Claims are continuing to arrive in the Department at a current average rate of 50 cases per week.  Clearly, if claims continue to arrive in these proportions, we are talking of an eventual cost of multiples of these estimates.  The effect of this cost on public finances will be damaging <Col N="846" /> beyond reasonable acceptance.  Such damage is not acceptable to the Government nor do I believe is it acceptable to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be <Col N="847" /> deployed to anti drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving the prevention of illegal drug importation. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the Joint Task Force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as Enforcement Officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  Eighty recruits were enlisted in the Service in 1997, 50 to-date this year and arrangements are currently in hand for the enlistment of an additional 70 recruits.  Seventeen apprentices are also being recruited and are expected to take up appointment next month.  A competition to recruit ten Watchkeeping Officers to the Executive Branch of the Naval Service was advertised in March of this year and as a result, six officers have taken up appointment and an additional three are due to take up appointment on the 19th of this month.  A total of 13 Cadets also took appointment with the Naval Service on 21 September, 1998.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At present six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new Fishery Protection Patrol Vessel which is due to be delivered in September, 1999.</P>
    <P>As part of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-1998, the Government established a steering group to review the operations of the Air Corps and the Naval Service. Price Waterhouse Management Consultants were appointed to consider and make recommendations to the group and the Government published their report to the steering group in July 1998.  The Government considered the final report from Price Waterhouse and agreed in principle the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking/multi-capabilities and dedicated services and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing the Naval Service and the Air Corps be made accordingly. The mix of multi-tasking/multi-capabilities and dedicated services will be decided in the context of the identification of the resources required to meet the level of military contingency roles as determined in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Defence.  Value for money principles shall apply in decision-making on the allocation <Col N="848" /> to the military services, or to others, of various non-military sea and air support tasks.</P>

      <P>Some of the more important developments in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are a new fishery patrol vessel due for delivery in 1999; the supply of new turrets and fire directing systems for fitting, during 1998 and 1999, to existing armoured cars; the purchase of twelve refurbished 105mm.  light artillery guns to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete; delivery of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of nearly £10 million; expenditure of approximately £3 million on new troop carrying vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under consideration in my Department at present.  A project team was established in 1997 comprising civilian and military personnel and was tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  The procurement process will be undertaken in two stages by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.  In stage one, a general <Col N="849" /> request for proposals (RFP) issued to interested companies on 24 April 1998, based on a broad-parameter specification, with the aim of establishing product availability in the market place as well as an indication of the costs involved.  Proposals were received on 27 May 1998 and are being evaluated at present.  In the second stage, which will commence shortly, a request for tenders (RFT), based on a more precisely defined specification, will issue to a restricted list of companies &mdash; those deemed successful in the first stage.  In addition, each of these companies will be requested to supply a test vehicle for technical evaluation and user testing.  I expect that a contract will be placed early in 1999.  The project team, already in place, will manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Requests for participation by the Defence Forces in international peacekeeping missions are considered on their merits by the Government on a case by case basis.  Where a decision is taken to respond to any such request the military unit concerned will be provided with the equipment necessary for the carrying out of its mission.  The Defence Forces are currently participating in a number of overseas missions involving a total of 750 personnel and troops serving on such missions are provided with adequate resources to carry out their tasks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the rate of progress of the implementation plan.  In the past three months, the third and final phase of a scheme of voluntary early retirement for personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces has been introduced, the report of the studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service has been published, the Defence <Col N="850" /> Act 1954 has been amended and the Government has approved the closure of a number of military barracks.</P>
    <P>The momentum for reform of the Defence Forces will continue both through the White Paper on Defence which will be completed next year and through the implementation plans to be drawn up shortly for reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 86 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 August 1998 my Department placed advertisements in the national newspapers for the <Col N="851" /> sale, by tender, of five small vessels which are surplus to Naval Service requirements.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 30 September 1998.</P>
    <P>One of the vessels, the <i>Brime</i>, was detained by the Naval Service in July 1993 and found to contain some two tonnes of cannabis resin.  In December 1995 the Circuit Court made an order of forfeiture in favour of the Minister for Defence.  Consideration was given to the question of refurbishing the vessel for use by the Naval Service.  When it was taken over it was found to have a number of major defects and an expert survey was commissioned by the Department to ascertain the likely nature and cost of repairs. The findings indicated that extensive repairs would be necessary to bring the vessel up to Naval Service requirements at a cost which was considered to be uneconomic.  Accordingly, a decision was taken on 1 October 1997, by the then Minister for Defence, to dispose of the vessel. Because of the need to clarify a number of legal issues in regard to ownership of the vessel it was not possible to finalise the sale arrangements before now.</P>
    <P>Another vessel for sale, the <i>Nancy Bet</i>, has been in use as a training vessel by the Southern Company, An Slua Muirí.  Over the past three years motor launches have been purchased for all companies of An Slua Muirí and there is no longer a requirement to retain the <i>Nancy Bet.</i> These motor launches have low maintenance costs and can be used in operational and training roles.</P>
    <P>The remaining vessels for sale, three liberty boats, are all serviceable and in working order. They are now surplus to Naval Service requirements having been removed from Naval Service ships to make room for extra Avon sea riders. The sea riders are rigid inflatable boats and are used primarily for boardings at sea and can also double as liberty boats.</P>

      <P>The Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) commissioned a study by consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche some time ago concerning the possible establishment of a joint Naval Service/CIT national maritime college to be located on a site owned by my Department adjacent to the Naval Base in Haulbowline.  The question of the provision of such a college is a matter for the Department of Education and Science in the first instance.  This proposal has most recently been considered along with a range of other issues by the Ministerial Task Force on Seafarer Training and Employment which was established in February of this year by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  The task force, which includes a representative from the Department of Education and Science, has submitted an interim report and is due to submit a final report shortly. My Department will consider whatever recommendations emerge from the work of the task force in so far as they might relate to the establishment of a national maritime college as proposed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>The role of the Defence Forces in the Border area is to aid the civil power, which, in practice, means to assist the Garda Síochána at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches.  Military personnel also assist the Garda Síochána in patrolling the road network around the Border area.  The patrols are equipped with radio and can be diverted quickly to the scene of a Border incident.  Stand-to parties are also kept in readiness at each post at all times. These are available to respond to requests for aid by the Garda and can be on their way to the scene of an incident without delay.  In addition an Air Corps helicopter which provides aerial support, assistance and reconnaissance is stationed in the Border area.</P>
      <P>Two bomb disposal teams (one at Finner Camp and one at Dundalk Barracks) and specialised search teams are also stationed in the Border area where they can provide a quick response in connection with bomb threats or the need for systematic searching of specific locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands on the Defence Forces in relation to Border duty depend on the nature of the requests for assistance received from the Garda <Col N="853" /> Síochána at any particular time.  Currently these requests include the provision of armed parties in aid to the civil power for the purpose of protecting Garda Síochána and the carrying out of such duties as vehicle checkpoints and mobile security patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal tasks.</P>

      <P>Irish military personnel, in common with all other citizens, have rights arising from our written Constitution. This constitutional jurisprudence has been applied increasingly in the military legal sphere in recent years.  Also, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is a civil court, has full appellate jurisdiction over the finding and sentence of any court-martial.</P>
      <P>Discipline in the Defence Forces is governed by the provisions of Part V, Defence Act, 1954, as amended and regulations and rules made thereunder.  Military law provides for the summary treatment of minor offences and for trial by court martial in relation to serious offences. Obedience to orders is an integral part of military life.  Therefore disobedience to orders is regarded as a serious offence.</P>
      <P>A court-martial is a court of law.  Its procedures are not unlike those followed in the civil courts. A person tried by court martial can be represented by an officer of the Defence Forces or by a civilian solicitor or barrister-at-law.  A right of appeal lies to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is composed of one Supreme Court Judge and two High Court Judges.  The appeal court has power to affirm or reverse the conviction in whole or in part and to remit, reduce or increase the sentence.  There is also provision for petitioning against sentence to the Adjutant-General of the Defence Forces and to the Minister for Defence.  It is considered that our court-martial system conforms with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court-martial system as operated currently.</P>

As part of the White Paper preparation process, an inter-departmental group has been set up to consider the defence and security environment.  This group comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from the Garda Síochána.

      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Cyprus and Lebanon during the period 20 to 27 September 1998.  The main purpose of my visit was to observe at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the visit, I met with the Chief of Mission and the Force Commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus.  I attended briefings by the Chief of Staff of the force and I met with the Cypriot Minister for Defence.  Most of my visit was spent in the Lebanon during which time I met with the Lebanese Defence Minister, the Lebanese Chief of the armed forces and the UNIFIL Force commander as well as other local representatives and dignitaries.  In all of the discussions that I had with these individuals, there was consistent praise for Irish troops and a desire that they should continue in service in South Lebanon.  I visited the Force mobile reserve which is located in Qana and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate.  I was greatly impressed by the commitment of all our troops in <Col N="857" /> the Middle East to the important work they are undertaking in the course of international peace.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>An extensive advertising campaign was launched earlier this year to enlist recruits to the Naval Service.  This included advertising in the national and local press, national and local radio and on Aertel.  Also an advertising package, incorporating a specially designed recruitment video, was circulated to every second level school in the country.  To date, this advertising campaign has proved successful as the Naval Service filled its original quota of 50 recruits without difficulty.</P>
      <P>The new recruitment campaign to attract a further 70 Naval Service recruits has been advertised on Aertel since last week.  It is also proposed to advertise on local radio when Naval Service vessels are in port inviting young people to come aboard and talk to serving personnel about careers in the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>The current number of members in Civil Defence is approximately 10,000.</P>
      <P>The activities undertaken by Civil Defence are based on the objectives set out in the &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; programme which is focused on community help and support.  In this regard, Civil Defence has evolved over the years into a skilled community support organisation which provides essential assistance to a wide range of primary emergency services, which include An Garda Síochána, fire, ambulance and search and rescue services as well as the Defence Forces.  In this regard, I propose to update existing legislation to enable Civil Defence to more fully fulfill its defined roles.</P>
      <P>Essential activities undertaken by Civil Defence include response to natural and environmental emergencies such as flooding and blizzards; search and rescue; river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; forest fire fighting; responding to radiological emergencies; stewarding at local and national events; responding in the event of requests for overseas assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Towards 2000 programme contains provisions <Col N="860" /> for the involvement of the organisation in major emergencies and a considerable part of training is geared towards this role.  The major emergency plan is the combined co-ordinated plans of the local authority, health board and gardai in the area where the emergency occurs. There is provision in the major emergency plan for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces both at local and national level.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to place on record my personal appreciation and respect, and that of the Government, for the level of commitment and expertise which the members of Civil Defence, who act in a voluntary capacity, provide to the community in times of essential need.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the scope of representation of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO and Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  Sub-committees of the conciliation council were established to review, in the context of the PCW, the question of pay and allowances payable to the ranks represented by the representative associations.  Discussions have been ongoing at subcommittee level and it is anticipated that they will be finalised shortly.  I can confirm that offers have been made to both associations for a range of increases which will amount to around 4 per cent of the payroll cost, in addition to the earlier increase of 3 per cent.  The combined increase falls within the parameters of the PCW.  While the final acceptance of the offers will depend on a ballot of members, I understand that the executive committee of both the associations are recommending acceptance.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources recently announced his intention to develop and identify the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) as a national coastguard service and that he intends to bring forward specific proposals in this regard later in the year.  I feel that the proposed new coastguard service will give greater public recognition to all personnel involved in marine emergency response.</P>
      <P>As regards liaison with the Naval Service, that service currently responds to calls for assistance from IMES in marine emergency situations.  The Naval Service is also represented on the marine emergency advisory group which comprises senior officers of the maritime and land based emergency services and also on the Irish marine search and rescue committee.  The latter is a standing consultative committee representing the providers and users of the search and rescue services. I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will give full consideration to any request received for Naval Service assistance in connection with the operation of the proposed new service.</P>

The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996.  These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place.  This review will be undertaken in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 115 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9 December 1997, at Kilworth firing range, an accident occurred during firing practices with a 60 mm light mortar.  During the exercise, which <Col N="864" /> was being conducted by Defence Forces personnel of the Southern Command, an explosion occurred in the vicinity of the gun.  Five personnel were injured in this accident which resulted in their hospitalisation.  Private Laura Guerin suffered serious injury which resulted in the loss of her left hand.  Corporals McGrath and Dolan and Private O'Hare suffered abrasions and were discharged from hospital on 10 December having been detained overnight.  Private Dinan had no physical injury but was also detained overnight in hospital for observation.</P>
    <P>A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident and I am advised that it has now completed its deliberations and has submitted its report to the convening officer.  The inquiry encompassed the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry.  The Deputies will appreciate that courts of inquiry of this nature are intensive and wide ranging and can take some considerable time to bring to completion.  Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing but live firing for training purposes has, however, ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations.</P>
    <P>Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during this exercise.  These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills.  The outcome of the board of inquiry will determine if any further actions need to be taken in the interests of safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the reply is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Discipline in the Defence Forces is governed by the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act 1954, as amended and regulations and rules made thereunder.  Military law provides for the summary treatment of minor offences and for trial by court martial in relation to serious offences.  Obedience to orders is an integral part of military life.  Therefore disobedience to orders is regarded as a serious offence.</P>
      <P>A court martial is a court of law.  Its procedures are not unlike those followed in the civil courts. A person tried by court martial can be represented by an officer of the Defence Forces, or by a civilian solicitor or barrister-at-law.  A right of appeal lies to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is composed of one Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges.  The Appeal Court has power to affirm or reverse the conviction in whole or in part and to remit, reduce or increase the sentence.  There is also provision for petitioning against sentence to the Adjutant-General of the Defence Forces and to the Minister for Defence.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court martial system as operated currently.</P>

      <P>The Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium is committed to ensuring that opportunities will be made available to women in the home to undertake training in order to return to work.  In this regard all mainstream/specific skills training courses run by FÁS are open to every person who is unemployed and seeking employment regardless of gender, though preference is given to people on the live register.</P>
      <P>The Community Employment &mdash; CE programme, however, is designed to specifically target a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e., those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means tested payments.  This targeting maximises the availability of places by part financing the programme for savings in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>FÁS has been endeavouring through its Action Programme for Women to increase the level of female participation on all FÁS programmes.  The focus of the agency's strategy has been to promote womens participation in the full range of specific skills training courses, the largest programme run by FÁS, by targeting places in non-traditional and new technology courses in which there has been little or no previous representation by women.</P>
      <P>A number of innovative and flexible approaches to training have been undertaken, including flexibility of hours of attendance and multi-media delivery of training.  Both the latter innovations are particularly suitable to the training needs of women in the home.  In 1997, 5,171 women completed Specific Skills training courses with FÁS.  This represented 44 per cent of the total number of people completing such training.</P>
      <P>FÁS also provides courses such as return to work and enterprise training which has a high proportion of women participants particularly home-makers.  In addition to the standard return to work course, FÁS has developed and implemented a pilot project which delivers return to work training and guidance services in a more flexible manner.  In 1997, 536 women of the 1,694 who participated in the return to work programme participated in this pilot project.</P>
      <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for child care facilities for women who return to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community-based childcare provision by way of support for CE projects.  Approximately 130 CE projects have such a childcare dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community-based childcare for women undertaking training or education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through its action programme, FÁS is developing on an ongoing basis more and better <Col N="867" /> ways of meeting women's training and employment needs and the fact that the number of women participating on FÁS training programmes as a percentage of total participation is increasing shows that its efforts are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and which includes representatives of the National Womens Council, INOU, ICTU, IBEC, IFA, FÁS and other relevant Departments including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is currently looking at the issue of womens access to labour market opportunities and is expected to report to the Government in early next year.  Its recommendations will contribute to ongoing policy development and strategy for the integration of women into all forms of training and employment.</P>
    <P>The question of entitlement to sign for credits or eligibility for payment of social welfare benefits would of course be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday, 29 September 1998, I announced the expansion of the Local Employment Service &mdash; LES &mdash; to the following seven partnership areas; Bray, Canal Communities, in Dublin city, Galway city, Monaghan, Southside &mdash; in Dún-Laoghaire-Rathdown, Tralee and Waterford city.  This expansion of the LES brings the service to 25 areas and is consistent with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to extend the LES to disadvantage areas over the lifetime of the programme.  I have been anxious to ensure that the expansion of the LES would take place in the context of the strengthening of our employment services generally in order that we provide a comprehensive, co-ordinated service for the unemployed and at the same time protect the taxpayer's investment.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department will shortly be contacting the relevant partnerships to discuss the start-up of the services in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>As you are aware, the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed upon the industrial development agencies the importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the regions.</P>
      <P>As a result, there has been a greater emphasis by the agencies &mdash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &mdash; on the regional development of industry, in particular, the dispersal of investment projects and Donegal is now a priority location for IDA Ireland.  IDA Ireland has introduced a number of significant measures to encourage new investment in Donegal, including the following: (a) increased grant levels for potential investors; (b) investment in land and buildings including (i) a new Business Park in Letterkenny, (ii) a new 25,000 sq.  ft.  building currently under construction in Letterkenny Business Park, (iii) a new advance office building planned for Letterkenny; (c) IDA is also working with existing companies to encourage expansions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the difficulties being experienced in County Donegal, I launched the Donegal Employment Initiative on 16 September 1998 on foot of the immediate risk of job losses at Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal.  This Initiative, which includes in its membership representatives of the relevant State development agencies, will also focus priority attention on Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creating investment.  The work of the group should prove a valuable stimulus in attracting additional industry and business to Donegal.  The task force model has proved effective in other situations, for example, in Clonmel, Tralee and north Mayo and I am hopeful that the endeavours <Col N="869" /> of the Donegal Employment Initiative will have similar positive results.</P>

I am seeking to progress, with ICI, a joint sale of IFI.  To this end, IBI Corporate Finance has been appointed to advise and assist the State in relation to the proposed sale.  It is my objective to seek a purchaser with a commitment to IFI as a fertilizer manufacturer and to safeguard IFI operations and employment in any sale.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been ongoing with ICI over recent weeks with a view to agreeing a joint approach to the sale process.  Subject to agreement being reached with ICI, an information memorandum will then be circulated to prospective purchasers, as a basis for obtaining indicative bids.  Subject to successful negotiations with a suitable purchaser, it is hoped that the sale process will have advanced considerably by early 1999.  The State guaranteed NET debt is currently £167.95 million.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the sale in 1992 of the B&amp;I Line rested with the then Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  Responsibility for international ferries was transferred to my Department in 1995 by virtue of the International Ferries (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order (S.  I. No. 41 of 1995).</P>
      <P>The records available to my Department indicate that at the time of the sale of the B&amp;I Line plc.  to Irish Continental Group plc.  the company had some 879 permanent employees.  ICG entered into extensive negotiations with the B&amp;I unions with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement on rationalisation and work practices prior to sale completion.  The rationalisation proposals effected resulted in 163 employee redundancies. The whole question of rationalisation was a matter for negotiations between the ICG and the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the sale the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B&amp;I group of unions fully acknowledged that the acquisition by ICG was in the best interests of B&amp;I, its employees and customers and that it would lead to the creation of an enlarged Irish-owned shipping enterprise with the resources to develop and provide an enhanced level of service to Irish tourism and export trade.  The company's investment of over £200 million in its ferries division since 1992 has <Col N="871" /> seen that expectation realised.  Also, since the acquisition by ICG several other business changes have taken place within the company including the integration of the B&amp;I Line and it is not therefore possible to compare numbers employed in 1992 with its successor entity.  Currently the company has 828 employees.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, the decision on upgrading any particular rail line is a day-to-day matter for Córas Iompair Éireann and Iarnród Éireann and one in which I have no direct responsibility.  However, in the context of developing proposals for inclusion in Ireland's application for Post-1999 EU funding, CIE has submitted to my Department a number of studies related to its bus and rail transport investment needs, including a review of mainline rail requirements. The mainline line rail review includes investment proposals for the upgrading of the Arklow to Rosslare line.</P>
      <P>These submissions are currently being considered by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance which has the lead role in the preparation of the overall application. That Department will also engage in a consultative process with the regional authorities and the social partners before finalising Ireland's application to the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann and Aer Rianta set up a working group to examine the feasibility of a rail connection from Dublin Airport to the mainline rail network.  The draft final report of this group was submitted to my Department in December, 1997.  It concluded against a rail link to the Dublin-Belfast line for operational and capacity reasons and instead proposed a diesel rail link to the Sligo line at a capital cost of £140 million The report also identified a number of matters which required further evaluation. One of the matters requiring further evaluation is the traffic inter-relationship between this rail link and the planned light rail line to the airport.</P>

      <P>Major recladding work on the facade of the Met Éireann headquarters building in Glasnevin was undertaken in 1993-94 and the opportunity was then taken to landscape the surrounding grounds.  Under the expert guidance of the Office of Public Works, surface mulch dressing was applied and specially selected shrubs were planted.  These shrubs are now at various stages of maturity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Met Éireann is very environmentally aware and is particularly conscious of the desirability of maintaining good relations with the local residents. <Col N="873" /> In this context, I am happy to state that very few complaints have been made to Met Éireann in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that some of the shrubs are overhanging the wall close to the public footpath and may possibly be a cause of complaint; these will be cut back immediately.  I would like to thank Deputy Ahern for bringing this matter to attention.  Following discussions with Met Éireann it has been agreed to devote even greater attention to the condition of the grounds.</P>

      <P>As I have said on many occasions in the past, I am anxious to ensure that genuine cases of hearing disability are compensated for as speedily as possible and that the most cost effective way of achieving this is by way of some form of out of court settlement procedure.  Following the judgment in the first Green Book test case in May last, Green <i>v</i> Minister for Defence, I announced that I was hopeful that I could bring proposals to Government for approval to establish a compensation mechanism outside the courts.  However, the outcome of a second test case in July, Hanley <i>v</i> Minister for Defence has brought huge cost implications to bear on this proposal.  I believe that these costs are beyond what the taxpayer is willing to bear.</P>
      <P>If a tribunal is to be effective, it would be necessary to make awards which are in line with awards made in court; there would continue to be costs associated with legal representation; and because nobody can forecast how many of the potential 150,000 current and former members of the Defence Forces would be likely to claim, it would be impossible to provide a reasoned cost projection of the establishment of a tribunal.  In effect, there is no guarantee that a tribunal would improve the current situation or accrue tangible savings, and the foregoing factors therefore combine to prohibit the serious consideration of the establishment of a tribunal at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to Supreme Court appeals, a number of claims on which High Court decisions were reached prior to the close of the Trinity term have been submitted for appeal to the Supreme Court. This includes the Hanley case referred to above.</P>

      <P>In October 1977, the Chief of Staff established a review board to conduct a special study of the Reserve Defence Force.  The board was given the following terms of reference: to examine the report on the following aspects of the Reserve <Col N="877" /> Defence Force; future role(s) and military capabilities; the assimilation of the first and second line Reserve and resultant consequences; organisational structures and command and control arrangements for: reserve units; reserve elements within PDF units; PDF support to units and elements of the Reserve; higher level elements at DFHQ and formation levels; the Defence Forces Training Centre &mdash; reserve functions and requirements; the advisability of having an Air Corps Reserve element; training policies including assimilation with PDF policies; equipment and infrastructure requirements for the next ten years; deployment arrangements down to subunit level; personnel issues including age profile and pay and conditions of service matters; projected expenditure profile of the Reserve Defence Force; administrative and financial control arrangements including amending or redrafting of relevant DFRs and/or the Defence Act; and an implementation framework for putting in place the recommendations of the board.</P>
      <P>The board, which is made up of ten army and one naval officer, is required to consult with a consultative group comprising commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the FCÁ and the Slua Muirí.  The board has met on some 40 occasions to date, and it will issue its final report before the end of l998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint steering group which I set up earlier <Col N="878" /> this year is tasked with overseeing and guiding the study of the Reserve Defence Force.  The membership of the group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving FCÁ officer.  No member of the military board is also a member of the steering group.  The group has held 14 meetings to date and group members have also attended at FCÁ and Slua Muirí exercises.</P>
    <P>Meetings of the steering group are attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who keep the group briefed on the board's progress.  The steering group has recently furnished me with a progress report and I am satisfied with the overall direction of the review thus far and with the interaction of the two groups.</P>

      <P>A limited number of infrastructural projects is at present being reviewed in the context of the public private partnership approach.  It will be recalled that the consultants' report on this matter in July 1998 recommended a pilot approach initially.</P>
      <P>No specific decisions have been taken as yet in this regard, though it will be recalled that the new midlands prison project and the peat fired power station for which contracts have been awarded this year would both be described as PPP contracts.</P>
      <P>In view of the complexity of the Dublin light rail project and the considerable range of possible PPP approaches to it, the Department of Public Enterprise decided to retain consultants to advise on the optimum approach aimed at securing best value for the State on a PPP basis.  Tenders are presently being evaluated by the Departments of Public Enterprise and Finance with a view to the early engagement of consultants for this specific aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>Following the introduction of free fees in publicly funded third level colleges, tax relief at the standard rate for fees paid for full-time courses in private colleges was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995.  The Finance Act, 1996 provided relief for fees paid for part-time third level education. In both cases the relief applies only to approved undergraduate courses in the State.  Relief is not available for courses abroad.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation the approval of colleges and courses is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science in accordance with codes of standards laid down by that Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  For the purposes of tax relief, the level of qualifying fee for each approved course is also set by the Minister for Education and Science with my consent.</P>
      <P>All of these measures are targeted to facilitate greater first-time access to third level education. As the Deputy will appreciate the introduction of these measures has meant the commitment of large scale resources to third level education in addition to the significant resources already committed to this sector.  I have no proposals at present to extend these schemes.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  It should also be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. <Col N="889" /> Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department has sought the views of health board chief executive officers as to how the commitment might be implemented and the implications, financial and otherwise of their proposals.  Their response is currently being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>Last March, a block grant allocation of £788,686 was notified to Mayo County Council under the 1998 rural water programme.  Taking into account a credit balance of some £1 million relating to allocations made in 1997, the total moneys available for spending on the rural water programme in County Mayo in 1998 amount to around £1.8 million, of which £1.54 million is earmarked for spending on group schemes.  No recoupment has been made this year to the county council in respect of expenditure on group water scheme grants.  However, a payment claim in the amount of £1.3 million was received in my Department on 29 September and is being examined.</P>
      <P>Under the devolved arrangements for the administration of the rural water programme, the prioritisation and approval of schemes is now a matter for Mayo County Council, subject to overall block grant allocation.

      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of local authority houses built and purchased, the numbers on local authority waiting lists and the number of lettings by authorities in the period 1970 to 1998 is, to the extent available, included in the Housing Statistics Bulletin for the years 1976 to 1998, copies <Col N="892" /> of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Information requested which is not included in the published statistics but is available in the Department will be compiled and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  Information on the number of applications for housing received but not yet processed by local authorities, and on the number of tenants who have applied to local authorities for transfer to other dwellings is not available in the Department.</P>
      <P>Projections of the kind referred to are not generally made by local authorities.  Authorities are, however, obliged by section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 to carry out assessments of housing need at least every three years and the next such assessment will take place in March 1999.  In relation to immediate requirements the Action Programme for the Millennium sets out the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  A programme of 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions has been notified to local authorities for 1998.  These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable some 10,000 house-holds to be catered for in 1998.  Improvements in the terms of the social housing schemes are expected to increase housing output from these measures.  I will seek increased resources for social housing in the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the authorities concerned to consider the setting up of a single housing list and the co-ordination of their housing programmes. There are extensive provisions within the local government and housing codes for joint action and co-operation by local authorities in relation to housing as well as other services.  The Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, recognised the need for a special co-ordination mechanism between the Dublin authorities in the discharge of their functions and responsibilities in the new situation.  Section 32 of the Act places a duty on the Dublin authorities, in formulating policies and in preparing and carrying out functional programmes, to have regard to and promote the metropolitan interest, that is, the overall interests of the combined administrative areas and their inhabitants.  The onus is on the corporation to develop as they see fit the various approaches to enable them meet their responsibilities in relation to new housing needs arising in their area and the provision of an overall better housing service to the public.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation is considering the co-ordination of its housing activities with those of the other Dublin local authorities.</P>

      <P>The preliminary report (P.  R.) for the North Dublin drainage scheme, which is to provide for major extensions to the drainage system in the north Dublin area, was approved by my Department in November, 1997.  Given the extent of the work involved, Dublin Corporation was requested to prepare contract documents initially for a number of key elements.  Following approval by my Department of a brief for the appointment of consultants in July last, the local authority is currently engaged in the process of appointing consultants to prepare contract documents for the following main elements: the north fringe interceptor sewer, which will cross the Santry valley from Ballymun and generally run along the Mayne river valley to Baldoyle; a connection from this sewer to the proposed Sutton pumping station, and (c) the northern interceptor sewer, which will run from Finglas and connect into the proposed north fringe interceptor sewer at Ballymun.</P>
      <P>In addition, the corporation was requested to prioritise the remaining elements of the preliminary report, and submit individual proposals for approval to my Department.  These proposals are awaited.  The corporation is looking at ways of fast-tracking key elements of the scheme.  I am fully aware of the importance of this scheme in opening up land for development and my Department will assist in progressing it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Details of the results, on a local authority basis, of the previous assessment carried out in March 1996, were published in my Department's annual Housing Statistics Bulletin for 1996, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  A statement showing the number of housing starts authorised for each local authority for 1998, including Carlow County Council and Carlow Urban District Council, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community by providing once-off funding for certain types of security equipment. Under the scheme grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tire, Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the assistance provided under the scheme.  Under the scheme once-off grants can be made towards the cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security equipment; and socially-monitored alarm systems. Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder-burglar alarms.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary equipment.  However the actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>The closing date for applications was 22 May and applications received before that date are currently being considered in the regional offices of my Department, who process applications under the scheme.  My Department expects to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decisions regarding their applications under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I have received a request for a meeting from the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  However as the proposed meeting related, in the main, to the possible funding of the organisation I have referred them to An Chomhairle Ealaíon which is the principal arts funding body and which enjoys statutory independence.  The Deputy will be aware that one of my key priorities for the arts, as identified in the Government's programme An Action Plan for the Millennium, is support for disabled artists and I was pleased to announce on 15 June 1998 the appointment to An Chomhairle Ealaíon of a person with particular knowledge of the issues relating to arts and disability.</P>
      <P>Arts and disability is one of the areas being specifically examined under the terms of reference of the review of the current arts plan which I have commissioned.  Arts and disability organisations, as well as other arts groups, have been invited to participate in the review process by making submissions to the consultants who are carrying out the review on my behalf.  It will also be of interest to the Deputy that the grant aid from my Department to the 39 arts facilities and venues, which are being developed throughout the country under the cultural development scheme, is conditional on each project being fully accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>A statement of the policy of An Chomhairle Ealaíon in relation to Arts and Disability and its decision in relation to the funding of projects and organisations in this area are set out in the publication Arts Council Revenue Funding Decisions 1998, a copy of which I am sending to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this year I introduced a new system of supports for individual high performance athletes, known as the international carding scheme. This scheme replaces the outstanding sportspersons grant scheme which operated from 1986 to 1997.  The international carding scheme represents a new innovation in the development of <Col N="906" /> high performance sport in Ireland.  An essential difference under the new system is that qualification as a card holder is based on strict performance criteria and rankings related to each sport. The new scheme has been developed in consultation with the national governing bodies of sport and the national coaching and training centre in Limerick.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, our most talented junior, emerging, and world class athletes will not alone be eligible to apply for much improved direct financial support, but will also have access, free of charge, to a specified network of sport science and medical services, a career planning and counselling service, and training facilities.  The objective of the new support system is to nurture and encourage emerging talent and turn world class potential into world class performances, thereby increasing our chances of winning medals.</P>
      <P>The new scheme has a budget of more than £1 million in 1998 which represents a significant increase in direct funding to the athletes in terms of financial support and services &mdash; in fact, double the amount allocated under the old Outstanding Sportspersons Grant Scheme in 1997.  The new carding scheme also compares very favourably with similar schemes in operation in other European countries.  I recently announced grants totalling over £925,000 in respect of 170 player-athletes who qualified under the 1998 international carding scheme.  I am pleased to say that included in this figure are awards to 24 player-athletes with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Athletes wishing to enquire about their eligibility for the new scheme are advised to contact their national governing body of sport who will provide all the necessary information.  It is intended that the national governing bodies of sport will be circulated with details of the 1999 scheme before the end of 1998.  I will arrange for full details of the international carding scheme to be supplied immediately to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The school in question, in common with the majority of schools in the scheme, already has the services of a home school community laision co-ordinator on a shared basis.  My capacity to allocate additional home-school community liaison co-ordinator posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated an additional 26 home school community liaison co-ordinator posts with effect from September 1998.  This brings the total number of posts currently in place to 133.  The co-ordinators in question cater for 225 national schools.  The needs of the school in question will be fully considered in the context of any future expansion of the home school community liaison scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  More than 37,000 students were covered by this initiative in 1996-7 at a cost to the Exchequer of some £77 million in 1997. Any extension of the initiative would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1996 <Col N="908" /> academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third level.  In this regard, the profile of part-time students considered by the steering committee on the future development of higher education, indicated that almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment. In this context I would point out that, under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, as amended by section 7 of the Finance Act, 1997, tax relief is available, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.  The course in question is included in the list of courses so approved.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that not all courses listed in the CAO handbook quality for free fees.  I understand the CAO handbook draws the attention of prospective applicants to the need to find out before applying whether the course they wish to apply for qualifies for free fees.  Only students in institutions which have been approved for the purposes of the free fees initiative and who meet the eligibility criteria qualify for free fees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the cases made by the schools in question for a remedial teacher service.  My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I recently allocated an additional 60 remedial teacher posts to <Col N="909" /> national schools with effect from September 1998. There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in the primary system.  I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The way in which funding is provided to voluntary secondary schools and schools managed by vocational education committees reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for these schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the two sectors is difficult. The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  The <i>per capita</i> rate currently is £177.  An additional capitation grant of £30 per pupil is paid to schools which have been designated as disadvantaged.  Secondary schools with enrolments in excess of 200 pupils are also eligible for assistance towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services subject to a maximum of £8,750 and £10,500, respectively.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      <P>A medical grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be sanctioned where a pupil is severely medically handicapped, <Col N="910" /> and cannot be accommodated on the ordinary network of school transport.  Current rates of payment are attached for the Deputy's information.  Where post-primary pupils attend a school outside of their own catchment area, there should be necessitous reasons for doing so, in order for grant-aid to be allowed.</P>
      <P>The transport liaison officer has advised my Department that the pupil to whom the Deputy refers is attending a post-primary school outside her own catchment area.  The pupil's nearest school is considered suitable for wheelchair users. Accordingly, her parents were asked on 2 September 1998, to confirm whether there are any necessitous reasons for their daughter attending another school outside her own catchment.  No reply has yet been received, but the matter will be re-examined in the light of the additional details now submitted by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 provides for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students who are attending private third level colleges. Such students or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate, on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed codes of standards and are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.  Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years and are followed in colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme or in colleges which satisfy the prescribed codes of standards.</P>
      <P>The codes of standards for the approval of colleges and courses were set down in May 1996 and colleges are required to apply to the national council for educational awards for confirmation that the codes of standards are satisfied in any particular case.  Both tax relief provisions came into effect from the 1996-97 tax year and the maximum level of qualifying fees is £2,500.  This figure was recommended by the working group appointed by the then Minister for Education to advise on the implementation of the tax relief provisions for private colleges.  This maximum figure is sufficiently high to meet the full fees of the vast majority of approved courses in private colleges. However, I will keep this issue under review.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is not available on fees paid for courses abroad and I have no proposal to extend these provisions to include courses pursued in the United Kingdom.  For the Euroair flight training school in Waterford to have its commercial flight training course considered eligible for tax relief, the college must apply to the NCEA for evaluation against the prescribed code of standards.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  I have honoured this commitment with the introduction of a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses <Col N="913" /> in the current academic year.  The grants will be means tested and the rates of grant, income limits, and other criteria for eligibility will be similar to those, which apply to the third level student support schemes.</P>
      <P>The introduction of these maintenance grants involves an expansion of existing administrative arrangements for the third level student support schemes.  Following discussions with the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA), it was agreed that the vocational education committees (VECs) would have responsibility for the administration of the new PLC grants scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the vast majority of PLC courses are provided in the VEC sector and the vocational education committees already have considerable expertise in the administration of some of the existing student support schemes.</P>
      <P>The procedure for assessment of and payment to students by the VEC will involve the processing of applications from all applicants in each VEC's own administrative area.  Each VEC will then be required to make payments to eligible students attending PLC courses in its own administrative area.  The maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses was issued to the vocational education committees on 28 August 1998.  The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday, 16 October.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's long standing policy in the matter of conducting repeat classes and promoting pupils has been clearly set out in three circulars, the earliest of which dates back to 1967. There has been no change to this policy.  This policy specifies that the primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course which provides for an infant programme of two years followed by six years in standards from first to sixth.  The syllabus for each component of the curriculum is designed to give the greatest possible degree of flexibility in selecting programmes best suited to the individual needs of individual pupils and schools.  Accordingly, pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each school year.  In this way, pupils who have completed sixth standard at the minimum age of 12 years should transfer to post primary education and have the opportunity to complete three years of post primary education before reaching the minimum school leaving age.</P>
      <P>Since the retention of pupils is a serious intervention in a child's educational progress, the managerial authorities of schools should examine and exploit the deployment of staff resources, the use of more flexible class management and teaching methodologies and the involvement of parental and home supports before considering retention as an option.  This policy applies to all pupils and to all schools.</P>

      <P>The application from the group in question was one of a large number of applications received from consortia seeking inclusion in the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative.  All applications were examined in detail by a selection committee comprised of departmental and non-departmental personnel who have expertise in this area.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 project areas were selected for support.  Unfortunately, the group to which the Deputy refers was not successful on this occasion. All applicants were advised of the outcome of the selection process in August 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that I am very much aware of the need to extend the existing escort scheme on special school transport services.  I am currently giving active consideration to possible measures in this regard.</P>
      <P>The present pilot phase of the escort scheme is focused on facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools for children with physical disabilities, and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus or train at weekends.  The specific difficulty raised by Deputy Kenny has not previously been brought to my Department's attention.  I am arranging to have this matter investigated by my officials as a matter of urgency.</P>
