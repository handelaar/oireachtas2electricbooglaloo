      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member.  Yesterday, on the question &ldquo;That Deputy Ring be suspended from the service of the Dáil&rdquo;, a division was claimed and, in accordance with Standing Order 61, that division must take place now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. On the Order of Business recently the Minister for Health and Children said that he had not published the waiting lists report which is relevant to the Estimates in that it deals with the reasons for the agony of many patients on waiting lists because it had not been agreed by the Government.  The Government could have approved its publication when it met yesterday if that was an accurate statement by the Minister for Health and Children.  We should not agree to conclude the debate on the Estimates, of which the Health Vote is an important part, without first knowing that the report will be published and all the details made known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it reasonable to ask us to conclude the debate on the Estimates without having this vital information which was collected at public expense and which the Minister has been using time and again as an excuse for why things have not been done?  The Minister is reported in the newspapers this morning as being &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; about not publishing the report.  If the Taoiseach were in Opposition, would he want the debate on the Estimates to be terminated without the report being available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reports before the Government or in various Departments which would justify an increase in expenditure and which indicate how things can be done differently and the need for new agencies, not all of which were discussed before the Book of Estimates was published.  The Book of Estimates is the Government's presentation of the moneys it has agreed to spend under the various subheads in 1999.  The Minister for Health and Children uses various reports in his presentation to achieve the maximum amount for his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on waiting lists will not be altered by the Government.  We cannot have a meaningful debate on the Supplementary Estimate, let alone the Book of Estimates for next year, without the information which informed the Government's decision in the allocation of resources.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the report will be published before next Tuesday to facilitate a more meaningful debate on the Supplementary Estimate?  That is a <Col N="550" /> reasonable request and the Taoiseach should not refuse it.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, I understand from newspaper reports today that the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach will announce the list of cross-Border bodies it is proposed to establish under the British-Irish Agreement.  Since that decision, which we welcome, has clearly been made, although we do not know its contents, will the Taoiseach indicate what legislative changes, if any, will be required to give effect to these cross-Border bodies when established?  Have they been factored into the legislative programme on the British-Irish Agreement in general?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation will be required to implement these bodies through which we will have to work.  The discussions are not yet complete and it would be wrong to say the bodies have been agreed on.  Even if they are signed off by the British Prime Minister and me, it is, under the terms of the Agreement, a matter for Strand Two and for the parties.  That process must take place.  I emphasise I cannot sign off on those bodies without that process, which is an important factor in the Agreement.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday on the Order of Business whether a referendum was planned on the allocation of powers to the proposed two regions which the Government is seeking to establish.  He undertook to look at the matter and find out if such a referendum was planned.  Has he clarified the matter yet?  In light of the statistics he published yesterday in answer to Deputy Quinn as regards the figures on the counties, will he withdraw the proposal made to Brussels dividing this country into two clearly artificial regions and seek to plan the development of the country on the basis of the real wealth and poverty which exists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <P>Since the budget will be introduced next week, when may we expect to see the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill?  In the context of the budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, will the Taoiseach bear in mind the warnings from his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, that under this Government the gap between rich and poor is widening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>Next year will be a very important one in terms of the entire local development programme and the efforts being made, by the private and public sectors alike, in trying to tackle, in a partnership manner through an area-based approach, the many and varied problems that are the legacy of long-term unemployment, and the ever-escalating social problems in particular areas, especially in certain urban areas.  It will be the final year for the first EU Structural Funds-supported Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, responsibility for which rests with my Department. <Col N="557" /> Within this responsibility falls the obligation on my Department to provide the Exchequer co-financing element of sub-programme 2 of the operational programme.  The full title of sub-programme 2 is &ldquo;Integrated Development of Designated Disadvantaged and Other Areas.&rdquo; It is under this sub-programme that area development management, ADM as it is better known, the partnership companies and the ADM community groups are funded.  Within the 1999 Estimates a sum of £6.85 million has been provided for sub-programme 2 activities which attract 75 per cent assistance from the Structural Funds, sourced from both the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund in almost equal parts.  The Exchequer co-financing rate for sub-programme 2 is 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>It has been my pleasure over the past 18 months as Minister of State with special responsibility for local development to have been given the chance to work with so many people who are responding so creatively, imaginatively and energetically to overcome the challenges which these problems present.</P>
      <P>Being based in Tallaght, I was very familiar with the work of the Tallaght Partnership, one of the 12 original partnership companies set up in 1991 under the PESP.  However, it is broadly accepted that it was not until 1997 that the bulk of the partnership companies and community groups began to make a difference.  It was in the same period that we saw the drugs task forces growing in strength and targeting their actions to those with the greatest need.</P>
      <P>The partnership and area-based approach to local development is also being used to address the problems stemming from drug misuse.  A core element of Government policy on social inclusion is the national drugs initiative.  As part of the national drugs strategy, local drugs task forces were established in the 13 areas identified as having the worst levels of drug abuse.  Of these, 12 areas are in greater Dublin, where the heroin problem is particularly acute, while the other is in north Cork city.  The task forces, which comprised a partnership between the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, were set up to develop an integrated, locally based solution to the drug problem.</P>
      <P>Each task force was mandated to prepare an action plan for its area, to include a range of measures in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing supply. The plans, which were submitted to the national drugs strategy for assessment last year, focused on the development of community-based initiatives to link in with and add value to the programmes and services already being delivered or planned by the statutory agencies for the target areas.  The Government allocated £10 million to support the implementation of these plans and over 220 separate projects are now being supported under that initiative.  A further allocation of £10 million is included in the 1999 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> In addition, the national drugs strategy team, which was set up to ensure the effective co-ordination of the national drugs strategy and to oversee the implementation of the strategy, mirrored the partnership approach adopted in the task forces, comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments and agencies along with representatives from the voluntary and community sectors.</P>
    <P>A recent external evaluation of the initiative has found that the strategy has succeeded in harnessing the commitment of local communities and focusing the resources of the State in a more co-ordinated and strategic way and that this will ultimately result in a more effective and sustainable response to the problem of drug misuse.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, has approved the continuation of the drugs task forces, as recommended in the evaluation, subject to an evaluation framework for the process being put in place which would include clear statements of the overall aim of the initiative, the specific objectives arising from this aim and the specific targets arising from these objectives, quantifiable where possible and with appropriate macro level monitoring arrangements to allow performance against stated objectives and targets to be measured.  The findings of the external evaluation will inform an overall review of the national drugs strategy, which will be undertaken early in the new year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of treatment and rehabilitation services, the Government is committed to focusing on the development of preventive measures as part of its overall drugs strategy. A long-term solution to the drug problem must have at its core a strategy of prevention.  The purpose of the young people's facilities and services fund, established by the Government earlier this year, is to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of £30 million has been set aside over the next three years for this purpose, with £20 million of this amount being targeted at the local drugs task force areas, where development groups were set up in each of the 13 areas to develop locally integrated facility and service plans.  These plans have recently been submitted for evaluation by an assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  It is anticipated that the Government will take decisions in relation to funding for their implementation, on the basis of recommendations from the assessment committee, at a very early date.</P>
    <P>The remaining £10 million of the fund has been allocated to support strategies and projects aimed <Col N="559" /> at young people and children at risk, including those at risk of drug misuse, in areas outside the task force areas.  Up to £7.2 million has been allocated to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey's, programme for children at risk, to support a range of pilot projects for children and young people at risk in disadvantaged areas in Dublin and around the country.  Most of the remaining funding is being targeted initially at the major urban areas of Galway, Limerick, south Cork city and Waterford.  The relevant vocational education committees are taking the lead in preparing strategies, that meet the objectives of the fund in consultation with voluntary and community groups and other State initiatives in the areas.  In addition, voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit, which have the capacity to deliver targeted education and prevention initiatives on a global basis, were asked to submit proposed initiatives to the assessment committee by the end of October last.  Some £0.5 million has been allocated for such initiatives and a Government decision in relation to their funding is imminent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the progress of partnerships and community groups, it is appropriate to highlight some of their achievements to date.  Already most of the numerical targets set out in the operational programme have been achieved and, while the revised targets for the last year of the programme are being finalised at present, the number of people being assisted by partnerships etc. continues to increase.  For example, in the first six months of 1998 3,800 unemployed people have set up their own business with partnership and community group assistance.  Some 90 per cent of these were people who were unemployed for more than one year.  The cumulative figure to the end of 1997 was 7,800.  In the same period, some 2,280 unemployed people have been placed directly in employment.  The figure for all 1997 was 4,389, which was double the previous year's figure.  Two thirds of these people were unemployed for more than one year.  In the period from September 1997 to June 1998 over 9,500 children and over 1,800 adults were involved in preventive education activities.  The figure for 1997 was 11,000 schoolchildren over 12 months &mdash; almost three times the 1996 figure.  In the first six months of 1998, 2,401 adults on low incomes have participated in partnership funded education and training courses.  A further 4,287 were referred to training courses funded by other agencies such as FÁS and CERT.  Over the full 12 months of 1997, some 4,812 adults benefited from complementary education projects &mdash; more than double the 1996 figure.</P>
    <P>In terms of actual expenditure, by the end of June 1998 partnerships had drawn down £49.6 million, or 59 per cent, of the total of £83.7 million that has been committed to them by ADM over the life of the programme.  Community groups have drawn down £7.8 million, or 46 per <Col N="560" /> cent, of the £16.8 million which has been allocated to them.</P>
    <P>Between 1994 and 1996, the total sub-programme two expenditure amounted to £18.2 million, £10 million of it in 1996.  In 1997 alone, it was £23.8 million.  This year's expenditure by ADM is in line with the forecast of £29 million and the projection for 1999 is £36 million, which brings to £107 million the total estimated expenditure under sub-programme two of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>As we face into the final year of the programme, I have no doubt that the work of the partnerships and community groups will continue to make a significant difference to the lives of the people who have already been in touch with them.  However, I know they are not content to work just with existing clients &mdash; they continue to reach out to include more and more people, for whom there were few lifelines in the past.</P>
    <P>At central Government level, our task is to ensure that there is an agreed strategy and appropriate structures in place to continue the partnership and area based approach to addressing the needs of people living in the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the integrated services project. The State, under successive Administrations, has devoted significant time and resources to tackling the problems associated with pockets of acute deprivation in urban areas.  A great deal of good work has been done, and is being done, in those areas by organisations from the State funded sector.  Their front line staff work with great dedication.</P>
    <P>Each of the organisations operating in these areas pursues its own brief, and that is part of the problem.  There is often no overarching vision. Sustained, structured dialogue between the different organisations is lacking.  To be honest, there has not been a great tradition of consultation and co-ordination between organisations in the State-funded sector.  The Government feels this has been a factor inhibiting the effectiveness of the State's collective endeavour in deprived urban areas over the years.  The Government also feels it is time for this to change.</P>
    <P>To that end, the Government launched, under the auspices of the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, a pilot project, known as the integrated services project.  The first phase of that project was a research phase which involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &mdash; Dublin's north-east inner city; the canal communities of Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House and Dolphin House; Jobstown in Tallaght; and Togher in Cork.</P>
    <P>Following that work, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion has decided to proceed with the implementation phase of the project.  This will be launched at a special meeting of Secretaries General of relevant Departments and chief executive <Col N="561" /> officers of relevant agencies which will be convened by the Taoiseach in December.</P>
    <P>From an Estimates perspective, it is important to bear in mind that the integrated services project is a pilot project focused on the process of delivery of State funded services in these four target areas.  The ultimate aim of the project is develop models to secure more effective use of the State's resources in deprived urban areas and, thereby, improve the overall quality of life of the communities in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The literary award for confusion and, to borrow from Deputy Rabbitte, obfuscation should go to the Book of Estimates.  It costs £9 but without detailed explanatory notes it is more confusing than entertaining or informative. The Department of Finance should follow the example of some of the smaller local authorities which include with their books of estimates a full explanatory memorandum of the various items detailed in the accounts.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to get to grips with debating the Estimates without an explanatory note.  It is only press releases &mdash; and those of some Ministers are more detailed than others &mdash; which allow us to get any grip on the matter.  This happens every year &mdash; all Governments have been consistently wrong in this regard.  Future Books of Estimates should include very detailed explanatory notes so that they can be properly debated.</P>
      <P>The fact that there is a 26.6 per cent increase in capital spending to £2.2 billion makes it easy for Members on this side of the House to speak about it.  Our strong economic growth has put pressure on our infrastructure and has shown up the need to dramatically improve our ability to continue that growth, not only in 1999 and 2000 but for ten and 20 years into the future.  There is a particular need for investment in roads, transport and communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the decisions on infrastructural development require approval from Europe.  I am concerned by the slowness with which Europe acts in these matters.  I am particularly concerned about the delay in getting a decision from Europe on whether double rent allowances will continue under the new integrated area plans.  In Dublin South-Central, Dublin Corporation has submitted a detailed plan for the area from the quays through Thomas Street and James's Street up to the Coombe in Cork Street and taking into account the flat complexes at Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens.  European delay in the decision making process is not acceptable to the residents and other interested persons in this south-west inner city area.  It is not easy to hold a protest in Brussels against the tardiness of the Commission.  If these types of delays are set to continue in the future, then the commitment of people in Dublin South-Central to the future integration of Europe will be difficult to maintain.  Europe must respond in a timely manner to the needs and requirements of the <Col N="562" /> ordinary people of areas such as Dublin South-Central if Europe, as an entity, is to succeed. Many people in groups such as SWICN &mdash; the south-west inner city network &mdash; task forces of flat complexes and community partnerships have invested a great deal of time and effort in developing the integrated area plan in partnership with Dublin Corporation.  Delays in reaching a decision are not appreciated.  I would urge all Ministers to articulate the general dissatisfaction with the slowness of European bureaucracy in their dealings with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether by limiting net current spending growth to 4 per cent we are being fair to the large number of people who are not sharing in the benefits of our booming economy to the same extent as those who are in well-paid employment.  The principal reason advanced for keeping the increase in current expenditure to this level is the retention of competitiveness in the global economy.  A recent report in a Sunday newspaper stated that in Ireland less than 4 per cent of exported manufactured goods come from labour intensive industry, as against 30 per cent in Portugal and 24 per cent in Greece.  More than half of our exports come from research and development-based manufacture.  Both of these statistics point to the fact that the competitiveness of our products is less affected by wage rates and more by technological developments, efficiencies and brain power.  There are exceptions of course, such as Packard Electric in Tallaght and Fruit of the Loom in Donegal.  The well educated, high earning baby boomers of the early 1970s are evidence of the correctness of the path we are taking. Surely we can afford not to allow the gap between rich and poor to widen.  We should look after our senior citizens, carers, widows, low paid workers and those who are socially and educationally disadvantaged to the maximum possible extent.  In this context, I believe we should look closely at the sacredness of the 4 per cent cap on net current spending increase.  These are times of rapid change and what was right in 1987 and even two years ago when the programme for Government was in gestation may not be appropriate for 1999.</P>
    <P>The most important change in the funding of the social insurance fund is that there will be a surplus of income from contributions over expenditure, estimated at £38 million, in 1999.  This is an improvement of £96 million over last year and is mainly due to the improvement in economic circumstances which has resulted in a lower number of persons drawing unemployment payments than in previous years.  The Estimate includes an increase of 26 per cent in FIS from £30.1 million in 1998 to £37.8 million in 1999.  I welcome that increase which has occurred as a result of the increase of the income limit from gross to net of tax and PRSI.  The carer's allowance is increasing by 14 per cent from £45 million to £52 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>I want to make a particular case for families, married women and married mothers.  I hope that <Col N="563" /> when increases are being decided, the rate for the additional adult or adult dependant will be at least 60 per cent this year.  Many wives and mothers were unhappy with last year's increase which was only 40 per cent of full rate.  I would also urge that the child allowance be increased to the same amount for married and unmarried mothers.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the position of wife and mother in a family setting is protected in the forthcoming budget.  It is time there were positive incentives for couples to marry and raise children in a secure family environment. There are currently definite incentives for young people to have children outside of a family situation.  For society's sake, some changes must be made in favour of the family.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Taoiseach stated at the Árd Fheis on Saturday night last that he intends to throw a big party at the end of 1999 as part of the millennium celebrations.  A sum of £14.9 million has been set aside for such celebrations in the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is appropriate that the entire country shares in and celebrates our current success.  I know many groups in Crumlin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown and the south-west inner city will apply for some of these funds.  I hope we will be able to maintain our current pace to reach the year 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scarcely a Deputy in the House who would not like to change places with the Minister for Finance given the embarrassment of riches which forms the background to this year's Book of Estimates.  His performance must be assessed in terms of the choices he has made given the unprecedented bounty he has inherited as a result of prudent management by the previous Government.  For example, his performance must be measured in terms of what inputs he has made to improve the quality of essential services such as health, education and transport.  His performance must also be measured against the postures he adopted as the Scrooge of the Opposition, never missing an opportunity to engage in flowery rhetoric about the supposed profligacy of the rainbow Government. In fairness to the Minister, these postures are consistent with the stance he adopted during the wilderness years when, as a backbencher, he saw himself as a fiscally rectitudinous John the Baptist.  The truth is that the Minister fares badly under both these assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, let us examine the record in the context of the Minister's own view of himself as the keeper of the nation's fiscal conscience.  Last year in his first Book of Estimates, he contrived to artificially boost the outturn for 1997 in order to allow him to feign adherence to his own spending ceiling of 4 per cent for 1998.  The more the Minister added back to 1997, the more leeway he gave himself for 1998.  He added back in excess of £400 million spending into 1997 which, if it had conformed to standard accountancy procedures, would have properly been included in 1998.  This was the <Col N="564" /> first sign that, instead of a chartered accountant, we had a consummate conjurer as Minister for Finance.  He artificially inflated the 1997 spending outturn for his predecessor, Deputy Quinn, and constructed the foundation which forms the baseline for the current Book of Estimates.  The Minister's manipulations had converted an estimated outturn for 1997 of 6.3 per cent to a notional outcome of 9.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last year that one casualty of the Minister's manipulation was the omission of the detailed medium-term financial strategy, MTFS, planned by the rainbow Government.  In the event, the Minister responded on budget day by appending his MTFS to his budget statement.  It is salutary to compare the figures published in that medium term financial strategy on 3 December 1997 with the Book of Estimates published 11 months later.  I refer in particular to table 4(a) in respect of the non-capital supply services projected for 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister forecast a figure of £11.502 billion for 1999.  In fact, in this year's Book of Estimates, the Minister provides an NCSS figure for 1999 of £11.940 billion.  This is a whopping difference of £438 million.  In his MTFS forecasts for the year 2000, the Minister projected a figure of £11.921 billion &mdash; a figure which has already been exceeded in 1999.  What does this mean in practice? Are there more nurses on hospital wards or more teachers in classrooms?</P>
    <P>This Minister, with his reputation for tough talking, fares no better when we consider the capital side.  In his medium-term financial strategy, the Minister projected a public capital programme of £1,908 million for 1999.  The figure in the Book of Estimates is £2,216 million.  Indeed his MTFS statement was somewhat odd as it forecast a public capital programme of £1,946 million for 1998, falling to £1,908 million in 1999 and to £1,845 in 2000.  So much for the decade of investment. I welcome the change in direction and would like to know if a revised medium-term financial strategy will be appended to this year's Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister's excellent advisers may draw his attention to the fact that the public capital programme figure in the Book of Estimates is not £2,260 million but £2,175 million which is still a long way from the projected £1,908 million.  The difference is made up by the £41 million provided for non-programme outlays or NPOs.  I enthusiastically agree with Deputy Ardagh's comments about the absence of annotation in the Book of Estimates.  It is interesting to hear Deputy Ardagh, an accountant, explain to the House how difficult he finds it to get a grip on the Book of Estimates. It is extremely difficult &mdash; this is not a politically partisan point.  It is necessary to go through quite an amount of turgid undergrowth to find what NPOs in this case refers to and what NPOs are in the first place.  NPOs are described in the note as &ldquo;capital expenditures, either voted or non-voted, which do not create a physical asset&rdquo;.  This is interesting for two reasons, first <Col N="565" /> because of the astounding figure of £41 million provided for merchant bankers, stockbrokers and lawyers in privatising Telecom Éireann.  Over £40 million is being provided for consultants and others to bring Telecom Éireann to the market. The figure is almost beyond belief.</P>
    <P>The figure is interesting for a second reason. Although NPOs, according to the Book of Estimates, &ldquo;do not create a physical asset&rdquo; and do not create a single job, the Minister has no compunction in adding back in the £41 million in the page entitled &ldquo;summary public capital programme&rdquo; to bring the figure back up to £2,216 million, thereby permitting Deputy Ardagh and other backbenchers to proclaim that the increase in capital spending is 26.6 per cent.  Using large capitals, the Minister did the same in his press release which was headed &ldquo;Government increase capital spending by 26.6 per cent&rdquo;.  According to the Minister's press release &ldquo;the total allocation for voted capital is to increase by 26.6 per cent over 1998, bringing total spending to £2, 216 million&rdquo;. Of course the Minister is aware that it does not quite do this at all.  It is, however, the kind of smoke and mirrors presentation for which the Minister for Finance has a weakness.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Environment Vote to underpin the point.  I refer Members to the following paragraph from the Minister's official press release of 11 November on publication of the Book of Estimates.  Deputy Ardagh found the statement helpful, which it is in comparison to the Book of Estimates, but on reading it I wonder if even the Chair, despite his long years of experience in the House, knows what it means.  The statement said:</P>
    <P>With effect from January 1999, a Local Government Fund will be established to fund both the non-national roads programme and to make a contribution to the general costs of running local authorities.  The Fund will have two sources of income, receipts from motor taxation and a contribution from the Environment and Local Government Vote.  £270 million is provided in the Estimates for the Fund.</P>
    <P>So far so good, but the following is the tester for the Chair:</P>
    <P>Current spending on non-national roads is now provided for in the 1998 Environment Vote.  Adjusting for this, the net increase in current spending in 1999 is £224 million.  In order then to compare 1999 and 1998 properly, the funds must be removed from the 1999 figures for the voted current expenditure.  £178 million capital is included in the 1998 Environment Vote which the Local Government Fund will finance in 1999.  For a proper comparison of 1998 and 1999, that amount must be removed from the 1998 figures.</P>
    <P>This is what the statement said &mdash; I am not making it up.  One can talk about obfuscation, but this is the most incredible gobbledegook, which of course has a purpose.  It is high quality smoke and <Col N="566" /> mirrors, with the Minister conjuring a number of different balls in the air at the same time, the purpose of which is to simultaneously enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to claim a big increase in the Department's spend while the Minister for Finance proclaims he is living within the 4 per cent limit.  This is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister is adroitly presenting a number of deliberately confusing different factors.  First, the proposed new local government fund will be funded from two distinctly different sources, partly through voted public expenditure in the Vote for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and partly through taxation levied in the form of motor tax.  In all, £270 million will go into the new fund.  The £46 million going towards potholes is regarded as current expenditure.  This leaves £224 million, of which £178 million is capital spending.  Therefore, for one purpose the Minister, in order not to make the 1998 outturn look bad, subtracts £224 million and for another purpose, namely, presentation of this year's Book of Estimates, subtracts £178 million as it is capital spending.  One wonders whether this is the way to do business.  Deputy Ardagh is kind in describing it as obfuscation.</P>
    <P>In this fungible pot the Government is in a win-win presentational scam.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is portrayed as a big spender while the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is seen as living within his self-imposed limits.  It is quite extraordinary that the excellent high quality civil servants in the Department of Finance permit the Minister to put out statements saying he is living within the 4 per cent.  They, I and the House know that is not even remotely near the actual truth.  I know that by manipulating figures one can produce any result.  It is a nonsense which is merely designed to produce window dressing in order to convey a particular political expedient. No Minister for Finance has done this so blatantly.</P>
    <P>The man who threatened on taking office to pay back part of the national debt has ended up spending the significant savings which have accrued from servicing the national debt due to falling interest rates and other matters.  The Minister has now revived his threat to devote a considerable amount of his surplus to paying back some of the principal of the national debt.  It is a silly threat coming from a Minister who increasingly resembles a drunken man looking for somebody to hold his jacket while he prepares to fight. I think and hope he does not mean it.  This is not only my view.  The chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, Dr. Michael Somers, told the Committee of Public Accounts on 16 July in response to a question I put to him that:</P>
    <P>some people would say it should pay off a portion of the National Debt.  This is certainly a laudable thing to do.  Others might suggest it go into the small savings reserve, while others <Col N="567" /> would claim a national pensions fund should be set up.  My own hobby horse would be to put more money into infrastructure because I feel the infrastructure in this country has fallen way behind in recent years.</P>
    <P>This comment was made by the head of the agency charged with managing the national debt and whose record in discharging these responsibilities is praised on all sides of the House.  Given customary diplomatic speak it is a firm conclusion.  The Department of Finance agrees with it.  The Minister's housekeeping homilies are inappropriate.  It may make sense in an over-indebted family context to retire some of the debt if the bread earner or another member of the family wins the lottery but running a household is an inappropriate metaphor for running a country.  This is all the more blatantly obvious given the reduction of the Government debt as a percentage of GDP to 63 per cent in 1997, from 103 per cent in 1989.  It is projected to fall to 56 per cent by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Our poor infrastructure in so many areas is now a barrier to maintaining healthy economic growth rates.  This ought to be the Minister's focus, not feigning a reversion to his old Thatcherite postures.  Highly skilled emigrants are not returning to keep the Celtic tiger on course because they cannot afford to buy houses here. The lengthening queues for access to health care are reminiscent of what happened when Mr. Haughey admitted he had grown out of touch. Primary education and, in particular, programmes such as Breaking The Cycle and pre-school supports in disadvantaged communities are crying out for resources.  The Government cannot get its act together after a political battle to spend the small amount of money allocated to combating demand for drugs.  The gap between the beneficiaries of his halving of capital gains tax and the long-term unemployed is widening.  There is an urgent, moral, imperative for a massive transfer of resources to the huge urban blackspots where unemployment and deprivation are clustered. This should include provision for investment in training to enable people caught in the no-skills trap to get their feet on the first rung of the employment ladder.  Instead, the Minister has reduced the allocation for training by 3 per cent. Meanwhile he has increased the allocation for the local employment service from just under £11 million to £14 million.  To date the local employment service has primarily functioned as a placement service.  How can the long-term unemployed be placed in employment while cutting investment in training and essential counselling?  In addition, the Minister has cut the allocation to the jobstart programme by 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are two other items in the Book of Estimates to which I wish to refer.  The latest configuration of State agencies, as manifest in the new Enterprise Ireland, is planned to need £55.4 million to administer £52.5 million in aids to <Col N="568" /> industry.  I appreciate there may be excellent arguments for every penny spent by the old Córas Tráchtála but it is difficult to understand how any agency needs £55 million in administration costs to administer £52 million in aids to industry.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the slashing of funding for the registration and tagging of cattle from £4 million to £1.9 million in the context of the worsening brucellosis crisis.  On housing, the Government has taken issue with a leading economist who has asserted that the Minister's Estimate will allow 200 extra houses.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has countered to say that 600 will be provided. Whatever the truth the allocation will make no appreciable impact on the ever lengthening housing list which now totals 45,000.</P>
    <P>Far from living within the 4 per cent ceiling, when taken together with budget day spend the outturn will be more than twice that figure. Meanwhile the taxpayer is paying more for what are, in critical areas, inferior services.  There is no planned approach to badly needed investment in infrastructure.  There is no assault on the worsening housing crisis.  The Minister's approach to public pay rests entirely on aspiration and, most seriously of all, at a time of unprecedented economic boom there is no overall planned assault on poverty.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Rabbitte has been very amusing.  He had to look very carefully at the Estimates to find any fault.  On training funds for the unemployed, he neglected to say that the allocation for FÁS training for the unemployed has increased by 53 per cent in the Estimates.  He also said running a household is not a suitable analogy when talking about running a country.  I disagree with that.  Every man and woman running a household knows exactly how careful one has to be with money.  If Deputy Rabbitte looked more closely at how everyone has to live, particularly farmers in the west, it would be far better.  I am delighted he commented on the farming community, even if it was in relation to tagging cattle to try to eradicate brucellosis.  I have no doubt that will be good news for the farmers throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on the job he has done in preparing the Estimates and on living within the limits he set himself last year of 4 per cent for current spending and also the 1999 average increase of 3.9 per cent, which the Minister has set himself for this year.  It is good news for the country that he has managed to succeed with his objective and I have no doubt 1999 will be equally successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased an increase in capital spending of 27 per cent is forecast for 1999.  The proof of any good policy is in the evidence and certainly it is <Col N="569" /> in employment which has increased in the past two years by 4 per cent.  We have had an extra 100,000 jobs in the past two years and we have reduced out unemployment figures to below the European average.  The most important thing a person can have for self esteem and economic and social benefit is a job.  This Government has proved successful in the way in which it has managed our economy and in the prudent budget strategy adopted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  This is particularly important given that we will join the EMU in the next six weeks.  For that reason it is important to maintain our price stability so that we can maintain our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Economic success does not happen by accident and it certainly has not happened by accident here.  I further compliment the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on the sound budgetary policy he has adopted during the past two years.  It is a prudent fiscal policy that has allowed a reduction in taxation and an increase in spending on many important social programmes such as health and education which we currently enjoy.</P>
    <P>In 1999, the main aims in the Estimates are to limit current spending to 4 per cent.  Capital expenditure will increase by 27 per cent.  When speaking here a few days ago the Minister said that to maintain our economic growth we must improve our infrastructure.  This is important, particularly in the west, where infrastructure needs to be improved if we are to remain competitive. I am glad the Minister made specific reference to this.</P>
    <P>How will the money be spent in 1999?  An additional £121 million has been allocated to health.  We all know the importance of a good health service.  No matter how much money we spend in the health area, we will never spend sufficient. However, this Government is going a long way to address the problems in our health service on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has adopted a caring and sensitive approach on how the money is to be spent in the health area.  In County Mayo we are fortunate that last week phase II of Mayo General Hospital had a tender approved for £22 million.  This will provide state of the art services in the health area for the people of County Mayo.  It will deal with areas of women's health, which is of great concern to me.  A number of years ago phase I dealt with the male wing of the hospital.  I am pleased the balance will be redressed.  I thank the Minister for Health and Children for taking the initiative and giving £22 million to that much needed project.  Also, the £121 million provides a substantial increase for initiatives in child care and mental and physical handicap.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Vote will receive an extra £80 million in 1999 to cover the full year costs of improvements made by the Government in the 1998 budget and other technical factors such as demographic changes.  An extra £69 million is being provided in the area of education, which <Col N="570" /> will increase the capitation grant from £50 to £60 in primary schools.  We would all like to see a higher increase, and all Members will have received deputations of national school teachers on this issue.  We sympathise with those teachers, who have a very difficult job in trying to manage their schools on low budgets, and we would like that capitation grant to be increased.  However, we must recognise that in the past two years there has been a 40 per cent increase in the grant under this Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>There is also a constant need for remedial teachers.  When the budget is published on 2 December more attention will have to be paid to this area and to school transport, particularly transport for special needs schools.  I ask the Minister to look at that area in particular.  I put down a parliamentary question on this matter recently, and I know the Minister is concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on allocating money for educational facilities for children with autism. For many years the parents of autistic children had to take High Court cases because no Government action was taken on the matter before this Administration acted.  I know many families with autistic children in Mayo and the Minister's action in this area has been very warmly received. He is a caring Minister and providing £4 million for adequate training and educational facilities for autistic children has been a significant and welcome improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science should also look at the issue of school secretaries and caretakers.  They are currently provided through FÁS, which is totally unsuitable.  He should also try to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and provide more substitute teachers.  Under capital expenditure, the Department of Education and Science is to receive an extra £18 million.</P>
    <P>The Defence Vote will receive an additional £32 million in the 1999 Estimates, and the Agriculture Vote is to receive an extra £26 million. The latter is important nationally but particularly in Mayo.  I am delighted to welcome the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution scheme as well as installation aid for young farmers and the dairy hygiene scheme.  It is very unfair that 80 per cent of all agriculture subsidies coming into the country go to 20 per cent of farmers.  Farm incomes have dropped significantly in Mayo to the point where families cannot survive on farm incomes any more.  Unless something is done about it, families will have to leave the land in areas like Mayo, which has already suffered a significant reduction in population in recent years.</P>
    <P>Capital spending on the Public Enterprise Vote is to rise by £90 million in 1999, which I welcome, and an additional £212 million is to be provided for the Environment and Local Government Vote.  We had a debate recently on rail safety.  I draw the Minister for Public Enterprise's attention to the rail line to the west, which is in need of investment in the region of £60 million just to make it safe.  It is unacceptable that in 1998 <Col N="571" /> people must use a train travelling at 20 miles per hour.  That is prehistoric.  Major investment is needed, but the extra funding given to the Minister in the 1999 Estimates will go some way towards improving this.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the significant increase in his Estimates.  I thank him for his good work for Mayo in approving many water and sewerage schemes.  It is vitally important that every home has running water.  While those in the cities take this for granted, there are people in Mayo who must rely on roof tanks for their water supply. That is not acceptable.  Every home should have an adequate supply of water; this should be a number one priority.  The Minister should note that fact when allocating money after the budget and I hope Mayo benefits.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about hospital waiting lists.  People with mental handicap have been on waiting lists for 20 to 30 years and we require 1,400 residential places and 1,000 day places.  Families with mentally handicapped children are experiencing severe hardship, particularly when those children get older.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance's Book of Estimates and congratulate him on the prudent job he is doing with the economy. We are on the crest of a wave and everything seems to be going well, but it is vital that we plan for the future and do not let that success blow us away or pump prime the economy.  It is vital we keep a prudent line on public finances, though major increases have been given to the Departments, especially on capital funding.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cooper-Flynn said, there has been much debate on hospital waiting lists.  However, we have seen an increase of over £120 million given to the Department of Health and Children. Every person visits hospitals occasionally, either as a visitor or patient, and we see the dedication of doctors and nurses on the State's behalf.</P>
      <P>Long-stay institutions were built by the State in the 1940s and 1950s to cure tuberculosis.  Those have now become long-term institutions and some patients have been in those hospitals for over 40 years.  Very little maintenance has been done in those hospitals, and I urge the Minister to look at this issue.  Some of the institutions are very run down.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is being examined, as are ways of directing more resources from long-stay institutions to community involvement.  This is very worthwhile.  It is easier on everyone, and particularly the State, if elderly people are kept at home in their communities.  The proper financial incentives must be given to the families caring for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to welcome the increase in the IT 2000 programme.  The spending on this programme in 1999 is to increase by 100 per cent from this year, when it was first introduced.  Information technology will be a vital part of our <Col N="572" /> future.  We have seen different watersheds in Irish history over the past 50 years.  People will be classified according to their expertise in information technology.  National school pupils of eight or nine years are better able to adapt to information technology than many adults or older schoolchildren.  That is welcome.  I commend the Government and the Minister for the ongoing spending in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase in capitation grants for national schools.  I am sure there is not a public representative in this House who would not agree that primary schools have been neglected for some time.  While a good deal of money has been invested in education in recent years, primary schools have been neglected.  There are many dilapidated primary schools and there has been a lack of resources invested in them, particularly in educational aids to assist teachers.</P>
    <P>The commitment by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government in regard to the installation aid scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and the control of farm pollution scheme is particularly welcome from a rural viewpoint.  Since the control of farm pollution scheme was suspended in April 1995 the fisheries boards and others have regularly impressed on farmers the need to invest large amounts of money in small holdings to comply with regulations governing the control of pollution. Many were leaving farming because there was no capital incentive or State grant aid to alleviate the financial burden of such investment. I welcome that commitment which is encouraging.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the reintroduction of the installation aid scheme which will be funded by the Exchequer.  It will encourage young people to seek employment in the agricultural sector which has faced great difficulties this year.  The Government should give whatever incentives it can to ensure young people find employment in that sector. If young blood is not attracted into an industry, that industry will die.</P>
    <P>Incentives to encourage people to stay in rural Ireland and maintain a viable rural community have been a hobby horse of mine since I was elected.  In recent years many people have moved from rural communities to large urban areas.  This has created infrastructural problems with an increased demand for housing land and the provision of roads while vast areas of the countryside have been depopulated.  A Government cannot wave a magic wand to reverse that trend, but a White Paper on rural development is in the pipeline. That is welcome and I await, with interest, its publication.  I encourage the Minister for Finance and the Government to examine more practical ways to ensure that people are attracted back to rural communities.  There has been an escalation in the price of land in the areas surrounding Dublin city and, to a lesser extent, Cork city.  If an appropriate tax incentive was introduced, it would encourage people to return to rural Ireland.  A major incentive to achieve that <Col N="573" /> objective would be the provision of jobs in rural communities.  It has been part of the Government's objective since taking office to provide jobs in the regions rather than provide all jobs in central locations, but even more jobs should be provided in the regions.</P>

      <P>Despite our economic boom, for which all parties can take credit because they had a hand in bringing it about, there are dangers lurking on the horizon.  As the previous speaker mentioned, our rural economy is collapsing. Farmers are not deciding whether they will continue in farming, but when is the most opportune time to leave it.  I am pleased the Minister of State is present.  There does not seem to be any understanding of what is happening in the rural economy. That was epitomised in the fodder scheme which was inadequate, unfair and did not target those farmers who were in crisis.  It allocated fodder vouchers to farmers who will have plenty of fodder for the winter.</P>
      <P>Problems in the health services will not be addressed by what is contained in the Book of Estimates.  There has been an increase in the number on the waiting list for geriatric care, ENT procedures and orthodontic treatment.  Hospital waiting lists are increasing rather than decreasing. The health services are inadequate.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention some of the dangers lurking on the horizon.  The Government must take account of them and not be complacent.  The strain on our infrastructure has become increasingly obvious.  It is epitomised daily by the traffic gridlock which results in a loss of man-hours and delays in moving goods from A to B. Traffic congestion is costing the country a good deal of money, which is evident on the ground.  Such congestion problems may influence an industrialist's decision on whether to locate an industry in this country.  An investor who considered investing in my part of the country some months ago decided against doing so because of the time it takes to travel from Kerry to Dublin.  I welcome the extra funding, though not substantial, that will be provided to address that problem.</P>
      <P>It is important to address the apparent labour shortages and skills deficit.  The problem of upward wage pressures is also raising its head. Having regard to the various demands being made at present, that problem is gathering momentum.  These factors will serve to make our economy less competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EMU, which will come onstream in six weeks' time, will expose our economy to the harsh winds of competition on all fronts.  Nobody can predict what will happen, but it will further expose our economy.  The Government must address this problem.  It is addressed to an extent in the Book <Col N="574" /> of Estimates, but it must be further addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister for Finance should address the needs of the lower paid in the budget.  It is necessary to target tax breaks at the lower paid to maintain our competitiveness. Small companies which would like to give their employees an increase in their wages cannot afford to do so.  The only way those people can be rewarded is through the taxation system.  There is flexibility in the system to do that.  The Minister will probably give another £0.5 billion in tax breaks this year and I appeal to him to ensure they are targeted at the lower and middle income groups, which was the policy of the former rainbow coalition Government.  That would increase our competitiveness and strengthen local economies. In most cases small businesses are located in the rural economy and they are the businesses that are finding it most difficult to survive.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In particular it is important that there is a full and open account on the record of how the Government has succeeded in meeting its commitment to limit the growth in current spending to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>While this target has been broadly met, it disguises some worrying underlying factors, which I will outline.  Public service pay costs rose by 10 per cent in 1997, by 9 per cent in 1998 and are projected to rise by 5 per cent in 1999.  Also, increases in PRSI receipts together with lower debt service costs disguise a sharper increase in the cost of providing Government services and separate figures are not given for PRSI receipts. However, day to day spending, less debt service costs, is budgeted to rise by more than 6.5 per cent before budget day announcements are added to this total.  This is more than double the rate of inflation.  There are areas where increased expenditure is needed but I would be wary that the discipline in the economy which has been evident over the past ten years will be lost.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in primary education. Second level and third level education are mentioned a great deal in the House but not enough attention is paid to primary education. The capitation grant for operational costs of national schools has been increased by 15 per cent in the Estimates, which I welcome.  Building equipment and refurbishment grants have been increased by 40 per cent and that must be acknowledged, but when one looks at the problems addressed by these increases, they are minuscule, especially at a time when there is so much money at the disposal of the Minister.  There are still 200,000 pupils in classes of 30 or more and almost 80 per cent of principal teachers must combine their full-time teaching responsibilities with their administrative duties while more than 500 schools are still without access to a remedial teachers.  Shared remedial teachers generally have so many schools to cater for that the service provided is often minimal and is just not effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> Pupil-teacher ratios for special schools and classes set out in the special education review committee report have not yet been fully implemented and, indeed, there is a long way to go.  Due to a major shortage of substitute teachers thousands of pupils are in the care of unqualified and untrained personnel daily, people who are doing their best but are simply not qualified or trained to do the job.  A total of 42 per cent of substitution hours was provided by untrained personnel in 1997, which is a startling statistic.  More than 8,000 children with special needs attend mainstream schools on an integrated basis without minimal support services.</P>
    <P>Despite the 15 per cent increase in the capitation grant, it is totally inadequate.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment a number of weeks ago and also addressed it during Private Members' business last week.  Half of the State's full-time students are at primary level, but only one quarter of funding is provided to that sector. Primary schools' authorities are required by regulation to pay a local contribution before they receive their annual grants.  This is not a requirement for post primary or third level schools, despite the fact that the Constitution guarantees free primary education for every child.  Every child must go through the primary education system. Therefore, it makes sense if all our children are to be treated equally and given a fair opportunity for the future that more resources should be targetted at this area.  It should be given equal treatment at least.</P>
    <P>The capitation grant at primary level prior to the Minister's announcement following the publication of the Estimates was £50 per pupil per year and it was completely inadequate even to pay for the essentials, such as heating, lighting, cleaning and insurance.  This does not include other services such as cable connection and provision of computers and software, which are being demanded.  The 1998 increase in the grant amounted to £5 or less than 10 pence per pupil per week while the 1999 increase will amount to 20 pence per pupil per week, and that is not enough.  For example, the grant for second level education is £177 per pupil per year.  There is still a wide gap and people in second level believe that grant is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Grants for caretaking and secretarial facilities are only available to schools with 195 pupils or more and that breaches the commitments given in the PESP and PCW agreements.  A commitment was made to extend these grants to all schools with an enrolment of more than 100 pupils.  The dependence on fund raising and voluntary contributions to provide primary schools with the equipment necessary for the implementation of the curriculum is totally unfair and teachers are becoming very frustrated.  They are semi-professional fund-raisers as they must keep accounts of the funds they collect and spend most of their time collecting money in classrooms when they should be teaching.  The Minister should <Col N="576" /> again review funding for primary schools and address it in next year's Estimate if he is still around.  However, he should also do something in the budget.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister regarding the increase of 45 per cent for water and sewerage services and facilities.  It is critically important for rural areas.  and I have discussed this with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  As a rural Deputy I see great potential for housing development if sewage and water mains are provided. The population of my village would double in two or three years if sewage services were provided. I appeal to the Government to put major emphasis in future on the provision of these services to ensure that rural areas can compete with urban areas in terms of attracting people to live in small villages and so forth.  There was a reference to the White Paper which I initiated when I was in office in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The previous Government approved it and I am glad the Government has taken it on and is working on it.</P>
    <P>There is a major crisis regarding local authority and social housing.  Waiting lists are spiralling and one of yesterday's national newspapers reported the increases in and distribution of waiting lists. It reported a major increase because people on low incomes and social welfare just cannot afford to take out a loan to buy a house built by a private contractor.  As a result they must join the waiting lists.  There is a 20 per cent increase in funding in the Estimates but this is inadequate.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the number of unmarried mothers having more than one child and more should be provided for them.  We should not just look at the provision of single bedroom houses but also two bedroom houses for that sector. They are not being catered for sufficiently.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, I welcome the restoration of the scheme for the installation of young farmers but it is inadequate.  The number applying for agricultural colleges decreased considerably this year and the number entering dropped by 7 per cent, because there is no attraction in farming.  The grant under the scheme should be doubled at least, to about £12,000, as is our policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual Estimates provide the opportunity to see whether the Government's budgetary management matches its political rhetoric. At last weekend's Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis a banner proclaimed: &ldquo;Partnership with People&rdquo;, but we must ask ourselves what matters to people &mdash; is it GDP, standard of living or quality of life? I suggest it is quality of life but, ironically, as our standard of living and GDP increase, our quality of life is deteriorating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we need quality of life or sustainability indicators, which I have spoken about previously.  These include moneys specifically earmarked for social investment, and in this regard it must be noted that the Government does not provide figures for the proportion of GDP which is invested in social infrastructure and in poverty <Col N="577" /> proofing the public administrative process.  Most European countries make this kind of analysis available.  The absence of defined targets raises questions about the commitment to poverty proofing, since no measurable benchmarks have been defined in terms of the annual Estimates process.  A breakdown is required of the targets and trends, in which context the Book of Estimates is to be read in relation to such quality of life indicators as economic opportunity, employment and self-employment, health, etc.  The British Labour Party has spoken of these matters and is now introducing such indicators.</P>
    <P>We have no long-term health planning and there is no provision in the Estimates for preventive or complementary medicine.  We need to invest in that area rather than in gigantic, hugely capital intensive hospitals.  We increasingly find that the budget for such hospitals increases but the rate of return is not great.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, for sharing his time, and agree with him that the primary schools have been shamefully ignored.  At the rate of increase in the Estimates, it will take 30 years for them to catch up with secondary schools.  In my constituency schools cannot get remedial teachers.  The position is terrible in the blackspots of my constituency and it will not be improved by the Government's approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>In considering the supply and quality of housing we must compare the scale of the problem with the investment.  There is a crisis on our hands but if one judged by what the Government is doing one would think there was none.  Waiting lists are rising even as the Celtic tiger moves on and growth increases.  We must face up to this fact; if we had quality of life indicators, perhaps instead of talking about GDP we could discuss housing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Climate change is another important indicator now provided by the British Labour Party.  We have failed miserably to examine this and as a consequence the Exchequer is facing a huge bill. We will be forced into trading CO 2 permits, which will cost the state in the region of £500 million, yet if one listened to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, one would think there was no problem.  In my constituency, from Pearse Street to Irishtown, about one in four children is suffering from asthma exacerbated by air pollution.  There is interconnectedness here because we know this costs a fortune under the health budget.  It also costs in the region of 20 million ecu to deal with one pollutant, nitrogen dioxide.</P>
    <P>Transport is a significant problem.  We witness gridlock daily and the increase in the Estimate is not enough when we consider the scale of the problem.  We need huge investment in public transport because the city is grinding to a halt and becoming uncompetitive.  On current calculations gridlock is costing us £1.2 billion per year.  We are looking at the wrong indicators.  We cannot simply see the Estimates in terms of GDP because many people are missing out.  More of us <Col N="578" /> will become aware that quality of life indicators are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having studied all the pages in the Book of Estimates I have discovered that it is a page short, and this page has been missing for the past 15 years.  The Minister has given a general direction to the economy and indicated how the increased spend for 1999 will impact on the various Departments in a positive way, but the question remains as to what has happened to the missing page, the one which should have been written for Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>When I was first elected to the House, I said my constituency seemed to be the Brigadoon of Irish politics.  A great fuss was made of it at election time but it vanished soon after, and I pledged that I would try to change that.  Unfortunately, the recent restructuring for Objective One status has changed the perception of matters in the south-east, particularly in my constituency.  This was underlined at a recent meeting of the Carlow County Enterprise Board, which stands as an example of how money should be spent in the region.  The chief executive officer of the board spelt out that Carlow was a neglected and deprived area, and the local newspaper carried the banner headline: &ldquo;Carlow Banjaxed&rdquo;.  That is an unusual comment by a local paper on its community, and I would be unhappy with the expression, but it encouraged me to look behind it.  I found the statistics presented by the county enterprise board were valid.  They clearly indicate that Carlow, an important part of my constituency, is falling far behind the national average.</P>
      <P>Something radical must be done to support the self-help ethos of the people and to restore pride in their attempts to develop their county.  I am anxious to help the Minister to write the new page into the Book of Estimates and to look at the county in a constructive way.  Areas in Carlow are dying on their feet, and I ask the Minister to turn this around.  He should look at organisations such as CANDO, a community-based body which is driven to influence and strengthen community development within the county.  He should examine the many worthwhile projects on his Department's books and help to kick-start local communities.</P>
      <P>He should invest in the county's roads &mdash; while there has been an increase in the investment, it should be filtered directly through to the people I represent.  The Carlow by-pass should be finished because the town should not be choked with traffic every day.  I do not want to see business in Carlow town and county grinding to a halt for lack of infrastructure.  I want the Minister to correct ten years of neglect, and to look seriously at how he intends to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> There are almost 1,000 people on the social housing list in Carlow, a staggering number for a small county.  If there had been investment over the past few years, that list would have been whittled away.  Today the list is growing.  That is not good enough, and I ask the Government to invest heavily in the provision of social housing in the south-east and in Carlow in particular.  The Minister should understand the plight of the thousands of people who are on the housing lists because of neglect by successive Governments over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>In the context of tourism, the Minister should take on board the suggestions made about Carlow Castle and the dolmen sites.  It is not good enough that local voluntary groups put their shoulder to the wheel to find that the only thing stopping them is lack of representation at this level.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at the question of funding for those projects.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Carlow marina project, which is encountering a problem at the moment, I ask the Department officials to take note of the problem and try to resolve it.  One company's efforts to address the neglect of tourism in Carlow are thwarted by bureaucracy.  A simple intervention by the Department would help to get the show on the road.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister invested in the Carlow Institute of Technology.  That institute could be a centre for the creation of high-tech, high-spec IDA jobs.  We need a properly serviced land bank in Carlow available to investors who wish to come in.  The IDA should set up a task force to focus attention on investment in that area.  Outside investment is urgently needed to fill the places available and the ones that could be created by the Government if it took the problems in Carlow seriously.  Indigenous industry needs to be supported and expanded, and we can do that only by having jobs available.  A task force made up of the IDA, the local enterprise group and others would ensure a kick-start for Carlow, restoring pride and helping the county to move on.</P>
    <P>Carlow plays an important role in a regional context in that it adjoins Kilkenny.  Kilkenny has suffered because it does not have a ring road. Major Government investment is needed here.  In passing from Carlow to Kilkenny one needs to take the Waterford road, which accesses Waterford port at Belview.  A proper road infrastructure would help the region as a whole to develop. Kilkenny has worked quite well with Carlow. There is an outreach centre from Carlow Institute of Technology.  There is also an outreach centre from NUI, Maynooth, driven by a local voluntary group of which I am a member.  About £0.75 million is to be spent on the expansion programme with Carlow Institute of Technology.  Surely it would make good sense if the infrastructure in Carlow could be used to make third level education accessible to other people in that constituency. I have asked the Government to invest in a pilot project between NUI Maynooth, Carlow <Col N="580" /> Institute of Technology and St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny.  I hope my request does not fall on deaf ears.  Local spending with NUI Maynooth amounts to £0.75 million.  I am asking the Government to match that and show its intent to develop services between Carlow and Kilkenny. It could be encouraged and driven as a pilot project from which the Government could learn much.  There is an application from Kilkenny Corporation in relation to an inner relief road. Because Kilkenny was neglected over a period, I ask that this application be given priority.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to encourage the local group expanding health services by way of the sale of property, to give them the necessary encouragement to move that project ahead.  Let us stop the Celtic tiger turning a blind eye to Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimates debate is unique in that the Government has a current budget surplus unprecedented in the history of the State.  It is an indicator of the robust health of the economy and gives this Government a latitude in public spending not enjoyed by any previous Government.  The question to be answered is how the Government will use the health of this economy to maximum benefit.  What will be the ethos of the Minister for Finance's budget next week?</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget is the Minister for Finance's second chance to get it right.  The 1998 budget was a deep disappointment in that it failed to spread the benefits of economic prosperity across the dividing lines of Irish society.  The effect of across-the-board tax cuts was to benefit disproportionately the better off and to widen the gap between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>In urging the Government and the Minister to seize this second chance, Sinn Féin rejects the culture of &ldquo;mé féinism&rdquo; which pervades the Celtic tiger economy and which the last budget fostered. Reducing the contribution to the public purse of those who can most afford to contribute is entirely the wrong approach.  Emphasis should be placed not on tax cuts but on increased public spending and on enhancing the quality of services provided by the State in health, education, housing, social welfare, infrastructure and job creation.</P>
      <P>The figures in these Estimates and all the feel-good rhetoric about the Celtic tiger economy are undermined when one examines those other figures, each one of which represents an individual or family being denied the benefits of economic prosperity.  It is almost forgotten, and has certainly slipped from the media agenda, that there are still over 200,000 people unemployed in the Twenty-six Counties.  There are nearly 50,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists and 43,000 people on hospital waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still have to ask when there will be a fair taxation system.  This question has been left unanswered by successive Ministers for Finance. Over the past five years, the Irish public have witnessed <Col N="581" /> one taxation scandal after another.  There have been politicians who have evaded tax, banks who have deliberately allowed their customers to defraud the State, high earners who pay little or no tax because their income and status allow them to exploit loopholes in the tax code, companies who siphon funds out of the economy, leaving ordinary citizens with a disproportionate share of the tax burden and a taxation system where PAYE workers pay over 80 per cent of total income tax.</P>
    <P>There has been some simplification of the tax code, but the much needed root and branch reform of the system has been avoided by successive Ministers.  Last year the Minister ignored advice to use the considerable funds available for income tax cuts to help the low paid.  We proposed using all the funds for income tax cuts to raise the tax-free allowance enjoyed by all workers.  This would help all workers, but the low paid would be the prime beneficiaries.  The Minister not only cut the higher rate of income tax but also slashed the rate of capital gains tax by half. The result is a tax code characterised by abuse and structural inequity.  This coalition has already promised to deliver further cuts in corporation tax without making any firm commitment to the low paid.  The taxation measures in the 1998 budget thus widened the gap between rich and poor.  Tax cuts once again disproportionately benefited the higher paid.  This must not happen again.  The tax priorities must be to improve the income of the low paid, using extra revenue not to boost the incomes of the highest paid, but to improve services in health, education, social welfare and job creation.  I urge the Minister to increase the tax free allowances of single people by at least £1,000 and of co-habiting couples by at least £2,000 annually and not to make more cuts in corporation tax or capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Up to 1.5 million people in the Twenty-six Counties are dependant on social welfare payments. They are not only the unemployed, but pensioners, people with disabilities, widows and widowers, lone parents, farmers with small holdings, the self-employed on low incomes and, most importantly, the children of these groups.  The aim of Government should be to create an economic environment where everyone can play a valuable part.  However, successive Governments have been unwilling to produce policies to make the goal of full employment and maximum inclusion a reality.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI conference on budget perspectives highlighted these inequalities.  It found that the incomes of the top earners in the Twenty-six Counties have increased over the past four years more rapidly than those at the bottom.  It also found that social welfare payments increased by 16 per cent over the past four years compared to a 22 per cent growth in average income.  The Minister should immediately increase social welfare payments to levels which will allow an individual to live with dignity in truly adequate living <Col N="582" /> conditions that will create the possibilities for greater economic participation in society.</P>
    <P>This year's budget must address the immediate crisis faced by farmers as well as taking the first steps towards ensuring the long-term economic future of rural communities.  In 1996, there were 301,000 people working full and part-time on farms.  Securing their future must be a priority and I urge the extension of the family income supplement to low income farmers.</P>
    <P>The current housing crisis will not be addressed by the paltry measures arising from the Bacon report or the few thousand local authority new house starts sanctioned for 1999.  Housing must be a priority in public spending and there needs to be major investment in a new and comprehensive social housing programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has a special responsibility to the most vulnerable in our society.  An allocation of £60 million for the mentally handicapped and their carers should be made and I urge the adoption of a new carers' payment for the 50,000 full-time carers in the home.</P>
    <P>There has been massive development in our roads infrastructure in recent years and new national roads, motorways and bypasses have been developed.  However, a new emphasis on non-national roads throughout the Twenty-six Counties is needed.  Last week I published a report, &ldquo;Time to End Cavan's Ordeal&rdquo;, which outlines the grim reality for the people of that county which has the worst non-national road network in the country.  I urge Government action and funding to end Cavan's ordeal.</P>
    <P>The unique opportunities provided by the Estimates should not be missed this time.  It would be obscene if the already very prosperous and thriving sections of society were awarded yet again.  If the Minister's budget includes these vital elements, I will have no hesitation in supporting its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ulick Burke.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this year's Estimates and to comment on what I hope the budget will contain on 2 December.  The issue of pay structures and how they affect those who wish to work must be examined. On the day the budget was announced last year, the Department of Finance issued figures which showed that a person with no dependants who earned £55,000 a year would receive a tax benefit of £1,250.  However, a person who earned approximately £20,000 would only receive a tax break of £250 to £300.  This demonstrates that there was an imbalance in last year's budget to the detriment of middle to lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to ensure that the benefits of the Celtic tiger are shared equally, the Government must consider the proposals put forward by the previous Rainbow Government.  These would allow people on low incomes to receive a better share of the tax reliefs provided, including increased allowances and benefits.  This would <Col N="583" /> make it more beneficial for a person to work than to be on social welfare.  On social welfare, one receives extra benefits, including a medical card, free transport for children in a rural area to primary and second level schools and other fringe benefits.  We must ensure that opportunities are provided in that regard.</P>
    <P>The issue of pensions must be considered. Many people welcomed the £5 increase in last year's budget.  However, it was only after the increase came into effect that people realised partners and individuals on disability benefit did not also receive it.  This was unbelievable.  If one was under 65 years of age and on disability benefit, one only received £3.  I urge the Minister to ensure that all those in need get proper allowances. This must include people on disability benefit.</P>
    <P>Health matters have been mentioned many times in the House in recent weeks.  It is vital that the Minister for Health and Children and the Government realise that people on waiting lists suffer.  While there is a major increase in the health Estimate, I worry that some of this money will be used for salary increases or other matters and that patients will not benefit.  I outlined a number of examples during the recent debate on health, but I received a telephone call from a mother this morning whose child is waiting for orthodontic treatment.  My secretary was told by the relevant department that it is only working on 1995-6 cases at this time and the child must wait at least another year.  This is very annoying for a young girl who is eligible for treatment.</P>
    <P>Regarding education, I repeat the problem facing a school in Clones.  The junior primary school has not been declared disadvantaged although the senior primary school has been declared disadvantaged and the Gaelscoil in the town is receiving more beneficial grants.  The Government guaranteed that it would increase the allowance to primary schools to £177.  However, the Estimate only provides for an increase of £10 to £50 so the Government has a long way to go in this area.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on the issue of roads since I became a Member of the House.  I am proud of the record of the Fine Gael Party in Government on this matter.  I am also proud that the current Estimate shows a continued increase in this area. In my county, Monaghan, there was no increase in funds over ten years and the roads were in a desperate state.  The position in County Cavan was not any better.  The local authorities had to fund the demolition of courthouses and bridges and other matters and this cost the rural economy much money.  During my party's short period in Government, the amount of money available for roads was doubled.  The problem now is ensuring that the money is spent before Christmas.  I hope the money for this area is allocated early next year to allow the best use to be made of it during better weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Agriwaste is another major problem.  I hope <Col N="584" /> the Government will try to find some means of generating electricity from the enormous amount of such waste in County Monaghan.  This is not covered in the Estimates.  There are EU funds available.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, the Estimates are a disaster.  A sum of £10,000 will be made available to farmers in certain areas to resolve a crisis that affected the entire country.  The Minister has failed to secure the necessary funds to put a proper marketing structure in place for our beef and pigmeat products.  Additional funds should be made available to provide family income supplement for farmers in dire trouble and for agriculture in general to get farmers out of the rut in which they find themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  A report has been lying on the Minister's desk since early spring and there has been no indication that the Government is seriously considering following through on it.  It deals with the issue of drainage in south Galway, where the report was launched by officials of the various Departments involved.  Based on rainfall patterns we are on the verge of another catastrophe. Is it the Government's intention to undertake remedial works so that the people of south Galway need not live in fear of serious flooding? We are aware from headlines in the world press of what happened in Central America.  The same could happen here if action is not taken.</P>
      <P>I can find no reference to additional funds in the Estimates for school transport, on which a report was presented to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, some time ago.  He has promised on various occasions to undertake a root and branch review.  There is overcrowding on buses which date from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Buses have been withdrawn from service in Dublin and refurbished to provide a service in rural areas.  Finance should be made available as a matter of urgency to modernise the fleet.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should reconsider the involvement of CIE in the scheme as it is inflexible and unapproachable in making even the most minor of changes.  It will split hairs on yards rather than miles leaving young children to walk in the wind and the rain, in some cases at 7 a.m. It should be more considerate.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Government the integrated rural development groups operated under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. They have since been transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Food, while there is an overlapping of functions with the Western Development Commission, which has a separate budget.  They will find it an impossible task to extract the necessary funds to continue their work to revitalise rural communities and should be transferred back to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed <Col N="585" /> to this important debate on the 1999 Abridged Estimates and summary public capital programme.  The debate has been useful and interesting.  I will cover as many of the points raised as possible.</P>
      <P>The debate is important because it provides an opportunity for the Government to make clear how its spending plans will meet many of the pressing social and economic challenges facing us. The 1999 Abridged Estimates and summary public capital programme show that substantial additional resources are being allocated next year to a wide range of public expenditure programmes, including health, education, agriculture, public transport and roads.  The Government has taken full account of the need to improve public services and has allocated the resources required to make significant progress on a number of fronts in 1999.</P>
      <P>The House has heard Ministers give some of the details of how spending programmes will be developed next year.  Significant improvements in public services are being provided for by the Government while, at the same time, maintaining the prudent budgetary policies which have done so much to create the economic success of recent years.</P>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates and summary public capital programme set out part of the budgetary equation.  The Government's proposals for the remainder of the budget, including taxation, will be presented to the House next week.  The Estimates show that the Government is meeting its programme commitment to limit the annual average increase in net current spending to 4 per cent. The Government's planning for the 1999 budget is based on adherence to its spending target.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the statements from the benches opposite it is clear that the Government's approach to the Estimates has not been fully appreciated.  There have been the usual criticisms. The key point appears to be that the Government is massaging the figures to keep within the 4 per cent current spending limit.  The implication is that if adjustments are not made the Government will be seen to have broken its commitment.</P>
      <P>There is no mystery about the increase in current spending.  It could not be more clear.  The Government's programme explained how the limit on current spending was to be calculated. Net current spending is net voted current spending on goods and services plus expenditure on Central Fund services, which mainly covers interest payments on Government debt.  The Government programme gave a commitment that the increase in net current spending would be limited to an annual average of 4 per cent over its lifetime, that is, using the 1997 spending outturn as a base.  This yardstick was chosen because it is clear and straightforward.  It avoids any dispute about the evolution of spending between years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the Government is meeting its commitment to control spending can be checked simply by looking at the average annual increase <Col N="586" /> over the 1997 base.  For 1999 this year's spending outturn does not affect the calculation.  What matters is that the Government's spending plans for 1999 show that current spending is rising by an average of 3.9 per cent over the 1997 outturn. None of the criticism made of the Government affects this central point.  The Government is meeting its commitment on spending.</P>
    <P>It is important to see the wider policy background behind the approach taken by the Government.  The Government's policy on expenditure is not something that has been adopted for its own sake.  Prudent budgetary policies have been a key element in Ireland's economic growth and the Government is determined that will be maintained.  The success of these policies is clear.  Ireland's economic growth continues to outstrip that of our EU partners.  Most importantly, this strong growth has led to a substantial increase in employment.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, employment has risen by approximately 4 per cent for the second year running and unemployment has fallen to below the EU average.</P>
    <P>By setting a 4 per cent target for current spending, the Government is ensuring that significant additional resources are available for the development of public services, the details of which are set out in the 1999 abridged Estimates and public capital programme.  At the same time the growth in spending is being controlled.  There is sufficient scope within the budgetary arithmetic to provide further reductions in taxation, which have played a major role in securing the recent national agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked the Minister for Finance for information on a number of points, including details of the increases in public service numbers underlying the 1999 Estimates.  On the basis of the provisional information available to us, the Estimates involve an increase of 5,600 in public service numbers next year.  Of these additional posts, 4,000 are in the health sector, reflecting the substantial improvement in services decided by the Government in the contest of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford asked how the moneys might be spent.  The moneys provided in the Health Estimate are for important service improvements.  These cannot be undertaken without extra pay for the staff required and for the increasing numbers of staff.  Health is a service based industry in that a hands-on approach is needed to the delivery of the type of services the people of the country are entitled to.  The Government is aware that while improving the capital and resourcing side, human resources are equally provided in the front line delivery of health services.  That is an approach which the House should and does support.  The House will be aware that, especially in the health sector, it is impossible to have significant improvements in services without an increase in staff to provide them.</P>
    <P>The remaining 1,600 posts I have referred to are evenly spread throughout the public service. <Col N="587" /> Deputy Noonan asked for information on the assumptions underlying the 1999 public capital programme.  The programme has been drawn up by the Government on the basis of specific projects to improve our economic and social infrastructure and to support the development of the economy in the longer term.  The expenditure allocations provide for the 1999 cost of projects which are already under way and for the cost of those projects which are due to start next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>My second question was not about underlying assumptions about the public capital programme.  I asked if the Department has an Estimate of the scale of increases in public sector tenders in the construction industry.  Inflation in the industry is considerably greater than the consumer price index.  With regard to the projects to commence in 1999, has the Department or the Government information to allow for this inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works I am aware of what is happening in the marketplace.  The Deputy makes some valid points.  I do not have figures to hand to respond, however, in the context of my Department, which would be the main source of many of the capital projects on behalf of most Departments, I am aware of projected increases in the Estimates and of soaring rates on the rental side.  I will have a note made available to the Deputy.  I will shortly refer to increases in the capital programme for the Office of Public Works, which will reflect some of the questions he has raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell asked for information on a number of points, including the position on multi-annual budgeting.  The 1999 budget next Wednesday will present a multi-annual view of the main budgetary aggregates.  The Deputy asked what progress has been made with the development of accrual accounting.  He is aware that enhancement of accounting techniques in Departments has been under continuous review for several years.  Substantial accruals-based information is already included in the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
      <P>On the basis of recommendation in <i>Delivering better Government,</i> a financial management working group was established with representatives from both the public and, more importantly, the private sectors.  The group's report addressed a wide range of management and financial accounting issues, including accrual accounting and was presented to the implementation group on the SMI in June for its consideration.  When that group completes its consideration of the report, which I hope is not too far away, it will then be submitted to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also asked if the Minister for Finance was satisfied with progress being made on the introduction of expenditure reviews. I assure him the Minister is satisfied with these. <Col N="588" /> The Government decided the first round of spending reviews last year.  I understand that, to date, 12 reviews have been completed and it is expected that a significant number of other reviews will be completed shortly.  The Deputy will be aware that this is the first year of the new system and the main aim has been to ensure that the expenditure review process is properly established within Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ardagh and Deputy Rabbitte made the valid point that the recently published Book of Estimates was impossible to understand due to the lack of explanatory notes and annotations. The Minister for Finance announced in the 1998 budget that he would be appointing a small expert group to look at the presentation of public financial statements with the aim of making them more easily understood.  The expert group on improving public financial statements was established and it has reported to the Minister. Improvements in presentation documents are being made in the Department at present and these will include the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works I am pleased to draw the attention of the House to the increase in the provision for new works projects, from £39 million in 1998 to £60.65 million in 1999, which is contained in Vote 10.  The House is aware of the Leinster House 2000 project, which is well under way and ahead of schedule.  Other projects include the extension to Dublin Zoo, including land acquisition and the provision of a new African plains exhibition area; the National Museum, which has been allocated another £8 million for the development of Collins Barracks; the sighting of the new national folk museum at Turlough Park House; and the National Library will see a further extension and substantial improved accommodation. In addition, the Garda building programme will be increased by £5 million to oversee the completion of the divisional headquarters in Thurles, the commencement of a new station at Mayorstone in County Limerick and at Clondalkin, both much needed, and the commencement of the new residential block and three lecture theatres at Templemore Garda college.  I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke raised the issue of the south County Galway flood report, which was presented this year.  The information contained in the report, which runs to vast volumes, is extensive and is extremely valuable in the context of the planning of the whole south County Galway area, especially from the point of view of the local authorities involved.  On the assessments that were done, it is clear that some of the projects, including some of those anticipated at local level, were not viable for a range of good and well founded reasons.  However, it is possible that some remedial works may be undertaken.  We would like to assist if these can be done without cutting across environmental issues and protected areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> I hope I have addressed most of the points raised by Deputies.  I will try to get information on the point raised by Deputy Noonan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a very useful meeting with Mr. Jacques Santer, President of the European Commission, on Thursday, 19 November.  We discussed a number of issues, including the Agenda 2000 negotiations. I took the opportunity to stress once again Ireland's commitment to work constructively towards meeting the March deadline for agreement on the Agenda 2000 package.  He gave me a very useful assessment of the negotiations so far and offered his impression of the prospects for progress at Vienna and the attainment of the March deadline.  I also took the opportunity to outline the background to the Government's decision to apply to EUROSTAT for approval of the regionalisation proposals.</P>
      <P>In relation to CAP reform, I stressed to the President that while we accept the need for reform, the proposals in respect of the beef and milk sectors &mdash; which together account for 4 per cent of Irish GDP &mdash; will have a disproportionately negative affect on Ireland's economy compared with any other member state.</P>
      <P>I also raised with the President the Commission's report on own resources.  I mentioned that the co-financing proposals in their current form were unacceptable to Ireland.  President Santer stressed that the Commission had brought forward options only and had not made recommendations.</P>
      <P>In relation to employment guidelines, I indicated that Ireland would have no difficulties with the new employment guidelines which were likely to be approved at Vienna.  President Santer indicated that the general strategy agreed at Luxembourg in December last would be endorsed with some amendments and that he looked forward to seeing a constructive interaction between the various national action plans at Vienna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I emphasised our view that the peace programme contained vital elements which must be retained in any successor <Col N="593" /> programme.  As a programme unique to Northern Ireland and the Border counties, it provided very visible evidence of EU support.  It reached groups and communities which have not directly benefited from other forms of Structural Funding and its cross-Border and cross community approach was a key element in its success.</P>
    <P>On the issue of duty free sales, I briefed the President on Ireland's position and our proposed approach to reopening the issue.  I know Chancellor Schroeder of Germany has indicated a positive view towards re-examining this matter at EU level and I propose to continue to seek his support and that of other heads of state or Government to make this happen.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the Vienna European Council, I will meet Austrian Federal Chancellor, Viktor Klima, on 27 November.  The Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU Policy will meet on Thursday, 26 November for the third time since July this year.  It will also meet on 8 December to focus on the issues to be discussed at Vienna.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the House last week, the agenda and proposals coming forward for the Vienna European Council are not yet set and, accordingly, the positions to be adopted by Ireland are not yet finalised.  As I indicated, it is likely that one of the main items to be discussed at the Council will be Structural and Cohesion Funds and the CAP.  I will discuss these matters with Federal Chancellor Klima.</P>
    <P>On the question of institutional reform, I will once again stress that the Amsterdam Treaty should be implemented before embarking on any ambitious new reform process.  I look forward to the outcome of the consideration by the General Affairs Council of its reform and the issue of the concentration of Councils, and of the ECOFIN considerations of the question of external representation. I met a parliamentary delegation from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Dublin on 17 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the progress being made on Agenda 2000?  Does he believe the March deadline will be reached so far as deciding on the future financing of the Union is concerned?</P>
      <P>In regard to Objective One status, a matter he discussed with the President of the European Commission, does he have authoritative county GDP per head statistics available to him?  By virtue of the Revenue Commissioners' access to such information, these take into account the income per resident in each county and would be a more authoritative indication of the relative prosperity of a county than the CSO figures which were published recently, which relate to output in the county regardless of the residence of the people participating in that output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach consider asking the Revenue Commissioners, who have county income figures available to them, to make those available to the Government for the purposes of establishing <Col N="594" /> which county has what income proportionate to other counties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Agenda 2000, from the meetings I have had recently, and following the meeting in Porschach last month and from what the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, said last week, it is hoped that some progress will be made at the Vienna Council next month.</P>
      <P>The view, which I share, is that if some progress is not made in Vienna, we overburden the German presidency in trying to achieve sufficient momentum by March.  The view of the President is that would not be possible if we have not at least laid down and agreed some firm ground rules at the December meeting.  There are no proposals for that meeting yet but I will meet Chancellor Klima later this week and I will know more then.</P>
      <P>It is still the view of the Commission, our view and the German Chancellor's view that we must reach the March deadline for the reason I stated before.  It will allow the Parliament and the Commission to deal with these matters in April. Otherwise we will be in the period of the European elections and the ensuing gap before the establishment of a new Parliament and the end of the Commission's period.  The view is, and again we share it, that it would then roll into 2000 creating major difficulties.</P>
      <P>The only figures which I have available to me are those from the CSO as the Deputy knows from what the Minister Deputy Brennan said yesterday. I cannot say what figures are available within the Revenue Commissioners; that would be more appropriate for a question to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for statistics for the Government as a whole.  Any statistics available in any Government organ should be available to him as the Minister responsible for statistics.  If it is the case that the Revenue Commissioners have income <i>per capita</i> figures for each county, because they have the addresses of the people living there who pay tax there, they should be able to make them available to the Government to establish the income per head of each county on the basis of tax paid.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask that such statistics be published so that we can see the income of comparative counties?  Will he not agree that if we are to divide the country we must do it in a fashion which is transparently fair or else it will leave a bitterness which would be entirely unproductive? Any statistics available, such as those from the Revenue Commissioners, should be sought and published so that people know the basis for the selections of counties which the Government has made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The operation of this process, and the mechanism used by the European Commission in all these decisions, is based on GDP.  That is the benchmark which will be used in terms of Objective One status for all of the countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that the March deadline is critical in the settling off on Agenda 2000.  Why, then, did the Government, which had a document since 21 July this year which did include the proposal to consider Counties Clare and Kerry, according to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, not submit the proposal prior to the August recess? Is there any truth in the allegations made by a number of senior political correspondents over the weekend that the Government decided to defer making a submission to EUROSTAT on this matter until after the Cork by-election and as a consequence valuable time was lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is no truth in that. The Cabinet spent a long time considering the best way to do this.  The simple thing to do was to do nothing and leave the end position for 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had the proposal on 21 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a presentation by the Department of Finance by June or July which indicated that Counties Clare and Kerry should be included.  That is correct.  The preparation and the Cabinet's finalisation of the various options which were put to it did not take place until recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that the March deadline for Agenda 2000 should be met.  I have no problem with that.  He also said it is in order to facilitate the other institutions of the European Union to address the proposals. What arrangements are being made to enable this House to address the Government's input into the different aspects of Agenda 2000, given the Government's extreme reluctance to give any information to this House in advance of its decision on the regionalisation debacle?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that he will be more co-operative in presenting this House and the committees of this House with information on the studies being carried out and the options open to the Government, so that this House is relevant to decision making at European level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he accept that the Government has made a total mess of the regionalisation issue?  The statistics which he published yesterday were based on CSO extractions which the CSO subsequently denied as having any validity.  Would he agree that whatever the benchmark being used by the European Union with regard to measuring our prosperity, at the very least we would expect the Government to base its plans on what it <Col N="596" /> knows to be the facts?  The facts are that the GDP does not reflect on a county by county basis or on a national basis the real picture with regard to the prosperity of this country.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that multinational profits are counted as part of GDP although they do not stay in the country?  At the same time, European Union funding which goes to the farming community by way of headage payments is not counted in the GDP calculations, although it remains here &mdash; unless it is sent to an offshore account &mdash; and is spent in the regions where it is paid.  There is no reality to the figures on which the Government is basing its national plan.</P>

      <P>That was a very gentle reminder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Members can put forward their views on Agenda 2000 at any time they wish. However, I remind the Deputy there have been a number of discussions here on the matter since last March when the proposals were first outlined. There has been a debate on the CAP and several Ministers have answered questions on various aspects of the Commission's paper which was presented on 18 March.  However, we can have another debate.</P>
      <P>I also remind the Deputy that no country has put forward its negotiating position to any extent and member states are unlikely to do so until the Vienna Summit, which will be the first opportunity for people to enter into the area of negotiating positions.  That will be an interesting exercise in terms of how much they are prepared to move.  However, I am ready to set down our position. Our position on agriculture and the Structural and Cohesion Funds is already in the public domain &mdash; we just have not put down some of negotiating arguments, which would be very unwise.  As I said earlier, I hope the March deadline is met because it would be better in terms of planning and organisation.</P>
      <P>I know Members wish to keep playing around with the figures.  However, the reality is that Objective One status for all regions of all countries &mdash; the position of other countries was well signposted in Monday's newspapers &mdash; is based on GDP per region and nothing else.  Of course, there are problems with this.  Westmeath, for example, is wealthier than Paris because all teachers are paid from Athlone, which is very interesting.  That is why the figures are taken on a regional rather than county basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry is well within the limit. It has a dramatically low GDP although everyone here swore on their lives last week that it was way over the limit if it was taken on its own.</P>
      <P>However, I believe all this is meaningless. What is meaningful is to take the figures on a regional basis, which is how it has been done.  As the Minister of State said yesterday and I have said several times, the CSO believes that the figures in these discussions stand up on a regional basis.  The discussions are commencing next week and every other country is using the same basis to calculate its figures.</P>
      <P>We could have taken the alternative view, which is to close down the funding in 2006 and walk away from resources which every other country will get.  I think some Members are saying we should do that, but they are not very coherent in the way they say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Taoiseach says, the matter should be taken on a regional basis in order to be fair, how does he justify departing from regional boundaries for two counties and not for others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is justified on the basis that the people who prepared this made a good case, which was later strongly supported by the Government, that it should be the western seaboard, which is a peripheral area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting to the House that Mizen Head is not on the western seaboard?  If he is using the western seaboard as his basis, how can he justify excluding west Cork?  On what basis can he exclude the county with the largest coastline, the most peninsular land and the southernmost and westernmost points in the country?  How can he justify including every part of the western seaboard except west Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very simple.  When we asked about taking parts of counties &mdash; such as some of the poorest places in Ireland which I am honoured to represent &mdash; in isolation we were told we could not.  That has been followed through all this year and no country has been allowed to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree he has repeatedly stated that the March deadline is critical? Will he also agree that it is in the interest of <Col N="598" /> a loose coalition of net contributor countries that the March deadline is not met and that, therefore, countries such as Ireland which are net recipients for the time being have a vested interest in ensuring the March deadline is met?</P>
      <P>Will he agree the Government has been negligent in not making its submission to EUROSTAT earlier, for whatever reason?  I will not speculate on that although my views are on the record.  This is in contrast to Portugal and the United Kingdom, the two countries he has just cited.  Why has the submission been made so late? Has the Government attempted to construct a political alliance among the net beneficiary countries to ensure a positive result in Vienna, bearing in mind the March deadline?</P>

      <P>In regard to a debate on Agenda 2000, the Taoiseach indicated that a number of the issues have already been addressed.  A number of the issues were addressed in reply to parliamentary questions which is not a debate, as the Ceann Comhairle would be very quick to point out.</P>
      <P>In addition, the discussions which have taken place have not been based on documentation presented by the Government on its views on the options.  I am not talking about the Government having to pin itself down to a particular option but at least outlining to Members what the options are as far as it is concerned so that Members can have some input into the Government's thinking.  Will the Taoiseach put in place a systematic process to examine the options faced by the country on Agenda 2000 between now and March, so that the House can have some relevance in that debate rather than being faced again with the situation which occurred on the regionalisation issue?</P>
      <P>There seems to be some level of avoidance or incomprehension in regard to my question on the issue of GDP versus the reality of poverty and wealth in this country. The Taoiseach acknowledges that the GDP figures being used by EUROSTAT do not reflect reality in terms of the spread of wealth, disadvantage and poverty.  In view of that, will the Taoiseach be using other statistics and criteria to develop the national plan?  If so, why will he not come clean and inform us of that?  In regard to regions, the Taoiseach indicated there was justification for Kerry to be included because of the county figures produced by the CSO but denied the validity of those figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If so, why are we presenting an artificial two region strategy to Europe in order to apparently grab the last penny from it?

The CSO must present the figures to EUROSTAT on a regional basis, as determined by GDP, in line with at least ten other member states which receive money in this way.  The CSO believes that when one considers the issue on a county, parish or rural basis, the figures are diluted and are not as accurate as they might be.

It behoves us to put together as good, complete and constructive a national plan as possible as we have done on two previous occasions.  In regard to areas of rural and urban disadvantage, which may or may not be included for the purposes of Objective One funding, we should endeavour to provide for any difficulties in those areas.

In terms of dealing with the difficulties perceived by the Deputy, we need to put our energies into the development of a national plan to deal with areas of marginalisation or peripherality. I have already said that 98 per cent of expenditure in the national plan will come from the Exchequer.  Funding for social programmes, in which I know Deputy Sheehan is genuinely interested, effectively comes from Europe.

      <P>This is about seeking to ensure part of the country is kept within Objective One status after 2006.  The Commission expressed opposition to regionalisation based on subsidy shopping or creative geography.  This required a relatively modest approach.  We have been criticised for taking an over-modest approach by including too many counties, but the area had to be contiguous and based on our need to put a case together.  We also took into account what the Commission had accepted on the precedent effect of the recent changes in Wales and Cornwall where decisions were grounded on peripherality. We had to put forward a coherent proposal which did not involve major changes and which had a <Col N="604" /> reasonable opportunity of gaining EUROSTAT and Commission approval.  I cannot say our application will be successful, but if we tried to include areas all over the country the application for regionalisation would have no hope.  The Commissioner expressed her views clearly at the meeting in Cork and said that if our application seemed to be based on creative geography or subsidy shopping it would get no hearing.</P>

Should we accept the figures released yesterday given their basis?

I put it to the Taoiseach that in drawing a new region, as is done in the region which includes the west of Ireland and counties Clare and Kerry, the Commissioner did not say the map of the new region could not include areas in Cork which bounded and were contiguous to the included area?

      <P>I will shortly introduce a supplementary estimate of £700,000 to increase the 1998 capital grant-in-aid to the Irish Film Board to enable it to provide additional development and production loans to meet the expanding requirements of the indigenous industry, including television production and documentary.  I am also pleased to announce that I have secured an increase in capital funding for the Irish Film Board for next year bringing its capital allocation to £4.81 million, which represents an increase of 18 per cent on the original provision for this year.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement in the film industry that project development is a key area in ensuring the future growth of the indigenous industry, and accordingly, in addition to providing additional capital resources, I have secured sanction for the appointment of a development officer at senior level in the Irish Film Board.  This appointment will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>In June of this year I established an Irish Film Industry strategic review group, known as the &ldquo;Think Tank&rdquo; to formulate recommendations for a strategic plan for the future of the Irish Film industry into the next decade.  I understand the issues raised by the Deputy are being addressed in this forum and I expect the report of the review group in January.</P>

Does she appreciate the importance <Col N="607" /> of the audio visual sector in the context of future growth, job creation and as the core of the development of the industry?  Does she agree that Enterprise Ireland should recognise the audio visual sector as the core component for the growth of this industry?  How does she propose to create strong Irish companies which can develop into this sector given that RTE and the indigenous sector are losing a large number of young people who have creativity, imagination and vision in this area?  Due to current restrictions they are unable to break into this section of the audio visual industry which is the key growth sector for jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny has asked whether I recognise the importance of the audio visual industry in Ireland.  I do and because of that the Government has shown its commitment to the film industry in a number of ways, not least in bolstering the Irish Film Board in every way possible in its work in encouraging indigenous industry here.  The screen commission was set up to ensure the film industry would be promoted not only at home but abroad and to prove that Ireland is an excellent location for film making.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the independent productions are extremely important.  RTE has a statutory obligation to set aside a specific amount each year for the commissioning of television programmes from the independent sector.  Within that sector there are many up and coming young people who are in a position to produce such programmes. That kind of production is encouraged and is recognised by the statutory obligation.</P>
      <P>There has been some confusion over the 1993 legislation with regard to the interpretation of RTE's future commitment to the independent production sector in terms of the actual figures. I had no intention of playing referee with that legislation.  I decided the best possible approach was to incorporate the whole principle of the famous 20 per cent, as it is now known, in my new broadcasting legislation which will be published shortly.  In doing that I made known that my intention was to remove the uncertainty of the 1993 legislation by providing a specific amount, £16 million, to be made available by RTE for independent commissions in 1999.  This represents a 60 per cent increase on the 1998 provision for independent commissions.  I realise the importance of the independent production sector when it comes to promoting the indigenous industry.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the federation's view that this sector can grow from £6 million to £60 million by 2004?  How did she arrive at a figure of £16 million rather than a proportionate increase basis, as originally intended, because that appears to stifle the independent sector?  Is the Minister happy that RTE, given its difficulties and the pressure and competition it is now facing, is strong and broad-minded enough to allow these young people with creative and <Col N="608" /> imaginative minds to move into this sector dealing with television, documentary, drama, international cable sales and so on?  Is she happy that RTE is not stifling the independent sector?</P>

      <P>There is great potential for growth in this sector for a number of reasons, not least because there is talent and youth in the independent production sector.  On the question of whether RTE is strong and broad-minded enough to deal with the proposals I am putting forward in my legislation concerning the independent sector and the £16 million which will come on stream for 1999, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I believe they are strong enough.</P>

      <P>The allocation provided for in the Abridged Book of Estimates for 1999 in relation to Teilifís na Gaeilge is in excess of the amount that would be payable in accordance with the formula approved by the previous Government in January 1995.

      <P>Teilifís na Gaeilge, under the overall responsibility of the RTE Authority until it is established as a separate entity, will have to develop proposals on how it might wish to develop its service in the context of digital broadcasting.  If such proposals involve increased Exchequer funding they will be carefully considered by me.</P>

      <P>An bhfuil meastachán déanta ag an Roinn ar na costais atá ag baint leis an aistriúchán go dtí an córas digiteach ag Teilifís na Gaeilge?  Sin ceist a thagann as an méid a chuir mé síos.  Ó thaobh an fheidhmiú údaraithe ag an lucht féachana, an mbeidh sé ar chumas Theilifís na Gaeilge, ag deireadh na bliana, má tharlaíonn an t-aistriúchán go córas digiteach, freastal ar 96 faoin gcéad den phobal agus 100 faoin gcéad den Ghaeltacht?</P>
      <P>My point is not just the estimated cost of the transition to digital, but what guarantees are being put in place to ensure that Teilifís na Gaeilge will assure 97 per cent coverage nationally and 100 per cent coverage in the Gaeltacht?  What is the Minister's view of the fact that the lowest increase in any Estimate head is for Teilifís na Gaeilge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>Digitalisation is a very important matter that must be addressed immediately. That is why I will have broadcasting legislation published very soon.  It is imperative to <Col N="609" /> push forward on digitalisation.  There are costs involved, but, as Deputy Higgins will be aware, it means greater opportunities for the enhancement of reception.  It will also mean an increased reception ability for people all over the country.  Universality is very important.  Reception is now at approximately 97 per cent for RTE, and it is important that Teilifís na Gaeilge is available to as many viewers as possible across the country.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amount of funding available, the abridged Book of Estimates for 1999 will show that £11.5 million for current expenditure and £200,000 for capital expenditure compares very well with the present expenditure, which is £10.6 million and £200,000 for capital expenditure for 1998.  I and the Government would be happy to give more money to Teilifís na Gaeilge, but the current increases are greater than if we had followed the formula set out in 1995.  On 20 January 1995 the Government urged that Exchequer expenditure of £10 million be provided for Teilifís na Gaeilge's running costs in 1996 and 1997, and thereafter £10 million annually, adjusted upwards to take account of inflation.  Taking the annual inflators provided by the Department of Finance at Estimate time, the original £10 million would be worth £11.2 million in 1999.  No provision for increase was made in the Government decision, and the £11.7 million I have been able to give is £500,000, or two years, ahead of the Government decision of that time.  Knowing the Deputy's commitment to Teilifís na Gaeilge, he will welcome the substantial and significant increase in the money allocated to that body.</P>

My question related to the adequacy of the funding to Teilifís na Gaeilge to enable it to complete its existing commitment to programmes. I have not had a satisfactory answer, and I believe the Minister has had a view expressed to her Department from Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>I also asked about the adequacy of funding, capital and current, to enable the transition to digital.  The Minister will agree that that was not the issue in 1995.  Now that the Minister is taking up this issue &mdash; I appreciate her interest in digitalisation &mdash; she mentioned upcoming broadcasting legislation.  Will there be an independent electronic programme guide that will have a must carry clause for Telilifís na Gaeilge?  Will it be a requirement in that legislation that any licences to be considered will have a must carry clause relating to the national services, including Teilifís na Gaeilge?</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins asked if I believed that the increase in funding would enable Teilifís na Gaeilge to carry out its work, given that it faces the digital age.  As we know, the procedure was that RTE was to provide one hour's programming free of charge to Teilifís na Gaeilge and, in line with the increases for Teilifís na Gaeilge, that will help to alleviate any problems in providing funding for the station.  I can put Deputy Higgins's mind at rest on the must carry clause, though we will be able to discuss the broadcasting legislation in detail.</P>

      <P>When I established the Irish Film Industry Strategic Review Group last June on foot of a commitment in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to establish an industry think tank, I assigned it the following terms of reference: Having regard to the fact that the statutory authority for the section 481 scheme, formerly section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, expires at the end of the current fiscal year: to carry out an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of the existing schemes and incentives to develop the industry; to analyse and identify the fundamental issues facing the industry and to make recommendations in regard to future measures in support of the film industry; and to formulate a strategic plan for the future of the film industry into the next decade.</P>
      <P>An interim report on the section 481 measure which was submitted to me in September this year recommended the retention of section 481. Furthermore, the report of the independent economic consultant examination commissioned by my Department at the request of the think tank has just been received by me.  I am referring this report to the think tank to assist it in its examination of existing schemes and incentives.  I am also having this report examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins, when Minister, was responsible in a major way for enabling the film industry to thrive.  Why was it necessary to change the name from section 35 to section 481? Section 35 was an internationally branding instrument that was clearly understood within the film sector.  From the Minister's examination of the interim report, is it not clear that with 4,000 full time and 4,000 part time workers in the film industry, it is now important to extend the section's provision which allows a clear timeframe for those in the film industry?  The film product can then be sold.  If this is not done, the Minister will allow uncertainty to creep into the <Col N="611" /> industry.  Does the Minister intend extending section 481 based on the interim report and, if so, when?</P>

      <P>Reference to section 481 refers to a section in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1998. It is popularly known as section 35, which refers to section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987.  I asked the think thank to give me an interim report on the question of the continuation of what is colloquially known as section 35 as soon as possible. It did that and I explained that in my reply.  The final report will go into far greater detail on analysis and identifying the fundamental issues in the film world.  It is also part of the remit of the think tank to formulate a strategic plan for the next decade.  It submitted an interim report on section 35 and will submit a full report next year. My views on this issue do not matter, what matters is what the Government will decide on this issue.  The Deputy can be assured that these issues are being considered by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a decision on this matter, I take it from the Minister's reply that she will have to wait until she gets the final report from the board and the think tank.  That means there will be a period between when the section 481 scheme will lapse at the end of this fiscal year and when the final report is submitted.  The Minister said her views on this do not matter, but if it is her view that this provision should be extended, will she put forward a request to that effect to Government and allow the film industry to continue its work with a degree of confidence in the knowledge that the section 481 scheme will be extended by Government order for a five or ten year period?  She should do that now to avoid the uncertainty that will be created in the industry as a consequence of it not knowing the Government's decision on this section.</P>

      <P>With regard to the number of people permanently resident on our islands, I refer the Deputy to pages 128 and 129 of &ldquo;Census 96 Population Classified by Area&rdquo;, Volume 1.</P>
      <P>I am in the process of implementing an action plan to address the needs of our islands as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium. Earlier this year I announced assistance of almost £2 million towards various minor works on islands.  This programme of works is being carried out in partnership with local authorities. Access to the mainland was one of the main issues raised with me on the various occasions I met island communities and their representatives. Since I was given responsibility for the offshore islands I have provided significant funding for access, including more than £1.7 million towards the inhabited islands off the coast of County Cork and for the first time ferry services servicing Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island have been subsidised.</P>
      <P>Through the Interdepartmental Committee on the Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish Language, the implementation of Government policy on offshore islands is co-ordinated to ensure it is implemented in an effective manner.  As chairman of this committee I will continue to endeavour to ensure equal access to services such as health, education, water, roads, electricity, refuse collection etc., for our island communities.  The provision of essential services and the promotion of economic and social development on the islands are vital in securing the future of our offshore islands.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I obtained an increase of 52 per cent in funding for the offshore islands in the Estimates recently announced.  This funding will assist me in continuing the work which I have already outlined.</P>

      <P>We have tried to deal with a number of issues.  One of the first issues with which I was concerned was bonding between adults and children.  If children are taken off the islands at the age of 12 and sent to boarding schools with no opportunity to get home at weekends, the bond between them, the island and their homes is immediately broken.  As the Deputy is aware with regard to Sherkin Island, new arrangements were made to facilitate children going to school in the morning and coming home in the evening so that people would not have to leave the island to provide secondary education for their children.</P>
      <P>For example, I am currently looking at Inismaan where there is a new arrangement.  Pupils travel to Inisheer on a five day basis but I am trying to improve this.  Subsidised weekend services have been arranged for the first time for Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare Island, which are guaranteed throughout the winter months to ensure children can get home at weekends.  My proposal involves five rather than seven day boarding.  The schooling available on Inisheer has been extended to include the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The next issue to be dealt with was physical access and for that reason I did not include the piers in Cork.  Eight small islands do not have an electricity supply and I hope to deal with that matter in the near future.  The Deputy referred to cost of living and I assure him that the islander's allowance is under very active consideration.  We are also looking at transport within the islands in terms of the cost of maintaining cars, new regulations relating to DOE and the cost of tax and insurance of cars on the islands.  We do not want untaxed or uninsured cars but paying mainland rates poses difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to business on the islands, I wanted to make access in and out possible in terms of services.  However, we must move on to <Col N="616" /> provide employment.  Telecom Éireann is providing ISDN lines on some islands.  That is to be welcomed as it is a huge step forward.  Until now many services on islands, funded with money from the islanders, were provided from the mainland. I was thrilled when I visited Inishbofin and many other islands to find that 17 people had been given continuous infrastructural work this year, which was traditionally done by bringing people in from the mainland.  It has proved a major boon on the islands.  Even on that level significant employment has been generated by asking local authorities, which have been most co-operative, to provide work as far as possible for the labour force on the islands with our funds. This has provided a considerable economic boost on the islands.  There is a great deal to be done but if we continue in this direction, there will be a population increase.  I do not know whether the Deputy has other suggestions but I would be interested in them.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's heart is in the right place and I encourage him to continue his work.  However, as a result of measures taken by him and others the island population has been stabilised.  Should targets be set to increase the population?

      <P>I am reluctant to hold the matter up by considering a White Paper.  Many people, particularly in peripheral areas, would say that if plans or White Papers, etc, would solve their problems, they would have been solved 50 years ago.  We have a simple, effective work programme. The islanders in the Deputy's constituency will tell him that we have been very aggressive about delivering what they need on the ground.  When I run out of things to do with all the money I have been given &mdash; there has been a huge increase this year &mdash; that will be the time to think about a White Paper.  We are a long way from that.  There is a heavy agenda of work on which we should concentrate.  Aside from the work we are doing, I do not know if the Deputy is suggesting that we give out Viagra on the islands to people for free to try to increase the population.</P>

Of course, I agree with him in terms of providing the leaving certificate.

As he is aware, the school on Inisheer is a VEC school, and island schools have traditionally been allocated under the normal system through the VEC, the same as on the mainland &mdash; this was true when Deputy Higgins was the Minister.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and as a consequence I have already raised this issue, the Deputy will be happy to hear, through the interdepartmental committee with the Department of Education and Science.  I have asked it to consider the difficulties on the islands when applying mainland criteria for the provision of teachers.  When I met representatives of island schools I explained this was what we were doing.  We tried to get the best possible for this year under the old regime, which operated in Deputy Higgins's time as Minister, but in conjunction with the Department of Education of Science we will have to consider providing a special regime for the islands, because they will never have large pupil numbers but will still have to provide a wide curriculum.

      <P>I join in Deputy Timmins question. In none of the Minister of State's replies on the islands did he mention Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann, the federation of the islands, or the worthiness of its promotional work.  Does he have proposals for the federation or has it been further demoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, I assure the Deputy that I maintain continuous contact with Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann and the various bodies working on individual islands.  That has been crucial to our work to make the islands participants in what they are doing for themselves.  As he is aware, we are actively considering proposals to give islanders more control over island affairs.  That goes back <Col N="620" /> to what I said about employment &mdash; as far as possible, islanders should be employed and benefit from island money.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Timmins, the genesis for Galway County Council's proposal of a £1 tax was from the islanders themselves &mdash; it was part of a system they proposed to fund a worthy recycling project.  In conjunction with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann I am willing to look with a totally open mind at the manner of financing islands, collecting revenue on them, and self-development. It amazes me that most of the criticism of this man came from outside Inis Mór, because the plan was promoted by the people of the island as a way of solving a problem and of providing an important service.  Before people rush to judgment they should talk to Comhcumann Inis Mór, Galway County Council and the Department about what the islanders think about this proposal, because if it did frighten away the tourists it is the islanders who would lose.  Many people would be surprised by the answer.</P>
      <P>We must look at sustainable tourism development on the islands, because we will not maintain them unless there is balanced development.  We must attract tourists who are likely to stay and must increase bed nights on the island.  Anyone who knows the islands knows it is good that money has been provided to Inis Mór to look at sustainable tourism.  It has had bigger numbers than any other island, but it has been argued that the islanders themselves have not benefited <i>pro rata</i> from that increase in numbers over the years.</P>

      <P>In answering this question I am assuming the definition of museum relates to institutions that are systematically collecting artefacts in three-dimensional form that are evidence of Ireland's past.  Given this delineation the National Museum of Ireland is the only body under the aegis of my Department that comes within the scope of the definition.

      <P>I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  I commend his view on regionalisation to give people the opportunity to see artefacts that are of interest to their own area and to have them remain in their own areas. However, as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I have to reiterate that the museum which comes under the aegis of my Department is the National Museum of Ireland. According to that definition, local museums are not the responsibility of my Department.  This is analogous to the position of the Arts Council and the Heritage Council &mdash; both have a specific remit and come under the aegis of the Department but they are independent in their functions. The Deputy might have in mind the CDIS funding which gave an opportunity to further regionalise facilities in the arts and in heritage generally.  That was one of the opportunities afforded, in the 39 projects that have been accepted under the CDIS funding, to regionalise the arts and heritage.  My responsibility as Minister is for the National Museum.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Third Level Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Shea on Tuesday, 24 November 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the severe difficulty that students from low and middle income families now face in funding their third level education due to rapidly escalating accommodation costs, calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive package of emergency measures to tackle this crisis.  These measures should include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a substantial increase in income eligibility limits for student maintenance grants, with eligibility calculated on net as distinct from gross pay.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the introduction of a graduated system of entitlement to maintenance grants, with a substantial increase in the size of the maximum grant available;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a programme for the provision of good quality student accommodation in universities and institutes of technology, involving both direct State aid and tax incentives for the private sector; and &mdash; the abolition of the student registration fee.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Education and Science should undertake a review of policy with a view to ensuring a more equitable and rational geographical distribution of student numbers throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the significant expansion in funding for further and higher education, particularly relating to the creation of extra places, and believes that:</P>
    <P>&mdash; there is a need for increased dedicated student accommodation, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; additional resources for student support should be targeted at increasing participation by the most disadvantaged groups.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity, however brief, to contribute to this debate.  I want to speak on a specific aspect of the motion before the House.  That aspect relates to student accommodation. It is clear that the problem relating to student accommodation has reached crisis point. Every August parents and students travel to Dublin, to Cork, to Galway looking for adequate, safe, secure accommodation for the academic year ahead.  It is appalling that we face this crisis year in, year out.  While successive Governments have increased the number of college places, which I welcome, we have not made adequate provision for student accommodation.  I particularly congratulate the Union of Students in Ireland on the campaign they launched in September and October to highlight the crisis of student accommodation.</P>
      <P>With imagination the Government could resolve this problem.  I wish to put to the House this evening ways in which we could solve it. There are many large homes throughout Dublin which could be utilised by giving students the opportunity to stay there.  There are many elderly people living in large residences with bedrooms not being used, but they will not take on students or any other tenants because they would lose their living alone allowance and other secondary benefits that they get.  The Government should immediately look at that area.  In particular, it needs to target tax benefits at people who take in fixed or low income groups as tenants.  Many young people are struggling to pay monthly mortgages and they would be delighted to take in students for six or eight months if an incentive existed.  However, such an incentive is not offered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government to consider the amount of State land around many third level colleges. An audit of this land should be carried out to find out whether it is possible to use it for student accommodation.  It is a scandal that Ireland offers one of the lowest levels of student accommodation <Col N="625" /> in Europe.  If one goes to Northern Ireland or any other part of the European Union, one will see large amounts of on campus, residential accommodation.  It is almost non-existent in the State and something should be done about it.  I urge the House to support the motion.  We should do everything in our power to increase the amount of student accommodation available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this timely motion.  The hard fact which must be faced in relation to higher education is that higher education is only for the relatively privileged in society.  Despite the fact that a rate of almost 50 per cent participation in third level has been achieved, it is still the case that people from the higher social groups are the predominant participants.  For example, 87 per cent of the children of unskilled manual workers do not reach third level education in any shape or form. The contrasts between people on high and low incomes are startling.</P>
      <P>The child of an unskilled manual background is 16 times more likely to leave school without sitting the leaving certificate, more than four times more likely not to get sufficient results in the leaving certificate to go to college and three times less likely to get to college even with sufficient qualifications.  At every turn in the education system, children from more disadvantaged and lower income backgrounds are failing to get through.  There is an onus on the House and particularly the Government to ask why that is the case.</P>
      <P>A large part of it relates to the lack of a proper support structure for children from less wealthy families to get through the education system.  The only support mechanism at third level is the higher education maintenance grant system.  It has proved itself woefully inadequate in respect of those at the lowest level of income.  The cost of participation at third level, even on the most conservative calculation, is £2,000 a year if one is living at home.  Many people estimate that the cost is much higher, but even that figure is more than three times the maintenance grant.  If one is living away from home, the minimum cost is £4,500.  This is also almost three times the maintenance grant.  There is a yawning gap between what the State provides and what it costs to send a student to college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unsurprising, therefore, that families from lower income backgrounds do not consider third level participation as something for which they should hope or expect.  We must remedy this and it is the priority, above all else, in the third level education system.  It is fine for the Minister to pat himself on the back for introducing various schemes and research grants and making large investments in the third level sector.  The sector is already well endowed in comparison to other European countries.  Ireland spends more per student than any other country and we have a very good system.  However, unfortunately, many students are not getting through because they <Col N="626" /> cannot afford to be part of this well resourced system which has a high reputation.  This must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a commitment to address the needs of disadvantaged people, but it has not gone beyond the drawing board.  There was a commitment in the White Paper that 500 students from non-traditional backgrounds would go through the third level system each year, with the number increasing each year.  However, the total to date is 80, which is well short of the target. The Minister appeared to seek praise last week for his announcement that he would spend £800,000 on assisting children from disadvantaged backgrounds to get into third level.  That represents approximately 0.2 per cent of spending in third level and the Minister expected us to accept that he is making a genuine effort to address disadvantage in the third level sector.  However, that is not the case.  Students on low incomes cannot get accommodation or afford to buy books.  They cannot afford bus fares.  There is a need for a more radical consideration of this area.</P>
    <P>Some people ridiculed my proposal that a youth education wage related to income should be paid to early school leavers and students in the early years of college.  This is the way forward.  If we want to address the issue of why people from lower income backgrounds are staying away from third level, we must think and act radically.  Pussyfooting around with the schemes that are already in place will not make the necessary impact.</P>
    <P>The colleges must also pull up their socks in this area.  They have many innovative schemes, but they are still on a minor scale.  The colleges have an obligation to address the needs of students from low income backgrounds.  Compared to other European countries, Ireland is unique in having very few second chance or mature students at second or third levels.  Those options are closed off in Ireland.  However, mature students make up 50 per cent of the participants in many colleges in the UK, on which we are fond of pouring opprobrium from time to time.  It has opened up the system and welcomed mature and second chance students.  It has a much more inclusive approach to third level education and Ireland needs to consider it closely.</P>
    <P>We also need to consider some of the very successful models developed by the partnership companies and to start mainstreaming pilot projects. Ireland is a great country for setting up pilot projects, but these initiatives never come of age although the Department says it will adopt them. In my area, the northside partnership has a tremendous scheme.  The running cost is only £60,000 and it helps students with bus fares, the price of books and other small items, the things which make the difference between students being able to participate or not.  Such schemes should be mainstreamed so students can access them.  The hardship fund is rarely obtained.  It is unsatisfactory because it is known to be difficult to secure and it is not administered through the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> There is also a need to consider the issues surrounding the recognition of certification for access to third level.  Proper access is not given to people who come through the voluntary and community adult education programmes.  This aspect must be addressed.  The huge problems at third level need to be dealt with and while the Minister is spending money in this area, his priorities are wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Flynn, Pat Carey, Moynihan, Michael Ahern, McGuinness and Brian Lenihan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the House is discussing education for the second week in a row in Private Members' time.  However, last week some Opposition Deputies said capitation grants at primary level were too low and too much was being spent on third level education.  This week the Government is being attacked for spending too little on third level.  I hope more funding will be secured for third level because it is most important.</P>
      <P>I welcome much of the Labour Party's motion which mentions net income for the eligibility limits for student maintenance grants.  The Government has introduced a measure under which net income is used to determine eligibility for family income supplement.  The previous Administration did nothing about that matter.  I hope the Government will move towards using net income in this area.</P>
      <P>The motion raises the issue of how means tests are carried out for various grants and benefits.  If one applies for a medical card, one is allowed to include the cost of travelling to and from work as an expense.  One cannot do this in the case of higher education grants.  This is not mentioned in the motion.  I know of many people in rural areas who have to travel up to 40 miles to and from work.  Because of the failure of the previous Government to raise income eligibility thresholds in tandem with abolishing fees many students do not qualify for maintenance grants as their parents' income is £5, £10 or £20 above the limit. This issue should be addressed.</P>
      <P>The availability of student accommodation is a serious issue.  Increasing grants across the board is not the answer as those most in need would not be targeted.  Deputy Hayes referred to the Bacon report on the housing crisis.  The Government should consider commissioning a similar report on the private rental sector.  The Union of Students in Ireland has raised the issue of a student housing association, a concept that works well in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the extension of maintenance grants to PLC students.  About two thirds of the 20,000 students involved will benefit.  An additional 8,000 third level places have been provided this year.  Although many colleges have attracted private sector investment in college buildings, the NUI in Galway continues to use prefabricated buildings for lectures while there have been protests in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology <Col N="628" /> about the need for investment in facilities.  The Government should consider this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Minister in his approach to the motion.  Like my colleagues, I would wish to introduce measures to make life easier and more affordable for students, including a substantial increase in maintenance grants, but I would also wish to wave a magic wand to resolve the crisis in student accommodation brought about by the tiger economy.  As we are all aware, this cannot be done in one swift step, it can only be done on a phased basis.  That is the path we must take.</P>
      <P>We must strike a balance between our wish for major advances in education and the economic reality.  The Minister has chosen to travel this road.  This does not mean that he is unwilling to invest in education.  He has made massive funds available since taking office.  He has shown total dedication through his enormous work rate in meeting various challenges.  His performance speaks for itself.  It is without parallel.</P>
      <P>The Minister has planned a massive injection of capital and allotted huge sums to ensure we are prepared to meet the challenges of the new millennium.  Educational establishments have hailed his innovative approach to third level research and development programmes.  He has honoured his commitment on PLC grants. Nobody can question his commitment to ensuring the disadvantaged are able to access third level institutions.  He has undertaken to introduce a properly researched policy on student accommodation and hopes to be in a position to present initial proposals shortly.  He has taken positive steps to ensure the eventual recommendations of the commission on the points system will be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the impact the Minister has made on the education scene in Cork city and county and throughout the country.  He has given institute of technology status to that most respected of institutions, the former Cork Regional Technical College, which was bypassed by the previous Government in a shabby political manoeuvre which did not work.</P>
      <P>The Minister has guaranteed the installation of modern technological equipment in schools throughout the country.  He has made grants available to upgrade schools nationwide.  There is evidence of this in my constituency.  He has travelled far and wide and is known in schools and colleges throughout the country.  His track record in identifying with those on the ground is second to none.  I have seen him greeted by the youngest pupil and the most advanced third level student with equal enthusiasm.  They know his face, respect and like him.  I doubt if this could be said about any previous Minister for Education, except the late Donogh O'Malley.  Those involved in the education system sing his praises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of this I cannot understand the reasoning behind the motion.  The Labour Party, and other members of the Opposition, should have <Col N="629" /> the courage to say that the Minister is doing a superb job.  Instead the Labour Party is seeking to come up with propositions to implement changes which it did not see fit to introduce when in office.  Has it produced costings?  It did nothing to support the USI on its proposals on grants when in office, rather it did the opposite by introducing a policy of grant limitation as well as registration changes.  It now wants to abolish them.  It did nothing to advance the concept of a central grants authority on which the Minister is working and for which the USI has campaigned.</P>
    <P>Education was given a low priority by the previous Government.  The Labour Party did nothing to address the issue of student accommodation.  It now wants the Government to spend vast unspecified sums on accommodation without researching the most effective methods to curtail costs for students.  Spending vast sums in this way will only serve to worsen the situation.</P>
    <P>The conscience of the Labour Party has awoken.  It always does in Opposition.  It can, however, make one claim to consistency without blushing.  It can always state that it adheres to the policy of the U-turn and double think.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister's education policy and the programme he will deliver during the lifetime of the Government.  I hope the House will do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Labour Party has finally recognised the true costs for students attending third level.  The barrier for many of those on low and middle incomes was never third level fees but the cost of trying to survive, accommodation, transport, books and equipment as well as a few pounds to participate in the rich social life of our colleges, clubs and societies.  For students who come from less well-off families so-called free fees means nothing, they would have had their fees covered by a grant.  Three years have elapsed since the so-called free fees initiative was introduced.  There is no evidence that it has resulted in a single additional student from a disadvantaged background proceeding to third level.</P>
      <P>I challenge Labour Party Members to defend the former Labour Minister's decision and to show where it has contributed to greater access to higher education.  It remains the sad reality that if one comes from a higher professional background, one has a 90 per cent chance of going to college whereas if one comes from an unskilled, working class family one's chances are fewer than one in six.</P>
      <P>When the former Labour Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, decided her priorities for third level she gave greater benefit to the son or daughter of a barrister or bank manager than a member of a family trapped by unemployment and poverty. She ignored the plight of PLC students and was forced to meet representatives of evening and part-time students only when she was defeated in a vote in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So-called free fees for undergraduates have <Col N="630" /> meant that third level institutions have targeted postgraduates for additional income.  In the past three years postgraduate fees have jumped by over one quarter, five times the rate of inflation. The former Labour Minister removed this source of income but failed to give enough to ensure colleges could support and develop a much needed research base.  The Minister has introduced a much needed humanities research scholarship scheme and in recent days a budget of £180 million to develop research in higher education.</P>
    <P>The former Labour Minister commissioned a report, the de Buitleir report, to look at student financial support.  One would think that in examining this issue it would determine whether the levels of support were adequate and whether the thresholds at which someone qualifies should be improved but it did not.  A colleague of those who have tried to take the high moral ground today specifically excluded those considerations.</P>
    <P>Among other matters, the de Buitleir report recommended that eligibility should be based on net rather than gross income and that there should be a sliding scale of entitlement but these suggestions with other proposals aimed at speeding up payments were ignored by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Democratic Left when in power.  The Labour Party now regards them as part of a comprehensive package of emergency measures.</P>
    <P>Student hardship and difficulties in finding accommodation did not arise when the former Labour Minister left office.  One of her parting gestures was to increase the minimum third level grant by less than 2 per cent.  She failed to include a student representative in the de Buitleir group and also resisted student requests that a representative be appointed to the Higher Education Authority.  I am happy the Minster rectified the matter last year by appointing <i>ex officio</i> the president of the USI to the HEA.  I understand the contribution made by the current president has been substantial.</P>
    <P>Unlike his predecessor, the Minister is committed to student representation as of right at the highest levels of decision making in education.  I challenge Deputy Quinn, a signatory to the motion, to explain why it refers to increasing grants and eligibility limits as emergency measures.  When he was in a position to deliver on these issues as Minister for Finance he received a pre-budget submission from the National Youth Council of Ireland, the USI and students unions across the country urging him to increase grants. Indeed, even Labour Youth urged this course of action.  Why did he do nothing to prevent the current difficulties?</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party was in Government its method of addressing a combination of difficulties facing students was to introduce a £40 registration fee for each flat.  Although this system has not worked it has forced some landlords and landladies out of the market, thus making accommodation more difficult to find.  When the registration <Col N="631" /> fee is paid the cost is invariably passed on to the tenant.</P>
    <P>I accept that the third level grant is an insufficient amount on which to live.  Unlike my colleagues opposite, I have known for some time of the financial difficulties that face many students. Anybody who listens to Tom Mitchell of Trinity College or Pat Clancy of UCD, or who reads his excellent reports, or sees how access programmes, such as the Ballymun initiative for third level education, the Limerick community based education initiative, the Trinity access project or the Outreach programmes of the National College of Ireland, work will know the problems and challenges to be faced and how they can be tackled and overcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made tackling disadvantage in education one of his key priorities.  The decision to extend the third level grants scheme to PLC students was long overdue and will benefit a significant majority of the 20,000 plus students taking those courses.  The Minister has also increased the number of places in our universities and colleges and has ensured that northwest Dublin will now have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Prioritising access to education has always been a cornerstone of Fianna Fáil policy, from the establishment of the former regional technical colleges to the introduction of the grants scheme to its extension to PLC students.  I am confident this will continue to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and to speak on education for the second week running.  The previous Government's introduction of free third level fees for all, from the very rich to those on the poverty line, was a mistake.  A former Minister for Education in the 1950s who came from my home village said that the only way out of the depression of the 1950s was to educate young people.  The availability of education to the less well off in our society and the encouragement we can give them is of vital importance because it will ensure they will get out of the poverty trap that their families, perhaps going back over previous generations, have been in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with student accommodation has been ongoing for longer than the past 18 months. When members of my family went to college the basic level of accommodation available to students was deplorable.  Substandard accommodation was provided by landlords charging increasing rents.  If the maintenance grant for <Col N="632" /> third level colleges was to be increased in line with the motion it would only get into the hands of landlords.  A balanced approach is required to ensure that any increase in the grant should be made in the right way as part of a planned strategy.</P>
    <P>To judge by what has been said on Private Members' Business during this week and last week one would think that education was not given any recognition by the Government.  Yet, it is the one area that has secured dramatic increases in funding over the past 18 months, which I welcome because we have neglected the education system for too long.  It provides a foundation for every young person.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months there have been major initiatives in education.  The Minister has introduced major new ideas which he has acted upon. The Book of Estimates provides for an increase in IT expenditure, which is the way forward for education, be it primary, second level, third level or adult education.  More resources have also been provided to primary schools, which have been neglected for so long.</P>
    <P>The problem in most national schools, especially in my constituency, centres on large class sizes.  This is most noticeable in the higher classes, from fourth class onwards, which often contain as many as 35 pupils.  The Minister has undertaken to provide more resources and to regulate this area.  I congratulate him for what he is doing and what he continues to do.</P>
    <P>If we are to do something with maintenance grants it must be done on the basis of a proper co-ordinated report which will ensure that any increase in funding to students does not fall into the hands of those landlords who provide substandard accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Labour Party on moving this motion because it gives us the opportunity to debate third level education, including funding by the Department and the accommodation issue.  Given the record of the Minister, I doubt if many holes can be picked in the argument against the development of the whole area of education, and not only third level.</P>
      <P>Many people involved in third level education throughout the country can be seen on a weekly basis catching buses and trains to return to the overcrowded urban centres where their colleges are located.  We need to focus on and debate that problem.  What strikes me is that so many of our young people must avail of transport and head back to overcrowded urban centres where very high rates are being charged for accommodation. This represents a loss of these young people to their local communities and also a loss of revenue to that community.  It is a poor spend in terms of Government investment.  The Government will have to look at trends emerging in the provision of third level education, particularly in relation to information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimate today I highlighted the fact that outreach centres are <Col N="633" /> being demanded by people in rural areas away from the urban centres where education is delivered at the moment.  I would like to highlight a project in Carlow-Kilkenny where Kilkenny College, NUI Maynooth and the Carlow Institute of Technology have come together to provide a proper outreach facility in the college.  Through NUI Maynooth it has linked up with Armagh and Queen's University and it provides various course.  This project could be a pilot one if the Government in its wisdom decides to examine the case and take it on.  It could easily become a pilot project funded by the Government whereby proper analysis may take place.</P>
    <P>This project, which is up and running and is supported financially by local business people and the local authority with the support of the local community, is looking forward in terms of its development.  It anticipates a spend of almost £0.5 million in terms of the provision of the proper infrastructure to deliver the courses in Kilkenny College.  People who could not access a third level facility are now doing so in Kilkenny. People who in their earlier years found themselves marginalised and out of touch with education are now at a late age able and willing to come back into the education system, brush up on their skills and allow themselves to be introduced, through information technology, to the various courses they want to access.  The success rate to date has been quite remarkable in so far as there is a take up of the courses.</P>
    <P>The launch of the modular BA in local and community studies in autumn 1997 attracted 50 mature students.  A second cycle of students was recruited in 1998.  The diploma in youth and community work, a three year professional training programme, was launched in January 1998 with an enrolment of 16 students.  No State money is being utilised and yet both Carlow Institute of Technology and NUI Maynooth are contributing to the success story which this project now is.  I ask, and have done before during debates in the House, that the Department take serious stock of what is happening in Kilkenny, use it as a pilot project and fund it.  The moneys required are small in terms of the success a local community is having in providing a third level facility.</P>
    <P>As regards information technology, the country is now gearing itself up to get involved in e-commerce. This is a unique opportunity to include an institute of technology funded by the Government. This would give value for money and at the same time establish a reasonable base for a third facility as an outreach centre.  I commend the Minister on what he has done but there are other areas which we could examine and where the country and the education system can benefit.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue. As we are all aware, education is the rock on which this country has developed.  It is essential that all levels of the education system are funded properly so that our young people will be taught <Col N="634" /> properly and will receive the necessary education to ensure the continued growth of our economy. I notice from the Labour Party motion that we are not spending enough money on third level education.  Last week some Members complained that too much money was being spent on third level education as against the other levels.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will note there has been more growth in every sector of the education field than in the previous five years.  In the past year and a half more than £600 million has been invested in capital funding which is a significant amount.  It is due to the third level sector and I hope the Minister will continue that growth over the next few years.  There has been fine and badly needed development at Cork Institute of Technology.  Up to 15,000 or 16,000 students attend that college which was built for approximately 5,000 students but over the years, there was no real development of the facilities available there.</P>
      <P>We should widely acknowledge the investment announced in research and development.  The growth of areas such as information technology, chemistry and so on depends on research and development.  If we do not provide resources to the colleges to produce students with qualifications to carry out research and development, companies like Siemens and Philips will send our students to other countries and will utilise their abilities there, which happened in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  The £180 million voted for research and development will ensure the best of our graduates stay at home where they will use their qualifications in the Irish economy, which will ensure the economy remains in the excellent state it is now in.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Minister was not present to hear the extraordinary praise heaped on him in the past hour.  Nobody in Irish history has been praised more except perhaps Daniel O'Connell although even he had an occasional detractor.  It is said that people faint at the sound of the Minister's name in every part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> With the greatest respect to the speeches I heard, this motion is about an issue which is very current and urgent.  The motion refers to the crisis about which we speak &mdash; the recent accommodation crisis and the rapidly escalating costs.  I will introduce a note of bathos by saying that I live in a university city.  I know how practical it is for landlords who are now charging per person instead of renting houses to students.  In every shop in my locality you can see that the price per person has gone through the roof.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the speeches.  I believe that third level education at a university or any institution is about more than facilitating growth in the economy.  I was a university teacher for 23 years and the deterioration in the quality of third level life is one of the things which disappoints me most at present.  Even those who are involved in clubs and societies are having great difficulty in finding people to attend.  As I said, I was a teacher for over 20 years before the enormous expansion of the bus services which now bring people home from third level institutions, mostly for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>I live now in a city where the students are being exploited right, left and centre in relation to accommodation costs.  All the puffing up of the reputation of the local TD and favourite Minister will not answer the question that the housing crisis has knocked onto the rental sector which has in turn knocked onto the cost of students putting a roof over their heads.  That is what this motion is about.  It is not about relative reputations &mdash; wonderful dear Micheál and big bad Niamh &mdash; it is about the cost of living for students.  The motion indicates how this might be addressed by making specific proposals in relation to grant increases.</P>
    <P>The parties in Government will have to decide whether they want to reintroduce fees and whether they are in favour of free education.  If you look at the qualifications for the average job now, the labour market is looking for people qualified at third level.  That means that the formation of possibilities or prospects for full participation in society is dependent more and more on satisfactory completion of that particular level.  If we are talking about making it possible for people to complete their education, we must talk about that.</P>
    <P>We also have to talk, perhaps on another day, about the neo-utilitarianism, which I reject, subscribed to by many third level authorities.  A person is entitled to a third level education beyond the narrow needs and possibilities of the economy of the day.  One could take all this wind about research and development and say that unless you have the capacity for creating the basic skills in relation to the sciences, culture and the arts, you will not have the flexibility to be able to move through the opportunities which will be thrown up in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> The nub of this motion is the deterioration in the capacity of students to live, particularly due to the accommodation crisis.  On 22 October in a Dáil reply, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the successor of Parnell and O'Connell, admitted that his Department had &ldquo;not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third level college&rdquo;.  It ill behoves the large band of followers who are supporting their hero to come in this afternoon and say that he is the greatest thing to hit the island since the arrival of St. Patrick, given that he told us on 22 October that his Department had not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third level college. Maybe he is too busy picking up the bodies of those who have fainted at his arrival at the different institutions around the country.</P>
    <P>In real terms the value of third level grants has decreased in purchasing power.  This titan of education gave a grant increase of 77p per week and students on an adjacent grant received 36p per week.  I am sure they have been going wild on it ever since it was announced.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we try to deal with this matter reasonably.  The housing crisis did not manifest itself until recently.  I want to be fair to both Governments of which I was a member. It would be ridiculous not to acknowledge that what has happened in housing has knocked onto the public and private rental sector, particularly where it affects students.  That was manifested in autumn in every place where third level students were seeking accommodation.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the issue of the grant.  Let us have consensus in relation to the tiered structure of the grant as a desirable reform of what it is at present.  Instead of receiving 100 per cent and 50 per cent, there could be a graduated structure of 25 per cent and 75 per cent added as tiers of qualification.  I thought until this afternoon that there was agreement on the desirability of net rather than gross income being used as the criterion for qualification, in so far as it so clearly discriminates against those whose every pound of gross earnings is taxed and declared, but obviously that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I want to argue against something which is pernicious and ill serves us as a country that makes statements about the quality of our education. We do not have to set excellence, provision or inclusion at one level in competition with another.  The suggestion that the most effective way of eliminating disadvantage is by investing at pre-primary and primary level is not contested by me or anyone else in the Labour Party, but it is outrageous that those students who have made it to third level are driven into conditions of bad shelter, unable to afford accommodation, in order to satisfy the funding requirements of the other levels of education.  Setting education up as a war among the poorest is outrageous.  The argument is that the much vaunted performance of the economy would not be possible without those who have often undergone their education at great personal cost.  The surpluses of the economy <Col N="637" /> should adequately fund education.  The argument that education should now be satisfactory and for life very much includes third level.  The surpluses exist and there is an opportunity to do what is demanded in this motion without indulging in the politics of envy.</P>
    <P>As someone who represents a constituency where third level institutions are located, where I see students regularly in connection with the accommodation in which they are forced to live, I am appalled that those who own accommodation have been so exploitative of the students' position. The big change in Galway this year was that instead of houses being available to rent to groups of students, they are now advertised to rent on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has arrived, hallelujah.  I will now conclude to facilitate my two colleagues but I am sure there will be an opportunity for the hymn of praise to resume with the Minister present to hear it.  In the meantime I urge those who are in any way interested in student life and accommodation to accept this motion for what it is, a request for an overdue reform of maintenance grants for students.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Ahern it struck me that accountants play a prominent role in this Government.  The bottom line for the Government seems to be a crass cost effective benefit rather than looking at the overall problems in education and the economy.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Fianna Fáil speakers, I am not at all impressed with the record of the Minister for Education and Science.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on his recent initiative in adult education which is both timely and welcome.  If, however, we look back over the past 18 months, the Minister, Deputy Martin, has blatantly failed to deliver on any of the promises made by his party and the Progressive Democrats Party in An Action Programme for the Millennium. We are still campaigning for a widespread pre-school system.  We hope the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will make some helpful remarks on that area next week.  In the primary sector, despite all the Minister's promises, we still have grossly overcrowded classrooms, leaking roofs and bad accommodation in many areas 18 months later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>My trade union is bitterly disappointed with the progress the Minister has made over the past 18 months in addressing some of the key problems in the secondary sector.  I complimented him in the past on the IT programme, on which I understand he, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister Mr. Blair will take a ceremonial step tomorrow.  However, in general terms, it has been a litany of broken promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some Members last night sought to denigrate the remarkable achievements of the Minister's <Col N="638" /> predecessor, the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, who can be fairly compared to Donogh O'Malley in terms of her contribution to the development of education, the harsh reality is that the Minister has failed third level education, as he has failed every other sector.  He may be a Teflon Minister, but as the months pass more and more people in the education field are beginning to see he is a prisoner of vested interests, which was illustrated in his feeble Bill which this House recently passed.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, on tabling this very timely motion.  As a former teacher and the Labour Party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am always deeply conscious of the link between education and employment growth.  Many factors have contributed to our excellent economic performance in recent years, but most people agree that chief among these is our highly educated workforce. For both inward investors and our indigenous industries, the availability of a skilled, flexible and innovative workforce is a key element in maintaining current investment levels.</P>
    <P>However, one of the key factors that might limit that growth in coming years is the shortage of labour in certain areas.  The problem has been identified, not just by Members of this House but by many outside commentators, as a key area of concern.  Investing in education, particularly third level education in both the university and institute of technology sectors, is vitally important and will become more so over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Given this background, I fully support the motion.  The expansion of our third level sector and the introduction of free fees has opened up the prospect of third level education to the children of many working class people.  While there are still major problems regarding students from disadvantaged areas accessing third level, to which I will return later, it is fair to say that far more students of this generation whose parents are ordinary taxpayers have secured a third level qualification than ever before.  The vast majority of these students rely on the grant system to contribute to their maintenance in college.  The motion proposes a radical transformation and improvement of this system to take account of the real costs involved in attending third level.</P>
    <P>One of the major costs of third level education is, as my colleague said earlier, the renting of accommodation for the 36 weeks of the academic year.  The spiralling cost of housing in Dublin has had a huge inflationary impact on the private rented accommodation sector.  People who, up until now, would have sought to purchase a home are now priced out of the market.  As has been said before in the House, a couple who are both earning the average industrial wage, or above it, cannot secure a mortgage to buy a house.  These people, who would have traditionally moved out of the rented sector, have now no option but to remain renting.</P>
    <P>In addition to this demand factor, the changes introduced on foot of the Bacon report and the <Col N="639" /> scandalous slashing of capital gains tax in the last budget have encouraged investors to leave the rental market, thereby reducing supply.  This situation has led to a surge in the price of rental accommodation.  This was the situation which greeted tens of thousands of students who returned to our university and institute of technology cities and towns last autumn.</P>
    <P>While the situation in Dublin is the one most familiar to me, I know this problem affects other large towns and cities with large educational institutions. We are chiefly conscious in Dublin of DCU, UCD, TCD and St. Patrick's.  However, there is a dire situation all across Ireland which is getting worse.  There is a serious problem in the Dublin rental sector which cannot cope with the present demand and the influx of students every autumn creates further problems.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we examine both our capital investment programme and our tax system to facilitate the building of on-campus accommodation in colleges across the country, as the motion states.  For example, it is possible to allow developers a tax relief on income from new rental units constructed on college lands for a period of years until the initial cost of the construction is recouped.  The accommodation could then revert to the college which would have the benefit of the future income.  There is also a strong case to be made for providing capital grants to colleges to assist in the construction of on-campus accommodation.</P>
    <P>Beyond the question of accommodation, this motion also seeks to reform and improve the system of third level maintenance grants.  One of the most important of these is the need for us to move from a system of calculating grant eligibility from gross income to net income.  I have dealt with many problems related to this area, particularly for families whose incomes tend to vary but had a good year which disqualified their children for grants.  This welcome move has applied to family income supplement since the last budget, which is now based on net income, and should be extended to third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>It is unreal to calculate a grant from a gross income base.  Net income, after the payment of tax, PRSI and levies, is the disposable income on which a family survives.  It is from these resources that a family supports its children at third level education and a system of grant assistance should acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>This motion also calls for an increase in the level of grant assistance available under the scheme.  As my colleague pointed out, this increase is needed to meet the rising accommodation costs facing students.  This year's increase of 1.7 per cent does not come near acknowledging the real costs facing third level students.  My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, pointed out last night that the Department has not carried out even basic research on this matter.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for a more equitable and rational geographical distribution of student numbers <Col N="640" /> throughout the State.  I represent my home area of the postal district of Dublin 17, which has the lowest third level participation rate in the country.  Another area of low participation is Dublin 10 on the west side.  Over the past 18 months I have seen no effort by the Minister, Deputy Martin, to address this.</P>
    <P>In the last Government the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, launched the early start programme and programmes such as Excel and Challenger to encourage children in those areas to complete second level and to move to third level. I raised this matter in an Adjournment debate when I asked the Minister to consider supporting programmes which would fast track highly motivated children from very low income families through the primary and secondary systems and on to third level.  I appeal to the Minister to look at those programmes to see how they could be used to get people into third level and to keep them there.  I urge him to adopt the full motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and compliment Deputy O'Shea on tabling it.  There are a number of matters the Minister needs to accept.</P>
      <P>First, the maximum student grant of £1,624, which works out at £31 per week over a full year, is not sufficient for a student to live on.  The basic position is that no student can live on a student grant.</P>
      <P>Second, the income limit for qualifying for a student grant is too low at £17,740.  A parent earning £18,000, £19,000, £20,000 or even £25,000 a year is not in a position to finance a student through college.</P>
      <P>The third matter which must be acknowledged is that the financial position facing students this year is worse than in any previous year, largely as a result of the huge escalation in the cost and shortage of accommodation.  The types of private accommodation which were traditionally available to students are disappearing because owners are availing of the buoyant property market and the increase in prices to sell such property.  There is a shortage of student accommodation and a huge increase in prices.</P>
      <P>There is a need for emergency measures this year to provide student support and to recognise the increased cost of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that the poorer one is, the less chance one has of participating in third level education.  There has been a great deal of discussion on participation rates in third level education and underlying causes.  It must be acknowledged that participation rates are not entirely due to the availability or level of student grants.  A 15 or 16 year old who has just completed his or her junior certificate can choose to pursue a route to take them to a good leaving certificate and entry to third level.  In so doing, the student commits himself or herself to seven or eight years living in penury, postponing earnings and depending on their parents or on small State grants. <Col N="641" /> It is no wonder that children from poorer backgrounds in which there is less support from an educational point of view choose a route which enables them to take up employment, perhaps on a part-time basis initially, while they are still at school.  Their educational commitment is diluted during that period and consequently, by the time they reach leaving certificate level &mdash; if they do so at all, they are faced with the prospect of a meagre student grant which combines with other factors to discourage them from continuing their education.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that someone of 18 years of age is paid £67 per week unemployment assistance whereas someone who commits himself or herself to a course of study ends up being paid less than half that amount in a student grant.  There is a need for immediate measures &mdash; as outlined in the motion before the House &mdash; to tackle the immediate problems of student support and student grants.  There is also a necessity to take a fundamental look at the entire issue of student support.  The student grant system, as we know it, has been in existence for the past 30 years.  It is time to move towards a system of student support which treats the student as an individual, independent citizen rather than someone dependent on his or her parents.  Such a system would acknowledge that in a knowledge-based economy and information society, the provision of third level education is an economic investment and that participants in such a system need to be funded and supported.  We must also recognise that third level education is no longer something which occurs between the ages of 18 and 22.  In the kind of economy in which we currently live, people will have to return to education again and again.  A system of student support must be put in place not merely for those currently deemed to be dependants of their parents but for those who will, over the entire course of their working lives, have to return to education on an ongoing basis. A new approach is required to this type of support, based on what is essentially a different relationship between the student as citizen and the State, a system which recognises there are periods over the course of students' lives when they will be in a position to contribute to the State through taxation and so on and that there are others where they will require State support. I urge the Minister to take immediate action to deal with the problems addressed in the terms of the motion and to undertake a fundamental review of the entire system of student support and the approach to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the spiralling cost of accommodation is making it almost impossible for rural students to attend college in Dublin and other cities.  Last week, I met a constituent in Kerry who was attending college in Dublin but had to abandon the course of study as his parents could not afford to pay the accommodation costs.  The student in question was one of <Col N="642" /> three in the family attending college and is currently working in a factory in Tralee.</P>
      <P>The Minister has heard why he should support the Labour Party motion.  I would remind him of the promises he made prior to entering Government &mdash; I obtained the information from Fianna Fáil's website.  The Minister promised a gradual increase in the current level of maintenance grants as resources permitted and a rise in the qualifying income limits which he deemed too low in 1997.  He promised to set up an independent and regular appeals procedure for students who felt they had been unfairly disqualified from receiving a grant and to introduce new arrangements to deal with grant applications which were marginally above the means threshold &mdash; he has not delivered on any of these measures.  He promised to introduce a system of tax reliefs for post-graduate students and to ensure that larger families would benefit more from the grants system than they currently do.  He promised to improve provisions for post-graduate students and to provide tax incentives to the private sector, in partnership with third level institutions, to provide high standard capital accommodation for students where possible.  He gave a commitment to introduce tax reliefs to assist post-graduate, mature, second chance and part-time students who wished to attend third level institutions.  A commitment was given that where mature students over the age of 23 years returned to third level on a full-time basis, they would be means tested on their own incomes, not that of their parents, regardless of residence.  That has not happened and is creating major difficulties.  The Minister also pointed out that Fianna Fáil believed that part-time students should be permitted to qualify for means-tested grants on a proportionate basis. That has not been delivered on.  The Minister also promised to introduce an enhanced level of grant for mature students from low income backgrounds on a basis similar to that previously recommended for school leavers from low income backgrounds.  The Minister made many promises which have not been fulfilled.  He has major commitments to honour and currently has the resources to honour them.</P>
      <P>Three years ago when the Rainbow Government was in power, it delivered on the issue of fees.  The present Minister has not delivered on anything substantial to maintain people in third level institutions.  He has provided extra funding for some resources and now has a unique opportunity to deliver for third level students and ensure that those from low income families and families in receipt of social welfare payments will have a chance of third level education.  The Minister, the Minister for Finance and the Government are depriving many young people, such as the young person I met in Tralee, of the opportunity to attend third level.  He should bear that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody doubts <Col N="643" /> that the issues referred to in the motion before the House are real.  However, the solutions proposed are untargeted, ineffective, unfocused and, at the most charitable interpretation, absurd. They bring a whole new meaning to the time honoured phrase &ldquo;using a sledgehammer to crack a nut&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Nobody disputes the difficulties faced by students seeking accommodation in the private rented sector.  We are all aware that this is part of a wider housing problem.  In this regard, the Minister for Education and Science has indicated the Government's willingness to assist further significant student housing developments and hopes to be able to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.  There is no doubt that increasing the provision of dedicated student housing is the key to solving this problem.  I simply cannot accept &mdash; nor could anyone with a grain of wit accept &mdash; that increasing grants for all students, irrespective of the circumstances of the recipient, would assist in any meaningful way.</P>
      <P>If one considers the unhappy history of the health board subvention system, I put it to the Labour Party and other Members of the Opposition that such an approach would probably lead to increased rents with no improvement in the relative position of students.  The latest available statistical data from the Higher Education Authority on student residences relate to 1995-6.  It reveals that 45 per cent of students in the university sector live at home.  In addition, many other students are either in decent affordable accommodation or attending college in an area without a significant accommodation squeeze.  Therefore, the proposed response to employ a substantial increase across the board in the level of student grants would not only have a significant price tag but would also fail to target resources at students genuinely facing accommodation difficulties of the sort dealt with in the motion.</P>
      <P>There are just over 7,000 student residences, 3,000 of which are in Dublin where accommodation problems are most acute.  However, the availability of tax incentives in the past had a very positive impact on the provision of student residences. For example, the University of Limerick built almost 950 student residences between 1988 and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another priority for the Government is improving participation in further and higher education.  Positive action is required to tackle disadvantaged access and we believe that targeted approaches rather than scattergun responses are required.  Indeed, the Labour Party initiative favours the middle and higher income groups, although nobody should be too surprised by this given the party's history in education matters. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan outlined the party's belief in equality and access of opportunity &mdash; the Deputy is great for talking about equality. However, the Government, unlike that in which the Labour Party was a member, has delivered on its commitment to provide equitable support for <Col N="644" /> PLC students who were forgotten by the Labour Party when in Government and who have been forgotten in the drafting of the motion.</P>
    <P>On the one hand the Labour Party is advocating the need for student support services while at the same time it is calling for the abolition of the student registration fee.  This is another example of the scattergun approach which will do nothing for the most disadvantaged.  The effect of its abolition at a cost to the taxpayer of £12 million would be to relatively improve the position of higher income groups while potentially undermining funding for valuable services.</P>
    <P>The House should be reminded that the Government accepts the argument that levels of maintenance grants are not generous by any standards. However, we believe it is imperative we use available resources to tackle the issues facing students who are most in need.</P>

If Donogh O'Malley, a former Fianna Fáil Deputy for Limerick, the constituency the Minister of State represents, adopted the philosophy which has just been enunciated, he would never have introduced the universal abolition of second level fees.</P>

      <P>The Minister has missed the point, but that does not surprise me.  Fianna Fáil is now talking about targeting and selectivity, a complete repudiation of the principle of universality which the British Government applied to primary education, which Donogh O'Malley, an icon of the Fianna Fáil Party, introduced in relation to second level and which we unashamedly introduced at third level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We abolished fees.  If the boy Minister and the half boy Minister of State wish to interrupt me than I will engage them.  Access to education concerns a principle and a value, something Fianna Fáil may have difficulty in understanding. It is not just about places or the number of classrooms, but the right to be in whatever places exist irrespective of family income.  It is about the right to be there irrespective of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about some half baked aristocracy, but about the right of every citizen to be there if they qualify.  It is then one <Col N="645" /> can talk about the availability of places.  When we introduced the abolition of fees in third level we were addressing a principle and a value which Fianna Fáil through Donogh O'Malley addressed wonderfully in the 1960s.  The well-to-do middle classes were ripping off the tax system through tax covenants.  Tax covenants of the order of £3 million from the turn of the century had applied to a small category of people.  In 1993-4, when we were in Government with Fianna Fáil, we noticed a sudden escalation in the tax foregone on covenants which rose exponentially from between £3 million and £4 million to £38 million.  In middle class suburbs in my constituency and elsewhere there were back to back covenants, where the 5 per cent did not apply.  Who was able to apply? The answer is the fat cats and the rich people who had the income to write unlimited cheques for their neighbours and their neighbours' children, while the people who lost out were the children of creamery workers and others who barely qualified for a grant or who were £3 or £4 over the threshold on the basis of PAYE.</P>
      <P>We killed two things with the one stone, namely, the denial of the principle of universal access in relation to fees, perhaps the last country in the EU to do so.  Greece, Portugal and Spain, which are poorer than Ireland, had no university fees for those who qualified for entry.  We were the last country in the EU to get rid of fees.  We also closed a middle class tax loophole for which I make no apology.</P>
      <P>I challenge the young, strident and ambitious Minister for Education and Science &mdash; good luck to him &mdash; to come clean on where he stands on university fees.  Is he in favour of their reintroduction? That is not clear.  If equity means anything then grants should be assessed on the net income of a household.  There has been a scandal in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  In the three budgets I introduced, in the time available to me and given the background which existed, we did more than was previously done in relation to third level education.  The abolition of fees was the first phase.  We also made provision for capital infrastructural investment in third level education and we went on to do more.  However, I am not here to argue my record but rather to talk about what can be done now against a background of a surplus of £1,000 million.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk about accommodation.  I understand the young Minister for Education and Science, who is filled with the wisdom of 17 months in office, accused me of making a declaration of commitment off the back of a lorry. There was a debate in my parliamentary party and we agreed the motion in the name of all members of the parliamentary party which was deferred to take account of an all-party Opposition motion relating to a health issue.  We contacted people with whom we were in discussion to inform them of this development.  This is not some recent conversion.  My commitment to student politics and rights goes back some time, I suspect a little longer than the Minister's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the constitutional issue of collective responsibility in terms of education. Is the smug and well equipped Minister for Education and Science aware that while he sits opposite, comfortable in the knowledge that he is the heir and dauphin of this party, his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has acquiesced in the demolition of a student hostel comprising 250 bedrooms at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin 4, less than two kilometres from Belfield?  Is he aware that, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health and Children said they had no function in allowing an edifice which contains that amount of accommodation, built with taxpayers' money, to be demolished to make way not for an operating theatre, a ward, a special clinic or some unique research facility for medicine but for a car park?  The Minister and the Minister of State have acquiesced in the proposed demolition of student accommodation <Col N="647" />&mdash; nurses' homes no longer required in St. Vincent's Hospital &mdash; on a bus route, a short distance from the largest single education campus in the country, Belfield.  That hostel could provide scarce and necessary accommodation for students who need it and cannot get it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the probability that the Government will introduce in next week's budget tax concessions for the provision of accommodation on residential campuses.  I hope the terms are enhanced to encourage the private sector to invest in such accommodation and that the Minister and the Department will facilitate, rather than obstruct, that type of accommodation. However, it does not go far enough.  I remind the Minister that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has not given direction to any local authority to ensure landlords who own private accommodation are registered so that minimum standards can be enforced.  Only 20 per cent of all the rented accommodation, approximately 100,000 units, is registered.  If resources were made available and local authorities got an instruction from the Minister's colleague, who shares collective responsibility, to ensure that that accommodation was properly registered, the rack-renting, the exploitation, the ripping off, the black economy and the cash in the hand without a rent book &mdash; which goes on all the time for students &mdash; would be ended.  It would not affect supply.  It would ensure many students would not live in fire traps, that young people would live in accommodation complying with minimum standards, and it would ensure the Revenue Commissioners get their take of tax on the rent paid.  Why is that not being done?</P>
      <P>I salute the Minister who finally got into the Cabinet, having spent four and a half years attacking his predecessor, virulently and without any objectivity when on this side.  Given that he has reached the golden shore of collective Cabinet responsibility, I invite him to exercise some of it.  First and foremost, he should come clean on his attitude to fees and stop equivocating on what we did when in Opposition.  If the Minister wishes to undo the universality of the abolition of university fees, he should tell us and the students before 11 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A career of political achievement in 17 months is a short one.  In relation to accommodation I suggest the Minister look at the real problems mentioned by Deputy Deenihan where <Col N="648" /> some students have had to go home because they cannot afford to be housed and study at the same time, given what is happening in the housing market. The Bacon report does absolutely nothing to address the issues of supply for young single adults, typically and classically, students.  We are offering one specific proposal, that the Minister ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to get in touch with St. Vincent's Hospital and ask them not to demolish 250 bedrooms for at least four years.  I presume the Minister can do that. Those rooms were built by the taxpayer, those in the Gallery, ourselves and the ushers and they want to demolish them for a car park.  If government means anything all the Minister has to do is ask the Minister for Health and Children to get in touch with the board and say that the money for the building of the operating theatres and the wards will be provided but the car park does not kick in for four years, until the housing crisis is over.  The Minister is a powerful man and he knows it.  I think he can do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  It is important to my constituents in Laoighis-Offaly, particularly those in Portlaoise.  The loss of jobs in any town is obviously a serious issue and a sad time for the families of those directly involved.  There is also a consequent adverse spin-off for the town and surrounding area.  County Laois has been neglected by the Government in the employment creation stakes.  Week after week, the Tánaiste parades around the country announcing the fruits and benefits of the Celtic tiger.  Hundreds of jobs are created in every provincial town and city through multi-million pound international investment. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of job creation or investment in County Laois, or of assistance by the agencies, the Minister or her Department.  There seems to be no interest in County Laois on the part of the Minister, her Department, the Government or State agencies, particularly the IDA.</P>
      <P>Portlaoise is a modern, progressive town which expects huge population growth in the next five years but many people living in the town work in Dublin.  The dormitory town syndrome is becoming more prevalent as we approach the millennium &mdash; people leave on an early train and return late in the evening &mdash; and this has created a social and economic imbalance.  I urge the Minister of State to create an initiative for a positive job creation venture in the town.</P>
      <P>County Laois has a weak industrial base.  IDA employment statistics show that 3.5 per cent of jobs created in the State were in the midlands region, and County Laois received precious few of those.  There can be no doubt that the county, and Portlaoise in particular, has been neglected by the IDA.  Having regard to this, Laois County Council undertook an initiative to prepare a state of the art industrial business park, and a 2,400 square foot unit is in the course of construction. This will be appropriate for high quality international investment.  Unfortunately the marketing of this site by the relevant agencies has been non-existent.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister, the Minister of State and the IDA representative for the midlands region to the County Hall, Portlaoise, to meet the county development team, officials of Laois County Council and Portlaoise Chamber of Commerce.  I ask that they do so before Christmas so that the people of Laois can see the Government is about to redress the imbalance.  The Minister met a deputation last January.  She was courteous, understood the problem and was presented with papers &mdash; Deputy Fleming was there and can confirm this &mdash; but regrettably the follow-up has been minimal.</P>
      <P>Portlaoise is strategically situated in the heart of Laois, which is in the heart of Ireland.  We have an excellent road and rail infrastructure, the town has attractive schools and health services, and the quality of life for those working in the area is excellent, but for those not working the position is worrying.  I am critical of the IDA and the Minister. I cannot understand why Portlaoise has not been aggressively marketed by the IDA and Forbairt. The Minister may set up all the task forces she likes but they will only succeed if the will is there.  I look forward to seeing her and the Minister of State in Portlaoise before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the recent closure of C &amp; M Europe in Portlaoise, with the loss of 50 jobs.  I ask the Government what measures it proposes to take to find replacement jobs and to ensure a higher priority is given to promoting employment and investment opportunities in Portlaoise and County Laois.  We received a major shock when a PR company in Dublin faxed us with news of the imminent closure of C &amp; M Europe.  The employees were told on Friday week last and by last Wednesday the factory was closed.  It was a sudden exit in the immediate run-up to Christmas and is a major blow to the workers concerned.  I have no doubt the company will honour its legal <Col N="655" /> commitments on minimum notice, redundancy, etc., but the workers should be given some hope. It was a skilled workforce and we should find replacement jobs as urgently as possible.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to set up a jobs task force for County Laois, with an immediate and specific brief to examine industrial employment in the county.  We have a lot of service and public sector employment, whether in the prison, Bord na Móna, Telecom Éireann or Government offices, and there is also a lot of agricultural employment, but we have a woefully inadequate industrial base.  The county's industrial output <i>per capita</i> is the second lowest in the country, and this must be addressed.  We have not received priority from the IDA to date and I call for County Laois to be pushed higher up the priority list as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There are big employers in every direction outside County Laois: Modus Media in Kildare town employs 1,000 people; Braun in Carlow employs well over 1,000; Kilkenny has Avonmore; Roscrea has Antigen and Ashbourne Meats.  The problem is that there are no major industrial employers in County Laois, which can be shown in two ways.  First, it is outrageous that FÁS social employment projects are the single biggest employer in the county &mdash; up to 700 people are on those projects, which run from year to year.  If we have to rely on such projects, it shows the lack of industrial promotion to date.  The second factor is clear from today's editions of the two provincial newspapers published in the county, the <i>Leinster Express</i> and the <i>Laois Nationalist.</i>  There are 41 major job advertisements in those newspapers: 13 of the companies placing advertisements are based in Kildare, nine in Carlow, seven in Offaly, three in Dublin, one in Tipperary and one in Wicklow, while only seven out of the 41 companies are based in Laois.  Some 34 of those companies are based outside Laois &mdash; in other words, 83 per cent of those advertisements are encouraging Laois people to work in other counties.</P>
      <P>This highlights the essence of the problem &mdash; Laois people are willing to work but they are working outside the county.  Every morning hundreds of Laois people leave the county by train from Portlaoise, Portarlington or Ballybrophy, by public or private bus, or by private cars, to work in neighbouring counties or in Dublin.  Laois people who want to work have to leave the county.  Last week, a building society manager in Portlaoise said he had noticed an enormous increase in mortgage applications from people who wished to buy houses in Portlaoise but whose certificates of income came from companies outside the county.  He asked me when the town would get a reasonable sized industry.  There have been recent initiatives and I look forward to working with the Minister and the local authorities to attract industrial projects to the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I sincerely thank Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Fleming for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I share fully their concern and disappointment at the recent decision by C &amp; M to close its plant at Portlaoise and am conscious of the effect which this closure will have on the town and, most immediately, on the employees concerned. C &amp; M Europe Limited is a subsidiary of the C &amp; M Corporation of Connecticut, USA. The parent company was established in 1964 and employs 650 people in America and Ireland in the production of cables for the computer, telecommunications and medical industries.  The Irish operation commenced production in Portlaoise in 1991 and employs 50 people in the manufacture and marketing of wire and cable for the electronics industry.  During the past two years the company intensified its efforts to develop a new range of products for use in the telecommunications industry where future growth prospects were encouraging.</P>
      <P>However, despite the best efforts of the Irish management to develop and progress the Portlaoise operation, it was badly affected by global market developments in the cable sector.  In particular, a downturn in the market for key customers of C &amp; M has adversely impacted on the company, and this has led to a sudden and irretrievable loss of business to the Irish plant. Against this background C &amp; M has, unfortunately, decided that its Irish manufacturing operation is no longer viable.  It will, however, retain a small sales staff in Portlaoise to support its European customers.</P>
      <P>The House will realise that while the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which a company positions itself.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies and the House that IDA Ireland is actively pursuing a strategy to increase employment in County Laois.  As part of the agency's marketing efforts to enhance the attractiveness of the county for inward investors, it entered into a land swap with Laois County Council in 1997.  This resulted in the establishment of a new 45 acre business and industrial park by IDA Ireland on the Mountrath Road.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1997, IDA Ireland invested approximately £500,000 for the provision of all the necessary services and landscaping to enable the park to be established as a quality location to compete for overseas mobile investment.</P>
      <P>At the same time, IDA Ireland issued a BES certificate to private developers for the construction of a 20,000 sq.  ft.  unit at the park, and construction of the new facility commenced in October 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of this new business and industrial park and an advance factory facility is critical to IDA Ireland's marketing programme for inward investment to the area.  With this new <Col N="657" /> facility coming on stream in early 1999, IDA Ireland will concentrate its efforts on securing a client for County Laois at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    <P>In the light of the job losses at C &amp; M, I have asked the agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional investment, job creation and job maintenance in the region.  FÁS will also do everything possible to assist redundant workers through initiatives such as training and retraining.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to what the Deputies have said and I concur entirely with their sentiments.  The House can be certain that we are committed to ensuring that we get a replacement industry for Portlaoise and the greater Laois area as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy Flanagan said about a meeting and about setting up a task force.  I will convey his sentiments to my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.  I was disappointed that Deputy Flanagan did not mention the county enterprise board.  I had the pleasure of visiting Portlaoise recently.  I saw an enterprise exhibition of the highest standards showing entrepreneurship, flair, and industrial development at a micro level which I believe will become macro and make a major contribution in the future.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure yesterday of presenting the National Enterprise Awards.  County Laois was represented in the national finals.  There is hope. There is opportunity, and there will be further investment in Portlaoise before this Government leaves office and renews itself for another term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the new dementia unit at St. Patrick's Hospital, Carrick-on-Shannon, which was provided at a cost of £750,000 and officially opened by the Minister for Health and Children last June but which, unfortunately, is still unused by patients.</P>
      <P>At the outset I pay tribute to the matron and staff at St. Patrick's Hospital, Carrick-on-Shannon for the excellent work they have done in the hospital in recent years.  The patients are cared for very well and the hospital is well thought of by the patients in the hospital and their families.  I also pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, who, as Minister for Health, provided £750,000 to build the Monsignor John A. Young Unit at St. Patrick's Hospital.  However, I fail to understand how such an excellent facility, which was officially opened by the Minister, still has no patients or staff.  It is not good business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated at the opening that he had provided an additional £7 million for the care of older people.  It is disgraceful that the finance was not provided to have this dementia unit opened. Nineteen extra staff will be required to run the unit, and I am now demanding that Government provides the £400,000 through the North-Western <Col N="658" /> Health Board, so that the people for whom this unit was provided is opened immediately.  The situation at Carrick-on-Shannon cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope the Minister will provide the extra funding to the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>This unit was opened to look after people who suffer from Alzheimer's disease.  We all know the ravages that disease wreaks on the people who suffer from it and on their families.  I do not want to be facetious, but whoever in the Department of Health is responsible must have forgotten about it and probably should be considered for in-patient treatment there.  I cannot understand why the money has not been provided to run such a fabulous unit.  Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to provide the money as a matter of urgency so that this fine unit can be opened for people who really need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen.</P>
      <P>The Minister understands the unit referred to by the Deputy to be the dementia unit based at St. Patrick's Hospital, Carrick-on-Shannon.  This unit has been developed in line with the North-Western Health Board's policy to provide nursing accommodation for older people in or as near as possible to their own home area.  The unit is one of two which has been developed in the Sligo-Leitrim area, the other being in St. John's Hospital, Sligo, which was opened earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to the development of these two units, patients with severe dementia or Alzheimer's disease were accommodated in St. Columba's Psychiatric Hospital in Sligo and in accommodation on St. Patrick's campus.  This accommodation is not suitable in the longer term for patients with this condition.</P>
      <P>The 30 bed unit at St. Patrick's is a purpose designed facility to cater for the special needs of mentally infirm older patients and to provide respite for their families and carers in the community. This development will complement the comprehensive range of community services, hospital services, day care and respite services for older people in south Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The unit has been developed at a capital cost of £750,000, and the intention was to have it open in the second half of this year.  However, a number of staffing issues arose, which necessitated detailed discussions with the staff representatives concerned.  In these circumstances, the board did not have the required agreement to proceed with opening the unit.  However, negotiations with staff representatives are nearing completion and it is anticipated that all outstanding issues will be resolved in the near future which will enable the North-Western Health Board to open the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are committed in our programme for Government to providing care for older people. It would have been our wish to have this unit <Col N="659" /> opened prior to this, but we are confident it will open shortly.  I thank the Deputy for his interest in this very important issue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Asylum Seekers' Driving Licences.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent days asylum seekers applied to local authorities for a driving licence and were informed that they would not be granted one.  In one county the local authority indicated that not only would the asylum seeker's driving licence be refused but licences currently held by other asylum seekers would be revoked.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for this ruling was laid by the local authorities in question at the door of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  While it is clear that a written directive was not received, it was also clear that the Department had instructed local authorities in early November to refuse such applications.  In one case we are talking about families who are living almost two miles from any shops or other social contacts and where there is no public transport. Irish friends offered to provide them with a vehicle and insurance cover.  The asylum seekers had driving licences from their own country.  All that was required was a provisional driving licence to be granted to them in Ireland.  One can imagine their shock when they were refused a licence by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Until recently, it has been common practice for asylum seekers to be granted provisional licences. When I investigated the matter, the Department of the Environment and Local Government appeared unclear about its position, yet at local level I received confirmation that there had been a clear change of policy.  The proof of this change is irrefutable.  It is in the experience of asylum seekers who are now being turned away and refused a licence to drive a vehicle.</P>
      <P>The Department indicated to me that if an asylum seeker had a green book, he or she would be able to get a licence.  However, I understand a green book is evidence of residency.  If one has a green book, one does not need to apply for asylum. In any case, it is a minor miracle if one has a green book these days.  One family went as far as going on hunger strike because for 12 months they had been denied a green book despite their clear right to one.</P>
      <P>Insisting that asylum seekers need a green book before they can get a driving licence is similar to saying that one could have jam yesterday and have jam tomorrow but not today.  Nobody has any difficulty with the principle that an asylum seeker needs to be in Ireland for six months before he or she qualifies for a licence.  Given the long waiting time, that qualification is not onerous by any means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the refusal to grant licences in recent times is a measure to constrain and constrict further the lives of asylum seekers.  It was done quietly and casually and might not even have been exposed but for the fact that, despite the <Col N="660" /> isolation of asylum seekers, there are Irish people who reach out a hand to them and acknowledge them as humans with the same needs and rights as us.  Fortunately, these people went public and, as a result, I am convinced that this blockage is being removed.</P>
    <P>As a result of the issue being highlighted, the Department has been forced to think again.  I hope the intention is to open up once more the system of granting driving licences.  However, I am raising the issue because it is important that the decision is put on the public record.  Too often the treatment of asylum seekers at official level has been hallmarked by secrecy and injustice.  For example, we are still waiting for the basic right to legal representation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Last year, all parties in the House passed a resolution urging the full implementation of the Refugee Act, yet the Government has stubbornly refused to comply. Meanwhile, racism and prejudice are on the rise.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that these people have a right to be in Ireland until their claim is processed. They have a right to social supports and we have a duty to comply with our international obligations to provide them.  It is horrific that the spirit of these obligations is being so blatantly flouted.  It appears the Government is intent on making the lives of these people as miserable and restricted as possible while they are with us.  Asylum seekers are prevented from working and contributing. They are prevented from integrating. The official mindset determines that, in particular, young men who are well able and qualified to work are left to idle away their days, isolated from the social context of the world of work.</P>
    <P>They are prevented from contributing to our society although there is a wide consensus extending from IBEC to ICTU to the INOU that they should be allowed to do so.  They are prevented from studying in Ireland and now the controls are being ratcheted up to deny them even the freedom to drive a car.  This is petty and vindictive.  It is at variance with the general view among the public that we have a long history of emigration which obliges us to show humanity when it comes to dealing with those who are seeking refuge with us.  Many of these people will not succeed in their desire to live and work among us.  Some will succeed.  Regardless of the outcome, while they are in Ireland asylum seekers are entitled to be treated humanely and decently. Even if common decency does not wield the authority that it should over the Government, international law demands it of us.  I look forward to the Minister stating unequivocally that the practice of unfairly excluding asylum seekers from holding a driving licence is now ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for raising this issue.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be <Col N="661" /> present to respond to the matter and he asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>There has been a deal of misinformation circulating on this matter in recent days.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government has not issued directives to local authorities in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers for the purposes of driving licence applications and neither has it attempted to revoke anybody's driving licence.  It has not and cannot do so since revocation of licences is a function of the courts only.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the issuing of driving licences in accordance with relevant national regulations and EU directives.  The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989, require a birth certificate to accompany applications for provisional driving licences.  A local authority may also seek evidence of identity from applicants.</P>
      <P>EU requirements are that member states should issue driving licences only to persons normally resident or studying in a country.  Normal residence for this purpose is indicated by a stay of at least six months.  The European Commission and member states are entitled to expect conscientious administration of these provisions at national level as full national driving licences are mutually recognised and exchangeable throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>Subject only to the necessary conditions regarding age, normal residence and identity, the driver licensing system is designed to treat all applicants equally and without discrimination.  If there is any suspected or substantiated case to the contrary, the Department will be prepared to have it investigated and, if necessary, rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of practical administration and to facilitate refugees who may not have ready access to the required documentation, local authorities already issue provisional driving licences to nonnationals, including refugees, who possess the <Col N="662" /> green registration book issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Local authorities are not concerned with the administration of immigration controls as such.  Accordingly, if reasonable proof of meeting the necessary driving licence conditions can be given in some other way, this should also be acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is not within the power of a local authority or the Department of the Environment and Local Government to effect a legal revocation of a driving licence.  This is a function reserved to the courts.  Further to extensive inquiries with local authorities, it has so far been revealed that one local authority mistakenly sought to revoke one licence issued to an asylum seeker.  This local authority has been instructed to return the licence to the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>In most cases, persons arriving in Ireland who already hold either a national driving licence or an international driving permit are entitled to drive in Ireland for up to one year following arrival.  Persons coming to this country who do not hold a driving licence may, upon becoming residents and subject to the age conditions involved, apply for a provisional driving licence. It is not the policy of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to deny asylum seekers or refugees resident in this country the opportunity to learn how to drive.</P>
    <P>In view of difficulties which have been reported recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will ensure active liaison between his Department and local authorities on this matter and full clarification and promulgation of the policy I outlined. I trust this explains the position to the satisfaction of the Deputy and the House.  The Deputy may be assured that the Government is totally committed to ensuring that equality of treatment prevails for all people resident on the island at all times.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 November 1998. <Col N="663" /></P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission prepared its first programme, pursuant to the provisions of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, and it was approved by the Government and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in <Col N="664" /> January 1977.  The Commission have advised that the majority of the projects contained in that programme have now been dealt with in its published reports, consultation papers and working papers .</P>
      <P>In addition to the first programme, research undertaken at the request of successive Attorneys General as provided for in section 4(2)(c) of the Act also formed a substantial part of the commission's work.</P>
      <P>A considerable body of work has been completed by the commission this year.  I welcome the publication of its reports on land law and conveyancing law, privacy and the implementation of the Hague Convention and its consultation paper on aggravated, exemplary and restitutionary damages.</P>
      <P>A detailed account of the work undertaken by the commission under its first programme and research undertaken at the request of the Attorney General are to be found in the appendices to the annual report for 1997 which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Commission is also continuing its work in the areas of land law and conveyancing law and aggravated, exemplary and Restitutionary Damages as well as on the law of homicide, statute of limitations, drafting and interpretation of legislation and civil liability.</P>
      <P>The commission is currently in the process of formulating a new draft programme for law reform to form the basis of its future work, with the intent that this programme will play a significant role in enabling the law to respond to the needs of our changing society.  The new programme for law reform will be prepared by the commission in consultation with the Attorney General and other interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the commemoration committee to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>It was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the Untied Irishmen and the Fellowship of Freedom that inspired them in 1798.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this in mind it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the international conference 1798 &mdash; A Bicentenary Perspectives, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments <Col N="665" /> 1798 commemoration scholarship and the RTE Documentary Series &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; are examples of projects funded which I think duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
    <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin/Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries and the Drennan Papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's film festival was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme, From Revolution to Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Croppies Acre memorial garden at Collins Barracks opened by me on the 22 November was developed in association with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Museum and will serve as a lasting memorial to all those who died in 1798.</P>
    <P>We can all agree that the 1798 Centre at Enniscorty, which I opened earlier this year, is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the last ten months to mark the rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by the Taoiseach and involving the French military and our Defence Forces took place in Ballina on 22 August to acknowledge the involvement of France in 1798.</P>
    <P>Throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.  Unfortunately given the limited budget available it was not possible to fund all of the many worthy projects under way throughout the country and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all of the local committees who have worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank my committee for all their work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

      <P>Estimates of GDP per capita for the EU and its regions, expressed in purchasing power parties (PPPs) to allow for differences in price levels between member states, were received by the Central Statistics Office from EUROSTAT by e-mail on Wednesday afternoon, 18 November.</P>
      <P>These estimates incorporate the latest data supplied by the member states.  They showed that Ireland was at 95 per cent of the EU average over the period 1994-96.  The conversion of the Irish estimates to a PPP basis is still the subject of discussion with EUROSTAT regard some technical issues.  However, any resulting amendment is likely to be a relatively minor nature, probably amounting to no more than 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  24 agus Uimh 25.  le chéile.</P>
      <P>In answering these questions I think it is important to outline some background information on the matter.  In 1990 the human remains of four individuals, dating from the 13th to 15th centuries, were recovered from the Mullingar town dump by the National Museum of Ireland acting on information received.  These human remains are presently in the care of the National Museum.  In the light of recent representations on this issue seeking to have the remains returned for reburial the National Museum has agreed to this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> Development works on a nearby site in Mullingar in 1995 also led to the excavation of further human remains &mdash; in this case of a further 60 individuals.  These remains are not in the custody of the Keeper of Antiquities of the National Museum but are being studied, on behalf of the private archaeologist licensed to excavate the site, by a specialist in the scientific research of human remains.  When the research is complete it is envisaged that the remains will be included in the national anatomical collection of the National Museum in due course because of their scientific value.  The Deputy will be aware that the information that can be gleaned by specialist archaeological bone experts can be very comprehensive and can shed important light into our history.  The anatomical collection is also used for medical research and is a crucial national resource.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policy issues involved I acknowledge that there are considerations involved which are wider than just those of science. The Heritage Council has been asked to assist in formulating policy proposals on this subject for my consideration having regard to all the aspects involved, including ethical and other non-archaeological considerations.  I understand that this request from the museum will be considered by the council at its next meeting in December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, while I have primary responsibility for the protection of wildlife, other Ministers also have responsibilities in that regard.  I am strongly of the view that the current allocation of ministerial responsibilities is working well to ensure the protection of wildlife and I can assure the Deputy that I receive the full co-operation and support of my ministerial colleagues whenever such is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the position that has developed in recent years where the relevant environmental policies at all levels &mdash; national, EU and international &mdash; require that all sectors take on board appropriate responsibilities for the protection of the environment, including wildlife, the Deputy will appreciate that all Ministers and State bodies carry such responsibilities to some degree.  The development of this approach, which integrates environmental responsibilities across sectors, reflects a considerable advance from the situation pertaining previously.  Any suggestion that this should be reversed by removing obligations to protect wildlife and the environment in general from other Ministers would fly in the face of current policy and would, in my view, be a retrograde step. <Col N="669" /></P>

      <P>Proposed natural heritage areas are those areas identified by Dú chas, the heritage service of my Department, as having a special wildlife interest of importance from the national perspective.  I will include powers to designate such areas in the forthcoming amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, is more complex in that the EU Habitats Directive sets out a procedure for the designation of such sites.  The directive requires that member states propose a list of sites of community interest and transmit this list to the EU.  Then in consultation with the member states, the EU Commission will establish a committee consisting of representatives of the member states which will examine the proposed list to see whether it meets the requirements of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process the Commission has decided to hold biogeographical conferences at which the lists will be examined and where invited experts and non-Governmental organisations may suggest additions to or deletions from these lists.  Finally the Commission will adopt a list and then the member state will be required to formally designate the sites.  The Biogeographical Conference for the Atlantic Region, in which <Col N="672" /> Ireland is located, is being tentatively arranged for September 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department has published 207 proposed candidate SACs to date and has formally transmitted 48 of these to the EU Commission.  An additional ten sites will be transmitted in the next few weeks.  Further sites will be transmitted as the objections to the inclusion of private lands in them are dealt with by the advisory appeals board, which I have established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, recently placed advertisements for seasonal guides-information officers at various heritage sites throughout the country. The Deputy will be aware of the general position in relation to the national minimum wage, from the comprehensive replies given by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Employment, Deputy Harney, to questions raised by him and other Deputies in this House on 3 November 1998.  Legal effect has yet to be given to the national minimum wage, but an interdepartmental group is currently in the process of formulating proposals and a plan of action to deal with the complex issues which arise from the National Minimum Wage Commission's report.</P>
      <P>The entry point on the scale of pay for seasonal guide-information officers, commencing their first employment with Dúchas, is equivalent to £4.38 per hour.  While this point is very marginally lower than the rate of £4.40 recommended by the commission, it is hoped to finalise a pay claim shortly which will see that point advance ahead of the minimum rate.  It should also be pointed out that the further points on the seasonal guide scale and the scales for all other guides in Dúchas are well ahead of the recommended minimum rate.  Pay levels for guide-information officers are determined by reference to general Civil Service rates and therefore cannot be treated in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous years, I do not anticipate difficulty in recruiting suitable seasonal guides for the 1999 season.  Visitors to our heritage sites, from both home and abroad, have always extolled the calibre of our guide service and I am happy to endorse that appreciation. <Col N="673" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion against Ireland addressing the negative impact of sheep overgrazing on the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex special protection area, as well as the negative impact of sheep overgrazing on the habitats of the red grouse, a resident wild bird species, protected under the Birds Directive.  This step precedes the <Col N="674" /> institution of legal proceedings.  My Department has responded to the reasoned opinion.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that sheep overgrazing has caused damage to some habitats covered by the directive.  However, it is a problem mainly confined to mountain commonage lands, that is uplands held in common, but not equal, ownership by several individuals.</P>
      <P>Commonages with overgrazed land have been designated as such by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.  The degree of overgrazing varies significantly from commonage to commonage and within individual commonages themselves.  It is estimated that the overall area of commonages where overgrazing has occurred amounts to some 60,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>As there is considerable variation in the extent and nature of the problem in the different commonages, I have agreed with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to arrange for the preparation of individual commonage framework plans which will set out a sustainable stocking density on a commonage basis.</P>
      <P>Agricultural and environmental consultants preparing farm plans for participants in the rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will be obliged to implement the stocking levels set out in the commonage framework plans in the individual farm plans.  Farmers in ecologically sensitive areas, special protection areas, proposed candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, and proposed natural heritage areas will be required to participate in the REP scheme or to farm in accordance with an agri-environmental plan prepared by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>
      <P>Commonage framework plans for each individual commonage are likely to take some time to prepare.  In the interim for 1999, the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with my Department is implementing measure A of the rural environment protection scheme, with a reduction of mountain ewe quota premiums of 30 per cent of 1998 levels pending the introduction of the individual plans.  As the individual commonage framework plans are completed they will replace this interim arrangement.  Headage and premia will not be paid in the affected areas unless landowners are in compliance with these requirements.</P>
      <P>In tandem with these agri-environmental measures Dúchas has pursued an extensive land acquisition programme in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area and now owns just under 10,000 hectares of land in the complex.  In July this year I announced that these lands would be declared a national park.  These measures of themselves will have a positive impact on the habitats of the site as grazing on these lands will only be permitted at sustainable levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The red grouse is a species which is dependent for food and cover on the plant species calluna vulgaris, ling or bell heather.  This is the dominant plant species on many Irish heaths, raised bogs <Col N="675" /> and uplands.  I propose to designate a very large area of these habitat types, in excess of 200,000 hectares, as SACs.  Proposals to designate these areas were published in 1997 and designation will occur after the consultation process has been completed.  In the interim the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, provide protection to the sites.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures taken by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food will overcome the overgrazing problem and ensure the conservation of red grouse habitats. However, I have directed Dúchas to monitor the sites to ensure that vegetation recovers and to implement additional measures should it become necessary.</P>

      <P>My intentions regarding the implementation of the National Cultural Institions Act were stated in my reply to Question No. 715 of 28 January last.  The principal objective of the Act is to accord the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland autonomy as set out in the provisions of Part II of the Act.  In so far as resources in my Department and in the institutions concerned allow, work is ongoing so as to enable this part of the Act to be brought into force efficiently and effectively in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The following parts and-or sections of the Act have already been implemented: &mdash; Part I, except sections 4 and 6 in respect of other sections not yet implemented and section 7; sections 14, 26, 34, 35, 36 and 41 of Part II in so far as they relate to the National Gallery of Ireland and section 20, except subsection 4, in so far as it relates to Marsh's Library; Part III; in Part IV sections 47, 48, Register of Important Cultural Objects for items in the care of the National Gallery of Ireland and of the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, 49 and 50 &mdash; most of the subsections on export provisions concerning items on the register and archaeological items; all of Part VI; and Part VII sections 62, 63, 64, 68 except for subsections 1 and 2(b) and 69.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier I hope to commence Part II of the Act in the year 2000.  The remaining sections of the Act will be commenced as required and as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will be aware of the package of measures announced by myself and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in May last. These measures, legislative, financial and administrative, are intended to strengthen the protection of our architectural heritage, including houses and castles of architectural and historical interest.</P>
      <P>The legislative measures include a new planning Bill, to be brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which will give comprehensive protection to buildings and structures of architectural, artistic and historic importance, and a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, which is currently being carried out by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, on a statutory basis.  The latter Bill is currently being finalised and I expect to be able to publish it shortly.</P>
      <P>The package of measures also includes the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to protected, listed buildings which will commence in 1999.  This scheme will be administered by local authorities and will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum.  It will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards which are being drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my own Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council.  In addition, in the context of the preparation of a National Heritage Plan by my Department, further policy areas relating to the protection of the architectural heritage will be developed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposals submitted by The National Theatre Society Ltd. relating to a proposed capital development at the present site of the Abbey Theatre at an estimated cost of £25 million.  The society approached my Department in May of this year seeking an allocation of £1.5 million to progress its plans for the building project. The society was informed that in order to consider its application it would be necessary for it to develop a more detailed proposal and in particular to set out how it proposed to fund the full £25 million project.  In order that I can consider the matter further I have asked officials of my Department to meet with the National Theatre <Col N="680" /> Society Ltd. to discuss the proposal in more detail.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, has responsibility for over 740 heritage sites in its care.  It provides visitor facilities and guided tours at 62 of these sites throughout the country.  Details of these sites, including opening arrangements and admission prices, are provided in the heritage sites booklet and I am arranging to provide the Deputy with a copy of the 1998 booklet.  The visitor numbers to those heritage sites with visitor facilities has shown a steady increase over the last five years &mdash; in excess of two million people visited these sites last year.  It is anticipated that the numbers will show a further increase this year and with the introduction of new sites next year, I am confident that this successful trend can continue.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to announce that three new visitor facilities are expected to be opened to the public in 1999.  These are Dún Aonghasa, Kilmurvey, Inishmore, Aran Islands &mdash; a pre-historic stone fort overlooking the Atlantic ocean; St Audoen's Church, High Street, Dublin 8 &mdash; a medieval urban parish church, and Reginald's Tower, Waterford city &mdash; a 13th century Norman tower, to be run in conjunction with Waterford Corporation. In addition, Castletown House, County Kildare will reopen to the public in 1999 following completion of phase two of restoration works to the main house.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently approved my proposals to introduce legislation on television coverage of events which are considered to be of major importance to society.  The main elements of my legislative proposals are as follows: &mdash; power to enable me as Minister to draw up, in consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and subject to certain criteria that will be set down in the legislation, a list of events designated as being of major importance to society. Following enactment of the legislation, extensive public consultation and consultation with event <Col N="681" /> organisers and broadcasters is envisaged in drawing up the list.  I will also have to determine whether the events designated should be available on free to air television on a live or deferred basis and whether such coverage should be on a whole or partial basis.</P>
      <P>The list of events will be given effect by way of a positive statutory order and will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Provision to amend the order will also be made. Broadcasters who are not qualifying broadcasters under the proposals and who acquire exclusive rights to a designated event will be required to make the event available at reasonable rates to a broadcaster who has the status of a qualifying broadcaster under the legislation.  For an initial three year period, RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3 will be deemed to be qualifying broadcasters. Thereafter, the proposals envisage that a qualifying broadcaster will be one who provides a free to-air service to at least 95 per cent of the population.  However, where the 95 per cent coverage threshold reduces the number of qualifying broadcasters to only two, a broadcaster with 90 per cent coverage will qualify.  The proposals provide a basis for action in the courts if a broadcaster believes that another broadcaster is engaging or about to engage in activities prohibited under the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>The proposals have been referred to the Attorney General for drafting into a Bill which will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Both I and the National Museum are in favour of the extension of the opening hours of the National Museum in order to improve access by the public.  There are, however, very serious human resource and financial implications inherent in such a move.  However, the matter is under active consideration by the National Museum management and the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give any indication at this stage as to when it might be possible to improve the opening hours on bank holiday Mondays.</P>

      <P>The grant-in-aid fund in respect of acquisitions and conservation at the National Gallery is used to fund three main areas of the gallerys activities: the acquisition of pictures, conservation of works of art and the purchase of books and journals.</P>
      <P>I understand that the allocation from that fund by the National Gallery in respect of acquisitions in the current year was arrived at having regard to the overall resources available to the gallery as well as to the prioritising by the gallery of requirements within those resources.  The National Gallery also has other independent sources of income for use in making acquisitions and which includes income from the Shaw bequest.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that in accordance with section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, tax relief is available in respect of the donation of important national heritage items to the national collections on the basis of certain criteria. The National Gallery is one of the approved bodies in respect of this facility.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the National Gallery was recently in a position to use this facility to acquire the sculpture titled Amorino by Antonio Canova, an example of the benefits which can accrue to our cultural collections through the use of this provision of the legislation.  The gallery also received a donation of paintings under the same scheme in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the price differences for petrol within the cities and in different parts of the country.  In regard to petrol retailing, the policy of recent successive Governments has been to promote competition and consumer choice.  Price control, fixing prices on petroleum products, was abandoned as policy in 1991 and there is therefore no standardised maximum price.  The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs monitors the display of petrol and diesel prices to ensure that they comply with the display requirements of the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997.  Persons selling petrol and diesel products are required to specify, in a manner set out in the order, the price per litre being charged for these commodities.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991 prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as agreements, decisions and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, and the abuse of a dominant position.  The Act applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unnamed corporate body or persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.  It should be noted that the Competition Authority has responsibility for enforcing the Competition Acts and in particular section 4 of the 1991 Act which prohibits, <i>inter alia</i>, the direct or indirect fixing of prices.</P>
      <P>As a result of the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, which gave public enforcement powers to the Competition Authority, there are two alternative ways for an individual-firm to pursue allegations of breaches of competition rules.  The first is to take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or second, to make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate alleged breach or breaches of competition law.  Any complaints therefore alleging collusion or price fixing in regard to petrol are a matter for the Director of Competition Enforcement to investigate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>To determine the needs of the port industry nationally, my Department commissioned two detailed studies in the key areas of port costs and future capacity requirements over the past year.  Both studies point clearly to the need for a third national port development programme as part of the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Based on the examination of the port industry's importance to the economy and of its development needs over the period to 2007, a number of complementary measures have been developed comprising a substantial investment programme for ports which will seek to maximise the use of existing facilities and infrastructure, and ensure sufficient new infrastructure is added as demand grows.</P>
      <P>Following a comprehensive consultation process involving all commercial seaports, including those operated by Shannon Estuary Ports Company and Foynes Port Company, port and maritime infrastructural development projects have been identified and costed in the context of possible funding allocations under the next round of EU Structural Funding post-1999.  A key priority of any new seaports investment programme will be to ensure that port efficiencies and the utilisation of existing assets will be maximised and that new infrastructure will only be developed where there is a clear economic rationale and where there are no lower cost alternatives based on existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the extent of funding available and the conditions attaching to its award are determined, it will not be possible to determine the impact of the area's Objective One status on the development plans of the ports referred to by the Deputy. As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided on 17 November to pursue an application to EUROSTAT for a change from Ireland's current status as a single region to one comprising two regions.  In this context the Government is also conscious of the position of traditionally deprived areas bordering on counties in the proposed new objective regions.  In their discussions with the Commission on Structural Funds, the Government will seek to have account taken of these areas.  In addition, the Government will, in drawing <Col N="688" /> up the National Development Plan, pay attention to the needs of these areas.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is involved in funding two capital projects in the Waterford constituency during 1999.  They are the construction of a station house for the Irish Marine Emergency Service coastal unit in Dunmore East and the improvement of facilities for the Air Corps search and rescue service at Waterford Airport.  No estimate of expenditure can be given at this stage as tenders have not been requested or contracts signed.</P>
      <P>The requirements of Waterford will also be considered in the context of the Fishery harbour development and coast protection programmes for 1999, details of which will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, subject to obtaining any required statutory permissions, Waterford Harbour Company proposes to undertake capital dredging of the River Suir during 1999-2000. While tenders have not yet been sought for the project, and funding arrangements have yet to be determined, it is estimated that the cost of works will be approximately £1 million over the life of the project.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficult debt situation faced by Zambia and a number of other countries.  The consequences of this situation are a matter of great concern, not least because the need to service international debts constrains the ability of the countries concerned to allocate sufficient resources to health, education and other services of importance to poor people.</P>
      <P>At the international level, Ireland has played an active part in efforts to find solutions to the problems caused by the high levels of indebtedness of some poor countries.  In this connection, the House will be aware of the £31.5 million debt relief package announced by the Government two months ago.  In relation to bilateral development co-operation between Ireland and Zambia, I believe that Ireland is making an appropriate and significant contribution to economic and social development in Zambia through funding of programmes of direct benefit to poor people. Irish Aid expenditure in Zambia is expected to amount to about £5.8 million in 1998.</P>

      <P>The only capital project involving direct funding from my Department in the Waterford area in 1999 is the completion of a minor part of the infrastructural improvements at Waterford Airport commenced in 1998.  Capital projects which State bodies may be undertaking during 1999 in the Waterford area are operational matters for the companies concerned, over which I have no responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The amounts of premiums, headage arable aid and grants made to Teagasc in 1997 are set out in the attached scheme.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to respond immediately to the request for similar information for all State agencies. It would require extensive research and the use of staff resources which are at present committed to issuing payments to farmers under the various schemes.  I have asked my staff to make further contact with the Deputy and will be glad to respond to his request for information by letter at an early date.</P>
      <P>Forestry payments area matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and will be answered by him next week.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 26 cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme and 46 animals, including the 26 cows, under the 1998 cattle headage scheme.  Six of the cows had invalid tag numbers.  My Department wrote to the person named on 15 September 1998 and again on 23 September 1998 requesting correct tag numbers for the animals in question.  To date no reply has been received from the person named. Eight of the animals applied on under the 1998 cattle headage scheme were not registered with the National Calf Birth Registration Service and the person named was written to by my Department on the 15 September 1998 requesting that the animals be registered.  To date, only six of the animals have been registered.  The remaining two animals will have to be registered and the six invalid tag numbers corrected before the applications can be processed further.</P>

      <P>My Department has completed a comprehensive review of expenditure under the Leader programme and has identified funding arising from savings under certain measures and monetary adjustments which is available for allocation among the approved groups.  The precise amount available has not yet been finalised but it will represent a relatively small amount by comparison to the £87.6 million which has been allocated to the groups to date.  I will be submitting proposals to Government shortly for the allocation of the funds available and I can not give a commitment to any groups at this stage.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the bottom-up philosophy of the Leader programme, the implementation of local business plans and the management of funds available, which in each case is limited and known to groups for some considerable time, is a matter for each group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, in deciding on the application to EUROSTAT for a NUTS II reclassification, had to take account of the following factors: the opposition expressed by the Commission to any regionalisation based on subsidy shopping and creative geography; this required a relatively modest approach in terms of reclassification; the precedent effect of recent changes in western peripheral regions of the UK; the need to meet general EUROSTAT criteria in regard to size, population and geographical contiguity.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the Government decided on an application for the reclassification of Ireland's single NUTS II region status into two NUTS II regions: one comprising the Border, midlands and the west including Counties Kerry and Clare; the other comprising the rest of the country.  This application has now been lodged with EUROSTAT.  The proposed inclusion of Clare and Kerry in one region means that the total west coast from Donegal to Kerry is now encompassed.  This provides a plausible and realistic view of a peripheral area of the Community, in good balance with the overall Community picture.</P>
      <P>In regard to poor areas outside the proposed Objective One region, I draw the Deputy's attention to the Government's commitment in its press release on the regionalisation proposal that the proposal will not in any sense deflect the Government from its commitment to tackle social exclusion, urban or rural.</P>

It may be that the taxpayer has paid relevant contracts, C45, tax for which he has not yet claimed credit.  If that is the case, he should forward any forms C45 in his possession to the inspector of taxes who will adjust his tax liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on the details supplied the position in relation to the various taxes is as set out below: On the basis that none of the three sons received any prior gifts or inheritances since 2 June 1992, each son would be entitled to avail of a tax free threshold of £174,000.  On that basis no inheritance tax liability would arise.</P>
      <P>Assuming no exemptions, probate tax at the rate of 2 per cent would be payable on the value of the net estate at the date of death, inclusive of the house.  Where, in the year 1994, the house was occupied by the deceased as his/her principal private residence at the date of death it was entirely exempt if there was a surviving spouse. Where there was no surviving spouse that portion of the house passing to a dependent relative was exempt.  It was necessary that the dependent relative normally resided in the house at the date of death; and had income not exceeding a specified amount £4,023 in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to capital gains tax each son would be treated as having acquired his one-third interest in the property at the date of death of his mother in June 1994 for a consideration equal to £11,667 namely £35,000 x one-third.  If the house is sold now for £150,000, each son would be liable for capital gains tax in respect of his one-third interest in the property. <Col N="701" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is directly responsible for civil service pensioners.  The position regarding civil service pensioners is that all received an advance payment of 2 per cent or 3 per cent in 1997 or earlier this year.  About 85 per cent have now received their full entitlement based on the application of parity or the floor amount; outstanding cases are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases.  Initially, <Col N="702" /> there were some difficulties in some areas in interpreting how these guidelines should be applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in local authority and health board areas. However, following consultations with my Department, these issues were resolved and, as far as I am aware, the decision of November 1997 is being fully complied with.</P>
    <P>I would point out that some pensioners have disputed some of the guidelines.  For example, some pensioners take the view that the 1997 decision meant that allowances being made pensionable for serving officers should also be passed on to pensioners who had already retired.  The fact is, however, that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that, when an allowance is made pensionable for serving officers, the benefit does not apply to pensioners.  The 1997 Government decision did not change this policy in any way; the decision was that parity would apply in respect of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> restructuring deals, with the only change being to set a floor increase of 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information refers to some 33,000 individuals aged 65 and over, who were liable to income tax for 1995/96 and were identified as having interest income to which deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, applied.  From this data it is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of this proposal could be of the order of £10 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the situation of the elderly in relation to DIRT, the over-65's are one of only two categories of individuals entitled to a refund of DIRT if their total income, including interest income, is below their total tax free allowances or as the case may be their income tax exemption thresholds.  Concessionary treatment is, therefore, already afforded to these individuals in the administration of DIRT where their incomes falls outside the tax net.</P>

      <P>The scheme the Deputy is referring to is the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.  The scheme targets relief at those persons who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.  The Revenue Commissioners are unable to put a figure on the number of multiple sclerosis sufferers who have been approved under the scheme in the past two years, as it is the nature and the extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions of the scheme was carried out in 1993-94 and resulted in the adoption of the current regulations.  The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms, persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg, and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>Where a person meets the medical criteria, the relevant senior area medical officer issues a primary medical certificate for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board, whose decision is final.  An interdepartmental group has recently been established, under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Dental treatment services for children in primary schools are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme.  The eight health boards work in close co-operation with the school authorities in their regions to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave primary school.  The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc. is provided as necessary.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children in primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department has a millennium bug remedial programme in place for some time now.  As part of this programme a working group has been set up to deal specifically with the threat to embedded systems which are in use in some water and sewerage plants.  While the responsibility for ensuring that water and sewerage services are maintained rests with each individual local authority, the working group has been given the task of co-ordinating remedial activities in local authorities thus ensuring that problems are identified and solved and that the experience and expertise gained in solving these problems is shared.  In addition, my Department has recently sanctioned the appointment of an expert in this area who will provide technical assistance to the working group and to individual local authorities as required.</P>
      <P>While there is little doubt that a substantial amount of work is required over the coming months I am confident that the measures I have outlined will ensure that necessary remedial programmes will be completed for both water and sewerage services.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>There were 11,138 persons in receipt of the carer's allowance at the end of September 1998 at an estimated annual cost of £45 million.</P>
      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
      <P>In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was launched by me last month.</P>
      <P>The review examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need.  The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the most generous means tested payments in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed that the specific proposals in relation to the carer's allowance will be examined further in the context of the 1999 budget as will the issue of the rate of payment.</P>

      <P>The 1998 budget provided for increases of £5 per week for old age pensioners and £3 per week for those under 66. These improvements came into effect from the beginning of June &mdash; two weeks earlier than in previous years, at an additional cost of over £7 million.</P>
      <P>The cost of further bringing forward the dates of increases to the beginning of January would have very significant cost implications.  By way of illustration, the cost of bringing this year's budget increases forward from the beginning of June to the beginning of January 1998 would have cost an additional £74 million.</P>
      <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including the timing of these increases, are matters to be examined in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established by my Department in 1996 to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the scheme's services.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems.  Funding is not available for conventional burglar alarms under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Older people, aged 65 or over, who live alone or in households made up exclusively of older and-or other dependent vulnerable people and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves, can benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.  Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow the Department to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
      <P>As the closing date for receipt of applications under the 1998 scheme was 22 May, it is not possible at this stage to accept applications under the scheme.  Applications received before that date are being considered in the regional offices of my Department who expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July last year this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, the Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way <Col N="719" /> possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>The <i>pro rata</i> pension referred to by the Deputy has been introduced to address the very specific issue of the group of self-employed people who, having entered social insurance in April 1988 and paid into the fund, found themselves excluded from entitlement.</P>
      <P>This new pension will only be payable to those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed and who have between five and ten years contributions paid since April 1988. Further details will be announced at budget time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the ten year rule, in general a person is required to have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961, with the purpose of linking entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to amend this existing arrangement.</P>

      <P>The costings and statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, to qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have (i) entered insurance at least ten years before pension age; (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid, and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 <Col N="720" /> contributions or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 &mdash; when the unified system of social insurance came into effect &mdash; or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last year. To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>I also recently announced the introduction of a new <i>pro rata</i> pension in the very specific case of self-employed people who were over age 56 in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed.  In this instance, the yearly average has been reduced to five due to the fact that these people, having paid into the social insurance fund, found themselves excluded from entitlement.</P>
    <P>Prior to l953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 196l did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
    <P>However, contributions paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    <P>I have long stated my commitment to ensuring the most broadly feasible contributory pension coverage to as many categories as possible.  With this in mind, my officials are undertaking a detailed review of the contribution conditions generally applying to the old age contributory and retirement pensions and I hope to have a report on this in the first quarter of next year. This review will include the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of my key priorities for the arts, as identified in the Government's programme An Action Plan for the Millennium, is support for disabled artists.  In this regard, when I appointed a new Arts Council earlier this year, I was particularly pleased to nominate to the council a person with particular knowledge of the issues relating to arts and disability.</P>
      <P>Arts and disability is one of the areas specifically referred to under the terms of reference of the review of the current arts plan which I have commissioned and which I expect to receive the report on shortly.  Arts and disability organisations, as well as other arts groups, were invited to participate in the review process by making submissions to the consultants who are carrying out the review on my behalf.  The review will inform the development of a new arts plan by the Arts Council.</P>

      <P>My Department has no funds available to cover the preservation of properties other than those where I, as Minister, am the owner or guardian.  As I am neither the owner nor guardian of Lismore Castle, I am not in a position to fund its restoration.</P>
      <P>The main source of public funding for heritage related projects is the Heritage Council, based in Kilkenny, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including limited financial assistance, in relation to the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner/occupier of an approved building/garden in respect of repair, maintenance or restoration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware of plans for a new system of protection and grant-aid for buildings and structures of interest which I have advanced in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Funding for grant-aid towards the cost of repair and maintenance of such buildings and structures is due to come on stream from next year.</P>

      <P>As explained in my reply to Question No. 334 of 24 March 1998, my Department has at present no funds for coastal protection works on the mainland which are the responsibility of the local authority and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  My Department received an application under scéim na mbóithre aise &mdash; accommodation roads scheme &mdash; in respect of the road referred to by the Deputy.  At my Department's request, Mayo County Council provided an estimate for the cost of the works required which amounted to £20,000.  The application was then evaluated in the context of the 203 other applications received from applicants in the Mayo Gaeltacht and the limited amount of funding available to me under the scheme but, unfortunately it was not possible to provide funding for it.</P>
      <P>The application in question will, however, be reconsidered under scéim na mbóithre in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the National Museum of Ireland in this question which is the national cultural institution under the aegis of my Department which is primarily entrusted with the collection and display of historical items.  In answering this question I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 25 of 7 May 1998, 89 of 7 May 1998 and 17 of 15 October 1998.  I also presume that the Deputy is referring to those artefacts which are suitable to be on public display in the normal course.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Ireland holds collections of material in storage which are not available for public display.  It is in the nature of collecting institutions that it is neither appropriate nor possible to have all the artefacts in their collections on public display at all times.  In general, however, a significant proportion of the collections of these institutions, at any one time, would be available for some form of public viewing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main collection still in storage in the National Museum is the folklife collection although a selection of material is now on display at the National Museum's new premises at Collins Barracks and some objects are on display, on loan, in various county museums.  However, <Col N="726" /> the development of a National Museum of Ireland Folklife Centre at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo, will ensure that a much fuller range of this collection will be available for public viewing.  The geological collection of the National Museum is also in storage.  However it is planned to mount exhibitions drawn from this collection in a new exhibition gallery for earth sciences in the plans for the next phase of development at Collins Barracks.  Much of the art and collections of the museum is now on display at Collins Barracks.  Key artefacts from the museum's antiquities division are usually on public display.  In relation to other artefacts held in storage selections are provided for public display from time to time as appropriate and as the theme of an exhibition requires.  For instance, artefacts from the ethnographical collection were displayed as part of a Spice Islands exhibition.  In some cases reserve collections of the National Museum are also accessible to the public, particularly for the benefit of researchers.  Viewing can be arranged by appointment.</P>
    <P>The National Museum as with any of the other institutions has its own individual collection policy based on resources available and on priorities in relation to its own individual requirements. Items of historical significance which are appropriate to an institutions collection can thus be acquired subject to the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a previous reply to the Deputy, in order for the National Museum to properly manage its collections, and not just for reasons of display, it is necessary that all its artefacts be documented and that an easily accessible record of these collections be in place.  In the past such documentation systems have been largely paperbased and were not always maintained in a consistent manner.  In recognition of the needs in this area, a programme was initiated in 1995 to prepare a computerised inventory of the National Museums collection, focusing in the first instance on those objects in the art and industry collection due to be transferred to the new National Museum facility at Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>This inventory of artefacts which is a long-term process of properly documenting all of the records relating to the museum's extensive collection, is ongoing at this time.  I am pleased to say that to date many thousands of items have been included in the inventory.</P>
    <P>I look forward to sustained progress in this most important aspect of the National Museum's activities in the future and I am confident that with the records thus created, it will be possible to make available to researchers and the public alike a wider range of information regarding the collections of the National Museum.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is primarily concerned with buildings of the pre-1700 AD period and the resources available are mainly directed towards national monuments and historic properties in State care.  There are a total of 17 national monuments and historic properties in County Kildare in State care at present, as detailed in Table 1.  There are no current plans to acquire any further such properties in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>Regarding recorded monuments and places, while fully complete statistics are not available for the total number of historic buildings, houses or ruins including castles and great houses not in State care, the Record of Monuments and Places identifies the vast majority of these properties and affords legal protection to all the Monuments and Sites listed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a record has been established for over 1,600 sites in County Kildare and is available for inspection at various venues locally including the Kildare County Council Offices, Kildare County Library, farm development offices and Teagasc offices in the county.

    <P>Regarding architectural heritage, a national inventory of architectural heritage is being undertaken by Dúchas.  There are a projected one mi ion structures to be recorded making it a long-term project which is aimed for completion by 2010.  Surveying has not yet commenced in Country Kildare.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings which will commence in 1999.  This scheme includes measures for the protection of the architectural heritage, including the new grants scheme for listed buildings, agreed by Government and announced by the Minister for Environment and Local Government and myself in May 1998.  The new grants scheme will be administered by the local authorities.  It will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum and will be opera in accordance with national criteria and standards to be drawn up by an advisory group comprising representatives of the two Departments and the Heritage Council.  Draft Bills to provide for further protective measures and to establish the inventory on a statutory basis are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Regarding natural heritage sites, the following sites in County Kildare have been proposed for designation as Natural Heritage Areas, NHAs: Ballina Bog, Ballynafagh Lake, Barrow Valley at Tankardstown Bridge, Carbury Bog, Corballis Hill, Curragh (Kildare), Derryvullagh Island, Donadea Wood, Dunlavin Marshes, Grand Canal, Hodgestown Bog, Kilteel Wood, Liffey at Osberstown, Liffey Valley Meander Belt, Mouds Bog, Oakpark, Poulaphouca Reservoir, Red Bog (Kildare) and the Royal Canal.</P>
    <P>The following sites were proposed for NHA designation and were also proposed as candidate special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive: Ballynafagh Bog, Pollardstown Fen and Rye Water Valley/Carton.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 81 of 15 Deireadh Fómhair last.  Planning permission was granted for development works at Maynooth Castle subject to certain conditions.  An initial provision of £1 million has been earmarked for the project of which 75 per cent is being funded by the European Union's Operational Programme for Tourism. To date £78,000 has been expended.  A detailed programme for the works is being considered in the light of available resources.  It is intended to commence the first phase of the restoration works in the latter half of 1999.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a major restoration of the Connolly Folly was undertaken by the Irish Georgian Society in the early 1960s.  In the intervening period there has been some deterioration and wanton vandalism. Since coming into State care in 1993, fencing and gates have been erected at the folly in order to protect the site and a detailed survey has been carried out which has highlighted certain restoration works that are required.  However, I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that my Department's current priority must be the extensive restoration programme for Castletown House itself.  I assure the Deputy that the condition of the folly will be closely monitored and restoration works will be undertaken as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received 26 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  The prioritised locations are Bray, Cork, Dublin South-Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.  The remaining applications, including Dún Laoghaire, are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective levels of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.  Applications are also evaluated from a technical and telecommunications perspective.  It is only fair to say, however, that the commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory <Col N="732" /> committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>
    <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera.  Each application submitted must also be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>The payment of rent allowances to the gardaí and prison officers goes back many years.  In the case of prison officers, the allowance goes as far back as the 19th century and it was introduced for members of the Garda Síochána in 1927.</P>
      <P>While the rate of allowance payable to the two services has tended, since 1947, to be broadly similar, there have been significant differences over the years in the way the allowance has been applied, especially in regard to qualification for the allowance and its pensionability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters such as these have been and continue <Col N="733" /> to be decided through negotiation with the relevant staff associations.  Clause 2 (iii) of the PCW provided that claims for improvements in pay and conditions be addressed on a basis which would involve change in structures, work practices or other conditions of service.  In the case of the Prison Service negotiations took place with the Prison Officers' Association under this clause and agreement on a package of measures was reached.  One of the issues which was agreed with the association was that rent allowance will be pensionable to members of the prison service serving on or after 1 January 1994.  It was also agreed with the association that rent allowance will be reckonable for the purpose of calculating lump sums or death gratuity in the case of members who retired or died in service in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993.  In such cases pension will only be adjusted to take account of rent allowance with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
    <P>Making rent allowance pensionable has cost implications.  Clause 2 (iii) of the PCW put a ceiling on the overall cost of agreements.  A cut off date for the pensionability of rent allowance had, therefore, to be agreed upon.  The dates outlined above were agreed with the association.</P>
    <P>It is established practice that allowances, where they are made pensionable for the first time, are made pensionable only for employees serving on or after the effective date.  This has been consistent policy for all public service groups.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  The programme is currently under review by my Department and I expect that this review will be completed by the end of 1998.  On completion of the review, details of the revised schemes will be widely publicised and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new programme.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to say what projects will be funded under the programme in 1999 in the Waterford constituency.  Details of tourism projects being funded is available from Bord Fáilte Éireann which is the implementing agency for tourism grant schemes, particularly those involving EU funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently 69 sets of legal proceedings involving children seeking appropriate education services where I, as Minister for Education and Science, am one of the named respondents.  Some 48 of these cases relate to children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>These cases have been initiated at various points over a number of years and are currently at various stages in the legal process.</P>
      <P>The most important issue in these proceedings is to ensure that the needs of the children concerned are met.  My Department makes all reasonable efforts to resolve these cases to the satisfaction of the courts, in consultation with parents, school authorities and other appropriate agencies.</P>
      <P>Some of the cases will have effectively lapsed due to the failure of the plaintiffs to proceed with them.  In some such instances this will be because satisfactory provision has been put in place for the children in question.</P>
      <P>My recent announcement concerning children with special needs will remove the cause of many of these cases, particularly concerning education services for children with autism.</P>

There is a psychologist assigned to post-primary schools in County Cavan, but the service has not yet been expanded to include primary schools in the county.</P>
      <P>On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced.  Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in 1999.  It is not possible to meet all the needs in all areas at the same time, so a phased expansion of the service is necessary.  It is my intention that there will be an educational psychological service available to all schools by the end of the five year implementation phase.</P>

      <P>The youthreach programme is a joint initiative implemented in VEC youthreach centres and FÁS funded community training workshops.  The pay claim for staff in the education sector is seeking teacher's pay and conditions with appropriate adjustments and extra allowances for the length of the programme. An offer was made which included salary improvements, the introduction of pension, fixed purpose contracts, an incremental scale and movement on the ratio of full-time to part-time posts.  This was rejected on the basis that the pay levels envisaged fell far short of what was being sought.</P>
      <P>A hearing of the Public Service Arbitration Board was held on 23 June 1997.  The board directed that both sides should return to negotiations in the light of a recent pay offer to community training workshops workers and to examine the possibility of a settlement in the context of this offer.  Discussions ensued but the union was not in a position to agree that the CTW offer provided the basis for a settlement.</P>
      <P>The matter was referred back to the arbitration board who held a further hearing on 3 September 1998.  Further documentation was supplied by both sides on 23 September 1998 which is now being considered by the board, and a decision is expected very shortly.</P>

      <P>An application has been received for the provision of a PE hall at Christian Brothers secondary school, James Street, Kilkenny.  A further letter was received from the school authority recently regarding this application.  As outlined previously, the question of providing physical education facilities at this school can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally. Because of the demand for classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I assure the Deputy that this application <Col N="740" /> will continue to be reviewed in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

The school authorities have confirmed that they will fund the difference in cost between the Department's approved accommodation and the full size sports complex.  The stage one submission for this project, that is the site investigation report, is now awaited from the school's design team.  The question of funding will only arise when the project is ready for tender and as it is at a very early stage of architectural planning it is not possible to indicate when construction will commence.</P>

      <P>There are 490 pupils and 31.75 wholetime equivalent teachers in St. Mary's secondary school, Glasnevin, Dublin 11, giving a pupil-teacher <Col N="742" /> ratio in the school of 15.95 : 1.  The pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes in respect of ordinary enrolments in second level schools since 1970 is set out in the table below.  The ratio shown does not take account of <i>ex quota</i> or concessionary posts.</P>
      <P>A <i>de facto</i> ratio of 16 : 1 applies in the case of enrolments in certain programmes including leaving certificate applied, leaving certificate vocational programme, vocational preparation and training programme and PLC courses.  This ratio was first introduced in 1984 in respect of VPTP courses.  When all pupils and teachers are taken into account, the actual pupil teacher ratio at second level in the 1997-8 school year was of the order of 15.64 : 1 and is anticipated to reduce further this year.</P>
      <P>School authorities may apply for an increase in the approved teacher allocation to cater for particular circumstances.  Applications of this nature are considered under the curricular appeal process and each case is considered on its merits.  As the Deputy will appreciate, additional resources must be considered in light of overall fiscal policy.</P>

      <P>The substance misuse prevention programme, or SMPP, for primary schools has been developed by my Department and applied in selected primary schools over the past three years, which was the development period set for the project.  Approximately 150 primary schools have participated in the development which was assisted by many teachers, parents, personnel from health boards and local drugs task forces and gardaí and overseen by a representative steering committee and led by a small project team in my Department.  It was a successful co-operative project.</P>
      <P>The development of the programme has been evaluated independently.  I launched the evaluation report during European Drug Prevention Week.  This evaluation shows that the programme, as developed and used in schools, was in line with existing programmes which have been shown to be successful elsewhere, that the educational resource material and the training and other support offered were rated very highly by the participating teachers and, in terms of level of suitability, that the programme was suitable for use with children generally.  In summary, the evaluation shows that the development project has resulted in a programme of substance misuse prevention education which is perceived as being highly successful and effective.</P>
      <P>The educational resource materials have been revised finally now in the light of the feed-back from their use.  They are being printed now and will be ready in a couple of weeks.  It is my intention to begin, in early 1999, the dissemination of the entire programme, which is to be called &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo;, in its current form as developed to primary schools generally and to complete the dissemination process as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the problems raised by Deputy Ahern which serve to highlight the inadequacies of current arrangements in relation to school attendance.  Under new legislation, which is currently being drafted and will be enacted in 1999, I will be bringing forward a comprehensive range of measures to address the problem of non-school attendance.  Among my key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility for school attendance on a country-wide basis.  The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.  I am confident that these new measures will eliminate the fragmented nature of current approaches to the problem of early school leaving.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has a staff complement of a principal, nine teachers, two part-time teachers and two special needs assistants.  The current enrolment of the school is 46 pupils.  I am aware that the school in question has recently submitted an application to my Department for the allocation of an additional six special needs assistant posts.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their special needs.</P>
      <P>The case put forward by the school in question is among a number of applications for special needs assistants currently being considered by my Department in the context of this new development in special needs provision.  I expect that responses in such cases will begin to issue shortly and continue through 1999.</P>
