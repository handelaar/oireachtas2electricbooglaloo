      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Taxi Forum was established last December.  Many of the issues it considered cut across departmental boundaries.  For this reason a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as the national taxi organisations, business and consumer interests were represented on the forum.  The representative from my Department ensured that I was kept informed of developments.  The time spent was approximately one half day per month.</P>
      <P>The forum has now completed its work.  It presented its recommendations to me on 2 September. A copy of the forum's recommendations has also been laid before the Dáil.  I believe the forum's recommendations should now be given urgent and serious consideration by the relevant Departments, agencies and interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that yesterday the Dublin local authorities decided to issue 850 new taxi licences?  Does he agree that part of the problem with taxi availability is that this city has the earliest closing public transport system of any city in Europe?  The last DART leaves Dublin before the last pint is pulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1394" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the joint committee of the four local authorities yesterday recommended 820 new licences.  This is in line with the taxi forum report, although it would probably shorten the issuing period by 12 months. I am aware of the early closure of public transport; I am also aware that last year the Minister involved arranged for CIE to run more buses from different locations rather than from one location, which had been the case for a number of years.  The Minister also raised the issue of extending the DART service and I know those discussions have been ongoing.  It is not just a matter of giving a directive because industrial relations matters are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that the report came to him in September.  Has it been published yet?  Has he had discussions with the Minister for Public Enterprise about her Department's intention to ensure CIE runs the DART later than its current closing time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was published in early September and was laid before the House. We have had a number of discussions about the possibility of extending the transport system and last year some moves were made.  The Deputy will know that for a number of years buses left from only one location in the centre city but that was changed last year.  Discussions also took place about the DART but it was too late to make progress on that.  I know the discussions are continuing but some of those involved are reluctant to move forward on these issues.  Perhaps if the Deputy puts down a question for the Minister he may hear the up-to-date position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the DART is one of the most expensive pieces of capital equipment ever installed in this country and that it is scandalous that for seven hours each night, from 11.20 p.m. until 6.30 a.m., that facility is not used despite the large numbers of people who want to use it to get home safely?  In a city that seeks to attract tourists and where tourists have to get accommodation in the suburbs, it is a disgrace that a transport system already in place is not available after 11.20 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the recommendations the taxi forum, in its conclusions, asked the Departments to consider.  The Minister had already endeavoured to do that, but these matters have to be negotiated.  This would mean staff working hours additional to and outside those they currently work.  While it is desirable that this would happen, these matters have to be negotiated with staff interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has seen fit to involve himself and his office in this Dublin transportation issue, will he outline the problems to the House?  This Administration is not the first to have to deal with this problem, which is not easy <Col N="1395" /> to resolve, but since all the negotiations have taken place, will the Taoiseach indicate the difficulties that would arise in operating the DART after hours?  Is it a matter of additional overtime or cash?  Perhaps the Taoiseach might share these inner secrets with the wider public.</P>

      <P>We are moving away from the substance of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As you may have heard this morning, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and from the Taoiseach's reply, his Department is involved because this issue crosses a number of Departments. My question is germane to his replies to supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty answering the question, but I remind the Deputy that the Dublin Taxi Forum has now completed its work.  Other Ministers have answered questions extensively on different aspects of that work because we asked each Department to move on its position.  I am glad we have moved, hopefully by agreement, on the taxi licences issue and that a total of 3,200 licences will be issued over the next number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position with the DART?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the DART, the main reason for the reluctance on the part of the staff last year was law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the report envisage the 820 licences will be issued?  Is the Taoiseach aware there is a serious difficulty in getting a taxi service in Dublin city at certain times?  It will be practically impossible to get a taxi coming up to Christmas but that is also the case on other occasions.  Notwithstanding that the majority of taxi drivers work hard, a number of them do not use the full facility and often suspend their services when it is raining because it is too inconvenient for them.  What can be done to ensure taxi licences are used by all who obtain them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issuing of licences is a matter for the local authorities.  To answer the other questions, the joint committee of the four local authorities recommended that 820 licences be issued over the next three years.  The taxi forum recommended that 826 licences be issued by the end of 2002.  There is a difference of a year, but that matter is currently being discussed by the local authorities to see if it can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the recommendations of the forum related to late night public transport.  The Minister for Public Enterprise has discussed this recommendation with the relevant bodies.  Dublin Bus management and the trade unions are currently discussing the arrangements to cater for additional demand over the Christmas period, as they did last year. <Col N="1396" /> Iarnród Éireann also has plans to increase capacity at weekends and to provide additional services within normal hours, but the question of the DART has not yet been resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in addition to the availability of taxis, cost is also a problem, particularly for young people and those on low incomes?  It prevents them from availing of an opportunity to enjoy a social occasion. Therefore, the availability of public transport late at night is important to this large section of the community.  Even if we had an additional 850 taxis, these people could not afford the fares being charged.  Will the Taoiseach ensure public transport is available to a large number of people living in urban areas who do not have any other means of commuting from the centre of the city to the suburbs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>People do more shopping in the run-up to Christmas and most of them want to leave their cars at home.  Taxis are difficult to find and people frequently have to queue in the rain.  Will the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers try to ensure that the necessary innovative steps are taken to allow people to travel home late at night this Christmas without having to drive their vehicles to social occasions at which they may consume alcohol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government agrees with the sentiments expressed by the Deputies.  We are trying to bring the taxi issue to a conclusion but that will not be adequate.  It is a matter of trying to reach a figure which is agreeable to the local authorities and the taxi forum.  I do not believe that 3,200 taxis will be adequate but it is a big improvement and it represents an increase of 1,000 on the numbers available during the Christmas before last.  However, this will take a number of years to take effect.  Deputy Gay Mitchell is correct to state that taxis do not stay on the roads at all times.  This is particularly evident during and immediately after the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>The other issues to which the Deputies referred involve the DART, trains and buses.  Substantial progress was made in terms of improving Christmas bus services last year and I hope that will continue this year.  It will be all the better if such progress can be achieved in respect of DART services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the extension of DART services past 11.20 p.m. would cause problems in terms of law and order. Has he considered the possibility of employing additional security staff on late night DART trains and, if necessary, charging higher fares to cover increased costs?  This would ensure that such law and order problems would not deny legitimate travellers the opportunity to travel home safely at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1397" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that those matters form part of the discussions to which I referred earlier.  Members will be aware that there are limited difficulties with DART services &mdash; not only those provided late at night &mdash; in certain areas. This was one of the obstacles highlighted last year.  A resolution must be found to this problem because extended late night DART services would make a big difference for travellers, particularly at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difficulties associated with this matter but Christmas is not going to take us by surprise this year no more than it did last year.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to assure the public in Dublin that a solution will be found to this problem now so that by the beginning of the Christmas period there will be an extended DART service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, I am in a position to provide such an assurance about bus services but I cannot yet do so in respect of DART services because discussions between staff interests, management and the relevant Ministers have not concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Contacts between the management of semi-State bodies and the Government take the form of ongoing interaction involving the appropriate parent Departments and Ministers. In addition, I am kept informed of key developments and issues affecting the operations of such bodies.  This process works well and is complemented by meetings between myself and the chief executives of semi-State organisations as the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in the House previously, a key Government priority in respect of the semi-State sector has been to maximise the conditions to <Col N="1398" /> enable such companies to be competitive and cost-effective in the provision of vital public services to the benefit of the consumer.  Our aim is to have growing and healthy companies, serving the public well and giving high quality employment at home and abroad and I am satisfied with progress in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the weekend, the Taoiseach stated he is planning to establish a new pilot scheme to enable all State bodies to provide better services to certain urban black spots such as Jobstown in Tallaght and Togher in Cork.  What exactly has the Taoiseach in mind and how does it differ from the partnership companies already in place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in Cork and in Killarney. I was speaking about the drugs problem and the work in progress under Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in these areas, with the community, to try to deal with the difficulties of drug addiction and the lack of educational opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With no disrespect, what is new about this?  Is this not what the drugs task forces have been doing and what the partnership companies, established under the previous Government, are doing?  What is the Government proposing that is new in Togher and in Jobstown?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that a youth facilities fund was set up this year which has been allocated £25 million.  Recently most of the 11 areas &mdash; ten in Dublin and one in Cork &mdash; submitted their plans, priorities and recommendations following a project which involved four pilot areas in Dublin and one in Cork.  Their recommendations have been accepted by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. He outlined last Thursday what precisely he intends to do in these areas.</P>

      <P>What is new is that the work of the pilot areas will be developed further. The money available to the service fund last year was zero, this year it is £25 million.  There is also £10 million in the drugs area which was available last year.  The Minister has been listening to the communities &mdash; the end user &mdash; to find out how best the Government can start to alleviate the problems and the difficulties in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I met with the chairman of the National Competitiveness Council, Mr. Brian Patterson, on Tuesday, 22 September.  Mr. Patterson briefed me on the council's ongoing programme of work. The council has recently prepared a statement on skills and a statement on telecommunications. These will be published shortly following their submission to Government.  The council is also working on its next annual report and on a statement on costs, both of which will be published early in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware one of the main concerns of the National Competitiveness Council is to establish a strategy for the making available of broad band telecommunications facilities?  Will he agree that broad band is where jobs will be provided, given that most modern jobs cannot be provided without usage of broad band?  Will he further agree it is not adequate to leave this simply to the free market, allowing for provision to be made only where there is already a guarantee of a profit for the private providers?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Government, in the interests of regional population distribution and the avoidance of excessive congestion in and around Dublin, needs to take a strategic view to ensure broad band communications are provided to important centres in the west and in areas that are otherwise peripheral so that call centre jobs and other jobs of that nature can be attracted to those areas? The pump must be primed by Government provision and leadership in this area.  It cannot be left solely to the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is broadly correct and is in line with what the Minister for Public Enterprise has stated.  The whole area of telecommunications infrastructure is internationally competitive and is vital to our future.  That is the reason the Government has taken various decisions.  The telecommunications market will be liberalised by 1 December 1998. The powers of the regulator have been reviewed to give her stronger powers; the awareness campaign is progressing; the telecommunications infrastructure legislation, which is vital, is progressing; the Government is exploring ways of increasing investment in Telecom infrastructure, particularly the broad band, and is looking at proposals on e-commerce; and the advisory committee <Col N="1400" /> on telecommunications, which has a number of world renowned experts, is to report before Christmas on how we can deal with this issue.  I agree that if we can set up science parks and e-commerce centres, we will have the capability to move away from the centre.  The Minister attended a recent international conference on this and I read her report on it.  If we develop this area properly and keep ahead of what is happening elsewhere, we will be able provide tremendous opportunities in regional areas, and that is the right way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government publish a strategic map showing the broadband communications connections and the towns and arteries within them that will have a broadband network so that the people will know the Government's physical plan for the development of employment through telecommunications?  This is not something that should be kept private between the telecommunications regulator and the companies with the public not knowing ultimately where the broadband connections will be provided.  There should be a national plan on this issue which should be published and made available for everyone to discuss.  Choices will be made to provide broadband connection in some places and not in others.  Will the Taoiseach agree that those choices should be public knowledge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have such a plan.  She has commissioned a report and I thank the group who are working on it.  I am not sure what form the report will take, but the group has considered those aspects in terms of infrastructure. I do not want to pre-empt the report by saying how it will be published, but it will be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of publishing the consultants' report.  Will the Government publish decisions as to what it intends to do in this matter?  Will that be in the form of a map that will be transparent and show where the routes will be provided?  If so, when will the Government publish its strategy on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be wise to await the report before the Government makes a decision.  I said the report will be ready in December, but the Minister has told me it will be ready on 18 November. We will examine it as well as the work of the Information Society Commission, the work of the advisory group working on behalf of the Minister and the work of others in the private sector who have been studying e-commerce.

      <P>On the Deputy's first question, we must await the recommendations of the report of the advisory group.  The Minister has been engaged in discussions with that group who have devoted an enormous amount of time to this work.  It is not for us to jump in and put forward proposals before we have sight of that report.  The Department and some of the State agencies have worked actively in this area.  The IDA and Telecom have also been actively involved.  I did not have any discussions with the National Competitiveness Council about medical consultants.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that wasteful expenditure in the public service is probably in the order of between £100 million and £300 million annually?  Given that industry must become competitive in view of the pending pressures of EMU, is it not time the public sector gave the lead and the Taoiseach, as head of Government, took steps to ensure that Ministers and public agencies identify and cut out wasteful public expenditure and use such funds in a more productive way?</P>

Does he agree there is a huge and urgent need to provide re-skilling and upskilling for workers in firms such as Fruit of the Loom and Krups where jobs are vulnerable so that these jobs are not lost, or if they are lost that the people have the skills to move on to other jobs?  Does he also agree that there is a serious and almost scandalous neglect of in-house training by employers in significant firms in Ireland at present and that the failure to invest in training is a betrayal of employees because it makes them vulnerable to the kind of fate the employees in Krups and Fruit of the Loom are suffering or fear they will suffer?</P>

However, because of the present skills shortage the Department <Col N="1402" /> and the agencies will address it in the Estimates.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission's first report was published in February this year and I understand copies were circulated to every Member of the House.  The report sets out the main areas of the commission's work programme covering awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues, Government services and social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The commission has set up six advisory groups to help take its work forward in each of these areas.  As the term suggests, the role of these groups is to advise the commission.  However, a significant amount of the commission's work is also being done directly at advisory group level under the overall guidance of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline the main issues being examined <Col N="1404" /> and some of the specific initiatives the commission has undertaken recently.  Possibly the most important work of the commission is in raising awareness of the information society and its benefits.  Initiatives here include the holding of a conference in June on the importance of the information society for social inclusion.  Also in June, the commission co-hosted a symposium on electronic commerce at which Ira Magaziner, special advisor to the US President, was the keynote speaker.</P>
    <P>The commission is the primary sponsor of a new television series &ldquo;TechTV&rdquo;, which is currently being screened by Network 2 every Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. The commission, in conjunction with IBEC, has also launched an awareness campaign for businesses, especially small and medium sized businesses, which will run until the end of next year.  In addition, it is encouraging businesses to adopt its logo as a demonstration that they are embracing the information society.</P>
    <P>On infrastructure, the commission is monitoring developments closely in the run up to full liberalisation of the telecommunications market on 1 December.  It is considering all of the key issues in this area, including the question of ensuring full international connectivity at competitive prices.  It is one of a number of bodies whose views are helping to shape strategic policy decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to learning, the commission is focusing on strategies to encourage the concept of lifelong learning in all walks of life within the information society.  In this context, it has already highlighted the need for additional measures outside the formal education process.  In the area of enterprise, the commission is considering employment issues arising under the information society and is examining ways of monitoring and assessing the changes arising from the increasing trend towards new forms of work organisation, including flexible working time, increased teleworking and home working.</P>
    <P>On legal issues, the commission is examining a wide range of subjects where legislation is likely to require amendment or where new legislation may be needed, arising from its work under the other headings.  For example, to facilitate electronic commerce, appropriate legislation is needed under a number of headings, such as facilitating security and confidentiality of transactions and ensuring protection of data and copyright.</P>
    <P>Under Government services and social inclusion, the commission monitors best international practice in delivery of public services electronically and provides advice on how best to ensure developments in this area address the needs of groups such as the elderly and persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the commission arranged a conference in June on the importance of the information society for social inclusion. The commission will shortly publish the results of national surveys it commissioned on attitudes <Col N="1405" /> towards and use of information and communication technologies among the general population and the business community.  This will enable the commission to focus its efforts in the period ahead.  I understand it will present its next annual report at the beginning of 1999.</P>
    <P>On the question of Border communities and counties, the terms of reference of the Information Society Commission do not include specific measures.  Rather, it focuses on measures at national level, aimed at increasing awareness of, and skills in, information and communication technologies and encouraging provision of better quality telecommunications infrastructure nationwide.</P>
    <P>While Border counties may be among the least developed regions in this context at present, a nationwide approach will help to extend the benefits of the information society to all parts of the country.  Some of the initiatives I have already mentioned are of particular relevance here.  These include the commission's awareness campaign, which covers the &ldquo;TechTV&rdquo; series, and the business awareness campaign being run with IBEC.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, the deployment of PCs and internet access to all schools, as recommended by the commission, is bringing the information society into every school in the country, irrespective of its physical location.</P>
    <P>On telecommunications infrastructure, the commission recommended the use of the EU economic infrastructure operational programme to assist in providing broadband facilities in areas where this may not be commercially attractive initially, and over 20 million ECUs have now been allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>These measures will help to bring the information society to the Border counties along with the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>What legislation is necessary to improve the enforceability of contracts transacted by electronic means and to deal with the authentication of participants to contracts from a legal point of view so that electronic commerce can develop on a sound legal basis where each participant knows where he or she stands legally?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is required in this area and, as far as I know, it is being prepared. The introduction of such legislation was discussed at the Ottawa conference.  All countries can legislate for the protection of privacy, consumer rights, parties using electronic transactions and other such matters.  We have to legislate ourselves, apart from already existing international co-operation on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree it is part of this question?  We cannot have an information society if there are no rules.  If there is no legislation to guarantee that contracts made electronically can be enforced in the courts, there is not much point in talking about e-commerce and employing consultants to describe all sorts of wonderful scenarios for which there is no legal basis?  When will the legislation be prepared and what will it cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In this area more has been done this year than in the past few years during which nothing was done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these matters have been moved forward.  Internationally, there is no certainty yet as to how this matter can be dealt with. All that has happened internationally is that the Finnish conference last year and the recent Ottawa conference identified areas where we should communicate on a global basis.  It has been stated that electronic commerce should have the same taxation base as any other business transaction. It has not been possible, following the Ottawa Conference, to put a mechanism in place for doing this.  It is unlikely that Ireland would have found an international resolution when nobody else has.  However, we have started the process.  The Minister for Public Enterprise is diligently working on it, using international experts who may be able to assist us in finding the best way forward.  We are lucky we have so many high-tech companies here making their powers and knowledge in this area available to the Government.  Nobody has yet found a way to deal internationally with this.  Every day there are movements through the skies on the highways of the world.  That has to be given a structured legislative base, and that has not yet happened anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that at present e-commerce is a reality for those people who want to access the virtual book-shop, Amazon. com, that credit cards of one kind or another are already being accepted and that we have the reality of e-commerce as we speak?  Would the Taoiseach agree that if we take the approach he is advocating, it will be four or five years before the Government has any legislative framework in <Col N="1407" /> place?  Can the Minister for Public Enterprise not bring forward minimalist legislation to overcome the barriers that are currently identified by consultants here, and not await international conventions? If the legislation needs to be upgraded and amended in due course, so be it.  Is there not a crying necessity for minimalist legislation to give a legal framework to activities that are ongoing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, many of those do not require legislation because security codes are already being used in respect of them. Deputy Bruton is referring primarily to what the OECD Fiscal Affairs Committee has set about &mdash; trying to find a financial framework for these issues and to legislate accordingly.  That is where we require legislation.  There is no difficulty with security codes which are being used by many commercial companies all the time to protect their financial base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that an electronic communication is not recognised as a document for legal purposes in the same way as something written on paper, and that if we are to talk about developing e-commerce we have to reach a point where that is so?  That is not something that needs to await OECD conferences or conferences in Ottawa or any other exotic place.  It is something we can do ourselves.  We gave a lead in duty free shops in Shannon 30 years ago.  We did not wait for others to establish a norm in duty free shops before setting up our own in Shannon. If we are to give a lead in the area of electronic commerce, does the Taoiseach agree we should be to the forefront in legislating for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to forefront.  Wherever we can make progress, be it recommendations by the Information Society Commission or the interdepartmental group, we will certainly make it, and where there is need for legislation, we will introduce it.  However, where there is international uncertainty, which there is in some of these issues, it is prudent for us to at least bear it in mind without allowing it to stall us completely. We can ignore the framework for conditions set out by the OECD fiscal affairs committee until there is some basis for the operation of these matters at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has reacted quickly in most areas, such as protection from piracy, consumer rights, adoption of parties elected to planning transactions and a host of other areas.  The advisory group we have established has some of the best people in the world in this business as members.  If it recommends certain courses of action in certain areas, we will take them and I do not see any reason we cannot.  However, in <Col N="1408" /> preparing legislation, we should at least observe what is happening globally.</P>

      <P>As with all other aspects of life, stunted opportunity is a daily reality for Border communities.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge the need to approach information and communications technology with a cross-Border focus to maximise the potential for real change?  Will he outline if there is such a focus on this area of work in the current work programme of the Information Society Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Society Commission believes that, if the proper infrastructure is put in place, the playing field can be levelled. Once the telecommunications infrastructure is in place, companies whose business is largely conducted electronically will be able to work anywhere in the country.  There are enormous developments in e-commerce every quarter through new research and ideas.  Installing the proper infrastructure will make it possible for all regions to compete for business because the very nature of the information society means one can access information and services irrespective of one's physical location.  I have every confidence that, if the infrastructure is installed, businesses will be able to operate anywhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is familiar with the concept of an industry standard where the major operator who first enters an area of business establishes the industry standard for a commodity, product or electronic commerce. Would it make sense for Ireland to seek to establish the industry standard for the regulation of e-commerce? It would mean our being a leader in this area and attracting electronic commerce here on the basis that we provided the best legal protection in the world because we took the initiative rather than waiting for an international consensus to emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be good for us to do that but the infrastructure is needed and deregulation is required in certain areas.  There are people in the private sector who are driving this agenda and working with the State agencies in that regard.  They want to attract the main niche of this business into Ireland and we and the State agencies will do everything to assist and support them in that, be it through e-commerce infrastructure, framework regulations or trying to influence what is happening in the EU.  However, all these people emphasise that, while trying to lead the debate, we must co-operate with and co-ordinate what is happening internationally.  Telecommunications networks and e-commerce are global. They are influenced by what is happening on the world scene.  Together with Finland, Ireland is one of the few countries giving a lead.</P>

      <P>There is an undeniable case, in a small country such as ours, for building a critical mass of skills related to financial regulation within a single body.  However, it is simply not possible to proceed to the immediate introduction of legislation on the matter.  The current regulatory system for financial services in Ireland is hindered by the multiplicity of regulatory bodies, each of which has different powers and functions.  The establishment of a single regulatory authority will be a major task involving a review of the functions and activities of all existing regulators, including my Department and the Central Bank.  This is the first Government to take positive action to deal with the issue and it is my intention that it should be tackled effectively and expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish an implementation group to furnish proposals on the role, scope and functions of the new authority and to progress the work necessary to enable it to become operational as soon as possible.  I am making available a copy of the full terms of reference of the implementation group for inclusion in the Official Report.  The implementation group, which will hold its first meeting this week, has been asked to report back with its recommendations by the end of February next.  The insurance section of my Department regulates insurance undertakings and the market for insurance products.  In addition, the Registrar of Friendly Societies has responsibility for regulating credit unions, friendly societies and industrial and provident societies while the Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for the authorisation of mortgage and credit intermediaries and the monitoring of all customer charges by credit institutions under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  With the establishment of the single regulatory authority, it is likely that responsibility for these areas will transfer to the new regulator.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Terms of Reference of the Implementation Group for the Financial Regulatory Authority To advise the Government on:</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>a) the role and functions of the single financial regulatory authority e.g. prudential supervision, the maintenance of orderly markets, safeguarding of clients funds, consumer protection, the development and regulation of <Col N="1410" /> conduct of business rules &mdash; including consideration of the issues arising from combining the functions of monetary policy and prudential regulation;</P>
    <P>b) the range of financial service providers to be overseen by the authority &mdash; e.g. banks, building societies, Post Office Savings Bank, insurance companies and brokers, investment intermediaries, including lawyers and accountants in as much as they handle clients' funds, exchanges, credit unions, friendly societies, finance companies, moneylenders, etc.  &mdash; also taking account of the development of electronic commerce which may involve new types of service providers;</P>
    <P>c) the extent to which existing regulators &mdash; e.g., the Director of Consumer Affairs, Registrar of Friendly Societies, Central Bank and Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; if any, would continue to have functions in relation to the regulation of the financial services sector and the extent to which any alteration to the <i>status quo</i> would impinge on the non-regulatory functions of the Central Bank;</P>
    <P>d) the organisational structure for the authority including the manner of its public accountability;</P>
    <P>e) the funding, resourcing and staffing of the authority, and issues arising in a transition to a new structure, including staffing and industrial relations, and the extent to which the authority could be self-financing;</P>
    <P>f) the legislative changes necessary for the establishment of the authority;</P>
    <P>g) the time schedule including, in so far as necessary, a phased implementation, for achieving the objective of a fully operational single financial regulatory authority at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>In meeting its terms of reference, the implementation group should be cognisant of, and take into account as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(i) the findings of the working group, established by the Minister for Finance, which is at present examining legal and consumer issues in banking;</P>
    <P>(ii) the findings of the Moriarty tribunal in so far as its remit extends to the regulation of the financial sector;</P>
    <P>(iii) the findings of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the regulation and supervision of financial institutions;</P>
    <P>(iv) the regulatory arrangements operating in other jurisdictions, with particular reference to how the individual consumer is afforded protection; and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> (v) the importance of the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think there is need for more regulations to protect the consumer as opposed to consolidating existing regulations? Has the working group been informed of this or is it being asked to decide whether there is need for more regulations?  What will be the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs if the new regulator will be responsible for dealing with such matters as bank charges, the responsibility for which was delegated recently to the Director of Consumer Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need to enforce existing regulations.  It is disappointing that in many respects existing company law is not being enforced.  As the Deputy is probably aware, in September I appointed a working group to look at the enforcement of company law and it is due to report within the next few days.  It is looking at whether there is need for change.  There is need, however, to move away from prudential regulation of financial institutions to aggressive regulation on behalf of the consumer.  As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Consumer Affairs has a wide remit, of which the charges imposed by credit and financial institutions form a small part. The newly appointed director, Carmel Foley, will be a member of the implementation group which is looking at the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What is meant by the term &ldquo;aggressive regulation&ldquo;?  What extra regulations are required to protect the consumer?  Is there a difference between what the Minister and the Minister for Finance think should happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the summer the Minister for Finance and I appointed a working group of officials to look at this issue.  We were of the view that there was need for a single financial regulator. It is unsatisfactory that there is a plethora of regulatory bodies.  The taxpayer is not getting value for money and the consumer is not receiving adequate protection.  On the existing regulations, it has much to do with culture and ethos. Traditionally the role of the Central Bank was one of prudential regulation with a view to ensuring financial institutions were sound and financially stable.  It also managed the currency well and advised Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of what has come to light recently and the changes occurring with the introduction of euro there is need for less passive regulation. We should be as concerned with the interests of the consumer as we are with prudential regulation.  To a large extent what is required is a new attitude and culture, not new laws.  It is not fair to expect a body which is supposed to protect institutions to take action on behalf of the consumer.  This conflict of responsibilities may be part of the problem.  That is the reason we established <Col N="1412" /> an implementation group on which the Central Bank, the Director of Consumer Affairs, my Department and the Department of Finance are represented.  There are also three outside persons involved.  It is the most appropriate group to come forward with recommendations on the most effective way of putting in place a single financial regulator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect to receive the group's report and will she ensure it is published as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the scope of the chairperson to do things ahead of time, as he proved in the case of the company law enforcement group, it may be presented before the deadline of the end of February.  It is the intention to publish it.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Committee of Public Accounts are carrying out extensive investigations into alleged irregular practices at the AIB concerning the non-payment of DIRT.  I am satisfied that these are the most appropriate means of addressing these serious allegations.  I will, however be closely monitoring the progress of these investigations.  Since the central focus of the allegations relates to issues of taxation for which I have no statutory responsibility, it would be inappropriate for me to invoke my powers under the Companies Acts.  Nonetheless, compliance with statutory obligations under the various codes of law applying in this jurisdiction is a matter of continuing concern to me. In that regard, and in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, we announced on 22 October the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. We also announced the establishment of an implementation group to progress the necessary work.  The group will report to both the Minister for Finance and myself by the end of February 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that one of her major functions is to regulate standards of behaviour and probity in the banks? Given the evidence in the public domain that there were 53,000 bogus non-resident accounts in the late 1980s and early 1990s and that there was collaboration and collusion by the AIB and possibly other banks in the promotion of such accounts, is it not appropriate for the Minister to use her powers to institute an investigation?  Does she accept that the Central Bank has failed in its remit in the regulation of banks and that what she is now doing is removing this power from it even <Col N="1413" /> though from January it will be a branch of the European Central Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect, I do not have a role in relation to the banking institutions. I do, however, have responsibilities in relation to the insurance industry, credit unions and friendly societies.  On the investigations under the Companies Acts, the Minister's powers are specific.  In the case of the AIB what has arisen is a tax matter. It is, therefore, the responsibility of another Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank as the regulator of the banks.  What came to light in the case of the NIB was an insurance-related matter.  That is the reason we acted initially under the insurance Acts and subsequently under the companies Acts.</P>
      <P>The situation in AIB is very different.  Different things may emerge but what has emerged to date is concerned only with taxation and Revenue matters.  The most appropriate fora to investigate these matters are the Revenue Commission, the Committee of Public Accounts and, when new powers have been given to him, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It would not be appropriate for me to interfere at this point since these are matters for other bodies.</P>

      <P>The Minister said she would keep a watching brief to see if it would be necessary for her to intervene under the terms of Section 9 of the Companies Act, 1963.  If there is gross misbehaviour by a company in its administration does the Minister not have a role?</P>
      <P>Many of our colleagues in the media and elsewhere have said that <i>prima facie</i> evidence of misbehaviour by a company exists.  Is the Minister prepared to use such evidence to make a formal complaint to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation on behalf of this House.  She is responsible, under the Companies Acts, for misbehaviour by companies.  Will she make a formal complaint on behalf of the House and allow the Garda bureau of fraud investigation pursue its own investigation of this matter which Superintendent Glackin has indicated to me he is prepared to do?</P>

      <P>The powers I have under section 19 of the Companies Act relate to breaches of the Companies Acts.  Recently a person sent me documentation in relation to AIB and I forwarded that to the Garda Síochána, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and others. The Deputy can be assured that if information comes my way I will pass it to the appropriate authorities.  No one can say I have been shy about initiating inquiries as the next question will indicate. I have been involved in 13 inquiries since the Government took office.  I am not reluctant to initiate inquiries but I must be sure that the most appropriate mechanism is found to investigate serious matters which come into the public domain or of which Ministers become aware.  The most appropriate way to investigate the AIB matter is to use the Committee of Public Accounts, <Col N="1414" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not believe there is an appropriate role at this point for the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of investigations being carried out and recently carried out by my Department under insurance and companies legislation is 13.</P>
      <P>These include ten investigations under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 into Celtic Helicopters, Garuda Ltd., Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd., Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Kentford Securities LTD., Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd., Faxhill Homes Ltd., Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (Ilac Centre) Ltd.  These investigations are ongoing except in the case of the two Dunnes Stores inquiries which are subject to judicial review.  The hearing of the review is expected to commence this week.</P>
      <P>An investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 into Bula Resources (Holdings) Ltd.  has been concluded and a report was submitted on 22 July last.  I have sent the report <i>inter alia</i> to the DPP, the Central Bank, and the Garda bureau of fraud investigations for whatever action these authorities deem appropriate.  I have also sent the report to the company and to the Stock Exchange and am at present considering the responses which I recently received from these parties.</P>
      <P>There are two investigations under the Insurance Acts one of which involving Irish Life plc.  is ongoing.  The second involving National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.  has been concluded and has led to the appointment of two High Court inspectors to the company.  The report itself has been referred by me to the DPP and the Revenue Commissioners for whatever action those authorities deem appropriate.</P>
      <P>There are four officers of my Department carrying out the section 19 inquiries under the Companies Acts.  Three officers are carrying out the inquiry into Irish Life under the Insurance Acts.  One external auditor is carrying out the inquiry into Faxhill Homes Ltd.  and an outside inspector carried out the inquiry into Bula Resources (Holdings) Ltd.  Some of the officers of the Department are also involved in other work.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister the status of each investigation but she has not indicated when she expects reports on any of these.  Is she concerned at the number of investigations and why has she not published the NIB report?  The Minister <Col N="1415" /> said in the House that reports of all investigations by her will be made public as soon as possible.  We have heard of many leaks, and comments by the Minister that she is deeply concerned by the facts uncovered by her inspectors but nothing has been published.  Does she intend to publish any of these reports and specifically the one which is completed, the NIB report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows the NIB report led to the appointment of High Court inspectors.  That inquiry is now before the High Court and is a matter for the court.  When the report is completed it will, I imagine be published by the court as all previous section 8 inquiry reports have been.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, while the Minister can act on foot of the information which comes to light or proceed to a further stage, reports received under section 19 of the Companies Act cannot be published.</P>
      <P>In relation to the stages at which inquiries are, I have received a number of interim reports both oral and written.  I expect to receive some final reports very shortly.  Some institutions are cooperating fully with the investigation, others are not.  This is why the inquiries are taking so long.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the number of inquiries. Clearly it would be preferable if 13 inquiries and two tribunals of inquiry were not required. However, in the interest of the country and of the people we represent it is right that we should investigate alleged wrongdoing and take action on foot of that investigation.  Even if that takes time and requires a larger number of inquiries than one would wish, it is preferable to carry out these inquiries and take whatever action is necessary than avoid taking decisions for fear of criticism about wasting time and money.  We do not use those criteria when deciding to investigate street crime and we should not do so in matters of this kind.  I hope my investigations will be completed shortly.  The officers involved have been working extremely hard for almost 12 months since shortly after the publication of the McCracken report.  I believe the inquiries will come to a conclusion sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a short memory. When she sat on the Opposition benches she constantly harangued the Government about delays in having reports completed.  I hope we can take the Minister's word that these reports will be finalised soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the NIB report which the Minister has already received, can she confirm that in the course of the preparation of that report, the Government was informed about problems in AIB?  When did the Minister know about the problems in AIB and the use of non-resident accounts to evade DIRT?  Is it not the case that the Government was warned about what was going on in AIB in the course of the investigation <Col N="1416" /> into NIB?  If the Government was warned why was action not taken on the matter before now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I first became aware of the matter when the <i>Sunday Independent</i> published an article in April of this year.  Almost every day I receive letters, some signed and some anonymous, making allegations against individuals and institutions.  No responsible Minister can casually establish an inquiry on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.  When allegations regarding AIB first came into the public domain as a result of an RTE news bulletin, an officer of the Department first spoke to NIB because we have responsibility for insurance under the Insurance Acts.  On foot of what he found we subsequently carried out a fuller investigation.  One cannot investigate willy-nilly.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the difference between NIB and AIB is that we have responsibility for insurance and the breaches that occurred in NIB related to the insurance industry in the first instance.  NIB was selling products for the sale of which they had no authorisation.  That is a serious breach of insurance legislation.  That is why that is different from the tax related matters which have come to light in AIB.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a package of proposals aimed at delivering better quality supports to long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons, the Deloitte and Touche report proposed that of the 41,000 places currently provided for on community employment schemes, the resources currently being used for 6,000 to 8,000 places would <Col N="1417" /> be better invested in places on other labour market programmes with better employment outcomes for participants than community employment has and on strengthening the training element in the remaining substantial number of community employment places.</P>
    <P>While recognising the value of supports that community employment delivers, the review poses the question as to whether it is the most effective means of delivering appropriate supports to the voluntary and community sector.  The introduction of the dedicated social economy programme, for example, is a recognition that more flexibility and continuity in support than community employment provides is desirable.</P>
    <P>Before changing the criteria for participation in community employment, I intend to initiate full consultation with the social partners.  I stress that there is no threat to the continued existence of community employment which is a valuable programme for many persons.  I intend to discuss future approaches to such supports with all Ministers concerned before bringing forward proposals to amend community employment programmes. I have already placed a copy of the report in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Does she not realise she has caused panic and consternation among voluntary groups throughout the country?  I am a director of a number of community groups in my constituency and I have received more than 20 applications for such schemes.  This morning I received a letter from the director&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a letter similar to those which other Members have received in recent weeks about community employment workers, such as those in cre ches, nursery schools, resource centres, youth centres and churches.  People are concerned because of the Minister's track record and her views on the role of single parents in the economy, in community employment and in general community development.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could comment on the fact that when the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was completed, she left it to her civil servants to present.  She did not present it or say what she would do with it.  That happened on 2 October. Now a month later there is consternation and panic in the community because people feel that the important experience and training which people gained over the past four or five years will not be used.</P>
      <P>Will we not lose a quarter, if not more, of these places?  Partnership 2000 stated that there would be 50,000 community employment places or places in the social economy.  The Minister is now proposing to give us 30,000 places, which is a reduction of 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>The reason I did not present it was that I had to go abroad on the Thursday morning in question for a family funeral.  I apologise for that.</P>
      <P>The report was produced under the strategic management initiative.  It is an independent, not a Government report.  I made it clear that the suggestions for change &mdash; there are some worthy ones &mdash; should at least be considered and discussed with the social partners.  I will do that as quickly as possible before we change any criteria.</P>
      <P>I have already said that community employment has a valuable role to play.  Labour market conditions have changed substantially since Partnership 2000 was first negotiated.  Deputy Broughan was critical of my employment action plan.  However, it is working like a dream after the first month.  Perhaps the Deputy could have an open mind about some things.  We might not give each other the benefit of considering other people's proposals during elections, but there are things which need to be changed.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of that report is that there should be a bigger training element and that we should provide more job orientated training programmes rather than community employment for younger people under 25 years of age. We should discuss that.  I have an open mind about what decisions we might make.  I gave the Deputy a commitment on a previous occasion on this matter.  The report was produced under the strategic management initiative.  It is right that we should publish and debate it and that those who have an interest, particularly the social partners, should be involved in any discussions on it.</P>
      <P>The fourth pillar came up recently with a good suggestion on the social economy.  It suggested that at least 5,000 community employment places should be switched from community employment to a dedicated social economy.  There are possibilities we should explore because there is a role for the social economy.  Notwithstanding the huge success of the economy, there are a number of activities which could not be considered commercial by any stretch of the imagination.  Much worthwhile activity, experience and training can be given to people who participate in the social economy.  We should look at that in addition to the other suggestions in that report.</P>

However, the people affected by this report will not be at the table when the Minister is discussing it with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> I remind the Minister of her public antipathy to lone parents.  What is her view of the recommendation that lone parents should be denied the opportunity to become involved in community employment schemes?  Is she not aware that many lone parents can only work on community employment schemes because of family commitments and that such schemes are targeted to suit lone parents who have responsibility for rearing their children?</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's view of the recommendation that community employment schemes will be phased out of public services?  Is the Minister aware, for example, that almost every school in the country has a community employment scheme in order to have a secretary or caretaker? Can she assure the House that that sector will not be prevented from having the opportunity to become involved in community employment schemes?  Schools could not function without the fine work of these people.  On Sunday I was told that the 59 year old caretaker in Corduff National School in my constituency has finished his three years placement on such a scheme.  He wants to continue working but he cannot do so.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that people over 35 years of age who are in community employment schemes should be considered for a second period of three years as their age is often against them for retraining or getting another job?  That is one of the few recommendations in this report with which I agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The report does not suggest denying lone parents or single mothers community employment.  The report states that it is too early to make any assessment on lone parents.  The Deputy must not have read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that when we have a couple more years experience, we should look at the impact of community employment on lone parents. It makes no recommendation on lone parents.</P>
      <P>Flexibility is the key.  Cut-off targets, whether age or number of years, can often be severe and impact adversely on many people who could otherwise access opportunity.  As Deputy Owen said, some might not have an opportunity to get a job in the labour market.  I recognise the role community employment schemes play for schools and other voluntary bodies.  That is one of the considerations we must take on board when developing the social economy model, where there are opportunities to develop it, and the voluntary area, including the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to see community employment for what it is.  It is to give worthwhile experience to a group of people who might not otherwise be able to access full training, educational opportunities or a job.  It is a stepping stone to a better opportunity for the majority.  It also makes a valuable <Col N="1420" /> contribution to the community.  It is a question of keeping what is best about it, improving it where it needs to be improved and learning from experience. We need to do this with all schemes.  We invest more than £300 million per year in community employment.  It is a large sum of money which delivers enormous benefits.  If we can deliver more benefits, we should do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Six per cent of the 41,000 people on community employment schemes are disabled, compared to one per cent in 1994.  This is an area of great concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have not delivered on the 3 per cent placement of the disabled in the public sector, the Minister has a responsibility to deliver on this in community employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister was rightly criticised by members of ICTU the day this report was published.  She now has an obligation to meet them quickly and decide what she will do.  It is her responsibility to remove the panic and fear groups feel about what will happen to this valuable programme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan should know I am criticised at least once every day.  People may have been critical because the report was leaked to people, such as the Deputy, who decided to stir it up.  When the report was issued a different attitude was taken.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Owen, the report discusses everyone under the age of 25 years, not lone parents specifically.  The report states that everyone under 25 years should get training instead of community employment and we should enhance the training and certification of what they do.  The report did not state that one must participate in community employment or do nothing.</P>

      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will shortly take over responsibility for the training of those with disabilities and negotiations are under way with the Department of Health and Children in this area. <Col N="1421" /> I agree that access of those with disabilities to community employment has been low for a host of reasons.  More opportunities do and should exist for the disabled to access community employment.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the shortage of chefs and other skilled staff in restaurants; and the reason work permits in respect of fully qualified chefs are considered only in the case of new upmarket ethnic restaurants.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that a comprehensive training infrastructure has been put in place to address skills shortages in the tourism industry and that CERT spends approximately £12 million per annum training people, including chefs.  Over the next few years CERT will continue to target more than 12,000 people per annum for training in this sector.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts however that in the area of ethnic restaurants there is a case for granting work permits to qualified chefs and trainers where specialist expertise is required. Accordingly, it is our policy to grant, on request, a limited number of work permits in respect of non-EEA nationals to new restaurants setting up in this country.  There is no policy of confining permits to up-market restaurants and each application is considered on its merits.  In the past permits were granted only to those working in upmarket restaurants.  However, this policy changed before I took office.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister write to me a few weeks ago stating that the Department will consider only applications from upmarket ethnic restaurants which employ fully qualified chefs? That is the basis on which I put down this question. Does the Minister accept there is a huge shortage of qualified chefs and other catering staff given that a great number of new hotels and restaurants have opened?  It is unwise to restrict the skills supply.  When there is a shortage of skilled staff, the Minister should be willing to issue visas to suitably qualified applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I wrote that in a letter to the Deputy.  I assure him that staff working in restaurants which are not upmarket or expensive have been granted work permits.  That has been the case in the Department for quite a <Col N="1422" /> while.  I will review the case referred to by the Deputy again.  Only 6 per cent of applications for work permits are refused by the Department; 94 per cent of applications are currently being granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the pertinent details but it relates to a restaurant in Bantry where ten Irish nationals and one Australian chef are employed.  Perhaps the Minister was not given the details, but she refused to grant the chef a visa to continue to work.  The consequence of this may be the closure of the restaurant.  While I am glad the Minister will look at the case again, will she also look at the broader circumstances?  New hotels are being opened every day of the week, particularly in Dublin.  Surely she realises there is a shortage of skilled staff and we must be open to bringing in suitably qualified staff from abroad until our training facilities are expanded to meet the full market demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the chef's case.  I am aware of staff shortages.  In the new Plaza Hotel in Tallaght, notwithstanding that there are 5,200 people on the live register there, many of the staff are Spanish.  There are staffing problems in the hotel and catering industry which are due not only to a skills shortage.  Some people do not want to work in that sector which is a great pity. We need to examine why this is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the wages were very competitive. Most applications for work permits are granted, 94 per cent have been approved in the past 12 months and 6 per cent have been refused. This is a high proportion by any standards.  Where an employer can demonstrate there is a need for staff which cannot be fulfilled domestically, even if there is not an ethnic necessity, work permits are granted.  I am considering putting work permit legislation on a statutory basis.  It is not on a statutory basis at the moment and appeals go to the Minister.  An independent process for approving and appealing work permits would be more satisfactory. Their consideration could be taken out of the direct influence of Ministers as this consumes an enormous amount of time, notwithstanding that only 6 per cent of applications are refused.  A high proportion of representations made to me relate to work permits.  We need to <Col N="1423" /> put the granting of work permits on a statutory basis so everyone is clear about the ground rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that her Department operates a policy whereby if a person applies to bring in a Chinese chef to work in a Chinese restaurant, he or she is likely to receive an answer that there are enough ethnic chefs in this country?  This is equivalent to saying to Mick McCarthy that because a person is good at playing basketball he or she is perfectly suitable to be included in his soccer team.  Special skills are needed to cook Chinese food, as special skills are needed to cook Thai and Indian food.  Will she ensure her Department does not deal with requests for ethnic chefs on a global basis, as it were?  When she eats Chinese, Indian or Thai food, I am sure she realises it is different and requires different skills.  Her Department operates that policy, despite her saying that only 6 per cent of applications are refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is not the case.  We have difficulties with a small number of ethnic restaurants whose staff mobility has given rise to concern, and one or two of those restaurants have been under investigation.  That is not the policy, nor has it been the practice for some considerable time. When decisions come to my attention where that view has been taken &mdash; I do not believe that is the case but there may be exceptional cases &mdash; the tendency is to approve the application for a work permit, and that will continue to be the practice.  In a society like ours, choice is important and it is good for our bigger cities to have a suitable number of different ethnic restaurants.  I probably spend too much time in some of them. I agree with the Deputy that a Chinese or Thai person is probably the most appropriate person to cook their native food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 55, 81 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a national minimum hourly wage is a key commitment in the programme for Government which I intend to implement.  The importance which the Government and I attach to this commitment is indicated by the fact that within weeks of coming into office we established the National Minimum Wage Commission to make recommendations on the issue.  The report of the commission, which was published last April, was an important stage in the process of achieving our objectives in this regard.  I welcomed the commission's recommendation for the introduction of a single national minimum hourly wage and the Government intends to introduce legislation to this effect within the timeframe recommended.</P>
      <P>In the context of the commission's report a number of complex issues were identified which require further analysis and study.  For that reason, the Government established an interdepartmental group of officials whose terms of reference are to assist in formulating proposals and a plan of action in respect of a national minimum wage and to report to the Government as early as possible.  The group commenced work in early April and has considered a broad range of issues. It has engaged independent consultants to undertake an expert analysis, as recommended by the commission, of the likely impact of the implementation of the national hourly minimum wage on employment, competitiveness and inflation, at both sectoral and national levels.</P>
      <P>As the study commissioned by the group will not be completed until March 1999, its final report will not be completed until May 1999. However, the group has recently submitted an interim report to me and it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to publish this.  It details the progress to date of the work of the group and identifies a range of issues related to the implementation of the national minimum wage.  It is my intention that the interim report will also serve as a basis for further consultation with the social partners on some of the specific issues pinpointed in the report.  I have already met with a broad spectrum of the social partners on the issue as part of the ongoing consultative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the work of the interdepartmental committee will not be completed until May next year, that time is fast running out if we are to introduce legislation for a national minimum <Col N="1425" /> wage by April 2000 and no such legislation is listed for this term, does the Minister accept that instead of setting up the original commission and delaying the matter as she is doing now she should have established the interdepartmental group in the first instance?  Will she give an assurance that, irrespective of the interdepartmental group recommendations, the Government is still committed to introducing a national minimum wage in April 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are committed to introducing a minimum wage in April 2000.  Work on the legislation has begun.  Initially it was felt we might not be able to do it through enabling legislation because what we would wish to do by way of secondary legislation would be outside the scope of such provisions.  However, I am now advised we can proceed with enabling legislation and the preliminary work was begun some time ago in the Department.  I hope that will be completed by the beginning of next year and the legislation can go ahead even if the final report is not to hand.</P>
      <P>Among the issues we have to examine is that of relativity &mdash; that was one of the concerns mentioned to me by the social partners.  ICTU has given a commitment that it will not seek a relativity impact in relation to the introduction of a national minimum wage.  There are also issues about how one defines remuneration, etc., which is why it was necessary to set up the interdepartmental group.  The first report has come to hand and it is good.  I hope to bring it to Government within the next two weeks and publish it as quickly as I can thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that all Departments and agencies under their aegis are currently offering wages at least at the level of the recommended minimum wage, given that the Government has accepted in principle that the minimum a person should be in receipt of is £4.40 per hour?  Does the Government intend to introduce tax allowances which would enable a single person in receipt of the minimum wage to be exempt from tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second matter, we must move in that direction.  It is ludicrous that a single person begins to pay tax at £78 per week and in that context people do not have a great incentive to take up employment.  To move the tax threshold from £78 per week to £176 per week will take time and we must make progress in that regard this year.</P>
      <P>I do not have statistics for how many people in the State sector are paid less than £4.40 per hour.  Many home helps do not receive that amount &mdash; I doubt they get that much in any of the health boards.  I am not certain if other State employees receive substantially less than that but I hope that by April 2000 everyone who works for the State will receive that much, because it has an obligation to pay the minimum wage which it advocates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> The commission said this minimum wage would add 4 per cent to the national wage bill, which was about £800 million at the time it produced its report.  Since then, wage rates have substantially increased for a number of reasons, such as shortages.  Among the issues being examined by the ESRI is the impact this will have on particular sectors or firms.  When it completes its analysis our data will be clearer and more up to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Department of Finance is anxious to push the introduction of the minimum wage as far into the future as possible?  Is the Minister not concerned that we are going back over the same ground covered by the commission?  Should she not simply introduce the minimum wage?  She has available to her the example of a detailed British Bill, which has been seen by everyone in the House. Given the undercurrents of dissent in her party, there is grave concern that this Government will not last until 2000 and that the Minister, at the behest of elements in ISME and the SFA, is kicking the issue to touch.  She will be out of office when another Government has to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are the first Government to deal with the problem.  If it was as simple as the Deputy sometimes makes it sound, his party's Government would have tackled it a long time ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a national wage agreement which does not run out until April 2000 and we cannot start introducing changes in the middle of that process.  I do not think anyone would suggest we should do so, and neither did the report. The model in Britain is different from what is proposed here &mdash; the rate is much lower and young people are excluded, so it is not as progressive or as well remunerated as the rate recommended in the commission's report.  The commission said we should examine the impact on employment and competitiveness and what happened in the UK, which is why the ESRI is doing its analysis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the minimum wage will be introduced by this Government. Many people would like to see me out of Government for various reasons &mdash; I can speculate on some of those &mdash; but I assure the Deputy this Government will be in power in April 2000 to implement the measure.  I appreciate the Opposition want to get into Government for other reasons, but I assure the Deputy that I do not give up easily.  He need not be concerned; I will still be here at that time so he can continue to ask me questions.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that one of the recommendations in the commission's report is that young people receiving training in a company should be eligible to receive 70 per cent, followed by 80 per cent and then 90 per cent, of the minimum wage during the period of training, what progress has been made in discussions the Minister has had with IBEC, the Small Firms' Association or the representative bodies of private companies with regard to structuring their training schemes and programmes and assisting companies to do that so that when the minimum wage is introduced, young people genuinely receiving training can be identified and that this will not be used as a way to pay people cheap wages?  Has the Minister made any progress on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues we discussed when I met IBEC and representatives from the Construction Industry Federation was the impact of this measure on training, existing rates, differentials and so on.  I agree with Deputy Owen that we must take a realistic view of training rather than the widest view.  Some people argue that a person is being trained from the day he or she begins their first job, even though that person has specific skills and can do the job, to avoid paying the £4.40 per hour minimum wage.  We have to finalise our view on these and other issues in the context of the proposed legislation.  Training means training, and if companies do not have appropriate inhouse training facilities and programmes, they will be unable to avail of the 70 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent for the three year period of training.  They will have to show, to some satisfaction, that there is a genuine training element involved in what they are doing.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister undertake a survey of the wage rates being paid by various Departments, including those paid to Dáil secretaries, and the rates being paid by the various agencies associated with Departments?  In particular, will she inquire into the heritage service, Dúchas, which advertised recently for staff at a rate less than the minimum wage?</P>

      <P>The minimum wage is not yet enshrined in legislation so there are no legal obligations in that respect.  I accept the State must give example, but this is not yet a legal requirement. If I can I will give the Deputy the type of data he requests; I hope the ESRI will produce that data.  The intention of its analysis to provide firm and sectoral data on how this will impact across the different sections.  The early indications from the Departments are that it will not adversely impact on them because they are paying rates either close to this rate or what will be approximate to it by April 2000.  Notwithstanding the fact that Dáil secretaries are not well paid, I do not believe any of them are paid less than £176 per week, which is what we are talking about.  I will get the data for the Deputy if I can, but I am <Col N="1428" /> sure he could obtain it himself by way of parliamentary question.</P>

      <P>I recognise there is no legal obligation on anybody to pay the minimum wage being recommended, but the Government wants to introduce this rate as a matter of principle, and I welcome that commitment.  For example, agencies and Departments offering jobs should, at the very least, offer that as a starting rate.  Will the Minister agree that, as a means of preparing for the implementation of the minimum wage, the Government and State agencies should at least know the rates they are paying to staff so that they can begin to gradually improve those rates if they are below the minimum rate?</P>

      <P>I cannot give that undertaking.  As I stated earlier, the national wage agreement does not run out until April 2000 and we cannot interfere in that process, whether it is in respect of public or private sector workers.  The feedback from the interdepartmental working group would indicate that the impact will be minimal.  Most State employees are paid in excess of £176 per week, or will be by April 2000.  An area on which it will have an impact is the home help service and provision will have to be made in due course to ensure home help workers get the minimum wage.</P>

    <P>In compliance with Standing Order 160 of the Standing Orders relevant to Public Business, I would like to announce that at the by-election held on 23 October 1998, consequent on the death of Deputy Hugh Coveney, the following Member has been elected to the Dáil:</P>
    <P>Dáilcheantar Chorcaí Theas-Lár</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>It is my privilege and pleasure, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to welcome our party's newest Member of the Oireachtas, Deputy Simon Coveney, on his first day in this House.  Simon is following in the footsteps of his late father, Hugh, who was a distinguished Minister, a much loved Member of this House and someone who is deeply missed by all of us.  Simon Coveney, as a candidate and now as a Deputy, has already displayed his capacity to play an equally constructive role in national life on behalf of his constituency and the people of Cork in general. Many people contributed to Simon's spectacular victory.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I say a special word of thanks to his family, who supported him in his decision to enter public life, to our director of elections, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, to Simon's constituency colleague, Deputy Deirdre Clune, to the members of Fine Gael and to everyone who voted for Simon Coveney, not merely those who gave him their first preference votes but also supporters of other parties who gave him later preferences.  Deputy Simon Coveney's share of first preferences &mdash; 37.7 per cent &mdash; put him 3,500 votes ahead of the Fianna Fáil candidate on the first count.  On the final count his lead had increased to 7,000, representing the largest ever winning margin by Fine Gael over its principal opponent in a by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the by-election in Cork South Central represents a third consecutive defeat for the Government.  One would have to question the pertinence of opinion polls in this context.  In Limerick earlier this year the combined electoral support of the parties which formed the Rainbow Coalition was 58.39 per cent as against a combined vote of 33 per cent for the two Government parties.  On the same day voters in Dublin North gave the Rainbow parties 43.6 per cent of the <Col N="1431" /> vote as against 32.8 per cent for the Government parties.  However, the electors of Cork South Central &mdash; there appears to be a progression here &mdash; gave the largest margin of victory to the Rainbow parties with 56.7 per cent of people voting in their favour as against 31.6 per cent voting in favour of the Government parties.  The results of these real polls tell their own story.</P>
    <P>I again welcome Simon Coveney to the House. I believe he will have a distinguished career here because, in making a difficult decision against a background of terrible family tragedy, he has shown that he has the character to carry him through the many greater challenges he will face in his future political life.  This is a day from which my party can take some pleasure.  However, some if not all Members of this House &mdash; regardless of their political affiliations or whether they campaigned vigorously in favour of other candidates during the by-election &mdash; will be pleased that there is justice in the fact that Simon is taking the seat to which his father, who was prevented from completing his term of office by his tragic death, was elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a day for partisan speeches so I will not engage in one.  I congratulate Deputy Simon Coveney on the excellent campaign he ran.  There is no argument that he won a comprehensive and outstanding victory for himself and his party.  I was glad to see that my relatives &mdash; 90 per cent of whom live in Minane Bridge and who usually support my party strongly &mdash; voted in favour of Deputy Coveney.  I hope they return to the fold in the next election but I have no doubt that Deputy Coveney's charm may persuade them to do otherwise.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Coveney well on this his first day not only in Dáil Éireann but also in public life.  Simon's entry into public life resulted from the tragic and untimely death of his father, an event which deprived politics of a true gentleman who we still miss.  However, I have no doubt that Deputy Coveney will be a great successor.  I have had the pleasure and honour to meet him inside and outside the political arena in the past and I know he is a hard working and diligent person. He has been drawn away from his preferred profession into this one and I must warn him that it is tough, sometimes very tough.  However, I wish him well.  Hugh Coveney was a great person and Simon's mother and the rest of his family are great people.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the people of Cork South Central decided to elect Simon Coveney as their representative in Dáil Éireann.  I take this opportunity to thank Sinead Behan, my party's standard-bearer, for her best efforts in the election. I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, Fine Gael director of elections, and the constituency organisation on a well won victory.  We have no argument with the arrival of another decent Coveney in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome Deputy Simon Coveney to this House.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend congratulations to the Fine Gael team led by director of elections, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in what was a vigorous but fair electoral contest in Cork South Central.  The Fine Gael victory would not have been possible without the extraordinary doubling of the vote of Labour's standard bearer, Toddy O'Sullivan.  Not for the first time in a by-election, he was able to ensure that Fine Gael would claim the prize on the floor of the House.  However, my party has undoubtedly claimed the prize in the constituency. We will return to ensure that, following the next general election, Toddy O'Sullivan will return once again to our ranks where he belongs.</P>
      <P>I salute the Fianna Fáil candidate in the by-election on the vigorous way she pursued her campaign.  It is good to see young people participating in politics.  I welcome the vigour with which the campaign was pursued and the fair and reasonable manner in which it was conducted.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Simon Coveney on his victory and I welcome him to the House.  It must have been extraordinarily difficult for him on a personal level to decide to stand in an election so soon after the tragic death of his father who, as other speakers stated, was highly respected in this House as a man of great integrity and a good public servant.  It is important that people like Simon Coveney, the Fianna Fáil candidate and the Labour Party candidate &mdash; who performed so well &mdash; are prepared to put themselves forward for election at a time when politics and politicians have come in for a great deal of criticism.  It is a sign of the inner strength of Simon Coveney that he made the decision to run at the time he did and the electorate gave their support to him as a result.  I congratulate him on his victory.</P>

      <P>I join the other party leaders in congratulating Simon Coveney. It is a fitting tribute to his father and his family, that he performed so well in the by-election. Members on all sides of the House hugely respected his father.  Simon is approximately the same age I was when I first entered the Seanad. At that stage, I believed that everyone of my current age was ancient.  I do not know if that is the way Deputy Coveney's thoughts are proceeding today.  I also thought I would change the world in a couple of weeks but, after 21 years, I must inform Simon that it takes a great deal longer to do so.</P>
      <P>Today is one for celebration.  There are not too many days on which politicians can celebrate. Approximately 95 per cent of our time is devoted to hard work and drudgery while the other five per cent is given over to glamour and celebration. I hope Simon has an opportunity to enjoy the day.  He is embarking on a challenging career and he has our support in that.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> I pay tribute to Peter Kelly who represented the Progressive Democrats in the by-election.  He is a young dynamic person who will have much to offer to politics in the future.  Everyone involved in the by-election campaign, including the Government parties, recognise that Simon Coveney was elected by popular choice which speaks volumes for the campaign he ran, for his family and for himself.  This must be a very proud moment for his mother, Pauline, who can share in his celebration.  We wish him every success.</P>

I was elected to represent Cork South-Central along with Simon's late father, Hugh Coveney, a man who was much admired and respected here.  Many people told Simon during the campaign that if he was half as good as his father, he was good enough for them.  Simon is every bit as good as his father and has proved during the campaign that he is a person of integrity. His energy, enthusiasm and commitment to public life will serve the House well and will serve us well in Cork South-Central.  He has been a tremendous candidate in his own right and will be a excellent Deputy for Cork South-Central.  I look forward to working with him in the constituency.</P>
      <P>We should all reflect on the tremendous privilege and honour &mdash; no matter what our party affiliations &mdash; in being elected to this House.  It is a wonderful honour and privilege and it is Deputy Simon Coveney's day today.</P>

My colleagues, Deputies Dennehy, Batt O'Keeffe, and I look forward to working with him.  If Cork politics has one thing <Col N="1434" /> to offer the rest of the country, it is the strong tradition, dating back almost to the foundation of the State whereby Cork politicians tend to work together, irrespective of party divisions, in the interests of Cork and the wider region.  The late Hugh Coveney was committed to that approach to politics and to the Cork region generally.  Having listened to all the speeches, some of which had a particularly strong political flavour, I wonder whether the Boundaries Commission should be asked to make Cork South-Central a seven seater constituency to accommodate all the ambitions and aspirations of those around the House.</P>

Like other party representatives I record my party's satisfaction with the opening showing of our candidate Henry Cremin in Cork South-Central.  I have no doubt we will be there to contest future local and national contests.  I wish Deputy Simon Coveney well in joining the Fine Gael team in the House and every success.  His father was a very fine person in every respect.  In the limited period I had the opportunity to get to know him, I found him to be all of that.</P>

      <P>I join the various speakers in welcoming Deputy Coveney to the House.  I have already wished him a long and happy future here. I take the point made by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, that we tend to work together in Cork.  I had the privilege of working for many years with Simon's father, the late Hugh Coveney, and I succeeded him as Lord Mayor of the city.  It was possible to work with Hugh Coveney at all times in the interests of our constituency, Cork generally and the country. Since the commencement of the campaign I have seen the same traits in Simon.  He has committed himself to the future of Cork.  He has said he wants to be his own man and I have no doubt he will be.  He has popular support which can be attributed to various factors in the constituency. As the Minister, Deputy Martin, said we may want to push out the boundaries to make the constituency larger.  There is room in Cork South-Central for good workers at all times.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see many of my constituents in the public gallery.  The number of candidates run by Fine Gael on the next occasion will determine whether I will be looking for third or fourth preferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned by the Tánaiste I too would like to remember Mrs. Pauline Coveney today.  She has been in this House previously.  What happened to Hugh Coveney was so tragic that most of us could not comprehend it at the time. However there is a general feeling of satisfaction <Col N="1435" /> at the election result.  That is not to say Fianna Fáil was not disappointed.  We worked hard, we did not win on the day but it is a memorable day for the Coveney family and should be remembered specifically for that.  Deputy Coveney will have a tough time here but he has proven in other areas and during the campaign that he is capable of being at the helm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At times I was perplexed as to which campaign we were involved in, given that Deputies in my area who were part of &ldquo;a save Batt O'Keeffe campaign&rdquo; said, &ldquo;if you vote for Simon Coveney, <Col N="1436" /> it is a vote for Batt O'Keeffe&rdquo;.  It was a well run campaign.  It appears as if Deputy Coveney's transfers on the next occasion will come to my party.  I wish him every success in the House.  He will be a fine Deputy and I look forward to working in close harmony with him &mdash; but not too harmoniously. I hope all of us together can work in the best interests of Cork South-Central.</P>

      <P>Given the controversy about the deportation of a Romanian family, would the Taoiseach consider it useful to hold a debate on the policy being pursued with regard to deportation of immigrants so that the House will understand the circumstances which led to this order being made, the grounds for it being found not to be adequate and the Minister having to reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of options open to Members to raise this issue.  I understand there are many cases in various stages of appeal. This case had gone through the entire system over a long period and the Minister has made the facts known.  However, it is open to Members to submit questions or raise the matter in other ways.</P>
      <P>In his statement yesterday the Minister said that while the circumstances in the case are not such as to distinguish it from a number of others by reference to a humanitarian dimension, he was aware of certain facts.  Some were mentioned by Deputy Currie, including the days that were lost between contacts.  The Minister has appointed a senior official in his Department to investigate these matters and report back to him.  In the interim he has decided that the enforcement of the deportation order be deferred and the official will look at the circumstances in which the order was made and the circumstances surrounding the attempt to implement it last Thursday.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: A few moments ago the Taoiseach said it was proposed to go ahead with the Refugee Act and that certain commencement orders had to be made.  Is it the Government's intention to go ahead with all sections of that Act?  The dispute concerning the commissioner appears farcical in view of the fact that some of the people who have been brought in by the Minister are former civil servants in their seventies. The age issue has been amply dealt with by the manner in which the recruitment was carried out.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House provides for the establishment, for the first time in the history of the State, of a statutory agency exclusively dedicated to the promotion and development of sport, in accordance with a key commitment in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The new agency will be known as the Irish Sports Council.</P>
      <P>Sport is an integral part of Irish society, with the ability to touch each and every one of us.  It adds to the quality of life of all those involved in it &mdash; participants, volunteers, spectators and supporters alike &mdash; and constitutes a most unique and vibrant part of our national culture.  The role of the new council will be to plan and support the future development of Irish sport in conjunction with the various sports organisations and thousands of volunteers who have been the lifeblood of sport in Ireland for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation has been one of the Government's priorities since coming into office, and it will prove both effective and durable.  Deputies will agree that it is crucially important that we get right the various core components of any legislation that breaks new ground <Col N="1446" /> in institutional development.  In this regard, I am satisfied this Bill represents the right beginning.</P>
    <P>Recently in this House, during the Second Stage debate on the Tourism Traffic Bill, Deputy Deasy reflected on my good fortune in being given responsibility for the Tourism, Sport and Recreation portfolio.  While there have been times when the job has not been all sweetness and light as suggested by the title, the Deputy is right in commenting on my good fortune.  I am doubly fortunate, not alone because of my great interest in the areas covered by the Ministry, but also because I am charged with responsibility for sport in a Government which is the first to really recognise the value of sport and its potential for contributing to an improved society.</P>
    <P>This Government's intent in relation to sport was signalled at an early stage with the creation of the first full Cabinet position with responsibility for sport in the history of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, copies of my script are on the way.  In the intervening period, this Government has brought a new drive and momentum to the development of Irish sport, of which this Bill constitutes the latest and perhaps the most important stage in this process.  For example, the 1998 allocation, at £26 million, represents almost double the previous year's allocation by the outgoing Government.  Furthermore, a number of long-standing schemes have been subjected to major review in terms of their effectiveness and their impact in relation to Government policy, particularly in areas of socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>As a result, the grant scheme for national governing bodies has been rationalised, simplified and redesigned specifically to facilitate more planning and greater strategy on the part of these bodies in developing and promoting their respective sports.  Meanwhile, a comprehensive review of the sports capital programmes is nearing completion, and I expect a new, more focused scheme to be in place for next year's round of allocations under that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new carding scheme for high-performance athletes has been introduced to replace the previous system of grants for elite athletes.  The new scheme is designed to assist the country's most talented sportspersons to realise their potential to perform successfully at the highest international levels.  In addition to providing financial support to meet necessary international competition and training expenses, the carding scheme will provide services ranging from sports science and medical support to career counselling.  In this way it is intended that Ireland's most talented international sports people, including junior and developing talent, will have access free of charge to a holistic support system geared to helping <Col N="1447" /> them realise their full potential and to perform successfully at the highest international level.</P>
    <P>In line with another of its commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government has asked that a tender procedure for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool be initiated.  This tender competition has attracted considerable interest from both the private and public sectors, and nine qualified candidates have been issued with a comprehensive and detailed project brief.  I hope that realistic and worthwhile proposals will now come forward by 27 November, the deadline for tender submissions, and that it will be possible to identify a successful tender early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government also signalled our interest in pursuing a joint venture route with interested commercial and sporting organisations for the provision of national and regional sports facilities.  A steering committee has now been set up to oversee the undertaking of a feasibility study on the development of a world-class stadium for the new century.  The committee, which includes representatives of the main sporting bodies, welcomes the input of all interested sporting bodies as it is our intention that any development will be adaptable to as many uses as possible.</P>
    <P>Sport plays a unique role in the lives of our people.  This is manifest everywhere with thousands of people involved every day in playing, coaching and administering the demanding and often complex area of sport.  The contribution of the voluntary worker has been the backbone of Irish sport for generations, and it is vital that this special element of our sport be nurtured, developed and supported.</P>
    <P>Beyond the intrinsic value of participation &mdash; sport for sport's sake &mdash; sport is also a key element in the social and economic life of the country.  Active participation in competitive or recreational sport contributes enormously to the physical and mental well-being of the individual and, by extension, of the community and nation. Success at national and international competitions creates a sense of pride, excites interest and raises morale.  Involvement in sport creates a sense of unity and identity for communities, towns and villages in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>The achievements of our top competitors and the hard work, commitment and dedication behind their success all serve to inspire, encourage and raise our spirits.  Young people especially need role models and heroes to inspire and encourage them.  Sport can play a preventative role in the fight against crime and drug use, especially among young people.  Active involvement in sport can help foster a sense of confidence and self-esteem and counteract the problems of isolation and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Sport also makes a significant contribution to our economy.  It is estimated that direct employment in sports activities and in sports related <Col N="1448" /> activities, such as travel, catering, tourism and the media, accounts for over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs in Ireland.  Last year more than 900,000 foreign tourists took part in sports activities during their stay in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As we approach the millennium, we are witnessing dramatic changes in all aspects of our society.  Sport is no exception to this process of change.  It is now, more than ever, a truly global phenomenon.  Increasing commercial and commodifying influences through sponsorships, marketing and merchandising mean sport is now big business.  It is also arguably one of the most powerful presences in broadcasting, with much of our consumption of sport being mediated through such channels.  Equally, sport is a social activity which has immense cultural significance and tells us much about the dynamics of social change in our society.</P>
    <P>The inevitable consequences of all this change is that the challenges facing sport are now greater than ever before.  As Minister with responsibility for sport, my aim is to ensure that Irish sport, its organisations and structures, are all strengthened, and supported in their efforts to meet these challenges square on.  I see the Bill and the establishment of the sports council as major stepping stones in this process.  One of the most significant challenges facing sport is its need to recreate the traditional spirit and values which were once its hallmark.  For many people, these have been replaced by cynicism, gamesmanship and commercial excess where winning at all costs is the order of the day.  The increased incidence of drug abuse in sport on a global scale is one of the most significant manifestations of this sorry development. It would be naive to expect that Irish sport could somehow escape the scourge of drug abuse and recent events have only served to underline the need to have it addressed in a systematic and structured way.</P>
    <P>In June I launched Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme.  This major initiative underlines the Government's commitment to creating a sporting environment which fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means, and to ratification of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which Ireland signed in June 1992.  Details of the programme have been circulated to all governing bodies of sport concerned and discussions are now under way with them on the operational aspects.  The programme will incorporate testing, education and research.  It will be voluntary but public funding will be withheld from any national governing body or individual athlete opting out of participation in the programme or if those participating breach any element of the rules governing its operation.  The new system of dope testing is targeted for nationwide application as soon as the new statutory council is up and running.</P>
    <P>The initiative is well timed given recent controversies about drug taking.  As soon as the programme is operational, I will request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to initiate the procedures <Col N="1449" /> required to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989.  The Bill further emphasises the Government's resolve in dealing with this issue by specifically providing the council with the function, powers and structure to participate actively and constructively in the battle against doping in sport.  The Olympic movement also has a major role to play in the area of the fight against drugs.  Accordingly, I was delighted to accept an invitation from the Olympic Council of Ireland to open its major and timely conference, Sport Against Drugs, to be held in Dublin this weekend on 6 and 7 November 1998.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the sports council to support and assist sport right across the spectrum.  It will also benefit the outstanding sportspersons and teams who must be given every opportunity to develop and reach their potential.  The Bill will assist the ordinary person who wants to take part in sport for recreation and enjoyment, regardless of age, sex or ability.  It will do this by providing for specific functions which have as their main aims the promotion of excellence in competitive sport and the encouragment of greater participation in sport.  These aims are interlocked and should be seen as a cohesive force for the council.  The more people who participate the greater the chance of excellence emerging.  The better the achievements of our top sportspeople, the greater the number who will be inspired to emulate them.</P>
    <P>A sports council has existed in various forms since 1971 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, essentially to act as an advisory body to the Minister and the Government on matters relating to sport.  The current non-statutory Irish Sports Council was established in June 1996 with a twofold role, to advise the Minister on all aspects of sport and to co-ordinate the resources and energies of the sports movement.  It would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the excellent work of the council and its chairperson, John Treacy, in carrying out this role.  John Treacy is an internationally respected figure in the world of sport and he has my total support and trust.</P>
    <P>The council has been working over the past year with the national governing bodies of sport to help them strengthen their capacity to deliver effectively across the spectrum of their activities. The council has consulted closely with those bodies to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and to place an emphasis on the need for strategic planning, achieving value for money and the introduction of measurement criteria.  To facilitate this work my Department has designed a new simplified but comprehensive grant application and assessment system for sports bodies, which took effect from the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>In the area of children and school sport, the sports council has been continuing its work with the Department of Education and Science in developing initiatives to enhance physical education and sport in schools.  As a contribution to that Department's piloting of a new physical education <Col N="1450" /> curriculum in selected schools throughout the country, the council, with the National Coaching and Training Centre, is devising specialist training for parents, teachers and club coaches to enable them to work with children in expanding and enhancing the scope and quality of physical education and sport in the selected schools.  This training will facilitate synergy between schools and the resources and expertise available to them in clubs and sport organisations in the community.</P>
    <P>A special cross-Border pilot project entitled Youth Sport Foyle has been under way for the past 12 months involving schools in Donegal and Derry.  The aim of the project is to devise ways of introducing school children to a wide range of new sports activities through the creation of links and programmes involving schools, teachers, parents and coaches working together in the community. The project is funded under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The provisions of the Bill will provide a new and more coherent framework within which work such as this and other initiatives can be progressed and developed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will place the concept of a dedicated sports council on a statutory footing for the first time.  It will also provide for a major broadening of its role, beyond that of advising, to encompass executive functions, including a number currently carried out by my Department.  Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, are standard provisions, setting out the Short Title, the interpretation of key concepts, and providing for appointment, by ministerial order, of a day on which the council shall be established.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is one of the more important sections and sets out the functions of the council as follows: to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence therein; to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and for co-ordinating their implementation; to facilitate standards of good conduct and fair play in competitive sport through the promulgation of guidelines and codes of practice; to take appropriate action to combat doping in sport; to initiate and encourage research on sport; and, where appropriate, facilitate research and disseminate information on sport.  This section also provides that the Minister may confer, essentially to take account of future policy developments, additional functions on the council by order laid before each House of the Oireachtas, subject to such order not being annulled by resolution of the Houses within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 10, inclusive, set out broad parameters within which the council may pursue delivery of its statutory functions, giving it a range of powers to assist it in this task.  Section 7 empowers the council to co-operate with, advise and provide assistance, including financial assistance, for persons or groups on matters relating to its functions.  It may enter into contracts, including sponsorship agreements, accept gifts and <Col N="1451" /> engage consultants and advisers subject to certain conditions; and may charge for services rendered by it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires the council to establish criteria, terms and conditions, which may differ for different classes of applicants and recipients, for any assistance it provides under section 7 for persons or groups.  This section also enables the council to refuse or withhold such assistance and-or demand a refund of financial assistance, if it considers the established criteria, terms and conditions have not been met, or if information requested is not forthcoming.  Those terms and conditions will include participation by national governing bodies and individual athletes in the national sports anti-doping programme.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 require the council in performing its functions to have regard to Government policy and comply with general policy directives from me and to respond to any requests from me for advice on any matter relating to its functions or for information regarding the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 19, inclusive, set out the basic provisions which will govern the actual operation and running of the council.  These sections also provide for the composition and appointment of the council, the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified or removed from membership of the council or a committee of the council, procedures for the holding of council meetings and for the filling of casual vacancies arising on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment by the Minister of a council consisting of a chairperson and eight ordinary members for a period of office not exceeding five years, and that such persons may not serve more than two consecutive terms. I have specifically set out to address the gender balance issue by providing that not fewer than three members of the council shall be women and not fewer than three shall be men.  I shall also ensure that all members of the council have expertise relevant to the functions of the council.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the council's power to appoint a chief executive while section 18 deals with the establishment and dissolution of committees, including a requirement to establish one dealing with anti-doping in sport, the chair of which will be a medically qualified person, to be appointed directly by the Minister.  Sections 20 and 21 set out the arrangements for dealing with the disclosure of interests and the unauthorised disclosure of information by council, committee or staff members, consultants or advisers.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 deal with staffing and related matters.  The sections provide for the council to employ its own staff subject to certain conditions, including those conditions which will apply to civil servants who may transfer on establishment day to the council, and arrangements for the introduction of staff superannuation schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a standard provision applying to agencies generally and provides that members of <Col N="1452" /> Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the European Parliament will be disqualified from retaining membership of the council or of a committee of the council or, in the case of council staff, shall stand seconded from employment by the council.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 set out the arrangements for the council to periodically report to the Minister and the Oireachtas on its activities, plans and expenditure.  Under these sections the council is specifically required to submit for the Minister's approval and presentation to the Oireachtas three year strategy statements comprising its key objectives, outputs and related strategies for the following three year period and a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of all programmes operated by the council.  The council will also be required to submit to the Minister for presentation to the Oireachtas annual reports of its activities, including a progress report on the implementation of the strategy statement, and to keep specified accounts which are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 provide for transitional arrangements regarding legal proceedings relating to a function of the council which may be pending at establishment day and any rights and liabilities relating to such functions as at that date.</P>
    <P>The new council will constitute the lynchpin of the Government's policy of securing a more focused strategic approach to the future development of sport in Ireland.  The last 12 months or so have marked one of the single most highly concentrated periods of development in the framework for delivery of support to Irish sport and to the organisations which have nurtured and guided its progress over the decades.  I have no doubt that this legislation will maintain that momentum and constitute another important step in the evolution of Irish sport.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the belated publication of the Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, in the second last month of the year.  Early this year I published a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, the National Sports Council of Ireland Bill, 1998.  At the time the Minister of State, obviously with the consent of the Minister, Dr. McDaid, described the Bill as lacking balance.  On examining the Bill before us today I find little difference between it and my Bill except on a few vital points, the most important being funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, in February 1997 I published a major report on sport entitled Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, that is sport in Ireland from 1997 to 2000 and beyond.  This report, prepared by an expert group appointed by me, was the culmination of a detailed consultation process with the Irish sport sector and all relevant agencies and organisations.  An Irish Sports Council has existed as an advisory body in one form or another since the 1970s.  One of the key recommendations <Col N="1453" /> of the report was the setting up of an independent statutory council.  It recommended that legislation be prepared to set up the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis for the first time ever thus taking it from the role of a purely advisory committee to one with executive functions including many functions currently carried out by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in broad principle but I am still concerned that the Minister who is now almost a year and a half in office has not yet introduced a drug testing and education programme for sport in Ireland, has failed to produce the report on the review of outdoor leisure facilities, has effectively scrapped the capital development programme and has yet to publish the report of the review group set up to examine that programme, which was intended to develop facilities in Ireland at local, regional and national level. We have heard many statements of intent from the Minister but there has been no implementation.</P>
    <P>I had the honour and pleasure of working as Minister with responsibility for sport from December 1994 until June 1997.  Unlike the Minister, on taking office I discovered that there was no overall plan for sport in Ireland and I realised that sport was not attracting adequate Exchequer or national lottery funding.  I also quickly realised that Cospóir, the advisory sports council, whose term of office was about to expire, did not have adequate powers or structures to develop sport and recreation.  Decisions were made to develop a national plan for sport in Ireland in order to ensure, first, that funding for sport would be utilised to its optimum value and that in the presence of a plan there would be adequate funding from the Exchequer and the national lottery, second, that there would be a formal plan to provide attractive opportunities to participate in sport and third, that the avenues open to our sports people to develop their talents to their full capacity would be enhanced.</P>
    <P>John Treacy, the Irish Olympic medallist was appointed by me to compile this plan and after wide consultation involving public meetings throughout the country and the acceptance of more than 400 detailed submissions from organisations the national plan was finalised and published in February 1997.  About the same time a new and much more streamlined Irish Sports Council was appointed with clear short-term and long-term functions.  The establishment of the new statutory sports council was the key recommendation of the national plan for sport and the mandate of the new statutory sports council can be summarised as the promotion, co-ordination and development of sport in Ireland and it will play a lead role in this regard.  The six main strands of the work of the new council were set out in that plan.  These were: to deal with sport for young people, sport for all or recreational sport, high performance sport, sports facilities and natural resources, sports training and development and the co-ordination of sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> The Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, published earlier this year, proposed that the new statutory sports council should prepare and review periodically a national programme of action; exercise a national programme to ensure the implementation of the national programme; control and administer the spending of all national lottery funds allocated to sport and related activities &mdash; I see no such provision in the Minister's Bill; prepare in every financial year a statement based as far as possible on the national programme, including the requirements and proposals of every institution in receipt of money from the State; submit a statement together with the council's observations and recommendations to the Minister for further submission after consultation with the Minister for Finance; publish details of the financial allocations finally approved as a sports budget for the year in question together with a report on the current status of a national policy for sport and the implementation of national programmes, and those to be laid by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas; advise on proposals for the provision of new facilities or the improvement of existing facilities and report on the function and value of sport.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the Fine Gael Bill published this year are very close to those set out in the Government's Bill with a number of major differences.  The Minister has failed to hand over responsibility for the distribution of national lottery funding to the new sports council.  This is a major defect in the Bill and I ask the Minister to address this issue in his response to this debate. There has been much public comment on the method of distribution of national lottery funding. While I am certain that on most occasions funding is allocated on the basis of the need of the applicant as well as local effort, a suspicion exists among the public that political considerations often come into play.</P>
    <P>Sport plays an important part in the lives of people and we can judge the extent of this by the percentage of space given to sport in the media. Despite the central role that sport plays in Irish life, with the exception of top level sport, it has not yet managed to attract the necessary financial resources to cater adequately for the needs of people who are involved in a wide range of sporting activities, including organised competitive sport, recreational sport and active leisure pursuits within the &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; concept.</P>
    <P>Society now accepts the value of participation in sport and active leisure pursuits and the physical, psychological and social development of individuals. Our people have become increasingly concerned about issues that affect health and well being and are more aware than ever of the value and pleasure of physical exercise and sport. However, this is not always accompanied by a readiness to take part in any form of regular exercise. There is a need to translate this awareness into regular participation.  Involvement in sport is essential to achieve a balanced lifestyle because <Col N="1455" /> it is necessary for healthy living, enjoyment and socialisation.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out in recent years demonstrated that sport has a major economic impact on society because it promotes increased activity not only through the manufacture and supply of equipment, but through the service industry.  It is also a major asset in attracting foreign tourists to our shores.  It increases morale at home when Irish athletes excel on the world stage.</P>
    <P>There is great pressure on our young people at present, particularly from drug pushers and criminals. It is important, therefore, that sport and youth services provide positive alternative sources of entertainment and activity.  Sport and youth services are the greatest preventative elements in the fight against crime and drugs.  I am convinced that a modest investment in sport, recreation and young people's activities will help to avoid the need for greater investment in prisons and health services to deal with the problems which can arise if young people are not attracted into positive activities.</P>
    <P>The main aims of any sports policy must be to facilitate individuals and groups to participate in physical recreational sporting activities and to offer appropriate opportunities for every person, regardless of age, sex or ability, to continue the practice of sport and physical recreation throughout their lives.  The basic aim of any sports policy and council should be to ensure that people with an interest and ability in sport have a chance to improve their standards of performance and to make it a career.</P>
    <P>Voluntarism is strong in society and one can see the depth of voluntary activity in the sporting area.  Priority must be given to sport at the grassroots in any future development.  The work of the new statutory sports council must not be dominated by the needs of our top sportsmen and sportswomen, but must be the catalyst which promotes greater voluntary activity so that the benefits of sporting activity can be seen in the enhancement of our health and well being and in a reduction in the levels of illness and disease and in the incidence of crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>A spirit of co-operation between all the people on this island can also be achieved through sport. Sport can be an even greater significant source of tourism earnings.  Studies have shown that at least one third of visitors to Ireland take part in some sports related activity during their stay and that the availability of sports facilities is a major factor when deciding to holiday here.</P>
    <P>Sport is also an important source of employment and has major potential for expansion.  The economic impact study published in 1994-5 showed that sports related activities generated in excess of 11,000 full time and 8,000 part time equivalent jobs.  In addition, the inclusion of sports spending on media, travelling and tourism raised the figure to 18,000 full time equivalent jobs.  We must also include the accompanying <Col N="1456" /> benefits to the State of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and other taxes.</P>
    <P>The national plan for sport, which was published by the rainbow coalition in February 1997, proposed the setting up of a statutory sports council.  That Government set aside £1.6 million per annum to allow the sports council to develop its activities and to cover the cost of developing a technical sports team within the sports council which would launch and develop its work.  The Minister was lucky that the national plan for sport defined the carding system to which he referred and recommended the technical support teams he now has to support policy making, drug testing and the work of the council.  This work was put in place through the recommendations of the national plan for sport.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the plan was to attract the necessary Exchequer and lottery funding. The absence of a national plan for sport meant that sport was neglected financially.  Any Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation was like a man looking for finance from a bank without a business plan.  You inherited a plan and structures when you came into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was lucky.</P>
      <P>All parties agree that with the publication of the national plan for sport in February 1997 greater political efforts should be made to develop sport and leisure and that there should be greater co-ordination and centralisation of planning within Government as many activities in the sport and leisure sector are scattered across Departments.  I hope this co-ordination happens sooner rather than later because the situation is ridiculous.  For example, greyhound racing and horse racing are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Health and Children is responsible for promoting sport in its health promotion campaign, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is responsible for attracting major sporting events to this country, the Department of Education and Science is responsible for the development and maintenance of outdoor activity centres and for the development of sport in our schools, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for certain aspects of sport and the Department of Defence is responsible for the equestrian school.  I hope the Minister and the sports council co-ordinate these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must develop a greater level of participation in sport and leisure among all our children <Col N="1457" /> and ensure a proper introduction to sport and recreation is given to children at the earliest possible stage in the education system.  If young children develop an interest in sport and recreation at an early stage in school, they will continue to participate throughout their lives.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for Education and Science have not made a decision about the role of sport in our education system, starting at primary level, despite being in Government for one and a half years.  There are no officially designated physical education sessions at primary school level.  I have been waiting for months for the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to make an announcement or a decision on one of the key principles of the national plan for sport, the development of sport in our primary schools.  Apart from statements of intent, no solid political decisions of any consequence have been made.  The Department of Education and Science should insist that the minimum specific time period per week for sport is adhered to in all primary schools.  At present, departmental regulations require that each primary school designate one half hour per week to physical education.  In how many schools does this happen?</P>
    <P>At a time when the Minister for Education and Science seems to have an endless source of funding, he should have announced by now the appointment of physical education teachers in primary schools, especially in those which are seriously disadvantaged.  The Minister could introduce a flexible system whereby physical education teachers could be appointed and shared among a number of primary schools in a particular area or they could be shared between primary and secondary schools which already have physical education teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister scrapped the capital recreation scheme and announced he would launch a new scheme later in the year.  We have heard nothing about this scheme, except the passing reference to it which he made today.  I hope the Minister, before arriving at decisions and making announcements, takes into account the exercise initiated by the last Government who asked for quantitative and qualitative analyses to be done on facilities, as a lack of facilities is a serious problem for many schools.</P>
    <P>There should be a scheme to enable sport halls which are open for a few hours from Monday to Friday and closed for the weekends to be made available to the community.  Community based facilities should also be made available to schools. A capital programme with imagination would deal with the problem over a period of years. Only a sports council with the necessary resources, powers and staff can drive a programme such as this, in conjunction with both the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> There are about 800 to 900 physical education teachers in secondary schools, with 50 per cent of all schools having a physical education teacher. There is an obvious and urgent need for increased funding for more designated physical education teachers.  Every school should have access to a physical education teacher.  Recreation, physical education and sport are not current leaving certificate subjects.  Steps should be taken to make them part of the leaving certificate curriculum as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I expressed concern about the large number of school sports facilities which remain closed and unused in the evenings and at weekends.  There are often problems which are barriers to the use of these facilities.  However, insurance problems are often used as an excuse to keep these facilities closed to the surrounding communities.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the quantitative and qualitative analyses being done on sports facilities, I was amazed the report of the committee was preempted by the Taoiseach's recent announcement as regards the national stadium feasibility group. This announcement was a personal ego trip in the absence of a stated national policy regarding facilities at local, regional and national level, especially in the context of a substantial financial commitment to a second stadium some months ago.  Surely a country of three million people has the imagination, goodwill and commitment to provide one ultra-modern, multi-functional stadium which could be used on a sufficient number of occasions to make it economically viable.  The Taoiseach's announcement was made with little consultation with the major sporting organisations who must be involved.  His decision has caused severe disruption to their plans.  Surely sport is about teamwork and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs a strong, independent sports council to deal with the problems which confront our athletes who wish to compete at the highest national and international level and to deal with athletes who have disabilities and need to develop their special skills and abilities.  I welcome the introduction of the proposals set out by the previous Government as regards the carding system.</P>
    <P>We also need a strong sports council to deal with the developing role of the National Coaching and Training Centre in the University of Limerick, a facility which is a vital cog in the development of sport in Ireland.  We need an independent statutory sports council to deal with the issue of national, regional and local capital projects and in that context, the 50 metre pool and the national stadium.</P>
    <P>We need a strong sports council to deal with the different Government Departments and local authorities who are involved in the spatial development of our cities and towns.  A strong sports council must be a catalyst to bring about a total review of the planning and development of lands.  Past mistakes must not be repeated.  Future major developments in our towns and cities must <Col N="1459" /> ensure the provision of adequate sport and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>If necessary, the planning Acts and regulations must be changed to give the planning authorities powers to impose conditions which will ensure the provision of sporting and recreational facilities in new developments and towns.  We must also have powers to ensure that private developers contribute towards the provision of these facilities.  Too often we see the token gesture of an open space which becomes more of a nuisance than an asset in housing estates.</P>
    <P>I said sport must attract greater State investment in the development of facilities.  However, investment from the private sector must also be forthcoming.  In this context, I hope the new council will examine how significant incentives can be put in place to attract private investment. The new sports council must ensure the Government provides greater incentives for private investors to invest in or donate funds to projects approved by the council.  These incentives should include tax relief and allowances similar to the urban renewal and Temple Bar schemes.</P>
    <P>Contributions to approved schemes by private investors should be offset for tax purposes.  The use of covenants for sports and recreation projects should also be considered.  However, as regards qualification for schemes, the sports council should be the certifying authority and it should work with the Revenue Commissioners. Any of the projects developed should be in line with sports policy as enunciated by the council, in order to ensure proper use of the scheme.  The National Sports Council provides the structures which will allow all of these provisions to be made sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>This Bill is similar to the one published by Fine Gael earlier this year and both emanated from the same document, the National Plan for Sport, 1997.  However, one of the key issues not addressed in this Bill is the allocation of capital grants to sporting projects through the national lottery which should be taken out of the political arena.  All previous Governments have acted in good faith in the allocation of national lottery funding for sporting organisations.  However, the public perception is that funding for projects is awarded on the basis of political connections rather than merit.</P>
    <P>The new sports council should have the responsibility of deciding how these funds are spent.  The target of 25 per cent of total national lottery funds expenditure on sport should be achieved as quickly as possible.  This figure was recommended in the National Plan for Sport as the minimum public funding required for the proper development of sport.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with a number of issues.  First, I am concerned about &ldquo;drug taking in sport&rdquo; allegations.  Will the Minister clarify how advanced is the Department's drug testing programme, if it will really be introduced next January and if he has the resources and expertise <Col N="1460" /> available to him to commence drug testing at the start of 1999?  I am concerned that it will take until then to commence this programme as the previous Administration on leaving office had asked an expert group to report to the Minister and discussions had taken place with the Northern Ireland Sports Council to avail of their expertise and technology to collect samples.  The Chelsea Olympic Accredited Laboratories were identified as the most suitable analytical laboratories for the testing of the samples taken.</P>
    <P>My party published its drug testing and education programme in early 1998.  I cannot understand why the Minister and his Department, with an army of civil servants and a group of experts cannot manage to implement a programme until next year.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the good name of Irish sport is once again dragged through the mud by the most recent allegations concerning the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs.  Our sportsmen and sportswomen are vulnerable because of the Government's and the Minister's failure to introduce a national drugs testing programme with all due haste.  When Fine Gael published its drug testing programme earlier this year, the Minister indicated drug testing would be introduced shortly, but little has happened since then other than that statements of intent have been issued.  Our athletes still remain vulnerable to allegations because of this vacuum.</P>
    <P>The reported use of creatine to enhance performance in schools competitions is disgraceful. I ask the Minister to join with the Minister for Education and Science to issue a directive to all schools indicating that the use of creatine, although it is a naturally occurring substance, is wrong because it introduces young athletes to the world of performance enhancing substances.  Any school found to be encouraging the use of creatine should be disciplined.</P>
    <P>Using performance enhancing drugs is cheating. Along with a drug testing programme, the Government should consider introducing penalties for the possession and manufacturing of, and trafficking in, sports drugs, and these should match the penalties applied to narcotics.  An athlete who has tested positive for anabolic steroids should face criminal proceedings.  If the EU is serious about this issue, it should consider classifying performance enhancing drugs in the same way as illegal narcotics and amphetamines.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the reported statement by Dr. Joe Comiskey of the Olympic Council of Ireland that 50 per cent of top Irish athletes have taken performance enhancing drugs.  If this statement has been properly reported it is highly irresponsible and has tainted the names of thousands of past and present Irish athletes.  Along with my colleagues in the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I have invited Dr. Comiskey to produce evidence to support his statement.  If he cannot substantiate his allegation he should apologise to the Irish sports world. <Col N="1461" /> What arrangements are in place to ensure Ireland is adequately prepared for the Sydney Olympics?  What discussions have taken place between the OCI, the Irish Sports Council and him to ensure that our athletes receive the best possible preparation and training?  I hope our athletes are no longer the &ldquo;ham in the sandwich&rdquo; or the hostages in power struggles between sporting bodies, or between the OCI and the Government of the day.  Too often in the past they have been used as pawns.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Irish Sports Council are considering applications from organisations who wish to have their activities recognised for funding purposes.  The Contract Bridge Association of Ireland has thousands of members and provides a positive recreational activity for young and old alike.  Will the Minister consider this and similar organisations in their quest for recognition?</P>
    <P>In June 1997 I established a task force to examine the impediments facing Irish women in sport. What is the Minister doing to tackle the serious economic, social and psychological barriers facing women who wish to participate in sport?  There have been major improvements in media coverage of women's sport but it is important that both the media and the commercial sector continue to support it at participatory and competition level. Also, what has happened to the outdoor activities centres report, commissioned in 1996?</P>
    <P>Sport has more capacity than any other activity to unify this country.  I therefore ask the Minister, when appointing the Irish Sports Council, to follow the precedent of appointing a member of the Northern Ireland Sports Council, so that we can have a unified approach within the island to the development of facilities and structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for making themselves available to members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation to explain the background and purposes of this Bill.  We appreciate the facility which was offered and accepted.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is the second time this year the Dáil has had the opportunity to discuss legislation on the Irish Sports Council.  Last April, during the debate on Deputy Allen's Private Members' Bill, many Deputies took the opportunity to speak on the future direction of sport and the role a statutory sports council should play in that.  It was a useful and timely debate and I commend Deputy Allen on the work he put into his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days I re-read the contributions made to that debate, and noted that many Deputies congratulated Ms Catherina McKiernan on winning the London Marathon.  It seems that her winning ways have again coincided with a major debate on sports policy.  I again extend my warmest congratulations to her on her excellent win in the Amsterdam Marathon.  She was extremely close to a world record time, and given her dedication and continued participation in marathon <Col N="1462" /> running, no doubt the record will be hers in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to put the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis.  This is a progressive and important policy development, supported by all parties in the House.  The genesis of the Bill was in the work done on the development of a coherent and effective sports policy by the previous Government, as outlined by Deputy Allen.  This resulted in the production of a national plan for sport, a key element of which was the establishment of a new statutory sports council.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation, which the Minister has promised since taking office.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister in paying tribute to the work done in recent years by Mr. John Treacy.  He was central to the production of the national plan for sport, which involved the widest consultation at public meetings throughout the country, and more than 400 submissions from various clubs, organisations and individuals, which he received and considered.  From this process he produced one of the most important documents in the history of Irish sport, the national plan, which has driven Irish sports policy over the past 18 months and will continue to do so into the future.  His dedication to our sports policy has continued since the production of the national plan.  He has chaired the Irish Sports Council in a progressive and forward looking way.  His experience and commitment have been of tremendous benefit to Members of this House and in particular to the members of the Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  As chairperson of that committee, I want to record our appreciation of the assistance given to us over recent months by John Treacy.  In particular, he was extremely co-operative when the committee dealt with the appalling abuses perpetrated by Derry O'Rourke. At my instigation, the committee began a root and branch review of the voluntary codes of ethics and conduct operating in sports clubs throughout the country.  John's support and assistance throughout this process was critical to the important work the committee undertook.  All Members of the House will agree that important lessons must be learned from investigations carried out by the committee, to which a rapporteur has been appointed.  A report will be forthcoming to the committee which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with some of the content of the Bill produced by the Minister.  The Government has been in office for almost 18 months.  It had the National Plan for Sport and the Opposition's Private Members' Bill available to it on which it could have drawn for the production of this legislation.  Despite this wealth of information, however, the Government has produced a lacklustre Bill designed to do little else but confer statutory footing on the existing Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>This is not imaginative legislation.  It does not provide a dynamic vehicle for the advancement of sport.  At best it is the work of a Government <Col N="1463" /> going through the motions of placing a body on a statutory basis.  There is no philosophy or vision behind the legislation.  It simply fulfils the commitment in the programme for Government.  In short, the Bill represents a missed opportunity.  I accept it is enabling legislation and it is hoped that the new council to be set up under it will use every means to develop some of the areas about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the reason we want to place the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis.  In terms of the practical, day to day administration and funding of sport in this country, it is obvious that the clout of the sports sector will be strengthened when the Irish Sports Council is placed on a statutory footing.  That is important and the Bill will go some way towards achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>Beyond the immediate issues of funding and administration, referred to by Deputy Allen, there is another key element to the process of placing bodies on a statutory basis.  The new statutory body must be charged with addressing issues that form part of a broader social policy platform.  In transforming a body from an <i>ad hoc</i> group, there should be a qualitative change in the role and philosophy of that organisation.  The Bill fails to achieve such a change and it is fundamentally weakened as a result.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council has achieved a great deal for sport in Ireland.  It is a fine body and has performed well in what has been, at times, a turbulent period in Irish sport.  The new body created by this legislation must do much more than continue the excellent work of the Irish Sports Council.  I am aware that members of the sports council envisage that the new body will go much further than the advisory role they are permitted under the existing terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The new body created by this legislation must have a duty to progress social policy aims throughout sport in Ireland.  In this context the functions of the new sports council, as outlined in section 6, should include a more detailed list of functions.  For example, it is an aim of social policy that people with a disability are fully involved in sport and sports organisations.  Is that a particular aim of the Bill?  I realise it is not specifically addressed in the Bill but perhaps the Minister, when replying, will confirm that people with disabilities will be considered because their participation in sport is extremely important, as we know from our experience of the Special Olympics and other sporting events in this country.</P>
    <P>Why does the Government not specifically charge the new body established by law with promoting and progressing this goal?  That would be an important statement of Government policy in the Bill.  Perhaps such a statement is not necessary but people who have a disability need to have their case reaffirmed because in the society in which we now live it is difficult for them to achieve the level of participation many of us would like to see.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> Is it an aim of social policy that disadvantaged areas should be provided with the facilities and resources necessary to encourage sport and community activity?  The Minister stated that he is concerned about disadvantaged areas in the community in which sport could make a major contribution in addressing some of the social evils.  If that is the case, why is this new body not charged with charting a future for sport in Ireland and given a specific progress requirement in regard to these areas?  From the point of view of the Labour Party, the failure to invest the new sports council with this social philosophy is a major weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, to the Private Members' debate on this topic last April.  I appreciate the concern expressed by him at that time that legislation on the sports council would tie up the council in bureaucratic knots.  I agree with those comments but I do not agree with the production of stripped down, value free legislation that makes no effort to integrate sports policy into the wider social issues facing our communities.</P>
    <P>There are key areas of community life where sport is best placed to facilitate social progress. That this legislation consciously ignores this fact is a major failing and one I hope the Minister will reconsider when replying to the debate and on Committee Stage, which will be taken by the Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  Beyond this core point there are other aspects of the Bill which can be improved and I will briefly allude to some of those.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the reason this legislation draws a distinction between competitive sport and recreational sport.  I understand from advice this morning that this is in line with Council of Europe recommendations but it had not appeared in that form in Deputy Allen's Bill. By specifically referring to them, the ordinary recreational sports will not get lost.  I would like the message to get across to the new sports council that recreational sport is extremely important to the welfare of those who participate in sport in a non-competitive way.  Such a distinction may lead to a two-tier approach being adopted &mdash; perhaps the Minister will say otherwise &mdash; and that should be nipped in the bud.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would outline his position on this question in his reply.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that the concerns of thousands of bridge players throughout the country about this legislation are taken on board? Apparently they contend that section 2, which defines competitive sport and recreational sport, may exclude bridge from sport in some way. Many Members have been contacted by the Bridge Association of Ireland and are aware of the difficulties encountered by many bridge clubs in accessing lottery funding in recent months. Bridge provides a great social outlet for thousands of people.  It is a legitimate sport and the committee of which I am chairman recommended <Col N="1465" /> that it be so considered by the incoming council and that it should be recognised by the Government. In short, it is time to give bridge a sporting chance.  My party will be tabling an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will accept it.  After the GAA, bridge probably has the largest membership of any other sport in the country.  I know the Minister understands this and he is supportive of the association's case.  I hope section 2 can be refined so that bridge and similar sports are not discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the withholding of funding from a person or organisation.  This is an important part of the Bill and I commend the Minister for not only including the provision to withhold funds but also for inserting a section which allows funding to be reimbursed to the State.  This is a welcome development because use of the provision might be necessary in the future. However, section 8 does not provide for an appeals process for those from whom funding has been withdrawn.  Given the devastating effect the withdrawal of funding can have on a sporting organisation, it is important that an appeals system should be included under the section.  It is also important to insert in the section a safeguard which will prevent innocent sportsmen and sportswomen being punished for behaviour which occurred at an official level within their sporting organisation.  The Minister will recall the effect the withdrawal of funding from the IASA had on dozens of young swimmers.  It is important that we learn lessons from this experience and that we do not punish an entire sport because of the behaviour which may be practised by members of a sporting organisation, particularly those at official or coach level.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to the conditions of office of the members of the new sports council.  Subsection (2)(c) of the section allows the Minister to remove a person from the council if, in the Minister's opinion &ldquo;the removal appears necessary for the effective performance of the council's functions.&rdquo; This gives the Minister extremely wide powers and it does not allow for any degree of transparency in the process of removing members of the council.  The Labour Party will be proposing an amendment to this section which will require the Minister to produce a stated reason for a member's removal.  I recall that a similar amendment to the Enterprise Ireland Bill was accepted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, earlier this year.  I hope the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will acknowledge the precedent and reconsider the section.</P>
    <P>This is probably the most significant legislation the Minister is likely to bring before the House during the lifetime of this Dáil.  The Labour Party believes the Minister has, in a way, missed a golden opportunity to give full expression to the social benefits brought about by sport.  Thousands of people throughout the country dedicate an enormous amount of their time, voluntarily in <Col N="1466" /> most cases, to promote and encourage sport.  It is important that we establish a statutory sports council to ensure that this huge voluntary effort receives the funding and resources necessary to make real improvements to every community, and the sporting bodies involved therein, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The sports council outlined in the Bill has the potential to achieve this important task. However, that sports council will not become a force to combat discrimination and disadvantage because the Government refused to consider this an important enough task for it to undertake.  I remind the Minister that the problems of discrimination and disadvantage occur in the world of sport as much as they do in all other aspects of life.  The body charged with directing the future of sport here should be required to fundamentally address this issue.  It should be given a responsibility to lead change in this area.</P>
    <P>Given the calibre of people on the current Sports Council, and that of those involved in sport generally, I have no doubt that the new body will address many of these issues.  However, it will do so despite not being specifically requested to do so in the Bill which, as already stated, I am advised is enabling legislation.  That is the Bill's main failing.  It represents a missed opportunity and the Government has produced a minimalist Bill.  I had expected the Minister to be more adventurous in producing the legislation but I recognise that he must take account of legal advice and advice he receives from the Attorney General, the parliamentary draftsman and so on. However, although it fails to take account in some way of the place of sport in the fabric of Irish society, I hope the Bill will lead to a new force for change.  Beyond this key failing my party believes that the elements of the Bill can be improved and enhanced and we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this legislation as promised.  My party will support the Bill on Second Stage.  I hope the Minister will accept some of our comments in good faith and that he will accept a number of our amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister on its introduction.  Like previous speakers, I pay tribute to John Treacy and his colleagues in the strategy group on the production of their report, Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, a key recommendation of which was the introduction of this legislation.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Allen, is also entitled to great credit for having the foresight to mandate John Treacy and his colleagues to produce their report. Deputy Allen also produced a Private Members' Bill on this topic earlier in the year and thus maintained pressure on the Government to produce its legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The range of activities encompassed by the term &ldquo;sport&rdquo; is very wide.  It ranges from the multi-million pound bloodstock and horseracing industry to modest point-to-point competitions in rural areas, from professional soccer players being paid tens of thousands to play for their countries in the World Cup to children kicking a ball around in a park on a Saturday morning, from the corporate boxes in Croke Park to young players changing on the side of a ditch for a junior club match on a wet November afternoon and from the glamour of the Olympic Games to families going for a Sunday morning swim at the local pool.</P>
      <P>We have always prided ourselves on being a sporting nation but the role in and influence of sport on many areas of life has increased enormously in recent decades.  There is much more emphasis on sport in school.  People are more conscious of the physical, recreational and social value of participation in sport.  The tourism related and economic spin-off from our sporting infrastructure is significant and growing.  The level of participation in sport among children and adults is greater than ever and we have witnessed a tremendous resurgence in one of our leading national sports, hurling, and the emergence of new sports such as women's football.</P>
      <P>An indication of the huge range of sports now available is given in the index at the back of John Treacy's report on targeting sporting change, which lists 75 national governing bodies which received grants between 1994-96, ranging from well-known organisations such as the GAA, the BLE and the FAI to smaller, less well known, but no doubt much loved organisations by their members, minority sport organisations such as the Baton Twirling Sport Association and the Horseshoe Pitchers Association of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television has made sport more accessible than could ever have been imagined a few years ago. Fans who could never have hoped to follow an Irish soccer team abroad can now see every match in a World Cup.  Those who could never get a ticket to see their county play in an All-Ireland final can now see it all in the comfort of their homes, complete with action replays from every conceivable angle.  The Irish Derby, the English Grand National and the Melbourne Cup can all be seen on television.  Golf, snooker, darts, the Grand Prix, and other motor racing events can be seen at the press of a button.  As a result of television, top class sport has become hugely commercialised.  This has resulted in the paradoxical situation whereby, while major sporting events are more accessible than ever through television, ordinary fans often find it more difficult to get a ticket for a match.  More tickets are <Col N="1468" /> taken up by corporate boxes, sponsorship deals, ten year tickets and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible to turn the clock back with regard to the commercialisation of sport, but this trend raises serious questions about how we should apply scarce public resources when it comes to the promotion of sport.  The main priority in regard to sporting policy should be to promote the greatest level of participation possible by the maximum number of people with the best training and back-up facilities possible.  This should be the priority in regard to the use of public money.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth considering the recent Government decision to commission a feasibility study to examine the possibility of constructing a new 80,000 capacity national stadium at a reported cost of approximately £200 million. Despite going through the motions of the feasibility study, there appears to be a determination to see the project through and there is already mention of a completion date of 2003.  The project is being driven by the Taoiseach's enthusiasm for sport and by an astonishing, no strings attached, offer of a donation of £50 million from Mr. J.P. McManus to help fund the stadium.  Mr. McManus is a professional gambler and financial markets speculator who now lives in Switzerland, having successfully removed himself from the PAYE regime.  Many people heard his name for the first time when it emerged he was a shareholder in United Property Holdings, the company at the centre of the controversial deal involving the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site at Ballsbridge.  If the donation is of the level suggested, and genuinely without strings and conditions, it is a gesture of extraordinary generosity. However, little or nothing of Mr. McManus's donation or involvement in the project has been put on the record.  What has been reported has been on the basis of leaks and rumours.  It would be useful if all of this, or as much as the Minister knows about it, was formally put on the record by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the generosity of Mr. McManus, there is considerable confusion relating to the construction of a national stadium or, even more improbable, the construction of two or more national stadia.  The IRFU is planning a major stadium and has purchased the land between Clondalkin and Tallaght.  The FAI, not having shown any great skill at husbandry in the bountiful years &mdash; during the past 15 years &mdash; have similar ambitions.  The GAA continues to develop Croke Park, primarily using its own resources but also with some Exchequer assistance.  There are also a number of proposals from private developers. When replying to the debate will the Minister clarify the Government's stance?</P>
    <P>Will the proposed stadium proceed, irrespective of running costs or will the feasibility study determine whether it proceeds?  The reality would appear to be that the GAA would be required to play a number of meaningful games in the new stadium.  Croke Park authorities will <Col N="1469" /> not permit soccer at Croke Park, but will the GAA take a more ecumenical approach towards a new stadium?  Is it the case that the IRFU has recently indicated a willingness to participate in helping to make a new stadium a success?  Is the FAI still persisting with its own plans and what is the proper involvement of the private sector?  I am sure the Minister accepts there are not sufficient major sporting events available to this country to justify the construction of the several stadia supposedly mooted.  It is difficult to form a view on it.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, adjacent to where I live in Clondalkin, one developer has been demonstrating plans for some considerable time for a stadium in Clondalkin which originally was to have been sited in the town centre.  It seems an impressive plan but it is difficult to form a view on whether it is ever likely to be realised.  Similarly, it is difficult to understand whether the IRFU is determined to go it alone or whether it has changed its view having regard to the announcement by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and the Taoiseach. The IRFU has purchased the lands but that was contingent on the Phoenix Park site being available and presumably may now be contingent on whether the Government is proceeding and would involve the IRFU.  It is clear the operational costs would be high and that half a dozen internationals would not support the running of such a stadium.  Therefore, it is essential the major sports combine to make it a success.</P>
    <P>The GAA has developed a significant facility for Gaelic games at Croke Park.  Irrespective of the views of Members, it is unlikely the GAA will facilitate association football at Croke Park.  In terms of the revenue required to make a new stadium work, would the GAA be prepared to play a number of meaningful games in the new stadium? All these are questions for the Minister when summing up.</P>
    <P>A sum of £150 million, even allowing for Mr. J. P. McManus's generosity, is a great deal of money.  One must ask if £150 million might not be more productively spent in providing badly needed facilities such as neighbourhood swimming pools or the development of facilities for thousands of children throughout the country who do not have proper changing rooms or showers in which to wash after games and who still tog out in very primitive conditions.  I have not formed a view on that.  I do not know what the feasibility report will reveal, but a great many people who are involved in sport, for no other reason than the good of sport and the good of their local communities and who find it very difficult because of the conditions under which they must operate, will want to know if their lot will be improved as a result of the Bill and if this is the most productive use of public money.  Since the Taoiseach has refused to answer questions, as Deputy Allen said, the Minister ought to be required to answer them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the swimming pool controversy, the <Col N="1470" /> Minister announced that work on the proposed 50 metre swimming pool would start before the end of the summer.  Many of the questions I raised about the high operational cost of the proposed stadium would apply to such a 50 metre swimming pool.  It would have to be an aquatic centre with many dimensions rather than simply a swimming pool.  What is the position with regard to the Kit Campbell report commissioned by his predecessor in a former Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat administration?  That report concluded that having examined four different locations in the State, Tallaght was the obvious location for such a swimming pool.  The best proposal I saw was one promoted by DISC which provided for a partnership between the private sector, the local authority and the State.  In the case of Tallaght, the site was to be provided free gratis by the local authority and I do not know whether that influenced Kit Campbell Consultants. The other players involved in that proposal are probably well known to the Minister.  I would like to hear his views on that.  In that report the estimated running cost was £1.67 million per annum, the estimated revenue was £1.57 million and the £100,000 deficit was to be made up by the local authority which was committed to doing that.  What is the current state of thinking on that proposal?  Has the Minister abandoned that proposal announced by his predecessor, Deputy Alyward, in the run up to a previous general election? Many of my constituents would like to know the up to date position on it.  If we are to have a 50 metre swimming pool, Tallaght is the obvious suitable location.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing his time with me.  I support the case made by the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland for the recognition of bridge as a recreational sport and the comments made by previous speakers. Bridge is recognised as a recreational sport in almost all European countries.  It is recognised by the European Council as an olympic sport and it will be an olympic sport in the 2004 games.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question on 21 October.  In the course of his reply the Minister explained that this Bill was being circulated. He said the intention is to have the matter of the recognition of individual sports and recreational activities, including bridge, revisited in the context of the framework being provided in this Bill.  He said he had met the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland regarding the matter and it was aware of his general approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is not clear from the Bill if bridge can be recognised under the terms of this legislation. Competitive sport is defined exclusively in terms of physical activity and recreational sport is defined as meaning all forms of physical activity which, through casual or regular participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being and forming social relationships.  While bridge might qualify under the terms of mental well-being and forming social <Col N="1471" /> relationships, it is not clear if it qualifies under the requirements of physical fitness and physical activity.  The Minister must clarify his intention with regard to the recognition of bridge as a recreational sport.  Will it qualify for recognition?  If the Minister is not in a position to ensure that, it will be necessary to amend the Bill to allow for such recognition.  There is not much point in telling the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland that its application for recognition will be dealt with under the terms of this Bill if the definitions provided in it and its text will prohibit such recognition when such an application is made.  That needs to be dealt with when the Bill is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I pay tribute to the thousands of people who, out of the sense of sheer enjoyment, voluntarily participate in a large range of sport activities each week either as players or in a leadership or coaching capacity.  It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the late Noel Carroll who, as an accomplished athlete in his day, brought such honour and distinction to himself and his country and who, in more recent times, played such a significant part in the development of sports policy, in coaching and encouraging young athletes and, in his quiet and efficient manner, helped organise many events for which he will be long remembered.  I extend my sympathy to his wife Deirdre and his children.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to Catherina McKiernan and Darren Clarke who last Sunday achieved significant personal goals in their different sports as elite sportspersons.  As previous speakers have done, I pay tribute to John Treacy and his group who drew up the document, Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, which will make a significant contribution to the development of sports policy.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government outlined a commitment to set up a sports council on a statutory basis.  This commitment recognised the sterling work done down through the years by Cospóir.  The commitment to sport by the Government has been clear from its decision to create a full sports ministry, bringing sport to the Cabinet table for the first time.  The value and importance of sport and leisure activities to the development of personal and social skills, as well as physical and mental well-being, is enormous. It is important that the Government decided to recognise the shortcomings in the development of sports policy in a structured way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Sports Charter defines sport as encompassing all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aims at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.  Previous speakers have adverted to the overlap between sport and leisure.  Leisure can include activities such as chess and bridge which, while not physically demanding, are still worthy of attention and support because they assist the <Col N="1472" /> expression and improvement of mental well-being and the formation of social relationships.  If we are to develop a meaningful sports policy, we will have to develop one which will cater for the whole community and all ages and ability ranges within it.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to ensure his Department gives serious consideration to examining the recognition of chess and bridge as recreational sports.  When I was chairman of the Sports Advisory Council of the City of Dublin VEC, I recall being rapped over the knuckles by the Department of Education for allocating £100 to a chess club in Dublin because it was in breach of the provisions of a circular.  I hope we will have matured by the time a sports council comes onstream.  I support the goals adopted by New Zealand's Hillary commission for sports fitness, which include the need to increase participation in fitness and to enhance performance in sports fitness and leisure.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those who were 56 years or over when Social Insurance Pension contributions for the self-employed were introduced in April 1988, and who were required to make contributions but are now precluded from eligibility for the Contributory Old Age Pensions which became payable from 6 April 1998.</P>

      <P>Since I was appointed last year as spokesperson on social affairs on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I have been spearheading a campaign to remedy what I consider to be a major injustice.  As the motion indicates, the pension contributions for the self-employed were introduced in 1988.  The first pensions became payable to those who attained the age of 66 after 5 April 1998, effectively last April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there was one huge gap in the legislation in 1988.  No transitional arrangements were put in place for the self-employed who were over the age of 56 in April 1988.  They were forced to contribute to a fund, but under the legislation were unable to qualify for a contributory pension on reaching the age of 66.  This was so because the legislation provided for a minimum contribution of ten years, which in ordinary circumstances would have been acceptable.  However, it <Col N="1473" /> was provided in legislation for a group of people who could not meet that minimum requirement.</P>
    <P>Pension contributions to the State operate in such a way that they are not payable after the age of 66 and could not be paid after that age, even if the applicants wanted to.  Effectively, therefore, a group of people were left in limbo as a result of that legislation.  Thus an enormous anomaly was created from the beginning for those who were forced to contribute to the scheme but were unable to benefit from it.  Since I became spokesperson for social affairs on behalf of Fine Gael I was conscious of this injustice and anomaly and I raised the issue in the House on many occasions.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled last April following my dissatisfaction with the response by the Minister to a Priority Question I put down at that time. I am delighted with the success of the campaign because this major injustice will be remedied. This is clear from the Government's briefing over the weekend and from the proposed Government amendment to the motion.  It seems clear that the principle of <i>pro rata</i> pensions has now been conceded. I welcome the decision by the Government to make this concession.  I reserve my position on the issue until the details become apparent, but the principle for which all those involved in the campaign fought has been conceded by the Government and has, therefore, been established.</P>
    <P>Many people from around the country contacted me over the past 12 months with regard to the campaign for <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  I wish to highlight two files out of perhaps hundreds which I received.  One had to be under the age of 56 on 6 April 1988 to qualify for the scheme.  I received correspondence from an applicant whose 56th birthday was on 6 April 1988 and who paid all his contributions.  I have on my file a copy of the formal response from the Department last May to his application refusing a pension essentially because he was 24 hours over the age at the time of the introduction of the scheme.  Many others were days, weeks and months short, but that case highlighted the full impact of the anomaly created.</P>
    <P>The other file to which I wish to refer involves an applicant in Dublin who maintained contact with me during the course of the campaign.  When I wrote to him last week to advise him of my intention to move this motion on behalf of Fine Gael I received a response from his widow.  He died recently and he unfortunately cannot now benefit from the scheme.  The benefit to which I believe he should have been entitled from last April cannot now be paid to him.</P>
    <P>The question of the various estimates, including the estimates of those caught in the limbo I outlined and of the cost of resolving the problem, needs to be addressed.  When I pressed the issue with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in October 1997 he gave a Department estimate of 20,000 involved.  He also indicated that the figure could be in excess of 20,000 because it was possible that many others who <Col N="1474" /> might not have indicated their interest in the type of pension involved might come forward.  I have always considered that the figure would be much lower because many of those involved would have qualified in any event for a non-contributory pension and, given that the amount of <i>pro rata</i> pension they would get would probably be less than the non-contributory pension, they would not be interested in it.  I say this from my practical knowledge and experience as I have no access to the Department's detailed estimates.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I have always disputed past figures quoted by the Department to remedy this anomaly. Originally £756 million was mentioned as the cost over the lifetimes of the persons concerned. That figure was mentioned when I raised the issue during Question Time.  I noted there was a comment from an unquoted Department spokesperson who indicated that if money of that order was available it would be more appropriately spent.  With regard to figures and statistics, there are lies, damned lies and statistics.  I believe the cost of remedying this injustice was not addressed at an early stage.  I am glad this is happening now because the Minister would require detailed costings before he could concede on the scheme.</P>
    <P>A review was undertaken some years after the introduction of the scheme and the original figure of £756 million was quoted as being reduced to £500 million, based on 20,000 qualifying people.  I have never accepted that figure either, nor have I accepted a total overall costing of that order.  I do not know the exact figure.  I hope the Minister is aware of it.  However, I believe a sum of £20 million per annum would be the maximum amount required to remedy this anomaly.  It may be less depending on the number of people who will be entitled in any event to non-contributory pensions.  I understand the Minister now accepts that the cost of removing this injustice is of manageable proportions and accordingly the principle of <i>pro rata</i> pensions is being conceded.  I am very pleased about this.</P>
    <P>However, while the principle may be conceded a number of issues remain to be addressed.  From what date will the pension be payable?  Justice would seem to indicate that for those over the age of 66 in April 1998, payment should commence from that date, as that is the commencement date for everybody else involved who qualifies under this scheme.  I am talking about somebody who barely qualifies under this scheme only.  If the first pension became payable last April, then anybody over the age at that time should be at least entitled to qualify from that date.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to address some other issues at this stage.  There is the question of the <i>pro rata</i> amount to be made payable to those so entitled.  I always operated on the basis that if one had paid seven years contributions out of ten, and that was all one could pay, one should be entitled to a pension of seven tenths.  That seems to be fair.  The Minister may have other ideas and, if so, <Col N="1475" /> it would be appropriate for him to sketch in the detail now.</P>
    <P>There is another important group of individuals whose concerns need to be dealt with.  When the scheme was originally introduced in 1988 it was on the basis that refunds would be made for those self-employed who had to make contributions, if the applicant qualified for neither the contributory or non-contributory old age pension. The original principle was that if one did not qualify by having ten years' contributions one applied for a non-contributory old age pension and if one did not get it one was entitled to apply for a refund.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the exact number of applications for refund to date but, when I raised this issue in the House last April, I was told there had been a total of 3,874 applications for refunds, of which 2,868 had been paid.  That amounted to £2.5 million plus interest at an average of £900 per person, according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A serious question now arises as to the entitlement of those who sought those refunds under the law as it then applied.  Any such person should be entitled to qualify under any <i>pro rata</i> scheme now being introduced.  They should be treated in the same way as anybody else who did not go ahead with the application for a refund. Quite a number of people did not apply for a refund in the hope and expectation that the campaign for the establishment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions would be successful and, clearly, they will now qualify.  However, those who applied for the refunds under the law as it was at the time will also have to be considered.  They should be entitled to pay back the amount of the refund so they would be put in exactly the same position as if they had neither applied for nor received refunds.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter of the ten year period, the Minister quoted to me in the House that the Pensions Board looked at the issue and came down in favour of having a basic ten year rule on contributions.  I am not against a basic ten year rule but I have always insisted, and will continue to do so, that special provision has to be made for that tranche of people excluded by legislation at the time of the introduction of the scheme, yet who were obliged to contribute.  That is a fundamental point.  In the early days of this legislation, I recall raising this very issue but it was not dealt with at the time.  Now is the time to deal with it since the pensions have become payable since last April.</P>
    <P>For those who may feel I am playing free and easy with Exchequer funds from the Opposition benches, it is important to point out that is not my approach.  There is a case in justice to be resolved here.  We are dealing with a finite number of people.  We are not making a fresh start with a scheme for the self employed.  We are only dealing with those people who were caught under <Col N="1476" /> the terms of the scheme at the time of its introduction. The situation will not recur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis, justice requires that we do what is necessary to ensure the removal of what is agreed and accepted by everybody as being an anomaly.  The Minister should also examine the question of entitlement to free schemes.  That is a side issue to be dealt with in the context of the detail of the scheme.  It would seem to be only fair that those who qualify for <i>pro rata</i> pensions should also qualify for the free schemes where they otherwise comply with their conditions.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the many voluntary organisations that have been involved in the campaign for justice on this issue.  I will not mention them all by name, but the self-employed pension association was involved along with farming and employers' organisations.  They can be satisfied with the result of this campaign if the detail matches the expectation.  However, they can be happy that the principle has been established.</P>
      <P>I was involved in spearheading the campaign from the Fine Gael side, but Deputies from all sides of the House have been very sympathetic to the issue.  When I raised it with the Minister, even though he was not able to concede it, he indicated a sympathetic reaction to the case being made.  It is also significant that when I tabled an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill, 1988, relating to this issue, virtually every Deputy, including the Fianna Fáil ones, spoke in favour of the principle, while at the same time voting down my amendment. I suppose they had to do that in the context of the time.</P>

      <P>A number of other issues will arise which I will deal with in my reply to the debate.  There are a number of issues which the self-employed pension association would wish to raise and I will attend to those in my final reply.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Government has conceded this issue.  I spoke to the Minister in the Dáil and in a personal capacity about it.  I compliment Deputy O'Keeffe for bringing this motion before the House.  We had intended to debate it before now but many other issues arose so it had to be postponed.  When Deputy O'Keeffe was appointed Opposition spokesman for social welfare, he told me he would make this issue a <Col N="1477" /> priority.  I compliment him for bringing the matter before the Dáil.  I also compliment the Government for taking it on board.</P>
      <P>I hope when the budget is announced no obstacle will be put in the way.  As somebody who has been self-employed all my life, I welcomed this scheme when it came into place.  Many people thought this was the answer to their pension rights.  The numbers involved were small. When someone in my constituency asked me what I liked best about the Dáil, I said it was getting a cheque on fine days as well as wet ones. There were good days and bad days.</P>

      <P>Some people worked hard but did not know where the next pound would come from.  When this scheme came into place they were delighted, as I was.  I have been contacted about this matter by many of my constituents, some of whom are in the Public Gallery today.  I welcome them to Dublin.  That shows how concerned they are about this matter.  There was injustice, and it should not have taken us so long to react, no matter who was in Government.  The Revenue Commissioners collected what was due to the State.  When these people started making contributions in 1988 they thought that ten years on they would qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension. People missed out on the pension by one day, one month, six months, seven months.  I hope when legislation comes before this House these people will be given an option either to buy into the pension by paying a lump sum or to be paid a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  I hope the Government will concede that.  I hope they will also qualify for the free schemes.</P>
      <P>I am glad this legislation will be announced in the budget.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, announced it on Saturday.</P>

I am delighted this is happening.  I hope the people concerned will get what is due to them and that the State will learn a lesson from this.  The State cannot be always the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;, holding a gun to people's heads, telling them they must pay this or that.  If the State makes a mistake which results in injustice it should correct it quickly.  The civil servants have to learn that too.  Perhaps now and then a few civil servants could be taken from every Department and brought to Deputies' clinics to give them an idea what the general public are thinking.  Civil servants are so tied up with <Col N="1478" /> paperwork in their offices that they do not understand what is happening on the ground.</P>

      <P>I think they are and they forget about the public.  If they had to attend public meetings, as the Minister and I have to, and listen to people out there, they would know what is actually happening.  That was an injustice that the Civil Service should have dealt with before now, and it was seen as an injustice before the Minister came into office.  It should not have been necessary to bring a Private Members' motion before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The State introduced this scheme.  It told people that if they paid PRSI, they would qualify for a pension after ten years.  The State knew when that scheme was introduced that some people entering the scheme would not qualify. That should have been noted before the scheme was introduced, but once it was realised that a mistake had been made it should have been rectified. I am glad that tonight this is being done.  I hope there will be no trickery in December when the budget is introduced and that the matter will be handled in a straightforward manner.  Only a small number of people are affected and they are entitled to be dealt with fairly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> O'Keeffe on having played such a central role in resolving this difficulty.  I compliment the Government on accepting the motion and on the amendment it has tabled this evening.</P>
    <P>Natural justice demands that those who were forced to pay contributions should be able to benefit.  As my colleague, Deputy Ring has said, the anomaly in the scheme was unjust, and when an injustice is perpetrated by the State, people should not have to go to court.  It has taken us a long time to react to this situation.  I am glad we are on a positive track and that the whole problem will be resolved by the time the budget is introduced.  It will be interesting to hear the details because some people who have made contributions would have been entitled to a pension from last April.  I hope the Department will allow that.</P>
    <P>The self-employed must be taken into consideration because they have worked for many years.  Some of them have their own private pensions but many would not have been in a position to provide for themselves and it would be unjust if, having worked hard all their lives with no great return, they found they had no income and were unable to work the hours they could heretofore. Again I compliment the Government and my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for bringing this campaign to the forefront.  I hope the people involved will be satisfied with the result.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on spearheading this campaign to right this injustice.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for accepting the principle of the motion.  When I worked in the Department of Agriculture I found the civil servants very good at all times, and if I thought they did not know what was happening down the country I took them down there with me.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was introduced in April 1988 it should have included only applicants who were under 56 years who could comply with the ten year statutory deadline.  I remember pointing that out in the House at the time and warning the Minister that this could lead to litigation, that people would not be happy with it and that it was unfair.  It was a ridiculous decision to extend the payment of social insurance to people over 56 years when it was the intention to exclude them from pensions.  It was very unfair to them.  I am glad they are now going to benefit by virtue of the fact that they did pay over the years and that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and others, including the Minister, have accepted their case.  I wish them well.  In fairness, they continued to pay their contributions because they did not want to break the law, even though they knew they might not qualify for a pension.  Those people have been very good and patriotic citizens and it is only right that they should be rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-employed people have made a significant contribution to the economy, and a sizeable number of them would have been affected by that <Col N="1480" /> decision.  Shopkeepers working in small retail outlets who want to continue working would not qualify for non-contributory pensions.  It is to be hoped they will now qualify for the <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension which will help augment their incomes and improve their standards of living. All who have paid contributions should be entitled to payment, and that includes people who have paid anything up to one year's contributions. It is important the Minister clarifies that all those who contributed are entitled to <i>pro rata</i> pensions. I hope there will not be a cut off point at four, five or six years' contributions.  Now that the Minister has accepted the principle, all those who made a contribution must be included.</P>
    <P>Credit must go to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for raising this issue and continuing to lobby for it.  If it proves one thing, it is that, if someone is persistent and consistent, their efforts will pay off in the end.  Deputy O'Keeffe has proved that and is an example to others.  I thank the Minister for accepting the motion.  Dáil Éireann has done a very good deed tonight.  It shows senior citizens who have contributed so much to the country that we, as legislators, can do something right.  We have done something very fair this evening by removing this anomaly from the social welfare system and that should be welcomed by everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join colleagues in commending Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on his perseverance on this issue.  I praise the Minister, although he had to be dragged screaming into the Chamber and it took an Opposition motion to finally make him concede. There is no humiliation in that because it is right that some kind of adversarial politics be practised in the Chamber.  When the Minister was in Opposition, he made many arguments, some not all that direct.  He now sees the logic of Deputy O'Keeffe's argument which has also been that of many people who have pursued the issue for years.</P>
      <P>The stress and strain on old people who find themselves in this position has been spoken of already.  This issue weighs more heavily on people who have retired which is why I am glad it will be resolved.  I support Deputy O'Keeffe's request that <i>pro rata</i> pensions be introduced next April. When the social welfare system was first devised, many people did not believe it would come to play such an important part in their lives.  It does now and social welfare is an important part of the economy.  It also plays a strong financial role throughout the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has enjoyed a great partnership with An Post for many years.  Some 48 per cent of the revenue going through An Post comes from the Department.  However, post office employees who are members of the Communications Workers' Union are beginning to wonder what other initiatives will come from the Department. For example, there are a number of pilot schemes, one of which is in Ennis, whereby old age pensioners will be given high-technology <Col N="1481" /> cards to withdraw their money from ATMs, thus bypassing post offices.  Old age pensioners have had a long tradition of collecting their pensions at post offices.  I have not heard anyone at my clinic complaining about it.  The Department's system was flexible in that it gave people a choice of post offices.  They could collect in the local one or at a head office.</P>
    <P>The proposal to allow old age pensioners to collect their money at various locations in a town will greatly alter matters.  It will result in a loss of annual revenue of £36 million for An Post which will seriously undermine its viability.  Loss of revenue leads to a loss making enterprise, reduced investment in existing services and increased charges to compensate for the revenue loss.  Furthermore, major cost reductions lead to pressure to reduce staff numbers.  There is already an indication in Ennis that, if the Minister and the Department decide to deal directly with the banks in the payment of old age pensions, 11 jobs will be lost in the head post office.  Customers, principally old age pensioners, did not envisage a change such as that being necessary.  Neither were they told there was a possibility that, if they received such ATM cards, they could end up paying charges from their old age pensions because banks would eventually charge for the service. That is not a customer-friendly proposal from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regarding old age pensions.  It will certainly discommode many people.</P>
    <P>Ennis is the information age town which gives opportunities to explore new high-technology facilities which become available.  Nonetheless, the Department should discuss openly the future positions of employees of An Post with them.  I spent a great deal of time as Minister of State reassuring people about sub-post offices.  If the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, decides that all old age pensioners will collect their money using plastic cards, it will result in the closure of a greater number of rural sub-post offices than has been the case heretofore.  There will be a rash of closures which will strike at the heart of rural communities.</P>
    <P>I do not know the mindset of the Department on this matter because it has not made any statement of which I am aware.  I have had people attend my clinic who are very concerned, especially An Post employees who are also members of the Communications Workers' Union.  They are not alone in this as it could affect many post offices in towns around the country. Skibbereen has a substantial post office and Deputy O'Keeffe would probably be able to say how many people would lose their jobs there.  I am sure Deputy Kirk, although he is not supposed to go into Dundalk, would be aware of the potential job losses there.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state exactly his intentions regarding people being given plastic cards and being paid through banks, thus bypassing post offices?  Has he examined the resulting problems for An Post if he proceeds with playing it and the <Col N="1482" /> commercial banks against each other?  I do not believe it is in the interests of customers, especially old age pensioners.  Why should the Minister do it without advertising or campaigning for it?  There is no demand for it so why is he doing it?  Is it to save the Department money?  If so, it will be old age pensioners and social welfare recipients who will pay in the end.  I appeal to the Minister to state exactly his intentions regarding these pilot schemes and to indicate what progress has been made to date.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension and in that context welcomes the decision already taken by the Government to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> old age (contributory) pension for those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988 and notes that the issue will be addressed in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the issue under debate in which many Deputies have a keen interest.  I undertook time and again at Question Time to examine it, not only at the instigation of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe but at the instigation of Deputies on all sides.  It was raised on a number of occasions at meetings of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party since I took office.  I guaranteed that I would look at it as sympathetically as possible.  I indicated last month that the Government had decided to adopt a particular line.  Last Saturday I exhorted the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to make the nation aware of its excellent decision.  The motion, therefore, is a non-event.  As acting Chief Whip, I was surprised to learn last Friday that Fine Gael was proceeding with it.  Either Deputy Jim O'Keeffe did not read the newspapers during the Cork by-election or he was playing politics.  I am happy he has given me the opportunity to set out the background to this issue and to contrast the approach taken by the Government with the cynical opportunism of the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held the view that one of the true marks of a progressive society is the regard in which it holds its older people.  In preparing An Action Programme for the Millennium we recognised the tangible contribution and sacrifices made by older people in helping to build the country into what it is today.  We adopted a deliberate strategy to improve the position of older <Col N="1483" /> people in society and to secure their future as we moved towards the new millennium.</P>
    <P>One of the principal methods of improving the position of older people is through a strong social welfare pension based on social insurance.  In our election commitments we guaranteed a contributory old age pension of £100 a week by 2002.  We have made significant progress towards this objective through last year's increase of £5 a week in the basic rate to £83 a week.  The Government will continue its work in this area in the coming budget.  I have no doubt that the Opposition will thank us as it did last year.</P>
    <P>In our election commitments we promised to address the issue of those who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension.  I refer Deputies to the policy document, Irish Families &mdash; into the New Millennium, dated May 1997, which states, &ldquo;We undertake to make new arrangements to tackle the problems faced by people who were marginally excluded from participation in PRSI pensions&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to everything except the motion.  He should allow me to respond.  This group of self-employed persons were marginally excluded from entitlement to a contributory old age pension as they could not satisfy the condition of having entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age by virtue of the fact that they happened to be over 56 years of age when social insurance was extended to the self-employed group in 1988. The condition that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age before he or she is eligible to qualify for a contributory old age pension has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of this condition is to ensure entitlement is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during their careers.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that persons over the age of 56 should have been excluded when social insurance was extended to the self-employed. After a period of three years there is entitlement to a contributory widow's pension.  Some had class A contributions which when added to their self-employed contributions allow them to qualify for a contributory old age pension.  The Department could not, therefore, have provided for their exclusion.  If it had, it would probably have found itself in court for discrimination.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the rationale behind the ten year rule is sound.  It does, however, create transitional difficulties where the social insurance system is extended to a large group as occurred in 1988 when it was extended to the self-employed.  It is not unusual in this and other countries to make arrangements for groups affected in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue did not arise today or yesterday.  I have no doubt that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe <Col N="1484" /> received many representations when in Government. It has been discussed at length in the House.  The Deputy may recall that Fianna Fáil in opposition called for the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for the self-employed.  My ministerial colleagues, Deputies Walsh and Woods, raised the issue on many occasions but their proposals were rejected by the Fine Gael-led Government. What did Deputy O'Keeffe do at the time?  He did nothing.  What did Deputy Durkan who was Minister of State at the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs do?  He did nothing.  The previous Government's response was simply to provide for a refund of the pension element of self-employed social insurance to self-employed persons aged 56 or over in 1988 and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as employees provided they did not qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.  This amounted to an average payment of £900.  That was not of much use when what was needed was a much sought after pension.</P>

      <P>The truth is bitter.  In the last year I have been examining various options with a view to arriving at a formula that would address the specific problem faced by this group of pensioners. I have considered the possibility of making a lump sum payment to this group, allowing this group pay additional contributions to qualify and introducing a special <i>pro rata</i> pension.  On balance I consider payment of a <i>pro rata</i> pension to be the most equitable and the only practical way of addressing the situation taking all circumstances into account.  Therefore, I am pleased to confirm to the House this evening that the Government has agreed to my proposals to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension for those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988, who as a result did not qualify for a contributory old age pension and who have at least five years contributions paid since then.  Title to this pension will also give access to free schemes.  It is estimated that up to 8,000 pensioners and their 2,000 qualified adults will benefit from this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated full year cost of the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be £18 million.  The total estimated cumulative cost of the measure in the future is over £170 million.  Any refunds of PRSI contributions already paid to people who will now qualify will be recovered by my Department, which is a fair arrangement.  The precise details <Col N="1485" /> in relation to the introduction of the pension will be announced at budget time as one element of a package of measures for the older people in our society thus further fulfilling our election commitments to assist this most deserving group.</P>
    <P>This approach is a fair and just one which will be welcomed by those who have made the case for people affected by this anomaly.  It addresses the issue of those who, having paid into the social insurance fund in good faith, found themselves excluded from entitlement to a contributory old age pension through no fault of their own.  This issue was raised particularly by many farming organisations recently when they came to a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting and to the Select Committee on Social Affairs of this House.  I am glad to be able to respond in a positive manner to the various submissions they made.  The introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for this group will help facilitate older farmers in transferring the farm to the younger generation and will thus have a positive spin-off for farming policy.  It is very fitting also that this additional measure to help our older people will be introduced during the UN International Year of Older Persons.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of older people in our society over the coming decades clearly sets a challenge for us all but let me assure the House that this Government will not be found wanting in ensuring that adequate and effective pension arrangements are in place for all citizens.  While this new measure is a clear and positive signal of the Government's intentions in this regard, all the social partners have a responsibility and role to play in creating a strong pensions environment that will adequately provide for older people as we head into the new century.</P>
    <P>I am delighted my Government colleagues both in my own party and in the Progressive Democrats agreed that this measure should be introduced after many years of people calling for it.  Opposition Deputies have acknowledged that the bringing forward of this <i>pro rata</i> pension, details of which will be given in the Budget Statement, follows an enlightened decision by the Government.  For all these reasons I commend the amendment to the House and I am sure it will have the support of Opposition Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: I compliment the Minister on introducing this <i>pro rata</i> pension for self-employed people aged 56 and over in April 1988 and for linking the pension to the free schemes for pensioners.  For the past ten years I have argued with various Ministers, going back to Deputy Woods, that the contributory old age pension scheme was unfair to self-employed people.  However, only the present Minister was prepared to listen.  The reasons the scheme could not be changed were trotted out year after year. During the three years of the rainbow coalition Government I raised the matter at every meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I was informed by the then Minister, Deputy Proinsias <Col N="1486" /> De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, that changing the scheme would cost too much and would not be in the interest of pensioners or taxpayers.  Last year I differed with the Minister, Deputy Ahern, during the debate on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  The Minister then gave a commitment to examine the possibility of bringing this group of self-employed people into the contributory pension scheme and I thank him for this re-examination.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy has met people who do not qualify for a contributory old age pension because their contributions are one or two weeks short. Deputies on all sides of the House believe this is unfair.  I know of one case where a pension was denied because of a shortage of two days' contributions. The scheme contains a major anomaly which the Minister has recognised.  Since the proposed new scheme was announced in the past week, many people in my constituency have contacted me by phone to ask me to thank the Minister for recognising the need for pensions for this group of people.  To deny these people pensions because of the ten year rule was unfair.  It was insulting to refund their pension contributions because this money should not have been taken from them in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At a meeting last week of the Joint Committee of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Deputy De Rossa, whom one would expect to favour paying pensions to the older generation, argued that it would be too costly a burden on the taxpayer to pay pensions to this group of people.  Surely old age pensioners cannot be seen as a burden on the taxpayer during this time of economic plenty. Any person who reaches pensionable age should be entitled to a pension.  I thank the Minister for taking this decision to introduce an old age contributory pension on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  It will be welcomed by the 8,000 people who will qualify for it and is welcomed by those Deputies who have fought for this measure for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  I support the amendment that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension and in that context welcomes the decision already taken by the Government to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> old age (contributory) pension for those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988 and notes that the issue will be addressed in the forthcoming budget&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was elected to Dáil Éireann a little over a year ago and this is one of the days that has given me most satisfaction in that time.  Before my election I was not fully aware of the difficulties caused by anomalies in the pension scheme.  I have met numerous people in my constituency office regarding this issue.  I have given accounts of their difficulties to the Minister on many <Col N="1487" /> occasions and he is aware of my concern.  It should be a primary function of Dáil Éireann to meet the genuine needs and concerns of the electorate when those needs are based on sound factual arguments.  We should especially meet the concerns of that sector of the electorate who have devoted their working lives to their country and their families.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for taking the imaginative approach of choosing the <i>pro rata</i> option.  He outlined the other options available to him such as the payment of a lump sum to pensioners.  The <i>pro rata</i> option is the fairest and most suitable for older people who want a continuing income rather than a lump sum payment.  I appreciate that he has listened to people and has won the support of the Government for this measure.  It is important to know that 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualifying adults will be affected.  A number of self-employed people will also be affected by this measure, including shopkeepers, solicitors and priests, but the majority of people who came to me to discuss the matter were from the farming community.</P>
    <P>When the Government introduced the contribution scheme for pensions in 1988, the possibility that it would lead to an anomaly was recognised. The Minister has announced why it was important to take contributions at that time.  He said some people may have had contributions from previous employments and it would have been wrong to prevent them from making a contribution and getting a pension to which they were entitled.  This difficulty was always going to emerge as we moved towards the end of the ten year period.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government is responding to this issue.  People paid in good faith and many of them were surprised when they did not qualify for a pension.  Older people were particularly upset.  This was not a dignified way to treat people.  I commend the Minister for his actions which show that Fianna Fáil is a caring party.  The cost to the Exchequer will be significant, but it will be a poor reflection on our society if we cannot look after our older people.  This measure is just one example of the Government's commitment to looking after older people.  I know the Minister will announce further details to improve the lot of older people in the next social welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that people will be entitled to the free schemes and allowances associated with this pension scheme.  I support Deputy Browne's view that it was an insult to issue refunds to people.  Older people told me it was a kick in the teeth at the end of their days. I am confident the Minister will deal with that properly in the social welfare Bill to ensure those who took the refund of £900 because they needed it will get their full <i>pro rata</i> pension and that they will not be penalised for taking it.  Whether the Minister decides to deduct the refund from <Col N="1488" /> people's pensions or asks them to repay the amount, I am sure he will be fair and adopt a caring and sensitive approach.</P>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the House.  I look forward to the announcement of the final details on budget day.</P>

      <P>It is amusing, if not bemusing, that we are speaking tonight on this motion given that the Minister signalled some time ago that he would try to address this problem.  While it is of interest to all Members, the Opposition could make better use of its time by raising more important issues, although this one is important.</P>
      <P>I, like other Members, have been lobbied about difficulties since pensions were introduced for the self-employed.  The Minister indicated these difficulties are transitional, but they are unfair and inequitable.  For many years this House has tried to address these anomalies.  I was disappointed that a former Minister for Social Welfare from Democratic Left was adamant that this inequity should not be changed.  I could not believe my ears on Saturday afternoon when I heard him saying on the radio that he did not support changing this inequity in the social welfare system.  It shows a non-caring side to someone who was in a Department which is one of the most caring and which touches every family in the country.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister will be able, through his deliberations with all those involved, to introduce a Bill to address this anomaly.  I have had representations from farmers, small shopkeepers and fishermen who entered the contributory pension scheme because they were anxious to provide for their later years.  They were disappointed when they learned that because they were more than 56 years of age when they entered the scheme, they would not be in a position to draw down that pension.  Some people were ineligible because they missed the deadline by a few days or weeks.  I am delighted we will be able to address this problem.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to address the problem of refunds in the legislation.  People took the money for one reason or another.  A deduction system would be the best way to address this problem.  If people wish, they can reapply and be considered for the <i>pro rata</i> pension.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that many people do not consider pensions until they are close to retirement.  I am concerned about how we will adequately provide for our older people.  The Government and the Fianna Fáil Party have made a commitment, to which they have lived up, to support older people in the community and those who have given their lives to their families and to this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will ensure old age pensioners receive a pension of at least £100 per week.  I am fully committed to that and the Minister has gone a long way towards increasing pensions to £100.  The free schemes are exemplary.  I know people who worked and lived in the UK, in particular, who are jealous of some <Col N="1489" /> of the schemes we provide for our older people. It is fair and equitable that people on <i>pro rata</i> pensions will now be entitled to those schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister introduces a comprehensive Bill in the near future so that we will be in a position to provide for our pensioners.  That we will have an imbalance in a number of years in terms of the number of people in work <i>vis-à-vis</i> the older community must be a cause of grave concern for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and many other Departments.  I hope the Bill will take on board the concerns outlined by the Irish Pensions Board, the Department and Members here this evening.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to address a problem which has been highlighted since pensions were introduced for the self-employed in 1988.  It will alleviate the concerns of many of those who willingly entered the pensions scheme.  The transitional difficulties might not have been foreseen as the legislation did not allow enough flexibility.  I am also delighted that those who have obtained refunds will be considered for a pension.  I commend and support the Government's amendment.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Penrose and Broughan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  It is not the first time we have discussed it and I commend the Minister for agreeing to deal with it.  It is not a wasted debate as our pensioners deserve some consideration. There are many other issues as regards pensions with which we must deal.  I thank Fine Gael for putting down this motion to deal with this important matter for those aged over 56 who were self-employed.</P>
      <P>We have an economy where money is available to the Exchequer to finance expenditure programmes based on the promotion of equality and fairness in our society.  It is up to this Government to take key decisions on how to spend our newly found wealth.  It can decide to reward those who are already doing well, as was the case in the last budget, or it can decide to eliminate inequalities in society through the removal of poverty traps and anomalies.  This anomaly is being addressed, but there are many more.</P>
      <P>The lack of accessibility to <i>pro rata</i> pensions for self-employed persons aged 56 years and over who paid their full PRSI since they became legally obliged to do so in 1998 was a terrible anomaly which should have been addressed earlier in the context of our economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies are familiar with sad cases they have come across in their clinics where self-employed people paid into the fund and on their retirement discovered to their shock they had not paid sufficient contributions to draw down their pension or that they were not entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  Recently these cases have become more upsetting.  I know people who missed out on a pension by a matter of weeks.  They paid ten <Col N="1490" /> years of contributions which amounted to nothing but a slap in the face.</P>
    <P>Our party Leader, Deputy Quinn, received a letter this week which cited the case of a man who began paying his contributions in January 1989, just one week after his 56th birthday.  He missed out on a pension by one week and he was rightly upset.  He feared for his financial well-being and that of his wife during their retirement.</P>
    <P>In its report, &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;, the Pensions Board cites more than the necessity of increasing the basic old age pension as a measure to provide for more secure futures for older people.  It states, &ldquo;This should result in a wider coverage not only in terms of numbers covered but also in terms of the types of employment concerned.&rdquo; This was an important report in securing stable and comfortable retirement.  In responding to this report, the Government must consider all members of the workforce, including the self-employed and atypical workers.</P>
    <P>Self-employment constitutes a vital component of our economy.  It includes all sectors of employment, spanning services, manufacturing and farming. Self-employment needs to be regularised and should be seen as part of mainstream employment. The self-employed face many uncertainties as regards their income.  A downturn in the economy can result in the immediate closure of the business of a self-employed operator.  Differences in sterling and the punt can result in huge financial losses which cannot be borne for long by small self-employed business people.  The poor weather conditions, coupled with prices in world markets have resulted in huge difficulties for farmers.  We saw thousands of those farmers take to the streets of this city last week.</P>
    <P>Such fluctuation and uncertainty in income is not desirable for any group at any stage, but more especially during retirement.  There is a vacuum in the type of support offered to those who are self-employed.  The availability of FIS to those in employment often causes resentment among the self-employed, but that is a debate for another day.  However, if we are to consolidate our tax and social welfare systems, we will have to face up to anomalies which currently exist for those employed directly and those in self-employment.</P>
    <P>Self-employment is proving itself as one of the most effective measures in moving the long-term unemployed from welfare to work by means of the back to work allowance.  The back to work allowance is far from adequate.  There is little encouragement for the self-employed to regularise their tax affairs.  To this end, every support should be put in place to ensure they get their books in order.  However, the shortfall in pension provisions for the self-employed is a turn-off from regularisation.  This will only be remedied when we iron out the anomalies and problems in the system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a recent debate on the crisis in agriculture has given rise to a discussion of other related matters, one of which was the compliance of farmers to tax and PRSI obligations.  Everybody <Col N="1491" /> with a sustainable income should pay his fair share.  However, in paying their fair share, people should also be treated fairly.  It is unfair that farmers, who are part of the self-employed sector, are excluded from drawing down a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  The extension of the right of the self-employed to a <i>pro rata</i> pension if they have not satisfied the ten year rule would go a long way.  I thank the Minister for dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said on numerous occasions that this issue will be delivered on at a considerable cost.  However, some of the estimated cost could be offset if more people were attracted to a fairer, more simplified social insurance system where returns and entitlements were comprehensible and anomalies were eliminated.  A fear of the unknown and of lost income prevents people from moving into the formal economy.  While successive Governments have warned against black economy activity, there must be reciprocal returns.  Workers should be able to look forward to retirement.  After long years of service, workers should not have to worry about a shortage of money in their retirement.  A stable income is vital for our ageing population.</P>
    <P>The small shop-owner, the small farmer, the cab driver, the fisherman, the child minder or the gardener should not have to worry about how they will pay their bills and buy their groceries every week when they reach retirement.  Their thoughts should be focused on the way they can enjoy their newly found leisure time.  However, I know many self-employed people who, due to the <i>pro rata</i> pension anomaly were forced to continue working past retirement age to ensure a stable income.  It is not right that a person who contributes to the economy for his working life should be forced to stay at work past retirement age. Given the changing nature of our workforce and our older population, we need a clear framework upon which to develop a national pensions plan to ensure that retired people, be they self-employed, atypical workers or employees, are provided with a reasonable means of survival when they reach retirement age.  To return to the previous example, Ireland has the oldest farmers of the EU and many small farms are inefficient and produce low yields.  To overturn this we have tried to encourage young farmers on to the land, but when a farming couple realise they have not qualified for a pension, they are forced to continue working on the land.  This is good neither for them nor for agriculture.  The National Pensions Board report should be viewed as the beginning of a series of reforms which are necessary to ensure retirement incomes are secured for all members of society.  Taxation policy and the social security system are other key areas which must be reformed to prevent people moving into poverty upon retirement.</P>
    <P>For those who have been excluded from a contributory pension as a result of the ten year rule, their contribution to the social insurance fund <Col N="1492" /> seems like a double tax.  For many who do not have a contributory pension the current system makes pensioners liable to pay tax even on a modest pension.  My party believes a system of increased personal allowances, moving to a system of tax credits, would ensure not only that low paid workers could afford to take up a pension, but also that any supplementary pension provisions would not be taxed to the hilt during their retirement.  Unless we make pensions straightforward and eliminate the fear of means testing for people approaching retirement, we will have failed to encourage older people to invest their money as an alternative to storing it under a mattress, making them prime targets for burglars.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has regular contact with young workers knows it is next to impossible to encourage them to make contributions to a pension fund.  To them, retirement seems far away, and the idea of putting aside a few pounds each week seems like a waste of money or a double tax.</P>
    <P>We have discussed this issue on numerous occasions and although it has now been addressed we will return to it, because old age pensioners deserve more for their years of work.  I hope the budget gives them an income of £100 per week.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this motion as Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and rural development.  I compliment the Minister for tackling this thorny issue.  There were cost implications, varying between £20 million and £30 million, but in the interest of equity and non-discrimination, the Exchequer should finance expenditure programmes in times of plenty.  The Minister has found a sum which will promote equality and fairness by providing <i>pro rata</i> pensions for the self-employed, including farmers, small shopkeepers and fishermen.  A mushroom grower in my constituency led the campaign for their inclusion in the scheme and I am sure he is delighted to hear the Minister confirm this evening that he would do so quite soon.</P>
      <P>Some ten years ago I dealt with this matter in my former professional capacity, and it struck me that there might be difficulties at the end of the transition period, for example, for people aged 57 at that time.  Farmers had no choice but to make the contribution, it was included in the tax assessment. When a legal obligation is imposed there is a legitimate expectation or anticipation that they would reap the same benefits as people making similar contributions in other employment sectors. At the end of the period some people were angry when they were told they were a few contributions short of qualifying for the pension, and massive difficulties were created.  It was a hot potato and on several occasions I asked that a new system be devised whereby people in that position would not be denied the right to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, this matter relates to self-employed people over 56 years of age on the <Col N="1493" /> extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988.  That was the genesis of the current problem.  I am delighted he has taken a positive decision to make the appropriate amendments which will encompass the inclusion of these contributors under the aegis of contributory pension cover from now on.  The ten year rule was a barrier to small farmers and the payment of a <i>pro rata</i> pension is the most practical and equitable way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Upon qualification for an old age contributory pension, recipients will enjoy the benefits of the various schemes.  This is important because, as many farmers say in the privacy of a politician's clinic, their incomes are low.  Two thirds of all dry stock farmers have a household income of less than £100 per week, which is not sufficient.  The position was critical and people almost had to go to other agencies in order to survive.  This measure will therefore be welcome in the farming community.</P>
    <P>Small shopkeepers in rural areas who were competing against major multinationals also found they were denied a contributory pension. This persuaded them to continue trading for a few more years, perhaps making poor profits, until they almost died in service.  The same was true of farmers, and this measure will facilitate the transfer of farms, which is important from a socio-economic viewpoint.  When I studied for a masters degree, I noted how slow the rate of farm transfer was in Ireland, and it has not accelerated as it should, even under the farm retirement scheme.  Some of the problems may be related to the lack of installation aid, which I have often mentioned in the House.  This new measure is another impetus to the rate of transfer and it must be welcomed for that reason also.</P>
    <P>The self-employed had a legitimate case that they were being discriminated against under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  Once they contributed they expected to enjoy the fruits of a contributory pension.  Also, how we care for the elderly is a measure of how humane and compassionate we are as a society, and this is a welcome step in that regard, as is its inclusiveness. The self-employed pay their appropriate taxes and contributions &mdash; I say that as one in that category &mdash; so why should they, by a quirk of transitory arrangements for such contributions, be denied what is rightfully theirs?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin mentioned family income supplement.  There are practical difficulties in applying the scheme to the self-employed and farmers but this or a similar scheme should be provided for them, because on the basis of equitable application they are entitled to support if their income falls below the threshold set out in the FIS criteria.  It is a good night for everybody concerned and I hope the implementation will not be hindered by technicalities or complexities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 500 workers in Limerick who will not be very busy in the near future.</P>
      <P>The announcement on Friday that Krups would close with the loss of 500 jobs is a tragedy not only for the workers who will lose their jobs but for the communities in the neighbourhood of the Krups factory and for Limerick city and county.  Krups was an internationally known company when it set up in Limerick in 1964.  Its reputation in Germany and throughout the world at that time was for expertise in heavy engineering and its decision to set up a light engineering firm in Limerick was a cause of great celebration.  It was a major success for the then new policy to revolutionise manufacturing industry in this country by attracting well-known international companies to set up in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Krups in Limerick specialised in electrical household goods.  It provided excellent employment over the years and in the 1970s employed in excess of 1,500 people.  In recent years, Moulinex, a French based company, took over the household appliance section of Krups.  There was a scaling down of both production and employment and when the announcement came on Friday last, 500 people were in permanent employment at the plant.</P>
      <P>The announcement was a major surprise even to the workforce.  A total of 150 part-time workers had been let go in late spring and when the workers assembled on Friday morning to hear a special announcement from management, they were expecting at worst an announcement that everybody would be put on a three day week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of the closure at Krups have been well recited since Friday and I will not go into them here.  I have, however, on behalf of the workers and management of Krups, three demands to make of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.  I demand that the Tánaiste state clearly when she knew that Krups would close and the action she took to forestall the closure.  Is it true she visited the headquarters of Moulinex in France several weeks ago to discuss the closure <Col N="1495" /> and that, in the course of these discussions, she was allowed participate in organising the arrangements for closure?  What does she say to the allegation that the management of Moulinex allowed her and her IDA advisers to choose between the closure at Limerick and a possible closure at the Krups plant in Thurles, and that the Irish participants opted for the Limerick closure?  If this is so, what were the considerations which led to this choice?</P>
    <P>I demand also that a proper compensation package be quickly negotiated with the workforce. The workers are highly skilled and on a gender breakdown it is 70-30 in favour of women. Many of the women come from communities adjacent to the plant and are the sole wage earner in the family.  When I visited Krups on Friday, the first person I met was a young woman with tears in her eyes who said she had a mortgage, four children and a husband who is unemployed, and she will not have a job after Christmas.  Other workers have their own stories, some very tragic. Almost all the workers need new jobs quickly and decent redundancy packages in the meantime to bridge the gap between closure and re-employment. Taking into account the excellent record of the workers, the fact that not a single job was lost through industrial action in 25 years and the unexpected nature of the announcement, anything less than six weeks' redundancy payment for each year of employment, in addition to statutory redundancy, is the minimum acceptable package.</P>
    <P>As well as decent redundancy payments I expect management at Krups and the Government agencies to put in place a major out-placement programme for workers seeking immediate employment.  FÁS should carry out a skills audit in Limerick city and county and organise appropriate training for ex-employees of Krups in those skills where a shortage is identified.  Out-placement alone, however, will not solve the problem. The Krups plant is modern and effective.  It is the only major manufacturing plant within the city boundary.  Its workers are drawn from particular neighbourhoods and, without exaggeration, the Krups plant is vital to the future of these neighbourhood communities.  If Krups' workers are scattered throughout the region, the community closest to the factory will die economically.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's task force, chaired by the IDA, must ensure an appropriate replacement industry is set up in the Krups plant as quickly as possible and that job offers in this new plant will be made in the first instance to workers redundant from Krups.  No other solution is viable.  The task force, if it is to be effective, will need the strong political backing of the Tánaiste to ensure the Krups plant is given top priority by the IDA as a location for overseas manufacturers interested in setting up in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The closure of Krups was a sad day for Limerick but it is only one of a series of closures in recent weeks.  The House is conscious not only of <Col N="1496" /> the Krups closure but of the redundancies at Fruit of the Loom in Donegal and the redundancies announced in Mullingar which will shortly be discussed in the House.  The Tánaiste must clarify whether these are once-off, unconnected events or part of a pattern.  If they are part of a pattern, she must state the underlying causes for this spate of redundancies and the policy changes she intends making to forestall further redundancies. I would like her to give an indication of the prospects for inward investment in industry in 1999. Is the IDA pipeline drying up and, if so, what are the implications for the national economy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to deputise for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who, due to a prior commitment, could not be in the House tonight.  Members of the Government have collective responsibility and within the Department we discharge that responsibility as a team.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I share fully the Deputy's concern and disappointment over the recent decision by the Moulinex Group to close the Krups plant in Limerick.  I am conscious of the effect the closure of this plant will have on Limerick and, most immediately, on the employees concerned.  Krups has been a very good employer for Limerick for more than 30 years.  Its workforce over those years has gained a well-deserved reputation for adapting to change and improving both its skills and productivity, and their industrial relations record has been second to none.  In such circumstances it is all the more difficult to accept the closure of the plant.</P>
      <P>On the Tánaiste's visit to the Krups plant yesterday she met with representatives of the company's management and workforce.  She assured everyone that all possible options were explored over a number of months to safeguard jobs at the plant.  However, despite best efforts by all concerned, this did not prove possible due to the seriously deteriorating market situation affecting the Moulinex Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Moulinex Group have two operations in Ireland, Krups in Limerick employing 500 people, and GMX in Thurles where 300 people are currently employed.  Krups Engineering Limited was established in Limerick in 1964 and is engaged in the manufacture of small electrical domestic appliances.  The plant was owned by Krups until January 1991 when it was taken over by the French owned Moulinex Group.  Since 1993 the Moulinex group has been involved in an ongoing restructuring of its global operations against a background of increased worldwide competition. This restructuring included cuts in production facilities and significant job numbers, mainly in France and Germany.  However, Ireland fared well under these measures as two new motor lines were established and additional assembly was transferred here.  This resulted in an increase in activity in Ireland over the past two years. <Col N="1497" /> Unfortunately, the group's restructuring efforts have been undermined by a seriously deteriorating market.  In particular, the economic downturn in the Russian and Asian markets, which accounted for more than 10 per cent of the group's turnover, has meant that many of its manufacturing plants are operating below capacity.  Against this background, Moulinex has embarked on further reorganisation of its activities and has decided to centralise motor production in two plants in France.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the transfer of motor production from both the Limerick and Thurles plants, Moulinex has decided it is no longer viable to maintain both facilities in Ireland and remaining production will be concentrated into a single site location.  The Thurles plant has been chosen as the site for the centralised production in Ireland and this safeguards 250 jobs at the GMX plant.  As we all know, Krups in Limerick will close, with production being wound down over the coming months.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that, in the face of these developments, exhaustive efforts were made to safeguard jobs at Limerick and Thurles.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment asked me to state that she is satisfied that IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, in their dealings with Moulinex senior management, did their utmost to advance the case of the Irish plants. The Minister supported their efforts when she travelled to Paris in May last and met with senior management of the Moulinex Group.  At that meeting the company indicated that it was continuing in its strategic review of its global operation against a difficult market background. However, as already explained, the market situation has deteriorated significantly and this has seriously exacerbated the group's difficulties.</P>
    <P>The closure of Krups is a major upset to all concerned and requires immediate action to address the setback.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister established an inter-agency response group which is chaired by Mr Frank Conlon, area director, IDA Ireland, and includes representatives from Shannon Development, FAS, the Limerick City Enterprise Board, the PAUL Partnership and representatives of Krups Ltd. Representatives of the workers, the local chamber of commerce and the city manager are also joining the group.  The Minister met with the group yesterday and it outlined its plan of action which involves working closely with local interested parties to ensure that all efforts are effectively co-ordinated towards achieving the key priorities of securing alternative jobs for the workers and addressing their retraining needs.  In this regard, FÁS is carrying out a skills profile of the Krups workforce in order to identify employment prospects arising from new and expanding projects in the Limerick area.  I am also encouraged to learn that Moulinex is funding and co-operating in the organisation of services to employees on re-skilling, financial advice and counselling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> Finding a replacement industry for Limerick is also a key priority but this may take some time as it is necessary to ensure that a quality and secure replacement is found.  Fortunately, the Limerick region has shared in and contributed to economic growth in Ireland and has seen tremendous development across a range of sectors and activities.  Manufacturing employment in the region has increased by over 20 per cent since 1993.  The area has a quality infrastructure and its proximity to Shannon Airport and the University of Limerick is a strong attraction for overseas investment.</P>
    <P>The Plassey Technology Park, Raheen Industrial Estate and the Shannon Free Zone are the chosen locations for a growing number of high technology companies.  In addition, it is expected that the strong level of recruitment by existing companies in the area will continue, due to the high level of industrial grant approvals in recent years.  In this year alone, Dell Computer announced a major expansion in Limerick city and will recruit 650 employees by year end.  Both Shannon Development and the IDA are committed to ensuring that these advances continue.</P>
    <P>It is important that everyone pulls together in addressing this setback for Limerick.  However, given the improving employment situation in the Limerick area, the recent announcement of future job opportunities and the ongoing efforts of the State agencies, the Minister and I are confident that the work of the inter-agency response group will prove successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Friday, 23 October, was a black day for Mullingar because Tarkett (Ireland) Ltd.  announced the closure of its plant there with the loss of 141 direct jobs.  That figure represents up to 20 per cent of the industrial workforce in the area and placed in context of the local population and the scale of job losses it is on a par with any of the major industrial closures which have occurred throughout the country at plants such as Krups in Limerick or Digital in Galway.</P>
      <P>The surprise announcement that the Tarkett plant is to close came within a few weeks of Christmas and has been devastating for the workers and their families.  Many of those workers have given 20 years service to the company, which was established in Mullingar in 1977. They have families, homes, mortgages and financial commitments and, as we approach Christmas, this announcement is devastating.  We must also be aware of the other jobs which will be lost as a result of this closure.  For example, those of contract cleaners, caterers and suppliers.  I must make particular reference to a 64 year old man who supplied a specific service to Tarkett enabling him to provide adequately for his family.  He will also lose his income without the prospect of a redundancy payment and with little hope of finding alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> The closure is all the more baffling when one considers the commitment of the workforce which, over the years, contributed handsomely to the profits of this company and its parent group. Indeed, the plant produced a profit of £3 million last year.  The decision to close it, which was taken far away from Mullingar, is cruel in this regard.</P>
    <P>The creation of a task force is welcome but I am surprised and disappointed that neither Westmeath County Council nor the county development team will be represented on it.  I hope the Minister of State will take that point on board and communicate it to the senior Minister. It seems ludicrous that the premier body in County Westmeath, namely, the county council, should be excluded from membership of the task force.</P>
    <P>The finding of an alternative industry for the Tarkett plant must become a priority.  This plant, comprising ten acres under one roof on a larger site of approximately 120 acres, with excellent access, car parking facilities, etc., must be marketed internationally by IDA Ireland to find a suitable investor.  The location of Mullingar &mdash; 50 miles from Dublin and only one hour from Dublin Airport &mdash; and the fact that it is a thriving town with adequate infrastructure should be the major selling point for this plant.  With the regionalisation of the country now imminent and if the Government will take the final decision, Mullingar, County Westmeath, will be located in an Objective One region and investing companies will be entitled to up to 40 per cent support for capital investments.  This should tip the balance for inward investment in favour of Mullingar and it should be a major marketing point for a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>As budget day approaches, I call on the Minister for Finance to review the tax treatment of redundancy payments.  This is particularly important when one notes the length of service of many employees of this company.  My colleague, Deputy Penrose, will refer to specific details in that regard.  It is important that FÁS should provide a comprehensive skills audit and also the training that may be required to enable these workers to gain new employment.  The possibility of enabling some of the workers to establish enterprises and become self-employed should also be explored.  Every effort must be made to support any employees who take this route.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the presence of the Minister of State to take this debate, I am disappointed that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not present.  I am extremely disappointed that I have not yet received an interim response to a letter I sent to her on 23 October. That is disgraceful.  The Minister visited Mullingar last week and I suppose she was welcomed by the people who met her.  However, she chose not to inform myself or any of the other public representatives from parties other than those on her side of the House that she would be visiting the <Col N="1500" /> town.  She is playing politics with an important issue which is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>When did the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment become aware of the difficulties experienced at Tarkett?  When did IDA Ireland inform her of the possible closure of the plant? Did she inform the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, about the situation and what action did that Minister take in respect of it?  Did they attempt to fend off the closure?  I was disappointed to hear the Minister of State indicate earlier that finding a replacement industry for the Krups plant in Limerick is the Government's top priority.  Does that mean that finding a replacement industry for the Mullingar plant is of less importance to the Government?</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the Government's attitude to the Tarkett situation, particularly when one considers that a senior Minister lives in the area.  It is surprising that she has not been able to persuade her colleagues in Cabinet to give top priority to finding a replacement industry for Mullingar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise for discussion in the House the catastrophe and devastation which has arisen in Mullingar and its environs following the recent announcement by Tarkett and Sommers AG to close its factory at Newbrook, Mullingar, resulting in the loss of 141 jobs.  Friday, 23 October 1998, was &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; for Mullingar. It will be forever etched on the memories of those employees who had given tremendously loyal and dedicated service to the company and many of whom had worked for the company since it was first established in the town.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the closure was one of seismic proportions, impacting as it did not only on the employees but also on the community and the economic environment.  When we think of the 141 employees, we must reflect on the human dimension.  Many are married and have families of varying ages.  Four to five people per job are directly affected as a result of this closure.  Up to 700 people are adversely affected by this unexpected, unwarranted announcement given the employees' contribution to the company's profitability.</P>
      <P>A factory of this nature and size generates many ancillary downstream activities.  There were numerous jobs in haulage contracting, contract cleaning, maintenance work, catering, painting and a huge number of suppliers locally and nationally.  It is easy to understand how another 100-150 jobs can be at risk.  It is known there is a real and substantial risk to some jobs in the services industry as a result of this shock announcement. An announcement of this nature in the run-up to Christmas is particularly poignant and painful and accentuates the harshness of this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken extensively within the past 48 hours with a large number of employees and their <Col N="1501" /> tales are representative of the stories of the workforce at large.  Many have substantial original mortgage commitments, others have remortgaged for refurbishment or renewal, to finance their children through third level colleges or to finance the purchase of a motor vehicle to get to their place of employment.  This factory has employees not only from Mullingar town, but from Delvin, Multyfarnham, Coole, Castlepollard, Collinstown, Raharney, The Downs, Milltownpass, Rochfortbridge, Ballynacarrigy and Miltown. Therefore, it was an important source of employment for Mullingar and north Westmeath.</P>
    <P>The workers embarked upon these additional commitments, fortified by the knowledge that an agreement had been reached as late as April 1988, in which 40 workers were voluntarily made redundant.  It was anticipated and widely expected that these rationalisation measures had placed the company in a position to grow and prosper.  The agreement had been the subject of a Labour Court determination.  Decisions were made by these families only six months ago on the legitimate expectation that they had made sacrifices and that the future of the company was secure.  The employees had shown themselves to be flexible and adaptable and responsive to the changes required.  Tarkett was one of the first companies in Ireland to adopt the world class manufacturing concept and to wholly embrace it.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear the workers and their trade unions have played a positive and constructive role in embracing what were difficult decisions for all concerned and undermines the fallacious arguments often used to malign the trade union influence in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The average rate of pay for these workers was about £260 per week.  Some of the workers earned more but, if so, it was because they worked overtime, premium shifts and generally worked the long hours required.</P>
    <P>The workers have told me that what is required is not expressions of sympathy and regret but a focus on practical and helpful measures to help them deal with the harsh reality that by Christmas some of those who have worked continuously at the factory for up to 21 years will be unemployed.</P>
    <P>The workers are particularly concerned about the following matters.  The average age of the workers is 42 but some are approaching 50 years of age and obviously it will be more difficult for them to secure future employment.  I understand FÁS will carry out a skills audit, with a view to providing the necessary courses to help in acquiring new skills or upgrading existing ones.</P>
    <P>There is the huge facility available, with up to 400,000 square feet under one roof.  This is one of the largest factory places in the country, located centrally, and with an excellent rail and road network available which means it is within one hour of Dublin and within easy reach of our airports and seaports.  There are excellent infrastructural facilities in close proximity.  The town is an excellent location with a well developed infrastructure, located on the Dublin corridor, and boasting a <Col N="1502" /> highly skilled and educated workforce, with a proven track record.</P>
    <P>There is one important issue which is of major concern to the workforce and it revolves around the taxation of severance payments which will be negotiated.  The first £10,000 of any lump sum is tax free and there is a further exemption of £500 per year of service, together with top slicing arrangements.  In a practical way the Government can help these people by increasing the exemption limits significantly in the forthcoming budget. This is one of the most practical ways of helping workers whose jobs have been terminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude, if the Minister will allow me.  Many of the employees will use the lump sums negotiated to discharge mortgages, car loans and third level college commitments while others will embark on the road to self-employment which will necessitate the availability of seed capital so the amount of any negotiated severance payment available will be extremely important.  Will the Minister ensure adjustments are made in the forthcoming budget in relation to the taxation of severance payments?</P>
      <P>Like many people, I was delighted the Minister responded positively to our request to set up an inter-agency group or task force but shocked at the failure to include either a member of Westmeath county development team or a member of Westmeath County Council &mdash; the premier body in the county &mdash; which played a major development role in the provision of infrastructural facilities throughout the county.</P>
      <P>The acting county manager at a special meeting of the council on Monday, 2 November 1998, showed how responsive the executive of the council can be and illustrated the folly of not including a member of the executive of the council on the inter-agency group.</P>
      <P>The positive actions undertaken by Westmeath County Council, include the immediate commencement of development within the next week of 15-17 small sites on Clonmore industrial estate, which comprises approximately 12 acres, and a clear indication from the council executive that planning applications in respect of such sites which will provide employment, will be fast tracked.</P>
      <P>The council has called a special meeting of the county development team for Friday next.  I understand executives from the IDA will be invited to what we hope will be a positive discussion.</P>
      <P>Westmeath County Council is prepared to explore the idea of the development of a business park in Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what you have said and I hope I did not go over the limit.  Tarkett Ireland Limited which has been based in Mullingar for more than 21 years, had been a valuable employer and had made an excellent contribution to the economic development of Mullingar and its environs.  I regret Tarkett Sommer AG decided to close the Mullingar plant.  However, the collapse of the Eastern European market for floor coverings and the company's decision to significantly restructure its operations, has regrettably resulted in the decision to close the Mullingar plant with the loss of 130 jobs.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has established an inter-agency group to formulate an adequate response to the closure of the Tarkett plant in Mullingar.  The purpose of the inter-agency group is to examine and respond to the needs of employees of Tarkett Ireland Limited and look at ways for priority action on job creation in Mullingar.  The interagency group will be chaired by Mr. Frank Conlon, area director, IDA Ireland and comprise representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, Westmeath County Enterprise Board along with representatives of Tarkett Ireland Limited. It is clear from recent experience that speedy progress can be made by ensuring that agency representatives make face to face contact and identify their respective tasks in the follow-up to significant plant closures.  The inter-agency group had its first meeting on 29 October 1998.  The terms of reference for the group are: to secure alternative job creating enterprise both from overseas and indigenous investors to Mullingar, with particular regard to the location of a new industry in Tarkett's existing facility; to provide an immediate skills assessment and suitable training opportunities for the affected workers; and to provide the necessary information and assistance to any employees who may wish to establish their own enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the inter-agency group will brief public representatives, public bodies, local business interests, the Westmeath partnership and other community bodies on the inter-agency group's approach to its work.  It is important that <Col N="1504" /> the group and individual agencies co-operate with the appropriate trade unions representing the workforce and with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and local business and community interests in providing advice and support to redundant workers and in promoting Mullingar as a location for new investment.  The Tánaiste has asked the chairman of the interagency group to liaise with public, private sector and community bodies which can assist in promoting the area for investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>Action will be facilitated by the designation of Westmeath as one of the four areas in the country covered by a territorial employment pact which ensures close co-ordination of all development agencies and community interests.  During her recent visit to Mullingar, the Tánaiste met representatives of company management, SIPTU, and workers as well as members of the interagency group.  The regional managers of the industrial development agencies have informed the Government of their plans to put in place a focused marketing programme to highlight the availability of Tarkett's existing facility and the attractiveness of Mullingar as an industrial base.  I have arranged for FÁS, in conjunction with union representatives and Westmeath County Enterprise Board, to commence an immediate intervention programme to provide assistance to employees, i.e. job seeking skills, interview techniques, early retirement advice, investment opportunities, CV services and counselling, establish the skills pool which is available to new investment; and assess skills of workers to be laid off and assist employees with training and retraining, identification of job opportunities, job skills requirements and opportunities for self employment. The inter-agency group will have some immediate and more medium-term activities to oversee.</P>
    <P>Neither the sourcing of a new replacement industry &mdash; or more practically the sourcing of a mix of new small industries to occupy the available facilities &mdash; nor the provision of a tailormade programme to address the retraining and alternative employment options for the Tarkett workforce can be delivered rapidly.  On previous experience it takes 18 months to see this type of agenda to completion.</P>
    <P>While the full delivery of the terms of reference of the group may take some time, the inter-agency group will keep the Tánaiste and her Department informed of progress and identify activity which can be delivered in phases.  I expect an interim report on the organisation and delivery of the FÁS intervention programme will be submitted in early 1999.</P>
    <P>I confidently anticipate the work of this inter-agency group will be concluded in a successful and satisfactory manner.  I listened with great interest to the two Deputies and I will convey their sentiments and requests to the Minister.  We will see what we can do to facilitate their requests because we want to avail of all available expertise to fill the vacuum created by this unfortunate <Col N="1505" /> closure.

      <P>One would want to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the scenes of damage and devastation in Skibbereen at the <Col N="1506" /> weekend.  I want to help the people affected to pick up the threads of their lives after their terrible experience.  Approximately 70 to 80 families were affected by a flood about which they had no warning.  Damage was caused to many homes and premises.  Rain started to fall at 5 a.m. and continued for a long time thereafter; it was a traumatic experience for those affected.</P>
      <P>My main objective in raising this matter on the Adjournment is to seek to have the necessary mechanisms to ensure this will not happen again put in place immediately.  Emergency funding must be made available to achieve that objective. I am not in a position to say what is necessary to ensure there will not be a repetition of what happened over the weekend.  A preliminary investigation has been carried out.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Skibbereen, my home town, to lend solidarity to the people in their distress and to try to find out what caused the flooding and what should be done about it.  Some engineers on the scene advised that an interim flood relief scheme is necessary.  I would like the Government to immediately provide the necessary funding to put in place such a scheme.  That may require a report from a firm of consulting engineers, but that could be obtained quickly.  I want the Government to give a commitment to provide whatever funding is necessary to ensure there is not a repetition of what happened in Skibbereen over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Many people suffered damage to their properties as a result of the flooding.  I do not want to get into the legalities involved, but the flooding damaged carpets and furniture in many homes. There is an obligation on the Government to indicate that compensation will be made available to those affected.  Many of them are not covered by insurance for such damage.</P>
      <P>There is a history of flooding from the river in that area, but there has not been flooding since a major scheme was put in place a few years ago. The flooding over the weekend came from a different source and should not have happened. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the Government to come to the assistance of the people affected in their hour of need.  I appeal to the Government to commit the necessary funds for an emergency interim flood relief scheme and to indicate that compensation will be made available to those who were so badly affected by the flood damage over the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to speak to the House on the unfortunate flooding incident in Skibbereen last weekend.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this important item and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Members will join in extending sincere sympathy to all of those who were affected by the terrible flooding.  The Skibbereen area experienced approximately 160 mm of rainfall <Col N="1507" /> in the last two weeks of October and up to 40 mm of rain fell in the 24 hour period preceding the flood.  Deputies will appreciate that the immediate concern locally has been to identify the cause of the flooding and to give early assistance to those affected.  The emergency services were called in and helped to sandbag premises and pump flood water from affected properties.  I express our appreciation of the prompt action of the emergency services in dealing with the emergency. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has asked the local authority for a report on the matter, and this is awaited. However, the Department's inspector for the area has been in contact with local authority officials.</P>
    <P>I understand the flooding occurred as a result of debris lodged in a culvert on the Assolas River which caused a blockage and water to back up stream in the culvert.  Local authority personnel broke into the culvert at a number of locations and freed the blockage.  This allowed the flood waters to subside quickly.  A number of other actions are also being undertaken.  A closed circuit television survey of the culvert is being arranged.  I also understand that council crews are examining the upper sections of the river with a view to removing any debris which might pose a further threat.  The installation of temporary screening is also being pursued.  These actions are being undertaken in the short-term to prevent further recurrence of flooding from the Assolas River.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> A preliminary report on the Skibbereen main drainage scheme, which incorporates flood relief measures, was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in 1993. However, following submission of the preliminary report, the national sludge strategy study identified Skibbereen as a hub-centre for the west Cork region and Cork County Council was advised that the implications of this would have to be taken into account in the design of the Skibbereen treatment works.  The council recently submitted a brief for the appointment of consultants to undertake this review and the Department is in correspondence with it about this.</P>
    <P>Last weekend's flooding incident was not due to the absence of flood relief measures in the 1993 report.  However, it will be necessary to review the flood relief elements of that proposal in the light of developments which have occurred since 1993, such as the commencement of construction of the by-pass road from the Cork Road to the Schull Road, and development which has taken place in the town which may have impinged on sewer runs and-or increased surface water run-off.</P>
    <P>The recent flooding occurred because of a blockage in the existing culvert.  The question of funding for works required to alleviate flooding risk will be considered when the necessary reports and recommendations from the local authority are to hand.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 November 1998.</P>

      <P>In general, I and my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, have continued the line adopted by our predecessors of being generally supportive of the Commission's proposals for the introduction of the European Company Statute.  In this context, it has to be remembered that the EU proposal contains two separate but interrelated instruments, namely a regulation which contains the company law framework for the Statute Company and a directive dealing with the issue of employee involvement.</P>
      <P>My perception is that while there has not been an overwhelming demand from Irish business for the introduction of the concept of a European Company Statute, no doubt if it were to become available, it is something that would be seriously looked at by business to see whether it would better help them conduct their business in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland has played its full part in the negotiations on the proposal; the main difficulty is the Draft Directive on Employee Involvement.  The Austrian Presidency is seeking political agreement in the Social and Labour Council on 2 December next on three main policy issues: agreement to worker participation by the management of the companies forming an SE; protection for minority participation rights; and protection of participation rights where a European company is formed by conversion of a nationally registered plc.</P>
      <P>Ireland is playing a pro-active role in the search for a compromise.  All member states are negotiating on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</P>

      <P>An independent evaluation of the local employment service was <Col N="1510" /> completed recently by the consultants Eustace Patterson.  This evaluation was wide-ranging and detailed in its analysis and officials in my Department are currently reviewing the contents in consultation with the LES areas with a view to assessing how best to progress the recommendations. The evaluation report has been circulated to all LES areas and relevant partnership companies and copies are available in my Department to all interested parties.</P>
      <P>Clearly there should be better integration between the two main arms of the employment services, the FÁS service and the LES.  In this connection, the national employment action plan, adopted by the Government in April this year, outlined a major reorientation and strengthening of our employment services which would focus and integrate the roles of FÁS and the local employment service, while preserving the local dimension of each LES and ensuring that the role of partnerships in the LES remains undiminished. My Department is currently meeting with relevant interests, through the local employment service policy advisory committee to examine the options in relation to the best model which should be adopted in terms of the overall organisational framework and I hope to be in a position to take a decision on this in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, in so far as the enhanced employment services are concerned, both FÁS and the local employment service will have sufficient financial and staffing resources available to ensure that their roles can be carried out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 92, 94 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Government support to enterprise must conform to the limits set by the EU regional aid guidelines, the latest version of which will come into effect, generally, in January, 2000.</P>
      <P>At present the development agencies can offer assistance to enterprises of up to 57 per cent of investment costs in the non-designated areas, up to 71 per cent in the designated areas and up to 75 per cent in Gaeltacht areas.  In practice, of course, the assistance offered is well below these limits.</P>
      <P>Under the latest EU regulations, Ireland will be treated as comprising 8 Article 92(3)(c) regions (our regional authority areas) and each will have a ceiling on the aid which can be offered to enterprise.  The limit for each area will depend on its GDP/unemployment rate, but may not exceed 20 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs.  Not only is the Commission limiting aid payable across the Union to curb harmful competitive bidding between member states, but the new rules reflect Ireland's much improved economic status, i.e., we are no longer one of the poorest areas of the EU.</P>

      <P>The EU Social Policy Commissioner informed the Social and Labour Affairs Council on 27 October of his intention to make a proposal to the Commission in this area.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the Commission has not taken decisions on any such proposal.  Consequently, there is no draft directive on employee information and consultation as implied in the question.  I do not want to speculate at this stage on what decisions the Commission may take, or on whether its decisions are imminent or not. However, I can say that a draft directive in this area would clearly merit careful consideration at national level, including consultation with the social partners and other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a general note it is my view that consideration of EU social policy initiatives must include an assessment of their likely impact on investment in enterprise and jobs.  Also, regard must be had to whether initiatives in any specific area are <Col N="1512" /> best taken at national rather than EU level.  In Ireland we already have action to encourage partnership for competitive enterprise, including employee information and consultation, in Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 58, 100 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The company was scheduled to make an announcement on 14 September 1998 about plans for its operations in Donegal.  This decision was deferred pending further review by Fruit of the Loom of its plans.</P>
      <P>Representatives from IDA Ireland met recently with senior executives from European Operations of Fruit of the Loom to discuss the company's immediate plans for the Irish operation, and to clarify any matters relating to IDA Ireland.  The company confirmed that there will be no redundancies between now and the end of 1998.  The IDA has written to the company in relation to grant liability issues and I expect further meetings to be scheduled in the short-term between IDA and the company with a view to reaching a satisfactory outcome to the situation. Clearly my overriding concern continues to be to maximise the number of jobs in Fruit of the Loom in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 September 1998, I launched the Donegal Employment Initiative.  This group was established to offset and compensate for the immediate <Col N="1513" /> risk of job losses at the Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal.</P>
    <P>This initiative is focusing immediate priority attention on Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creating investment. The work of the Task Force is important in accelerating the attraction of additional industry and business to Donegal.</P>
    <P>To date, the Task Force has had two meetings and is exploring a number of suggestions in relation to infrastructure i.e. telecommunications, electricity and air access.  The Task Force model has proved effective in other major closure situations, for example in Clonmel and Killala, and I am hopeful that the endeavours of the Donegal Employment Initiative will have similar positive results.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland is active in raising awareness among its clients regarding the need for planning and preparation for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Currency fluctuations are a constant feature of international trade and Enterprise Ireland works with individual companies engaged in international trade to ensure that they have taken the necessary steps to cover themselves against possible losses.</P>

Given that ongoing survey results indicate that small companies are under prepared, the focus of this group is regionally based small business.</P>
      <P>A number of specific initiatives have been introduced by Enterprise Ireland to help companies with their EMU preparations.  These include, the provision of a euromentor through which a trained mentor is allocated to a company to work through the issues and advise on stragetic and operational problems, the development of a software tool to ascertain companies sensitivity to sterling/other currency fluctuations and the former Irish Trade Board publication on EMU for exporters has been widely circulated.</P>

      <P>Together with my colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and commerce, I announced the establishment of a working group on company law compliance and enforcement on 7 August 1998.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the working group is to advise on improving compliance with and enforcement of company law, and, in particular, to review the compliance arrangements and enforcement regimes for company law; to evaluate the legislative, organisational and resource issues affecting compliance and enforcement; to examine and identify the resources and structures necessary to achieve a more frequent updating of companies legislation; and to make appropriate recommendations to address these issues.</P>
      <P>The group was requested to report by 30 November 1998.</P>
      <P>No interim reports have been submitted by the group.  The group is proceeding with their work with a view to submitting its report by the set deadline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the Year 2000 Business Awareness Campaign I have been emphasising all along that this is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their particular systems and to determine the solution.  It is important that Irish businesses address the issue as the cost of ignoring the problem could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem at this stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the Government cannot solve the problem for businesses.  Where the Government can help is in raising awareness of the issue and by providing guidelines to businesses to help them tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>In May last, I launched a business awareness campaign with which I am personally involved.  A comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it has been circulated to over 100,000 businesses throughout the country, both directly and indirectly through industrial development agencies, county and city enterprise boards and chambers of commerce.  I arranged to have copies of this brochure circulated to all Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>In addition, a series of seven regional public meetings have been held to highlight awareness of the problem.  I have personally impressed on participants at these meetings the urgency of the need to address the issue.  In September the Taoiseach addressed a one day National Conference on the Year 2000 Computer Problem in UCD at which this message was repeated and developed by some international speakers.  This conference was attended by approximately 600 people, many of them from small businesses.  The regional meetings and the conference received wide media coverage.</P>
      <P>A broad range of relevant business organisations and State agencies have agreed to support the Government's campaign and take part in a national advisory committee to oversee the campaign and advise me on appropriate action to counter the problem.  In addition we have secured commitments from groups which interact with small business on a daily basis, e.g. the banks, the accounting-auditing profession and insurance companies, that they will continue to press smaller and medium sized businesses to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some recent research on the level of compliance of Irish businesses has found that, while the business awareness campaign has resulted in a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is required.  I, along with the national advisory committee, am currently considering what further measures could be taken to assist <Col N="1516" /> Irish business, particularly small businesses, to actively engage this problem.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, initiated a review of the adequacy of contingency plans to deal with a major industrial dispute at Dublin Airport.  Aer Rianta requested that the review be extended to include other airports in the State, particularly Cork and Shannon, to which the Minister for Public Enterprise agreed.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I share the concerns of both the public and the Dáil in relation to the continuing high rate of accidents and fatalities in the construction sector.  However, I should point out that the Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>The approach which is taken to the management of occupational health and safety is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is the principal piece of legislation dealing with occupational health and safety.  It sets out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities which both employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment.  This Act is comprehensive in its application &mdash; it applies to all places of work and all employers, employees and self-employed are covered by this Act.</P>
      <P>The 1995 construction regulations implement a European Union directive concerning minimum safety and health requirements on construction sites.  These regulations constitute one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one specific industry.  The regulations introduce the concept of a chain of responsibility thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion, and they place very specific obligations on all the participants, i.e., clients, designers, contractors, employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Legislation, however, needs to be enforced in a targeted and structured manner if it is to be really effective.  Earlier this summer, I launched a new Construction Action Programme, drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority, and aimed specifically at addressing the health and safety situation in the construction sector.  This programme includes the setting up of a dedicated team of construction inspectors within the authority. This team is now operational and the inspectors have been targeting unsafe building sites.  I have also written to all my Government colleagues asking them to ensure that where public sector construction contracts are being awarded, the firm or contractor in question has a safety statement, as required under the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>In addition, the authority's advisory committee on construction safety, on which the key players in the construction industry are represented, is also actively seeking to address safety in the industry.  It has produced a code of practice and video on safe work with scaffolding which will be launched shortly.  It is also in the process of establishing sub-groups to consider the whole issue of consultation in the construction industry and to draw up improved guidelines for clients on their responsibilities for safety on their sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> I have also recently sanctioned the recruitment of an extra 13 staff to the Health and Safety Authority.  This is in addition to the seven previously sanctioned for this year and is a total increase of 20 personnel or 18 per cent.  This is an indication of the firm commitment of this Government to protecting the health and safety of our workforce.</P>
    <P>The total staff complement in the authority will now be 132, a significant boost to the resources of the authority.  This will put it in a better position to meet the ever increasing demands being placed upon it and to continue to approach all of its work in a targeted and structured manner.</P>
    <P>In addition, I recently met with trade union and employer representative bodies in order to discuss my concerns on the issue of construction site safety.  At these meetings, both sides outlined to me the considerable extent of the activities which they themselves have undertaken to promote safety on building sites.  Over 8,500 construction workers have received on-site training under the auspices of the construction safety mobile training unit.  The unit is sponsored by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Construction Industry Federation, the Health and Safety Authority and FÁS and is an excellent example of the value and benefit of a co-operative partnership approach to a shared concern.</P>
    <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally good legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety.  It is enforced in a targeted and pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority.  It is complemented by the commitment and activities of the social partners. What I would like to see, however, is a stronger promotion at individual site level of the approach to safety which is espoused by the national representative bodies of the social partners.  Where legal obligations are not being adhered to nor forthcoming on a voluntary basis they will be pursued by the Health and Safety Authority in the courts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to remind the Deputy that I have already asked the board of the authority to conduct a general review of the 1989 legislation in the context of the tenth anniversary of its enactment and I look forward to the outcome of that review in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment is measured by the new quarterly national household survey which replaced the annual labour force survey.  Unemployment figures from the new survey, relating to December 1997-February 1998 and March 1998-May 1998, quarters will not be available until the end of November 1998. However, figures for County Tipperary, as recorded by the CSO live register area analysis for September 1998, are available.  While the live register is not designed to measure unemployment, <Col N="1521" /> figures for County Tipperary show an overall decrease of 2.6 per cent in numbers on the register in the year to September 1998.  The register shows a decrease of 10.9 per cent in the number of males and an increase of 12.1 per cent in the number of females.</P>
      <P>I have already taken steps to address the unemployment issues in Tipperary.  The Clonmel task force was established in December 1997, with its principal focus being to try to find a replacement industry following the closure of Seagate.</P>
      <P>On 6 July 1998, I announced Guidant Corporation's intention to establish a medical device project in the former Seagate building which will create 518 new jobs at full production.  Over 150 of these jobs are expected to be created within the next year.</P>
      <P>South County Tipperary has suffered in the past two years with the closure of two other overseas companies &mdash; Tambrands in Tipperary town and Schiesser in Carrick-on-Suir.  However, with the efforts of the agencies, overseas replacement industries were found for both Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, Clonmel Healthcare announced a 200 job expansion to its already existing 184 workforce.  .</P>
      <P>A 20,000 sq.  ft.  advance factory is being constructed on the IDA Ireland site in Cashel and is near completion.</P>
      <P>A number of enterprise centres have/are being established in the county.  Enterprise Ireland grant assisted an enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir last year and approved a feasibility study grant for a community group located in a 5,000 sq.  ft.  building which was donated by Tambrands to the town of Tipperary.  Enterprise Ireland recently approved £100,000 grant assistance towards a new enterprise centre in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>This centre comprises seven units of 1,000 sq. ft.  each, three of which are under negotiation for a project to employ 30 people, mainly female.</P>
      <P>South Tipperary County Enterprise Board has assisted 12 former employees of Seagate starting their own businesses and a further 12 employees have found employment in or are promoting projects for which the board has provided direct financial assistance.</P>
      <P>Last June, Shannon Development launched its enterprise development strategy 1998-2000 document which contains future plans for North Tipperary. Of particular note is the refurbishment of a 37,000 sq.  ft.  industrial unit at Stradovoher Industrial Estate.  This unit is being promoted to overseas companies by IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development has established a joint working group with the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, TRBDI, which will enable it to work out strategies and action programmes for initiating a range of development activities, both within the immediate Thurles campus site and in the wider north Tipperary area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Development also plans to develop a site at Bawntameena, Thurles as a high-tech <Col N="1522" /> enterprise centre.  The location of this site, opposite the TRBDI, will facilitate its promotion.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these initiatives, many of which are already under way, will lead to greater employment in Tipperary as a whole and will make a definite contribution to increasing the number of women being employed in the country.</P>

      <P>The background to this matter was outlined in my reply of 30 June 1998 [Official Report, volume 493, No. 3, cols. 597-598].  In January of this year I authorised an officer of my Department to examine the books and documents of four companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.  The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd.  and Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd.  I extended his remit on 9 June last to include the examination of the books and documents of Kentford Securities Ltd.  an Irish-registered company which was dissolved in May 1995.</P>
      <P>Since I last replied to questions on this matter the authorised officer has obtained a significant quantity of further documentation from Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited.  The officer and his staff have also examined the substantial documentation received from Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Hamilton Ross Company Ltd. and have interviewed officers of the entities which are the subject of his inquiries.  These investigations are continuing.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990 precludes me from providing any information relating to the bodies subject to section 19 investigations, other than in certain specified circumstances.  These circumstances, which are set out in section 21(1) relate, <i>inter alia,</i> to where criminal proceedings are being instituted pursuant to or arising from the Companies Acts; to the institution of criminal proceedings arising from or pursuant to the Exchange Control Acts; or for the purposes of proceedings relating to an application to enter and search premises.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 84, 88, 135 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any contravention of competition or merger law by any party to a merger notified to me under the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996.  Only mergers which exceed the relevant thresholds set out in the mergers legislation are required to be notified to me for clearance.  Larger scale mergers or takeovers which exceed the thresholds specified in the EU merger regulation, and which have a community dimension as defined by the merger regulation, are notifiable to the EU Commission which has jurisdiction in those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> All of the commitments given to my predecessor by Tesco are being monitored closely by my Department and Enterprise Ireland.  I am satisfied that the commitments relating to the establishment of a head office in Ireland and the sourcing of as many Irish products as possible are being honoured.  I wish to assure the Deputies that Tesco Ireland continues to meet with Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia to ensure that the Irish supply base is given every opportunity to achieve its potential.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland was recently informed that almost all of the Irish manufactured products which were listed by Hayes, Cunningham and Robinson (HRC) prior to the take over by Boots are still on the shelves of the former HCR shops. Those products which were removed were taken off because they did not fit the profile of the Boots range.  Since arriving in the Irish market, Boots has made contact with Enterprise Ireland with a view to identifying the opportunities for sourcing Irish supplied products.  In this regard, it is expected that a number of Irish manufactured products will be stocked in all Boots stores in the Republic of Ireland in the new year and not just in the former HCR shops.  The takeover of HCR by Boots was not notifiable to me under the Mergers Acts.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, Enterprise Ireland launched its supplier development programme with a view to assisting Irish companies to respond to the changes which are taking place in the retail sector and to exploit new opportunities arising.  To date, 26 companies have expressed an interest in the programme.  Of these, four are now at the implementation phase where training and development of staff with specific improvement projects is being addressed.  The remaining companies are being assessed as regards the suitability for strategic change.</P>

      <P>I have furnished the report of the authorised officer to the High Court inspectors appointed to investigate the affairs of NIB and NIBFS, to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Revenue Commissioners for whatever action they deem is appropriate.  The DPP's office and the Revenue Commissioners have sought further documentation and information from the authorised <Col N="1525" /> officer.  The authorised officer, whose investigation is formally completed, has given the DPP's office and Revenue Commissioners every assistance in that regard.</P>
      <P>On 30 March 1998 the High Court appointed Messrs.  John Blayney and Tom Grace as inspectors to the National Irish Bank Ltd.  and the same persons as inspectors to National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.  on 15 June 1998.  The inspectors are answerable to the court for the performance of their duties.  Certain of the staff of National Irish Bank have appealed the ruling of the High Court, which determined that the staff were obliged to answer such questions as were put to them by the inspectors.  This hearing is pending.  Given these developments it is not possible to indicate the date for receipt of the final report of the inspectors.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy in relation to industrial location is to encourage investors, via the industrial development agencies, to locate their investments in areas which need them taking account of the investors' own requirements. The locational aspects of industrial development require a strong co-operative approach between the industrial development agencies, the local authorities and infrastructure-service providers. For their part, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development offer various incentives to accomplish this task including enhanced grant packages, particularly in designated areas; stimulating construction programmes of modern advance factories and business parks at key locations with private sector involvement; working closely with local authorities to make available quality serviced sites; and working with local communities and development agencies to improve their areas so that these areas are more competitive and attractive to potential investors and capable of competing strongly against similar European locations for possible investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies participate, as appropriate, in various local initiatives such as special task forces, details of which are furnished in reply to a separate question by Deputy Creed on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>There are five task forces operating at present, which I established, namely the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, the Leitrim Enterprise Project Group, the Donegal Employment Initiative and the Mullingar and Limerick Inter Agency Groups.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative are to make proposals and to advise me on the options that remain to secure the future of the Killala plants as synthetic fibre manufacturing operations; the replacement industry-industries being located in the North Mayo area including those which can utilise the Asahi premises and workforce; steps necessary to assist local suppliers and sub-contractors and who are facing loss of business; assisting Asahi workers in such areas as career change training, retraining, job search and enterprise; supporting local SMEs to expand, including the possibility of incentives for employment of ex-Asahi employees; and such other matters arising out of the situation of north Mayo as the initiative may determine.</P>
      <P>The initiative has worked relentlessly in the pursuit of employment opportunities for the region.  I am delighted to say that since the establishment of the initiative on 10 July 1997 I have announced many new jobs for the region, including the following:</P>

    <P>These projects are making a significant direct contribution to the region's economy as well as creating additional spin-off employment arising from sub-supply opportunities.  The Coca-Cola project alone will create over 1,000 jobs during its construction phase.</P>
    <P>I also announced that FÁS is to support the establishment of an auto-turning training centre in Ballina in conjunction with the industry. Location of the centre in Ballina is a major boost for the long-term job creating prospects of the region and was a recommendation of the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative.</P>
    <P>In relation to the former Asahi facility, IDA Ireland is continuing to work closely with the new owners, UPE Inc., in marketing the complex to suitable chemical companies.  Six major chemical companies in the carbon fibre business have visited the site with varying levels of interest.  IDA Ireland also continues to promote the advance factory at Bunree Industrial Estate and has identified a 25 acre site suitable for development as a high quality business park.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> In relation to a further recommendation of the initiative, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has approved funding for the provision of a main drainage scheme for Killala Road and Swinford Road, Ballina, which is expected to open up over 160 acres of land for development purposes.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the initiative has informed me that its work to date has been extremely rewarding, concentrating the minds of all, not alone on the needs, but also on the resources that are available to help fashion a successful future for the area.  The initiative is continuing to work on the implementation of its proposals in conjunction with State agencies and local community interests, where appropriate, and I look forward to learning of further progress made in the pursuit of its objectives.</P>
    <P>The Leitrim Enterprise Project Group was established on 20 April 1998 in the wake of the closure of Ballinamore Textiles Ltd.  The terms of reference are: assessment of the skills of the labour force in County Leitrim; provision of training and retraining opportunities of the labour force; marketing of County Leitrim for direct foreign investment; encouraging indigenous business opportunities in the county; highlighting the availability of the industrial development sites throughout County Leitrim; providing encouragement to those who wish to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in their own right; maximising the potential to the county of the urban renewal scheme and the new pilot rural renewal scheme; and assessing the local infrastructural needs and liaising with the relevant State authorities.</P>
    <P>The Leitrim Enterprise Project Group has recently submitted its interim report, which contains a number of wide-ranging recommendations. I am pursuing these recommendations with my relevant Government colleagues and with the State agencies who are working on their implementarion.  With over 50 recommendations, the interim report presents a very broad agenda for the development of County Leitrim.  Clearly, some of the recommendations could only be implemented over the longer term.  I have asked the group to focus on prioritising and implementing those recommendations which would have the greatest impact in terms of industrial development employment creation.</P>
    <P>In response to employment difficulties being experienced in County Donegal and, in particular, the immediate risk of job losses at Fruit of the Loom plants.  I established the Donegal Employment Initiative on 16 September 1998.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for the Donegal Employment Initiative are to assess and recommend the most appropriate responses to offset and compensate for the immediate risks to jobs in particular areas of Donegal; and to draw up a set of priority actions for establishing Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job-creating investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> Since its establishment, the task force has met on two occasions and has agreed a programme of work to ensure that urgent action is taken to complete the tasks it has been assigned under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last, 29 October, I announced the establishment of a special Inter Agency Group to examine and respond to the needs of employees of Tarkett Ireland Ltd.  and look at ways for further action on job creation in Mullingar.  The Inter Agency Group will be chaired by Mr. Frank Conlon, area director, IDA Ireland, and comprise representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the Westmeath County Enterprise Board along with representatives of Tarkett Ireland Ltd.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for the group will be to secure alternative job creating enterprise both from overseas and indigenous investors to Mullingar with particular regard to the location of a new industry in Tarkett's existing facility; to provide an immediate skills assessment and suitable training opportunities for the affected workers; and to provide the necessary information and assistance to any employees who may wish to establish their own enterprises.</P>
    <P>On 30 October I announced an Interagency Response Group to address the issues that will arise for workers made redundant by the closure of Krups of Limerick and who seek to find new employment.  It will focus on finding replacement industry and jobs as well as on addressing the retraining needs of redundant workers.</P>

I further note that the council proposes a strategic review of revenues in order to prevent deficits in future.  Earlier this year, I met the CAI to identify any means by which I might be able to assist them to cope with difficulties following the ceasing of financial supports by the European Commision.  I assured the association that my Department would be pleased to work with them with a view to ensuring that their current difficulties are not repeated in 1999 and I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs gave a similar assurance. I also wrote to Commissioner Bonino, who has responsibility for consumer matters, requesting her support for the restoration of financial support to the Consumers Association of Ireland. She recently indicated that she would be prepared to re-examine the situation if her directorate's budgetary situation so allowed and if no alternative solution could be found for funding the CAI this year.  Since my meeting with the CAI and correspondence with the European Commission, my Department and the Director of Consumer Affairs have been in touch with the association with a view to further assisting as possible.</P>

While the content of the officer's report is confidential, I have furnished copies of the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the High Court inspectors appointed to investigate the affairs of National Irish Bank Ltd.  and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.  and to the Revenue Commissioners for whatever action they deem appropriate.  The only State expenditure incurred by the section 59 inquiry was in paying the normal salary costs of departmental officials associated with the investigation.</P>
      <P>Mr. John Blayney, a retired Supreme Court judge, and Mr. Tom Grace, FCA, have been appointed by the High Court as inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, to investigate the affairs of National Irish Bank Ltd.  and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.  The cost to date of these investigations is £474,511. Having regard to the fact that certain aspects of the inspectors' work will shortly be the subject of an appeal before the Supreme Court, it is not possible at this stage to estimate accurately what the final cost will be.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that the cost of an investigation by an inspector appointed by the High Court shall be defrayed in the first instance by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, the court may direct that any person, being <i>inter alia</i> a company dealt with in the inspectors' report, shall be liable to repay that Minister the costs incurred to such extent as the High Court directs.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to request the High Court in due course to seek the full recoupment of the significant costs of this investigation.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the 1990 Act provides that the publication of any inspector's report is a matter for decision by the High Court.  It would be my hope that the court will exercise its discretion in favour of publication in due course.</P>

      <P>In line with commitments in Partnership 2000, I can assure the Deputy that both I and my colleagues in Government are fully committed to the principle of lifelong learning.  This commitment is evidenced by the wide range of measures we are pursuing in this area with the involvement of relevant agencies and the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> As the national training authority FÁS is playing a key role in promoting lifelong learning. Some examples of relevant FÁS initiatives include the training support scheme which is specifically aimed at enhancing skills levels in enterprises; the excellence through people initiative which aims to reward and publicise best practice in training; and evening courses which are run by FÁS on a fee paying basis at its training centres throughout the country.  A wide range of courses are provided, generally of ten to 12 weeks duration.  These courses provide training and skills upgrading opportunities for people who are unable to attend the normal day time courses.</P>
    <P>A key goal for Enterprise Ireland is to work with employers to develop key business functions such as training and thus enhance their competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently working with the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC) to establish a new training networks programme which aims to facilitate and encourage employers to increase and enhance human resource development in their businesses.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, is also directing the policy of his Department towards lifelong learning.  The forthcoming Green Paper on Adult Education will provide the basis for wide-ranging consultation and debate on the future development of the adult education sector within a framework of lifelong learning.  I would also refer to the wide range of part-time courses on offer in third level institutions and in second and further education schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>In the area of fiscal policy, section 476 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief on approved courses in information technology and foreign languages.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the area of European Union actions, I would refer to the Leonardo da Vinci programme in vocation education and training.  In addition to promoting the development of language and other skills aimed at increasing mobility within the European labour market, the programme also aims to promote training and education which will facilitate industrial and technological change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of the autonomy of an ombudsman is the cornerstone of any ombudsman scheme whether privately or publicly funded. This is essential in order that such schemes have the complete confidence and allegiance of all those who use them and of the public in general whose interest they serve.  The former insurance ombudsman, in her presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business in July, expressed her views of difficulties that had arisen in the administration of the insurance ombudsman scheme and which, in her view, were militating against its effectiveness as an independent and fully transparent office.  At the same time the success of the insurance ombudsman scheme as an alternative and costeffective dispute resolution service was recognised. The former insurance ombudsman confirmed that it provided an invaluable service to the consumer and that, in developing jurisprudence through the adjudication process, her decisions had the impact of changing existing sales practices within insurance companies to the benefit of the policyholder.  She estimated that access to the alternative dispute resolution procedure under the scheme had saved the parties involved the equivalent of £34 million to £35 million in legal fees over a five year period.  It is particularly regrettable, therefore, that difficulties should have arisen in the administration of the scheme and it is important that the concerns expressed by the former insurance ombudsman, the Joint Oireachtas Committees and by individual Members of this House and of the Seanad be addressed in a constructive and expeditious manner. I am also mindful that the newly appointed insurance ombudsman, Ms Caroline Gill, must be given time to form her own views of her role and the degree of autonomy that is appropriate to the discharge of the ombudsman function. <Col N="1533" /> As a follow-up to my previous discussions with representatives of the insurance ombudsman's council this year, I and my officials met with the council chairman and the insurance ombudsman on 28 October.  At that meeting there was a full and frank discussion of the specific issues presented by the former insurance ombudsman to the Oireachtas Joint Committees and the committee's concerns in that regard.  In the course of my discussions I indicated a number of changes to the council chairman which I considered were desirable to address the concerns of the Joint Oireachtas Committees.  The council chairman undertook to convey my views to the insurance ombudsman board and to revert to me as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As the former insurance ombudsman pointed out to the Joint Committee, the role of the insurance ombudsman is essentially that of adjudicator, not regulator.  The function of the ombudsman office is to resolve disputes between policyholders and insurance companies through mediation and, where necessary, adjudication which is binding on the insurance company involved but not on the policyholder.  The ombudsman's digest of cases adjudicated, as presented in her annual report, would indicate where a policyholder's complaint of mis-selling was upheld and this would provide an important source of information to the regulatory authority. Because of the importance of this aspect, I conveyed the view to the council chairman that the insurance ombudsman should have full autonomy in regard to the content of her annual report akin to the autonomy enjoyed by the Public Service Ombudsman in making his annual report.  I will await the response to my proposals for changes to the structure of the existing ombudsman scheme before giving consideration to the question of the necessity for introducing statutory provisions in relation to the existing scheme or replacing it with a statutory ombudsman scheme.  Consideration of the latter measure would obviously have to have regard to whatever proposals and recommendations emerge from the implementation group established recently by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to advise the Government on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector.  However, given these developments, I believe that it would not be appropriate at this time to proceed separately to introduce statutory provisions in relation to the existing insurance ombudsman scheme.</P>
      <P>The insurance ombudsman scheme forms an important part of the positive trend towards alternative dispute resolution procedures, for example, through voluntary methods of mediation and arbitration.  I am happy to say that a partnership approach is being adopted by two of our key social partners, IBEC and ICTU, with the encouragement and support of my Department, in establishing a voluntary mediation system to resolve occupational injury compensation claims in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is scope for evolution <Col N="1534" /> and development of the existing insurance ombudsman scheme.  While the scheme has served the policyholder well, difficulties have arisen which have tended to undermine public confidence in a scheme which is structured and operated by the insurance industry.  It is of paramount importance, therefore, that the industry address the structural defects that have given rise to these difficulties.  Above all, the insurance industry itself must be seen to restore public confidence in the scheme.  I am hopeful that my discussions with the insurance ombudsman's council will be fruitful in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>In response to employment difficulties being experienced in County Donegal and, in particular, the immediate risk of job losses at Fruit of the Loom plants, I established the Donegal Employment Initiative on 16 September 1998.</P>
      <P>The task force, which is chaired by the Donegal County Manager, includes representatives from the business community, relevant State agencies and Government Departments.  The work of the task force is very important to accelerate the attraction of additional industry and business to Donegal.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the task force are fairly broad and address the critical economic and employment development concerns outlined to me during an intensive round of meetings and plant visits in Donegal on 6 and 7 September 1998.  Since its establishment, the task force has met on two occasions and has agreed a programme of work to ensure that urgent action is taken to complete the tasks it has been assigned under its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The first task is to prepare a strategy to offset and compensate for the immediate risk of job losses at Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal. The task force decided to plan the establishment of support services for workers made redundant or who are at risk of losing their jobs, to examine the skills base and retraining needs of workers and to examine, in the areas suffering job losses, alternative employment possibilities and how to attract replacement industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> The second task is to establish Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creating investment.  The task force will pursue the identification of mobile job creating international companies in the IDA pipeline who are best suited to a Donegal location, including the incentives and services they would require to attract them here.  The provision of economic infrastructure, including air access, specific to the needs of prospective investors will also be pursued. A database of skill available in or to the county will also be prepared.</P>
    <P>The third task involves assisting the development agencies in selling Donegal locations to prospective investors.  The actions being taken in relation to this task include the identification of job creating investment opportunities in the fishing, food, tourism and other sectors.  Obstacles which exist to the realisation of job creating projects or to the identification and promotion of investment opportunities will be identified and addressed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the strategic planning being carried out by the task force on these issues, the industrial development agencies are pursuing a wide range of initiatives to assist industry in Donegal and the north west.</P>
    <P>While it is still early days since the establishment of the Donegal employment initiative, I expect that it will have positive results.</P>

      <P>While August 1998 exports to non-EU regions are down 2 per cent compared to August 1997, a one month movement is not a trend.  Monthly export values can oscillate very sharply, and those to non-EU destinations have done so in recent months.  For example, record monthly export values to the non-EU area have already been recorded this year in March and June.  The more relevant statistic is the year to date trend where, for the period January to August, non-EU exports have risen to 31 per cent relative to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Imports from the non-EU area were up by 23 per cent this August as compared to August last year.  The main contributor to this increase was a 32 per cent increase in imports of machinery and transport equipment.</P>
      <P>To put these figures in context, the record surpluses on our trade for the year to June (the latest available from the Central Statistics Office) show a trade surplus of £6.38 billion which is a remarkable 50 per cent of the same period last year.  This is a tremendous performance overall.</P>

The section in question, to be found on page 9 of the strategy statement, refers to constraints affecting the overall performance of my Department in achieving its strategic goals.

      <P>The changing patterns of competition for mobile international investment projects are reviewed on a regular basis.  Ireland's main competitors for foreign direct investment are other countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>Policies are being pursued to maximise the attractiveness of Ireland as a continuing desirable location for foreign and indigenous investment and to ensure that existing industry is competitive. In this context, particular emphasis with appropriate initiatives is being placed on addressing key competitiveness factors such as skills, costs, telecommunications and the information society.</P>
      <P>Ireland is particularly strong in the electronics and software sectors.  Our main competitive advantage here is our highly educated English speaking workforce.  Because of its conviction that development of our workforce is the best way to both attract and safeguard long-term investment for Ireland, the Government has recently announced an additional £250 million investment in education particularly aimed at the development of information technology and language skills.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recently concluded agreement between the Government and the European Commission which safeguards Ireland's low tax regime beyond the year 2010 will contribute substantially to maintaining Ireland's competitiveness for investment moving into Europe.</P>

      <P>Ireland has one of the highest levels of active labour market programmes in the EU, with most of these places targeted at the long-term unemployed. There is currently a ratio of one active labour market place for every two full-time unemployed persons in receipt of a payment on the live register.  I have no plans to change the proportionate scale of investment in active labour market programmes although there are compelling arguments to change the strategic mix of such programmes and to enhance their quality with a view to getting a better progression of participants to open labour market jobs, and I hope to bring forward proposals on these in the near future.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the employment action plan is not a zero sum game but an enhancement of our existing strategy.  Within FÁS there has been a very significant additional investment in the placement service which plays a key role in delivery of the plan.  At my urging there has also been a reprioritisation within FÁS of the needs of unemployed persons <i>vis-à-vis</i> persons who are not disadvantaged in labour market terms.</P>
      <P>The employment action plan has been implemented with effect from 1 September 1998. Under the plan the Government has adopted a preventative approach to unemployment, with early intervention to provide quality supports to jobseekers on the basis of their individual needs to assist them to get or progress towards an open labour market job.  In its first phase the preventative strategy is targeted at 18 to 25 year olds with a view to helping them secure a job or other employability support as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the activation strategy for young persons only came into effect on 1 September it is very early days yet to assess its efficacy yet but the employment action plan does appear to be impacting on the live register in a positive way. Of the potential September cohort reaching six <Col N="1539" /> months on the live register 363 persons or 32 per cent had signed off the live register by 16 October.  Some of these would, of course have signed off in the normal course but the incidence of signing off is notably higher.</P>
    <P>Specifically, up to 23 October 1998 there were 1,419 referrals of 18-25 year olds from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to FÁS for their guidance interview.  Of these, 605, or 43 per cent, did not attend and those cases are being followed up by D/SCFA. Of the remainder 632, or 45 per cent, have been interviewed and there are interview pending for the remaining 182, or 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of those persons interviewed, 57 have been placed in jobs, 55 placed in training, 61 referred to the local employment service and 136 referred to training.  Of the 55 in training, two are in apprenticeships, 43 in FÁS training, four with community employment schemes and six on workplace.  The guidance procedure with the remainder remains active.</P>

      <P>Government support to enterprise must conform to the limits set by the EU regional aid guidelines, the latest version of which will come into effect, generally in January 2000.  I have already outlined the details of these in my reply to Questions Nos. 54, 92, 94 and 105 today.</P>
      <P>With regard to the deprived urban areas mentioned by the Deputy, it is quite clear that the strong growth in employment in these areas has left many people unaffected, despite the very significant fall in unemployment, including long-term unemployment, in recent years.  Some years ago it could be argued that the main problem was a simple lack of jobs.  In present circumstances, it is quite clear that the main challenge is to ensure that people in deprived areas have the education, skills and development opportunities to avail of existing and future employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve progress in this area, it is necessary to tackle specific problems with the appropriate policy instruments.  There is nothing in the regional aid guidelines or in the Structural Fund regionalisation proposals which puts obstacles in the way of our tackling social problems, including unemployment, with a variety of the appropriate policy instruments, e.g., training.  These instruments will continue to qualify for cofinancing <Col N="1540" /> from the European Social Fund and will continue to benefit from very significant levels of Exchequer financing, regardless of their geographical location.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that a departmentmental examination was initiated by me on 26 June last into sales practices at Irish Life with particular reference to allegations of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; of life assurance policies.  The examination, which is ongoing, is to inquire into and to furnish a report on the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> (a) any evidence, or otherwise, as to the extent and the scope of the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; of life assurance policies by salesforce personnel operating in the State on behalf of Irish Life;</P>
    <P>(b) the encouragement-endorsement of management, or otherwise, and or the connivance by management, or otherwise, in the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; of life assurance policies by the company;</P>
    <P>(c) the actions taken by management in the company to prevent the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; wherever and whenever it occurred;</P>
    <P>(d) the actions taken by management, disciplinary or otherwise, against those involved in the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(e) the actions taken by management to compensate policyholders suffering losses as a result of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; activities; and</P>
    <P>(f) the action taken by management to institute appropriate compliance and enforcement procedures to deal with &ldquo;churning&rdquo; of policies.</P>
    <P>The examination is being carried out under the supervisory and regulatory authority of the Insurance Acts and regulations.  I would expect the completed report to make whatever recommendations for future action in this area as are deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>On the question of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; generally, I have also written to every life assurance company in the State and insurance industry representatives on the matter.  As regulator of the insurance industry, I have sought assurances that where evidence of sharp practice or abuse of customer vulnerability exists in individual companies, it will be dealt with immediately and effectively by company management at all levels.  The responses from individual companies indicate that the level of sophistication in uncovering and dealing with malpractice varies from company to company.  As a result it is considered that, at least on the question of &ldquo;churning&rdquo;, a standardised method for detecting and monitoring the problem should be instituted by the industry in general.  In that regard, I should like to take the opportunity to inform the House that the parliamentary draftsman's office in the Office of the Attorney General is currently examining my proposals to introduce life assurance transparency regulations.  The proposals address consumers' concerns for appropriate disclosure by insurance companies, agents and independent brokers of commission payments and sales remuneration and the risks and benefits associated with purchasing life assurance investment policies.  The proposals include such standardised provisions which will make it more difficult for persons to engage in &ldquo;churning&rdquo; in the future.</P>
    <P>In so far as the specific examination into Irish Life is concerned, given that the departmental examination has not yet been completed, definitive <Col N="1542" /> conclusions are not possible at this stage. However, from documentation examined to date, my Department has uncovered no evidence which indicates any endorsement or encouragement of the practice of &ldquo;churning&rdquo; by management within the company.  Departmental officials are continuing to examine, among other things, internal company audit reports, relevant memoranda, personnel records, complaints records, including processing of insurance ombudsman complaints and the extent of the rectification measures taken to date both at company and policy-holder level.</P>

      <P>There are at present two main types of European share ownership schemes in operation: the approved profit sharing scheme, or APSS, and the employee share ownership trust, or ESOT.  The 1998 Finance Act made further enhancements to the employee share ownership trust scheme.  My colleague the Minister for Finance is currently examining a number of proposals in relation to profit-sharing. The seed capital scheme which is designed to encourage entrepreneurial activity by employees in business start-ups, also seeks to encourage share ownership through tax relief for employee equity investment.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, pleased to see employee share ownership programmes facilitated and encouraged as far as possible.  Such programmes can have the effect of spreading and increasing investment in enterprise.  Employee share ownership can also encourage employee commitment to the development of enterprise and encourage co-operative management and employee relationships. The agreement Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness supports favourable tax treatment of employee share schemes and profit-sharing and encourages forms of financial involvement in the context of developing enterprise partnership.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a related question on 30 June 1998, when I intimated that the need for additional funding for enterprise boards did not arise at that time from the establishment of Enterprise Ireland.  In particular I emphasised on that occassion that the establishment of Enterprise Ireland would not alter the functions of the county enterprise boards, other than that there would be more clearly defined arrangements for the transfer of micro-enterprise projects &mdash; ten employees or fewer &mdash; between the new agency and the boards.</P>
      <P>These arrangements, which are in the process of being implemented, entail the identification of enterprise board clients which in time and with their likely growth potential could remain clients of Enterprise Ireland under the new arrangements; the transfer to the enterprise boards of former ABT-Forbairt clients which would more appropriately belong to the enterprise boards; and co-ordination of sectoral policies and displacement-deadweight criteria in the assessment of projects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>On Thursday I published the independent review of the community employment programme which was carried by Deloitte &amp; Touche. The review covers the integration option and the job option.  The job option is currently being converted into a rate for the job option, on a phased basis.  The pilot part-time job opportunities programme no longer exists, some of its features having been incorporated in the rate for the job option.  It would be timely to have an independent review of the jobs initiative next year as the first set of participants begin their third and final year.</P>
      <P>For the review of community employment Deloitte &amp; Touche were asked to evaluate the success of the programme in meeting its objectives; to consider its efficacy in the light of current and evolving labour market conditions; and to make proposals to improve the programme within existing resources.</P>
      <P>The key finding of the review is that community employment is largely meeting its objectives of providing job opportunities for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded and assisting participants to become job or progression-ready. The review makes a case for a substantial reduction in the numbers of places on the programme in the light of the current labour market, i.e., strong growth in employment, reduction in unemployment and long-term unemployment, and tightening labour market giving rise to recruitment difficulties in some sectors. The review further makes the point that any savings from a reduction in the size of CE should be used to provide both enhanced and additional preventative and reintegration labour market supports for long-term unemployed persons either within the proposed remodelled CE programme or through other labour market supports.</P>
      <P>The overall point emerging from the report is that for the investment currently made in community employment there could be a significantly better outcome for participants through directing some participants towards other active labour market programmes and through enhancing the training and market linkage elements of the remaining substantial number of places on the programme.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that the proposals in Deloitte &amp; Touche are discussed by and with the social partners.  I believe that we should give strategic consideration to the mix and quality of our active labour market programmes so that they progress participants towards jobs, and I believe this should be of paramount concern in related Partnership 2000 discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific regard to lone parents the report recommends a further dedicated review once sufficient <Col N="1545" /> data has been generated to allow an analysis of the current growing participation of lone parents on the scheme, which has risen from 4 per cent of participants in 1994 to 22 per cent at present.  It will be at least two years before a sufficient data base for this purpose will have built up.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations in Deloitte &amp; Touche is that 25 and not 21 should be the minimum age for eligibility to participate in a CE programme. While not directly targeted at lone parents, this would have implications for younger lone parents but the point is not to limit their participation in CE but to direct them to programmes with better outcomes, such as specific skills training.</P>
    <P>The anecdotal evidence is that the progression rate of lone parents into a job or employability enhancing programme is lower than for other categories of participants on CE.  This is a problem we have to address by developing progression supports, encouraging lone parents to participate in active labour market programmes with better employability outcomes than CE and designing such programmes with more flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of health and safety legislation.  According to the latest figures received from the authority there have been 55 workplace fatalities reported so far in 1998, of which 19 have been construction related.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of additional resources for the authority I have also recently sanctioned the recruitment of an extra 13 staff to the Health and Safety Authority.  This is in addition to the seven previously sanctioned for this year and is a total increase of 20 personnel or 18 per cent.  This is an indication of the firm commitment of this Government to protecting the health and safety of our workforce.</P>
      <P>The total staff complement in the authority will now be 132, a significant boost to the resources of the authority.  This will put it in a better position to meet the ever increasing demands being placed upon it and to continue to approach all of its work in a targeted and structured manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the recently announced Health and Safety Authority construction action programme, <Col N="1546" /> which I launched in June, a team of dedicated construction inspectors has been established by the Health and Safety Authority to target unsafe building sites.  They will also be able to offer advice and expertise to construction site operators in an effort to encourage and to being about improvements in health and safety standards.</P>
    <P>The issue of subcontracting within the construction sector has received much attention recently.  As regards the impact of subcontracting on health and safety standards, I should point out that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and the 1995 Construction Regulations provide a solid legislative guide by which effective health and safety procedures can be managed in all forms of employment.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is a comprehensive Act which is applicable to all places of work, all employers and employees and to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the 1995 Construction Regulations are one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one specific industry. These comprehensive regulations apply to all construction projects as well as to the maintenance of buildings.  They place obligations on clients and designers to ensure that health and safety is taken into account before any construction work begins.  They also place obligations on contractors and employees in relation to ensuring the safety, health and welfare of people working on construction sites.  These regulations introduce the concept of a chain of responsibility thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that subcontracting <i>per se</i> is resulting in an increased accident rate in the building sector.  In any event, regardless of the work practices employed on building sites they are all subject to the full rigours of the legislation.  The 1995 regulations were specifically designed to address the range of work practices and varying forms of employment found on construction sites.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for keeping our health and safety legislation under continuous examination and in that context I have already asked the board of the authority to review generally the 1989 legislation in the context of the tenth annivarsary of its enactment.</P>

    <P>My Department's Statement of Strategy, 1998/2000, which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, sets out the strategy for improving Ireland's competitiveness rating.  The Government believes that maintaining and increasing competitiveness is essential for businesses to grow and develop and, accordingly, high priority is being given to improving Ireland's competitive position.  There is a continuing need to attract foreign direct investment and to strengthen the competitiveness of individual firms, especially indigenous firms, by providing an environment conducive to enterprise, economic growth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has already taken a number of significant steps to improve business competitiveness.  These include major initiatives in the areas of skills, education, taxation, infrastructure and telecommunications.</P>

      <P>Definitive statistics on the level of unemployment are based on the quarterly national household survey, which replaced the labour force survey in September 1997.  Unfortunately, results from these surveys are not available at county level.</P>
      <P>The monthly live register figures include data on claimants of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other registrants classified by local office of registration.  However, the live register is not an accurate indicator of the level of unemployment.  The following table shows the number of women on the live register in each county in July 1997 and July 1998.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office recruits a large, temporary fieldforce to undertake 5-yearly censuses of population.  At the last census, taken in April 1996, some 3,400 enumerators and 335 supervisors were employed.</P>
      <P>Appointments to these temporary field posts are made by the Director General of the CSO in accordance with section 17 of the Statistics Act, 1993.  The posts are subject to any general employment legislation in force at the time.</P>
      <P>All census field staff are recruited through open competition.  The positions are advertised nationally and applications for the various posts are submitted to the Central Statistics Office via FÁS.  Appointments are offered in order to merit as determined by specially convened interview boards, with preference given to persons not in paid employment.  The conditions of employment, duties and responsibilities of the posts and rates of remuneration are clearly set out in the relevant recruitment documentation issued to each applicant.</P>
      <P>The following were the remuneration rates applicable for the 1996 census:</P>
      <P>Field Supervisor</P>
      <P>Weekly salary of IR£244.80 plus a terminal bonus of IR£245.  Travel and subsistence allowances were payable where appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the rapidly changing nature of the electronics sector and its increasing importance to industrial development and employment creation in Ireland, all segments of the sector are kept under review both by my Department and the industrial development agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its latest review of its client electronics companies, the IDA formed the opinion that some 11 per cent of them could be considered as high risk, 34 per cent as medium risk and the remaining 55 <Col N="1554" /> per cent as low risk.  While these reviews help give an indicative view of the sector they are augmented by close liaison between the IDA and its client companies.  I would point out that the categorisation of &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; does not mean that a company is in imminent risk of closure or loss of jobs but that the commercial risks to the business are higher than the normal level of risk which is a part of commercial reality.</P>
    <P>It is an assessment that some adjustment or improvement may be required in order to make the company more competitive.  In general companies subject to a higher than average risk do make adjustments and improvements with a view to increasing competitiveness.  The IDA's latest assessment of the number of high risk companies is similar to previous IDA reviews, notwithstanding the economic difficulties referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In addition, an early warning system is in place to identify potential threats to jobs in both indigenous and foreign companies in all sectors, including the electronics sector and to faciltate an appropriate response.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is endeavouring to persuade companies which it has identified as being at risk, to add a range of business functions, in order to enhance the strength and depth of its Irish operations. In addition, IDA Ireland regularly reviews progress in individual companies which it has helped establish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has been working for some years with Irish sub-supply companies in order to address cost competitive issues through a world class manufacturing programme and will continue to emphasise the need for all companies to improve their competitiveness through such programmes.</P>
    <P>A feature of the electronics sector is the pace of change in the industry.  Such an environment requires flexibility and speedy response capability from companies.</P>
    <P>The number of Far Eastern companies established in Ireland is quite low.  Nevertheless the crisis in the Far East could impact on some companies in the electronics sector and could result in a scaling back, at least temporarily, of plans for capacity expansion.  However, the diversified nature of the electronics sector in Ireland provides protection against economic downturn. Over half of the companies based here engage in some subsidiary activity, in addition to manufacturing. These aspects commonly include product development, back office support, sales and marketing. I am confident that the sector in Ireland will continue its impressive growth record despite experiencing fluctuations in individual company fortunes and specific segments over time. However, it should be recognised that, despite the best endeavours of my Department and the industrial development agencies, in the final analysis individual companies themselves must react to market situations and take the action which they consider necessary to remain competitive and to develop their operations.</P>

      <P>It is important to distinguish between the position of &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; and domestic help.  An &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is essentially a student &mdash; not an employee &mdash; who is received by a family and treated as a family member in exchange for certain services, such as a limited amount of light house work or baby-sitting. Accordingly work permits are not required in respect of individuals proposing to act as &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo; in this country as such activity is regarded as primarily cultural rather than economic.  They would, however, be subject to the usual immigration requirements which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Persons providing domestic help, however, are employees and as such are protected in this country by all our employment rights legislation. Accordingly, a work permit would be required in respect of a non EEA national whom it is proposed to engage in full-time domestic duties in the State.  The EEA comprises the EU countries together with Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland.</P>

      <P>In late 1997, Xerox Corporation initiated an internal review of its worldwide business activities to refocus itself to meet the competitive challenges of the global document processing market.  This review was undertaken by Xerox, primarily to enable it to manage the technology evolution as the document processing market moves from traditional products such as stand alone copiers and printers to digitally connected, networked equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from this review, Xerox Coporation announced in April of this year, a worldwide restructuring programme which features an organisation-wide cost reduction programme including 9,000 redundancies worldwide; a strong focus on the rapidly growing digital based products market colour copiers, printers, etc; a revised business model for Europe based on consolidation of a number of business activites in a single location leading to increased corporate efficiency, <Col N="1556" /> customer service and reduced operating costs. Xerox also announced that the European restructuring would lead to 3,800 job losses throughout Europe over a three year period.</P>
    <P>Xerox evaluated a number of greenfield sites and locations in Europe.  Following a process of internal evaluation by the corporation, Dundalk and Blanchardstown were selected as the locations for its strategic investment to meet future growth needs.</P>
    <P>A key element of Xerox Corporation's European business strategy is the manufacture of a range of new and existing products on a single market site at Dundalk, resulting in the creation of 1,465 jobs.  As part of this agreed strategy, Xerox proposes to relocate some manufacturing activities and some jobs from its Mitcheldean (UK) facility to Dundalk.  This transfer process is expected to commence in December 1999 and will take approximately 12 months to complete. This was announced by Xerox Corporation on 7 October 1998 as a first step in the implementation of its manufacturing strategy.</P>
    <P>In order to mitigate the impact of these jobs moves at Mitcheldean, Xerox Coporation has publicly announced that it proposes to put in place a range of actions designed to avoid the need for any compulsory redundancies including redeployment, retraining, voluntary redundancy and voluntary early retirement.</P>

      <P>In accordance with regulations made under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1993, the 35 city and county enterprise boards are required to have their annual accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there were delays in the completion of the audit of the annual accounts by the C&amp;AG for the initial years, 1993-1995, of the operation of the boards.  These delays, which in turn affected the timing of the lodgment of annual returns by the boards to the Companies Registration Office, were unavoidable given the additional workload for the Office of the C &amp; AG created by the establishment of the 35 boards nationwide in October 1993.</P>
      <P>The position has improved considerably in the meantime and in some instances the C &amp; AG now contracts the work to local auditors in order to expedite matters.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided recently, on foot of the recommendations by the Task Force on Local Government and Local Development, that post 1999 the enterprise function for the development of micro-enterprises &mdash; ten employees or fewer &mdash; will be centralised in the enterprise boards.  The funding for the boards during this period will be determined by the Government in the context of new national plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>Thus the enterprise boards will continue to be a major force for job creation into the new millennium, building on their impressive record to date.  In the period October 1993 to end 1997, enterprise boards have supported the creation of 11,000 full-time jobs, with a further 7,000 jobs expected to be created during the two years 1998-99.</P>

      <P>I would assure the Deputy that the FÁS overseas graduate programme is not being terminated.  However, the operation of the programme is being reviewed in light of the changing skills and labour market environment at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, skills availability is critical to the continued expansion of the economy.  I am aware of the benefits of the overseas graduate programme, particularly in regard to the facilitation of inbound foreign direct investment, FDI, from South East Asia. However, given the skills shortages which are emerging, particularly in high technology areas, it is clearly prudent to review the opportunity costs attaching to the overseas graduate programme.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the future operation of the programme is as follows.  Forty two graduates will be placed abroad this year and FÁS will continue to support and interact with these graduates during the period of their two year placement.  During 1999 it is intended that FÁS will make a concerted effort to encourage more of the 450 graduates who have availed of the programme to date and are still abroad, to return to Ireland.  The situation will be reviewed in mid 1999 in light of these efforts and the labour market position at that time with a view to determining the level of placements in future years.</P>

      <P>People who are in receipt of invalidity pension may be permitted to avail of FÁS training/employment schemes, <Col N="1560" /> subject to approval under the rules of behaviour, as agreed and administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the National Rehabilitation Board.  This enables the individual to continue to receive their invalidity pension along with the appropriate FÁS payments, which is based on the single adult rate for the appropriate scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1997-98 some of the people concerned were being paid more than the single adult rate from the commencement of their activity with FÁS which should not have been the case.  In consequence they were, incorrectly, receiving two sets of allowances for their dependants.</P>
      <P>As this did not arise from any fault on the part of the participants there was no reduction in their payment for that year on community employment. However, some of the individuals concerned began a further year on CE and the correction was made at that stage, in accordance with the rules of behaviour.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of today's date regarding life long learning which, <i>inter alia,</i> details various initiatives which are being taken to assist training in employment.  In particular, I would draw attention to the proposed training networks programme and to the role of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>In regard to the latter, the mission of Enterprise Ireland is to help client companies to develop a sustainable competitive advantage, leading to increasing profitable sales exports and employment.  The agency will implement a business development model covering the key strategic business functions.  The model fully recognises the significance of training and human resource development in assisting firms to upgrade their capability and thus grow their competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>Relevant resources will shortly transfer from FÁS to Enterprise Ireland to facilitate it in implementing this aspect of the business development model.  In addition, there will continue to be close co-operation at regional level between FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland aimed at ensuring that the training activities of FÁS are fully attuned to the needs of firms.</P>

      <P>The overall commitment of resources to the employment action plan is in excess of £1,000 million this year.  The FÁS placement service has been significantly enhanced with a view to delivering satisfactory outcomes for the individuals concerned, and 7,500 places on employment and training schemes ring-fenced to accommodate the activation programme.  The numbers of persons dealt with under the plan at regional or sub-regional level is an operational matter for FÁS.</P>

As this House is aware, the general policy of successive Governments since the mid 1980s is to ensure that there is true competition in the marketplace rather than applying statutory price controls.  Accordingly, I have drawn the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement to a recent debate in this House on this issue and I have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.  I am also inviting representatives of the retailers to meet me this week to address these concerns.  Following those discussions I will decide what additional measures, if any, are required to ensure that consumers benefit from the reduction in producer prices for farm produce.</P>

The Director of Consumer Affairs is among the members of the implementation group.  Among the issues to be considered by the implementation group will be the responsibilities of the new authority covering the relationships between financial undertakings and their customers and the assumption of the regulatory functions at present exercised by the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other regulators over financial undertakings.  It will also be required to advise the Government on the legislative changes which will be necessary for the establishment of the authority.

      <P>The Deputy's question is very timely.  We have now accumulated an extensive body of consumer legislation and, while additional legislative measures are always likely be required from time to time both at national and EU level to ensure the consumer is adequately protected, there is likely to be a much greater emphasis on enforcement in the future.</P>
      <P>Improved enforcement of consumer legislation is a priority for the European Commission, which issued a working document on the subject in March 1998 intended to establish a broad picture of the situation in the EU.  As part of Ireland's contribution to this important debate I hosted a forum in Dublin on 2 and 3 October on Consumers and the Amsterdam Treaty at which this subject was discussed.</P>
      <P>I fully expect the importance of this issue to be reflected in future discussions both at national level and at EU level, and, crucially, in the level of interaction between the member states themselves and the member states and the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Oil plc.  as operators, together with their partners Saga and Statoil were granted a <Col N="1569" /> frontier petroleum exploration licence in 1994, licence 3/94, which give them the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in a four block area off the coast of Mayo.  They have drilled two wells under the licence &mdash; an exploration well in 1996 and an appraisal well this year.  The 1996 well resulted in a gas discovery, but Enterprise were unable to test the well due to mechanical problems. However, the 1998 appraisal well, drilled very close to the location of the 1996 well, was successfully tested and production of gas was measured at a stabilised rate of 63 million standard cubic feet per day.</P>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to give any indication of the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery, this will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years including the drilling of additional appraisal wells.  Should the results of this appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for Enterprise to apply to my Department for a petroleum lease &mdash; the authorisation required to bring the gas into production.  The licensees have not made an application for a petroleum lease and no agreement has been entered into in regard to development of the field.  Such a petroleum lease would be granted in accordance with the 1992 licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development.</P>
    <P>At this stage it would be impossible to predict the effects of developing the discovery on the local and national economy.  Any benefits arising from a development would be dependent on aspects such as the size of the accumulation, duration of production, flow rates, the type of development system, the cost of development, operating expenses and market price.  It is essential that we derive benefits from the production of our indigenous oil or gas resources and I will ensure that at all stages of exploration, appraisal and development, wherever feasible, opportunities for participation by Irish providers of goods and services are made available at local and national level.  I must emphasise that this is an international business and where we have the capability in Ireland we must be competitive in regard to price, quality and timeliness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159, 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's Questions Nos. 180 and 181 of 30 September 1998, it has not been possible to date, in the absence of any verifiable identification of the vessels involved, to resolve the compensation claim made by the person referred to by the Deputy.  The compensation system for damage to local fishing gear from trawling activities will, however, be on the agenda at the meetings of inshore fishing and trawling groups which my Department, in association with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, will convene shortly.</P>
      <P>Certain categories of larger fishing vessels are precluded by the terms and conditions of their sea-fishing boat licences from fishing within 12 miles of the base lines.  For example, this restriction applies to some Refrigerated Sea Water, RSW, boats except during the horse mackerel fishery.</P>
      <P>My Department has, through claims made by inshore fishermen for compensation for damage or loss of lobster pots and other static fishing gear, received a number of allegations of large vessels fishing illegally within 12 miles of the baselines.  It would be a matter of serious concern if a vessel was fishing in breach of the terms of its sea-fishing boat licence and I have, therefore, directed my Department to investigate the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that certain categories of fishing vessels may legitimately <Col N="1572" /> engage in trawling within 12 miles of baselines, and that it would not be practical or realistic to prohibit all trawling activity in every area where pots or other static gear may be deployed by inshore fishermen.  As I stated in replying to the Deputy's questions of 30 September, problems arising from the use of different types of fishing gear on fishing grounds are best resolved at local level, by co-operation between fishermen.  The forthcoming meetings with all relevant interests will, I believe, afford an opportunity to develop improved cooperation and understanding for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162, 163, 165 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>I do not have detailed information on the management of specific plantation areas by the UK Forestry Commission; however, to put the position in context, it needs to be borne in mind that the Forestry Commission has over two million acres of woodland comprised of coniferous plantations, mainly Sitka spruce.  I also understand that the Forestry Commission operates a policy of replanting under-performing crops.  The forest service of my Department would insist on a similar policy if grant-aided forest development operations in this country were carried out in a manner which was not compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>Conifers, and particularly Sitka spruce, are outstanding tree species and ideally suited to the marginal soils available for forestry in Ireland. Far from causing destruction to the environment these species are major sequesters of carbon from the atmosphere and are renewable resources, thereby meeting two of the most fundamental environmental needs.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that Ireland's afforestation policy is in any way in conflict with any international agreement or convention.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental condition of grant-aid that forestry development is compatible with the protection of the environment and there are a wide range of controls in place to ensure this takes place.  All projects must be submitted for grant approval before work begins so that environmental factors can be taken into account.  Where environmental considerations are identified other State agencies and local authorities are consulted in relation to national heritage, areas of landscape or amenity interest, areas of fisheries interest and areas of archaeological interest.  Published guidelines on the landscape, fisheries and archaeology must be implemented by grant-aided forestry.  Moreover, grants are not available for areas which are protected or qualify for protection under the EU Birds Directive or Habitats Directive.  Applications for grant assistance have been refused and proposed projects adjusted on environmental grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the forest service of my Department is currently drafting a code of best forest practice in relation to all stages of the forestry management cycle from seed selection through establishment and maintenance to timber harvesting and transport.  Preparation of the code is a major undertaking involving extensive reference to developments in other countries and also addressing a wide range of issues including <Col N="1574" /> achieving the integration of forest management, maintaining biodiversity, ensuring sustainability, maintaining and restoring productivity, addressing sociological concerns and maintaining forest health while integrating biological, social and behavioural sciences.  I expect that a draft will be available for wide consultation within the next few months.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of fishermen about the risks which may arise in connection with petroleum exploration and production activities in our offshore.  I have asked the Department to set up, in the coming weeks, a face to face meeting between the offshore industry and the fishing organisations which will review together issues of concern.</P>
      <P>While it is my belief that offshore exploration activities do not create a safety problem for fishermen it is my objective to protect the interests of all sectors operating in the offshore in relation to marine and offshore earth resources.  The rights and obligations of any one participant in the marine area must be respected by other users and harmonious co-existence is facilitated by information exchange and consultation.</P>
      <P>Procedures and controls governing the operation of exploration licences which provide comprehensive protection for fishermen and other users of the sea are in place.  My Department issues a rules and procedures manual for offshore petroleum exploration operations to the operators of exploration licences.  Operators must ensure that any activities carried out by them under these licences comply with all relevant national and international statutory regulations and other requirements in force at the time for any particular location.</P>
      <P>The manual outlines in detail the procedures to be followed in relation to applications to carry out exploration surveys and exploration and appraisal drilling.  Copies of the applications must be submitted to all relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Where marine vessels are being used for an exploration survey the Marine Rescue Co-Ordination Centre, MRCC, and the Marine Survey Office, MSO, must be notified of commencement and completion of the survey. The vessel is required to update the MRCC on a daily basis on its operational area.  In the case of exploration or appraisal drilling, notice must be given to the Irish Marine Emergency Services, IMES, and the MSO in order that such information as is required may be published in a Marine Notice.  During actual movement of a drilling unit within Irish waters the operator is required to keep IMES, the MSO and Naval Service headquarters informed of such movements on a daily basis.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, on recently seeking to avail of his Department's offer dated 30 May 1994 of a sea fishing boat licence and having complied with all conditions attaching to this offer, a company (details supplied) in County Wexford has been informed that a new application must be submitted; whether a tonnage certificate and fishing licence has been issued by his Department during the past two years in respect of any other dredger based in Wexford; if so, the date of application for such certificate and licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>An offer of a sea-fishing boat licence for a mussel dredger being imported from the Netherlands was made by the company in question on 30 April 1994, and was accepted on 6 June 1994.  The company was subsequently requested on 16 August 1994, in accordance with the normal practice for vessels being introduced into the Irish fishing fleet, to arrange to have the vessel measured by my Department's Marine Survey Office.</P>
      <P>My Department has not, to date, received the necessary measurement certificate from the company. In view of this fact, and taking account of the length of time since the licence application was originally made, the company was recently asked to make a new licence application.  This application has now been received and will be processed expeditiously.  Production of the necessary measurement certificate by the company would, of course, facilitate my Department in finalising this matter quickly.</P>
      <P>Two sea fishing boat licences for mussel dredging were granted to persons or companies in County Wexford in the last two years.  The applications for these licences were made on 15 July 1997 and 24 September 1997, and the licences were granted on 8 October 1997 and 3 November 1997 respectively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licensed fish farm operators are obliged to indemnify the State against all actions, loss, claims damages, cost expenses and demands arising in any manner whatsoever in connection with the construction, maintenance or use of any aquaculture <Col N="1577" /> structures, apparatus or equipment or in the exercise or the rights granted under licence.</P>
    <P>In addition they are legally obliged to report to the Department and the Fisheries Research Centre of the Marine Institute fish pathology unit within 48 hours of the appearance of any disease or abnormal losses or mortalities and send samples to the fish pathology unit.  This is an essential requirement to ensure that necessary monitoring and remedial action can be taken quickly to contain any potential disease outbreak.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that disease outbreaks invariably result in serious economic loss for fish-farmers and, as a consequence, it is clearly in the industry's own interest to ensure best practices apply.</P>
    <P>The use of all veterinary medical products is regulated under legislation administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food while the Medicines Board is the competent product licensing authority under EU and national legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of production levels, licensees are required, in addition to the licence condition which stipulates maximum permitted production levels, to furnish a production plan of their proposed inputs of fish to the farm.  In the interests of transparency, licensees are also required to seek permits from the Department for the transfer of smolts to production sites.  This provides a further means of monitoring adherence on the part of licensed operators to the stipulated production levels.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been consistent in its support to the people of Sudan over the past number of years and continues to commit substantial funds to the international humanitarian relief effort through the UN and Irish and international NGOs.  Overall emergency assistance provided by the Government so far this year totals almost £1.4 million. One of the conclusions of my own visit there in August was that emergency assistance will need to continue to be provided on a very large scale over the next 12 months if famine is to be avoided.  While we welcome the recent three-month extension of the humanitarian ceasefire in the Bar El Ghazahl region we will continue to exert pressure on the relevant parties to ensure that adequate humanitarian access will be maintained beyond the agreed period.  A technical mission from the Department of Foreign Affairs is currently in the region to monitor the impact of resources given so far this year and to plan for 1999.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Government fully recognises that the continued humanitarian commitment of Ireland and other members of the international community cannot be allowed to become a substitute for meaningful engagement by the conflicting parties in a negotiated settlement.  I emphasised this point to the Government and SPLA sides during my August visit as well as to the Kenyan Chair of the regional IGAD peace initiative.  We are also working closely with EU and other partners who are members of the international IGAD Partners' Forum which is supporting regional peace efforts &mdash; we are actively pressing for an early resumption of the political talks process.</P>
      <P>The crippling burden of debt on many developing countries remains a major challenge which must be vigorously addressed by the entire international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a new initiative last September, the Government agreed to a comprehensive debt relief package committing funds of over £31 million to ease the debt burden on the heavily indebted poor <Col N="1579" /> countries, while also adopting a number of principles to guide our future policy on the debt situation of developing countries.</P>
    <P>I fully respect the views of Jubilee 2000 on the issue of debt cancellation.  However, few Governments, from either developed or developing countries, have called for absolute debt cancellation, as opposed to measures to substantially alleviate the debt situation facing many developing countries.  In respect of general bilateral and multilateral debt, the position taken to date by developing countries is to generally favour reducing the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>As regards Ireland's position, the principles adopted by the Government in September include a commitment to strongly encourage the international community to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation.  Ireland will continue to use every opportunity to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, foreign lecturers, including several Irish lecturers, employed at a number of Italian universities have for a considerable time encountered difficulties in relation to their contracts and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>In December 1997, the European Commission decided to bring a case against Italy before the European Court of Justice regarding the acquired rights of foreign language lecturers in Italian universities. The Commission argued that in spite of a modification to Italian law in 1995 in response to previous rulings of the European Court of Justice about the contractual status of foreign language lecturers, a number of lecturers employed before 1995 were encountering significant difficulties in preserving their acquired rights.  The Italian authorities informed the Commission on 11 August 1998 that the Italian Minister for Universities, Scientific Research and Technology had written to the rectors of Italian universities and directors of higher education, instructing the institutions concerned to respect the relevant acquired rights of foreign language lecturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner Flynn issued a statement on 21 September 1998 in which he welcomed the action of the Italian authorities.  He said that, if swift and comprehensive action were not taken by the Italian <Col N="1580" /> universities to bring their contractual arrangements into conformity with European law he would not hesitate to proceed with legal action.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate at this point to make representations to the Italian authorities.  In consultation with the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, consumer rights and international trade, Deputy Tom Kitt, I have asked the Permanent Representation of Ireland in Brussels to maintain regular contact with Commissioner Flynn's office and the Commission's Directorate General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs and to impress on them our expectation that they will pursue the matter vigorously, with the aim of achieving a solution to the outstanding problems in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>The fees currently charged for Irish passports are: for a standard ten year 32-page passport £45, for a large ten year 48-page business passport £55, for a special three year 23-page passport for persons under 18 or over 65 £10, and for a collective or group passport £45.</P>
      <P>Any person wishing to exchange a passport which is currently valid for a new passport &mdash; for example, in connection with changing a name on marriage or adding children's names &mdash; may do so for a fee of £15; the new passport is valid for the period of validity of the previous passport.</P>
      <P>Some 600,000 passport application forms are printed each year for distribution mainly to Garda stations and post offices.  Passport fees are subject to change.  In the past, when fees were specified on the form, out-of-date forms and incorrect fees continued to be received after new fees became applicable; this caused unnecessary difficulties for both the Passport Office and the applicants concerned.  As long as the Passport Office does not directly control the forms that are given to applicants, the best way of avoiding such difficulties is by not mentioning fees in the form. In the experience of the Passport Office, any inconvenience caused to applicants by this omission is less than the difficulties a greater number of them would have through using out-of-date forms after a fee increase.  It is not intended, therefore, to revert to the practice of including fee details in the passport application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A list of current fees is on display in every Garda station and in the thousand or so post offices where the &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service is available.  They are also displayed in the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork and are recorded on the Passport Office low-cost information line, 1800 426 800. <Col N="1581" /> About 90 per cent of all passport applications within the country are made through post offices or in person at the Dublin and Cork Passport Offices.  In the case of the 10 per cent or so of applications transmitted by ordinary post, the fee is usually indicated by the Garda who certifies the applicant's identity.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs may refuse to grant passport facilities in certain circumstances but the Minister does not normally withdraw Irish passports once they have been validly issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 of 1968, which imposed mandatory sanctions on the illegal regime in what was then Southern Rhodesia, in the period 29 May 1968 to 21 December 1979 new passports were not issued to Irish citizens for emigration to Southern Rhodesia nor to those of our citizens residing in Southern Rhodesia whose activities furthered or encouraged the unlawful actions of the regime.  Since those restrictions were lifted, <Col N="1583" /> people who were affected have been able to avail of Irish passport facilities in the same way as Irish citizens generally.</P>
    <P>In the time available it has not been possible to ascertain whether there are records of the number of Irish citizens who were denied Irish passports in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution.  A search is under way and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome when it is completed.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been consistent in its support to the people of Sudan over the past number of years and continues to commit substantial funds to the international humanitarian relief effort through the UN and Irish and international NGOs.  Overall emergency assistance provided by the Government so far this year totals almost £1.4 million. One of the conclusions of my own visit there in August was that emergency assistance will need to be provided on a very large scale over the next 12 months if famine is to be avoided.  While we welcome the recent three-month extension of the humanitarian cease-fire in the Bar El Ghazahl region we will maintain our pressure on the parties to ensure that adequate humanitarian access will be maintained beyond the agreed period.  A technical mission from the Department of Foreign Affairs is currently in the region to monitor the impact of resources given so far this year and to plan for 1999.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Government fully recognises that the continued humanitarian commitment of Ireland and other members of the international community cannot be allowed to become a substitute for meaningful engagement by the conflicting parties in a negotiated settlement.  I emphasised this point to the Government and SPLA sides during my August visit as well as to the Kenyan Chair of the regional IGAD peace initiative.  We are also working closely with EU and other partners who are members of the international IGAD Partners' Forum which is supporting regional peace efforts.  We are actively pressing for an early resumption, in this framework, of the political talks process.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion of renewable energy, including wind energy, is a priority of the Government's overall energy policy as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>My Department has hosted four competitions for rights to sell electricity to the ESB from renewable and alternative energy sources, including wind energy.  The competitions were announced publicly and in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  They were open to all European Union nationals.</P>
      <P>Tenders received were independently assessed from a technical and commercial perspective in the first instance.  Thereafter, the successful applications were ranked on the basis of the bid price tendered in the interest of securing the most competitive electricity consistent with attaining preset technical and commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>ESB Power Contracting was then instructed to offer <i>pro-forma</i> power purchase agreements, PPAs, to the successful bidders.  Conclusion of these contracts is a matter between the ESB and the successful bidders.</P>
      <P>The competitions held to date are intended to deliver the published targets for renewable energy up to 2000.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish a Green Paper on sustainable energy later this year which will explore the options available for meeting Ireland's energy requirements over the next ten to 15 years in an environmentally sustainable way having regard to network capacity, forecast economic growth, security of supply requirements and international legally binding obligations, such as those arising under the Kyoto Climate Change Protocol. Future policy on wind powered production of electricity will be addressed in that paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 186, 193, 194, 195 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>Public concern over the possible risks to health to the users of mobile phones began in the United States in April, 1992 when a Florida man sued a mobile phone manufacturer for allegedly causing his wife to have a brain tumour.  This was the first such case involving mobile phones.  However, when it came to trial in May 1995 the case was dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publicity generated by this case drew <Col N="1586" /> world wide attention to the possible risks to mobile phone users.  In consequence manufacturers of mobile phones accelerated their research on improving the design of mobile phones to enable them to function effectively while using less power.  The results of this research are now incorporated into the latest GSM phones in use in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Concerning the specific points raised in these questions and in the newspaper article which prompted them I would make the following comments.</P>
    <P>The patents refer to research initiated in the wake of the Florida mobile phone lawsuit.  There have been other similar lawsuits in the United States since that first case.  None so far have found in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>The views of Mr. Roger Coghill are not supported by the expert group set up by the European Commission which in November 1996 stated:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any health risk emerging from mobile phones, but the results of present research are inadequate to draw firm conclusions on this issue.  Further research is therefore required.</P>
    <P>. or by the UK National Radiological Protection Board which, in February 1998 stated:</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the NRPB advisory group on non-ionizing radiation was that there is no firm evidence that electromagnetic fields cause cancer but that there is a need for further good quality research to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer are co-ordinating major research programmes in this area.  My officials will be closely monitoring the results of this research.</P>
    <P>Mobile telephones in use in Ireland meet the exposure standards recommended by major health advisory bodies world-wide, including the International Committee on Non-ionising Radiation Protection, who are advisers to the World Health Organisation on these matters, the American National Council for Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the United States National Council for Radiation Protection and Measurements.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the 1988 International Radiation Protection Association guidelines is a condition attached to all communications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who was appointed pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, is responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions in relation to emissions from masts and has now put in place a system for this.  The Director has recently published a report of her findings in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 187 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>A study on integrated ticketing, carried out by MVA for Córas Iompair Éireann, was funded by the Technical Assistance Programme of the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The study was completed in October 1997 and confirmed that a more integrated fare scale would encourage passengers to make better use of the current bus and rail network.  It also identified a significant potential revenue loss for the CIE operating companies arising from the introduction of an integrated fare scale and pointed to a need to examine further the issue of network and service integration.</P>
      <P>A committee chaired by my Department and including representatives from CIE, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann, the LRT project team and the DTO was established earlier this year.  This committee's objective is, on the basis of the DTI strategy and taking account of the MVA study, to prepare as soon as possible and in any event by 31 December 1999, proposals for an integrated fares and ticket system which encourages the best use of a network of routes and facilitates people who have to make more than one trip to complete their journey.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, the funds allocated to integrated ticketing under the Operational Programme for Transport must be drawn down by end 2000.</P>

      <P>Existing thermal electricity generating plants in Ireland use a broad mix of fuels including gas, oil, coal and peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol the European Community as a whole has agreed to reduce emissions <Col N="1588" /> of six main greenhouse gases by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012.  Within this overall EU reduction target, Ireland's target is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the same period.  The Kyoto obligations as they relate to electricity refer primarily to emmissions of carbon dioxide, CO2, and sulphur hexafluoride SF6.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Public Enterprise and Environment and Local Government jointly commissioned a report on &ldquo;The Limitation and Reduction of CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland&rdquo; in the course of developing a national strategy to meet Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol.  The report was published in June and consultations with all interested parties were invited.  A one day discussion forum on the development of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy was held on 28 October and work on the preparation of a strategy for Government approval is now progressing.</P>
    <P>In finalising a national strategy, the Government will seek to ensure that the burden of meeting Ireland's Kyoto commitments are shared equitably across all economic sectors, including transport, agriculture, industry and energy.</P>
    <P>ESB has met its environmental commitments in the past.  It will work in co-ordination with other generators entering the new electricity market so as to continue to meet all relevant environmental obligations in particular through a combination of switching to less carbon intensive fossil fuels, the continued development of renewable energy, supply side efficiency improvements, and demand side management measures.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the preparation of a White Paper on Defence were approved by the Government at the end of July 1998.  These proposals provided for a consultative process by which all interested individuals and organisations would be invited to make submissions to the Department of Defence on any or all aspects of the White Paper.  It was open to individual members of the Defence Forces to make submissions as individuals or from the perspective of their own speciality or branch. Submissions were invited by mid-October, although where an individual or organisation has indicated that their submission will be submitted in the immediate future, these will be accepted. Where deemed necessary, provision for ongoing consultations will be made, for example, in the case of the Defence Forces representative associations.</P>
      <P>The Government also approved the establishment of an interdepartmental defence and security assessment group to consider and report on the overall context against which the White Paper should be developed.  This group is representative of the Department of Defence, civil and military, and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The work of this group is ongoing and, for security reasons, its outputs will be confidential.</P>
      <P>The Department's strategic management committee, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising the Chief of Staff, the two assistant secretaries and the two deputy chiefs of staff, is overseeing the civil and military contribution which will ultimately form the White Paper.</P>

      <P>Detailed plans are still being prepared by the OSCE in Vienna on all organisational aspects of the mission, including personnel requirements. Ireland is currently contributing expert personnel &mdash; including one military officer who is serving with the OSCE in Vienna &mdash; to the OSCE's special planning unit dedicated to this task. Ireland has indicated its readiness, in principle, to contribute to the verification mission.  The precise size and composition of Ireland's contribution will depend on the needs of the mission, which are currently being identified by the OSCE, as well as the availability of resources.  The mission will be unarmed and of a civilian character.</P>

Some farmers applying on the same number of animals with the same amount of land in 1998 as in previous years might be experiencing a reduction in payments this year.  These include the application of stocking density restrictions of 1.4 livestock units per hectare across all headage schemes and a cap on the maximum grant payable to an individual farmer of £4,000.  In addition, headage payments are only being made in 1998 based on land digitised under the land parcel identification system; in previous years payments were, in the first instance, made in many cases based on the area claimed by the farmer.</P>

      <P>The new plastic tag system for cattle identification was introduced in Ireland in 1996 and the information available to my Department indicates that it has by and large been successful. The rate of tag loss is quite low and compares favourably with loss rates experienced with the brass eartags formerly used to identify cattle.  The performance of the large tag has been better than the button type tag in this regard.  Each tag-number contains a unique herd and animal identifier which are essential requirements for traceability purposes.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the current arrangements, a number of changes are being introudced with effect from 1 January 1999.  Animals born on or after that date must be identified by means of two large tags instead of the current combination of a large and a buton tag.  In addition, the new eartags will contain a barcode.</P>
      <P>Herd-owners will no longer be automatically supplied with eartags.  They will, instead, have to order their tag requirements direct from the official tag supplier, Mullinahone Co-op.  Finally, the tag numbering system is being changed to an all-numeric format.  This latter change is necessary to comply in full with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) 820/97.  The tag numbers will continue to include unique herd and animal identifiers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the disadvantaged areas appeals panel commenced its examination of areas for <Col N="1604" /> reclassification as more severely handicapped, the following guidelines were agreed with my Department and with the farming organisations: 1.  the data gathered in the 1988 farm survey would form the basis of the selection process, with the income threshold raised from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of national average income; 2.  the land quality rating established by professional officers for each townland would be used, with a rating of 4 or lower indicating potential more severely handicapped status; 3.  areas not contiguous to the existing more severely handicapped boundary would be considered if at least 15,000 hectares could be shown to satisfy the criteria.</P>
      <P>When the panel examined the areas in respect of which appeals had been received, they selected areas which satisfied the above criteria.  These areas were submitted to the EU Commission and were accepted in full.</P>
      <P>The townlands referred to in this question are part of the Castlecomer area of North Kilkenny which was considered as a non-contiguous group. The panel selected as many townlands as possible, up to the point that inclusion of any further townlands would cause the whole area to exceed the criteria.  Nine of these townlands had a land quality rating over 4, and the tenth, Smithstown, was isolated from the main group.  The ten townlands could not, therefore, be included in the submission and were not forwarded to the EU for inclusion in the more severely handicapped areas.</P>
      <P>As a result of various representations about these townlands, I have had the data re-examined and I am satisfied that the decision to omit them was correct based on the information available to the appeals panel.</P>
      <P>A report was received in my Department indicating that a recent study of the townlands in question set the land quality ratings at a reduced level which I would allow them to satisfy the criteria. However, since it was agreed by all parties that the 1988 data would be used in the selection of areas, it would be inappropriate to use data derived at a different time and possibly using different methodologies in support of one area, without giving other omitted areas the same consideration. This would amount to a new review of disadvantaged areas, and I am aware that the EU would not be receptive at this time to any such proposals.</P>
      <P>There is a re-examination of another area ongoing at present.  However, this is based solely on the 1988 data, and will only result in changes if it is determined that the appeals panel's interpretation of that data was incorrect.</P>

      <P>Pre-payment inspections are carried out on 5 per cent of new applicants under the rural environment protection scheme and on 5 per cent of those applying for second and subsequent payments.

      <P>There were 1,903 applicants selected for 5 per cent random inspections between 1 November 1997 and 1 October 1998.  The detailed breakdown cannot be compiled in the time available and I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 353 together.</P>
      <P>The Care and Welfare of Poultry (Laying Hens) Regulations, 1990, are the specific legislation operated by my Department in relation to hen welfare.  These regulations lay down the minimum requirements for the protection of laying hens kept in battery cages.  I am arranging to send a copy of the regulations to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have been taking place at Council of Ministers and Council Working Party levels in relation to a proposal for a new Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens kept in various systems of <Col N="1610" /> rearing.  The proposal takes into account the latest Council of Europe Recommendations concerning domestic fowl.</P>
    <P>While I take the view that hen welfare must be improved, any legislative changes proposed for the battery-cage sector must be introduced in a way which will not damage the EU egg industry by resulting in the importation, into this country and into other member states of the EU, of cheap battery-produced eggs from countries with little or no regard for hen welfare.  As I indicated in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 161 of 6 October, the economic implications of providing the appropriate space necessary to meet welfare requirements and the space itself call for further consideration.  My Department will participate fully in the discussions at EU level to ensure that the appropriate balance of interests is achieved.</P>

      <P>No applications were lodged by the person named under the suckler cow premium scheme in 1994 or in 1995.

No reply was received to this letter.</P>
      <P>Applications were received under the suckler cow premium on 22 May 1996 and on 30 May 1997.  However there was no entitlement to payment as the person named had his suckler cow quota withdrawn.  No applications were received under the special beef premium scheme for 1997.</P>
      <P>Since no entitlement to suckler cow premium or special beef premium was establised in 1997 he is therefore not entitled to extensification premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>Funding is available from my Department to farmers and growers to convert to organic farming or to maintain organic methods of production. This funding is available through the rural environment protection scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the REP scheme farmers, engaged in organic farming, are eligible to receive additional payments on top of the basic REPS payment of 125 ECU per ha.  per annum.  The rates of payment vary depending on the size of holding and the stage of organic status reached.  The annual additional rates are as follows:</P>
      <P>Applicants with more than 3 hectares of utilisable agricultural area:</P>
      <P>in conversion status: 150 ECU per ha.  for a maximum of 40 hectares.</P>
      <P>full organic status: 75 ECU per ha.  for a maxiumu of 40 hectares.</P>
      <P>Applicants farming up to 3 hectares with at least 1.0 ha under fruit or vegatables:</P>
      <P>in conversion status: 200 ECU per ha.  up to a maximum of 3 hectares.</P>
      <P>full organic status: 100 ECU per ha.  up to a maximum of 3 hectares.</P>
      <P>Farmers converting to organic farming methods are therefore eligible to receive a minimum of £1,150 per hectare, over a five year term, between the basic REPS payment and the organic supplementary measure.</P>
      <P>To date some £2.75 million has been paid to 411 farmers who availed of the basic REPS payment plus the organic supplementary measure and I consider this a very good response to the measure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the United Kingdom, I understand that a payment of £450 per hectare is made spread over a five year period of participation in its organic aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the measures operated by my Department provide strong encouragement to farmers wishing to opt for organic farming.  The <Col N="1612" /> high rate of payment per hectare, with a 40 hectare limit for payments sufficiently accommodates the Irish farming system where holdings tend to be smaller than those in the UK or France.</P>

      <P>Because of the continuing brucellosis situation and following extended discussions in the Animal Health Forum it was necessary to introduce a number of remedial measures, including a 30 day pre-movement test for all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, with effect from 23 February last.  All parties involved in the negotiations accept the veterinary advice that these arrangements are essential at this time, particularly in the context of our beef and dairy trades.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it would not be prudent to make any adjustment at this time.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the difficult situation facing many farmers at the moment, I have decided that the cost of up to 20 tags ordered by each farmer by 31 March 1999 will be met by my Department.  On that basis, some 75,000 farmers <Col N="1614" /> will receive free tags for all their calves in 1999 while the remainder of farmers may receive up to 20 free tags.  The cost of this concession will be in the order of £1.9 million.</P>
      <P>Bovine diseases levies were introduced under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979 to provide for the farming community to make a financial contribution towards the cost of the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.</P>
      <P>Rates of levies were adjusted from 1 April 1996 when they were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal slaughtered or exported live and from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon of milk delivered for processing. This reduction was to compensate farmers for the part privatisation of the testing regime for TB and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>Rates of levies were further adjusted from 1 July 1998 when they were reduced from £2.50 to £2 per animal slaughtered or exported live and from 0.5p to 0.4p per gallon of milk delivered for processing.  This reduction was aimed specifically at partially offsetting the additional costs on farmers brought about by the increased blood testing requirements associated with revised arrangements introduced earlier in 1998 under the brucellosis eradication scheme.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that receipts from levies for 1998 will be in the region of £10 million.  This is against an estimated grant expenditure of £30 million.</P>
      <P>Under EU legislation all member states are obliged to collect a fee to contribute to the cost of providing health inspection to the meat industry. Any national waiver would be incompatible with EU legislation and would be regarded by the EU Commission as a national aid.  It is, therefore, not open to me to suspend meat inspection charges.</P>

      <P>The application in this case was for a continuation of the early retirement pension to a spouse of a deceased participant in the scheme.  The way in which the scheme operates is that entitlement of a spouse or other relative to a continuation of the pension for the balance of the period for which the pension would be otherwise payable, is subject to them being dependent on the pension at the time of death of the participant.  A spouse is deemed to qualify as a dependant for the continuation of the early retirement pension when his-her current income at the time of death of the spouse, together with the early retirement pension, would be lower than the sum of the maximum of the early retirement pension plus the average industrial wage as determined by the Central Statistics Office.  In this case, as the situation of the spouse does not meet the guidelines, it is not possible to continue the payment of the deceased participant's pension to his spouse.</P>

      <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of 12 premium rights prior to 1995.  Under EU Regulations governing the quota regime, effective up to 1995, farmers holding suckler cow quotas were required to use &mdash; including quota leased out &mdash; at least 50 per cent of that quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used in the second year would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The regulation was amended in 1996 when farmers holding quotas greater than seven were required to use at least 70 per cent of their quota in that year.  That percentage was increased to 90 per cent from 1997 onwards.</P>
      <P>The table below shows the quota and application details of the person named since 1995.</P>

    <P>*Applied on 7 cows but debarred from scheme in 1997.</P>
    <P>As the person named did not use at least 90 per cent of his quota of 12 premium rights in 1997 he forfeited the unused part of his quota i.e. five premium rights, to the national reserve.  In fact, he was debarred from the scheme in 1997 as his application was deemed to be invalid.  The person named appealed that decision to the appeals unit of the Department but his appeal was rejected in June 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 2 February 1998 seeking the reasons for the non <Col N="1620" /> use of the five premium rights in 1997.  Following his response my Department restored the five premium rights to the person named, on the condition that he would use at least 90 per cent of the quota of 12 premium rights himself in 1998. In reply, the person named declared that he could not use at least 90 per cent of the quota himself in 1998 and the reason he put forward could not be considered to constitute exceptional circumstances. The unused quota of five premium rights was again returned to the national reserve reducing his quota to seven premium rights.</P>
    <P>He has now applied for the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme in the October 1998 application period in respect of three cows.  The person named may retain seven premium rights for 1998, even though he will only use three of these rights himself, on condition that he will use at least 90 per cent of that quota in 1999.  Under the regulations, he is not entitled to lease out any quota in 1998, but he may lease out unused quota in 1999.</P>

      <P>The position is that Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92 under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is being implemented specifies certain mandatory conditions which must be included in the scheme. One of these conditions is that a transferor must be not less than 55 years old but not yet of normal retirement age at the time of the transfer.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the regulation does not allow any more favourable treatment for farmers who are under the required age limit but who are in ill-health.  In the circumstances, the person referred to in the question cannot be accepted into the scheme.</P>

      <P>The existence of commonages, particularly <Col N="1622" /> in the west of Ireland, is part of our heritage and there is no legislation to prevent the grazing of livestock on such land.  The disease risk involved in the association of different groups of cattle on a commonage is not dissimilar to the situation arising in marts where animals are gathered together on a regular basis.  Provided animals are of the same health status entering the commonage, there is no undue risk to the overall group.  It is strongly recommended, however, that herd-owners should ensure that animals grazed on commonages are tested again before they return to the main farm and mix with other cattle in the herd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the 30 day pre-movement requirement which was introduced following discussions in the animal health forum.</P>
      <P>Because of the continuing difficult brucellosis situation it was necessary to introduce a number of remedial measures, including a 30 day pre-movement test for all female cattle and bulls, over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, with effect from 23 February last.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that these new requirements impose some additional constraints on farmers and others.  However, all parties involved in the negotiations accept the veterinary advice that these arrangements are essential at this time, particularly in the context of our beef and dairy trades.</P>
      <P>From 1 July 1998, rates of bovine diseases levies were reduced (from £2.50 to £2 per animal slaughtered and from 0.5p to 0.4p per gallon of milk delivered for processing) in recognition of the additional cost of increased blood testing requirements because of current brucellosis levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343, 344, 345 and 346 together.</P>
      <P>The fodder scheme is directed at all sheep farmers with mountain grazings and suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons in district electoral divisions in the worst affected areas based on a Teagasc survey published in September. Ninety-six per cent of the district electoral divisions of County Mayo are included in the scheme.  They are listed in the following annex. Furthermore all sheep farmers with mountain grazings as per the sheep headage scheme will qualify for the fodder scheme.  The same general procedures were applied to selecting the worst affected areas in all counties.  The counties included are Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo and the areas included were based on a Teagasc survey.</P>

    <P>Under the Structural Funds regulations, administrative costs etc., are not eligible for cofinancing and are borne by individual Departments as part of normal staff costs.  However, under the technical assistance measure of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, a sum of £460,000 has been spent to 30 June 1998, mainly on evaluations carried out by both the independent analysis and evaluation unit of this Department, £304,000, and by external evaluators, £112,000.  This measure is cofunded by the EU at a rate of 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>The fodder scheme is directed at all sheep farmers with mountain grazings and suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons in district electoral divisions in the worst affected areas based on a Teagasc survey published in September. <Col N="1635" /> The counties concerned are Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers with mountain grazings: Some 15,000 sheep farmers with mountain grazings will benefit under the scheme.  Such producers will receive a payment of £4 per ewe or hogget up to 75 sheep.  These farmers will also benefit from the sheep headage top-up; Suckler cow farmers: More than 31,000 suckler cow producers located in the selected DEDs will qualify for payment. These farmers will receive a payment of £40 per suckler cow up to a ceiling payment of £300; Small scale dairy farmers: More than 7,000 dairy farmers located in the selected DEDs and with milk quotas less than 35,000 gallons will qualify for support.  A payment of £30 per 1000 gallons of quota up to a ceiling payment of £300 will be made.  Farmers who stand to benefit from a combination of the elements of the fodder scheme will receive a maximum payment of £300.</P>
      <P>Sheep and suckler cow farmers do not have to apply for the payment.  Payment will be made automatically by reference to the details on 1998 sheep headage and suckler cow application forms. These payments will be made as soon as possible. Arrangements for dairy farmers will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the revised arrangements for the TB and brucellosis schemes which were introduced from 1 April 1996, following agreement with the farming bodies, responsibility for arranging and paying for the first herd test each year is devolved to farmers.  The fee payable to the veterinary practitioners by farmers for testing is a matter for negotiation between the parties concerned and my Department has no function in this.</P>
      <P>In recognition that farmers would henceforth meet the cost of a significant part of the testing programme, the disease levies were reduced by about two thirds, also from April 1996.  The levies were further reduced earlier this year to partially offset the cost of statutory pre-movement testing introduced as one of several measures to combat brucellosis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question received a tax refund of £7.75 on 20 October 1998.  If the taxpayer's circumstances remain unchanged then a further refund of £15.16 will be made on 13 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The individual in question left employment in late August and has been in receipt of unemployment benefit since early September.  Any possible refund of taxes due to the individual arising from leaving employment will take account of subsequent UB payments which are considered taxable income.  It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including UB, are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Treating such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  It should be noted, however, that since UB was made reckonable as income for tax purposes in 1994 the method of taxing UB has been restructured in order to improve the position of those most adversely affected.  To this end a disregard of the first £10 per week of UB for income tax purposes has been introduced.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973 provided for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the civil service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfilled specific criteria. On foot of legal advice which indicated that the reinstatement scheme was discriminatory, the scheme was abolished by the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1996.  This means that the person concerned, along with former civil servants generally, cannot be reinstated to the civil service.</P>
      <P>To become a civil servant again this person must, like other former civil servants and citizens generally, go through the normal recruitment route, i.e. she must be successful at a Civil Service Commission open competition.  These competitions are advertised in the national newspapers from time to time.</P>
      <P>At the time of the abolition of the reinstatement scheme, the Government decided that the next two series of clerical assistant &mdash; now clerical officer &mdash; and executive officer recruitment competitions would include special sub-panels composed solely of former civil servants (these sub-panels are open to all former civil servants).  The first such executive officer and clerical officer competitions have already taken place.  The second such executive officer competition is currently being advertised by the Civil Service Commission, with an upper age limit of 65 years.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person concerned was formerly employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.

      <P>I have no plans to abolish the taxes in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  The position is that capital acquisitions tax (CAT) is due whenever a person receives a gift or an inheritance, subject to certain exemptions and reliefs.  A son or daughter may receive up to £188,400 from his or her parents free of CAT.  This exempt amount is described as the Class I threshold.  Only the value of benefits received in excess of the threshold gives rise to a charge to CAT.  Since 1990 the CAT thresholds have been indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Where the beneficiary has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 June 1982, the value of these benefits is added to the value of the current benefit when determining the CAT liability. This process is known as aggregation.  The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the appropriate threshold rate, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance.</P>
      <P>Probate tax is charged at a rate of 2 per cent on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased.  Estates with a taxable value of £10,980 or less are exempt from probate tax and outstanding debts of the deceased, as well as funeral expenses, may be deducted as expenses of the estate in arriving at the taxable value.  Furthermore, the share of the family home passing to dependent children or dependent relatives of the deceased is exempt.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is not charged on property transferring on death.  Furthermore, death is not an occasion of disposal for capital gains tax and in any event capital gains tax is not charged on the disposal of one's principal private residence.</P>
      <P>In view of the reliefs that exist for the cases described by the Deputy, the impact of these taxes on sons and daughters is already mitigated to a significant degree.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the P35 return is the annual return submitted by employers in which they account for the PAYE and PRSI deducted from their employees and for the employers' share of PRSI.  The information contained in the return is also crucial for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as it determines the entitlement of employees to Social Welfare benefits.

      <P>The P35 return from this individual (details supplied) was not received on time and was in fact almost four months late.  The individual was also late last year with the P35 return and consequently a letter issued to him in April this year reminding him to lodge the return by the due date.  He was also advised at that time that failure to do so could result in the imposition of a £1,200 fine.  Despite this reminder, the P35 was still outstanding on 26 August 1998 when the case was selected for penalty and the Revenue solicitor was advised to initiate collection of this fine.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have reviewed this case and in the light of new information are prepared to accept that the delay was due to exceptional circumstances. Consequently, the commissioners have decided to forego the penalty on the understanding that P35 returns will in future be submitted by the statutory due date.</P>

      <P>Under EU Commission Regulations on State Aid all selective or regional business tax incentives must have the Commission's approval prior to their introduction.  However, no such EU constraint arises in connection with the residential tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme and for this reason I introduced the residential tax incentives with effect from 1 June 1998.</P>
      <P>There have been problems in obtaining the necessary EU Commission approval for the business tax incentives despite the fact that they were discussed with the EU Commission in Burssels at meetings in February, May and July 1998.  The two business tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme are the capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of industrial and commercial buildings and the double rent relief for the lessees of such buildings.  These same two reliefs were the subject of formal notification sent to the EU Commission at the end January 1998 in connection with an extension to the Custom House Dock Area in Dublin.  I decided that it would be advisable to wait until these two reliefs were processed by the EU Commission for the Custom House Dock Area before formally notifying them again to the Commission for the rural renewal scheme given that the reliefs were the same in both cases.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the views of the Commission in regard to the Custom House Docks Area scheme should clearly be of assistance in negotiating for the rural renewal scheme in respect of these two reliefs.</P>
      <P>However, as the Commission had not yet approved the Custom House Docks Scheme by mid-September I decided that the Commission should be formally notified immediately of the Rural Renewal Scheme.  The formal notification was made on 17 September, although as I have said the Commission has had actual knowledge of this scheme for some time arising from my Department's representations to them in the matter. The timescale for dealing with the application is a matter for the EU Commission and every effort will be made to assist the Commission in processing the applicationas quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, to date, information has been received in relation to payments of rent subsidies made by the Eastern Health Board for the year ended 5 April 1996. The information supplied contains details of 34,128 tenancies in respect of which subsidies totalling £31.7 million were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the earlier reply, the information supplied does not include details of the landlords of the premises in respect of which the <Col N="1645" /> subsidies were paid.  Details of rent subsidies are held on the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, DSCFA, computer system.  It is understood by the Revenue Commissioners that, for reasons connected with the Data Protection Act 1998, the DSCFA computer does not include landlord details.  This information is maintained on the individual applicant's file, which is a manual record, held in the health boards. Extraction of the landlord details from these files is causing difficulties for the health boards.</P>
    <P>The details supplied in relation to payments made by the Eastern Health Board in the year 1995/96 were taken from the DSCFA computer system and were supplied as an interim measure to enable Revenue to assess the usefulness of the information.  The information was found to be of limited value to Revenue, because it did not contain details of the landlords of the premises in question.  Tracing the identity of the landlord would involve an unjustifiable expenditure of Revenue resources because this information is already available to the health boards and is required to be supplied by them to Revenue.  The health boards, through the DSCFA, which represents the health boards in this regard, have been advised of the position and been requested to supply full returns, including details of each landlord's name and address, for the years 1995-96 and 1996-97.  The return for the year 1997-98 will be due on 31 January 1999.</P>
    <P>A return of payments made in one week in August 1998 has been received from the Midland Health Board.  This return includes details of 1,554 tenancies and also details of the landlords to whom the payments were made.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Revenue and the DSCFA are continuing to explore ways in which the health boards can fully comply with their obligations under section 888 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the availability of historical data relating to the income tax system is directly influenced by the need to have significantly over 90 per cent of tax returns represented in the figures.  Because of the return filing date for self-assessment returns from Schedule D taxpayers, the most recent year for which relatively complete and comparable data can be provided for both Schedule D and PAYE income distribution is 1995-96.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information provided in Parliamentary <Col N="1646" /> Question No. 213 of 20 October 1998, includes figures on rental income which were included in self-assessment returns for 1995-96.  Statistics on these returns were processed at 27 April, 1998 having reached a level of coverage representing some 93 per cent of the total returns expected. Self-assessment returns for the income tax year 1996-97 have not yet reached the appropriate level of coverage but are expected to do so by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The rates of VAT applicable to non-State traders providing goods or services in Ireland are, generally, the same as those which apply to domestic providers.</P>
      <P>The supply and installation of alarm systems where they are installed as fixtures is liable to VAT at the lower rate of 12.5 per cent.  This subject to the condition that the cost of the equipment itself (that is, the cost, excluding VAT, to the service contractor) must not exceed two-thirds of the total charge to the customer.</P>
      <P>If the cost of the equipment exceeds two-thirds of the total price, or if the equipment is simply purchased without installation, then the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent applies.</P>
      <P>In either case if the supply is inclusive of a monitoring charge then the total supply is also subject to VAT at 21 per cent.</P>

      <P>Ordance Survey Ireland (OSI) has had an agreement with the County and City Managers Association licensing them to use OSI mapping products for internal use.  Each local authority had the option under that agreement permitting them to offer copying services of the mapping products to the general public.  During the term of the 1993-97 agreement, only three of the local authorities availed of the option.  The return of revenue from these local authorities to OSI suggested that there was little or no interest in the service.  As a result, OSI did not include this option in the recently signed agreement covering the period 1998-2002.</P>
      <P>OSI is setting up a new service under which agents can supply OSI place maps from a locally installed computer database.  This is intended to be a service which will more fully meet the requirements of customers.  OSI is in discussion with a number of interested local authorities with a view to their offering the service to the general public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> I am very much aware of the concerns of consumers in relation to genetically engineered food. The primary purpose of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, enacted in July, is the protection of consumers and this is reflected in the structure of the authority.  In addition to the authority's governing board, provision has been made for a 24-member consultative council which will provide a forum for consumer representatives to voice their concerns.  The authority's scientific committee has also established a GMO and novel foods sub-committee which serves to advise me on issues in this area together with affording a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology.</P>
    <P>There are strict legislative controls on the genetic modification of foodstuffs and my Department is responsible for the implementation of the relevant European Community measures in this area.</P>
    <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients was adopted in February 1997 by the European Parliament and Council. This regulation applies to the placing on the market of foods and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community. Foods which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within the scope of the regulation, which came into effect in all member states in mid-May of last year.  The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved/authorised before being placed on the European market.  It ensures that common rules and procedures in relation to novel foods and novel food ingredients apply across all member states of the European Union.  These controls provide protection to consumers and the matter will be kept under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>The regulation also contains provisions for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients. Essentially, there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property (e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food) which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.  There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population; material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 provides for additional specific labelling requirements in respect of two genetically modified products and their derivatives (a genetically modified soya and a genetically modified maize) which were placed <Col N="1651" /> on the market in Europe before the coming into force of the Novel Foods Regulation in May 1997, and which would have fallen within the scope of the Novel Foods Regulation if it had been in force at the time.  This regulation was adopted by council on 26th May 1998 and came into force in every EU member state on 1 September.</P>
    <P>The labelling requirements for novel foods contained in Regulations (EC) No. 258/97 and 1139/98 are in addition to the general national and EU food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the latest EU measures on labelling, my Department is in consultation with both the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and representatives of industry to ensure that consumers are informed to the greatest degree possible in relation to genetic modification of foodstuffs. This issue is also the subject of ongoing discussions at EU level and I can assure the Deputy that in these discussions Ireland will continue to press other member states to address the consumer concerns which exist in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 394 and 410 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, as Minister for Health and Children, I no longer have any statutory role in relation to the authorising or licensing of medicines, but that the responsibility for the regulatory control of medicinal products is now vested in the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>The legal position in relation to the use of medicines is that, under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, a medicinal product may only be placed on the market in Ireland provided that it is the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board.  Before granting such an authorisation the board must be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> The position in relation to the product referred to by the Deputy is that the drug in question is still classified as an investigational new drug.  I have been advised that, although an application for permission to conduct a clinical trial was previously submitted to the Irish Medicines Board, after examination, the application was rejected by the board as it failed to meet the required standards. As a result, no permission to conduct a clinical trial on this drug has ever been granted, nor is there any further application for such a permission currently pending.  Furthermore, as no product authorisation has been granted for the product, nor has any application for an authorisation been submitted, neither the safety, quality or efficacy of the product has been established.</P>
    <P>Recently reports have been received by the Irish Medicines Board which would suggest that clinical trials on this drug have been carried out without the permission of the board as required by the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987-1990. These reports are currently the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>I have recently received requests for an authorisation or licence permitting the importation of the drug from the United States.  However, there is no statutory basis for the issuing of such a licence, other than in accordance with the statutory regulations to which I have referred.  The regulations do, however, permit the importation of unlicensed products where the importation or sale of a medicinal product is by or to the order of a registered medical practitioner or registered dentist for the treatment of a patient in his care, or the importation of the medicinal product is by a person for his own personal use, not being an importation resulting directly from any mail order advertisement directed at members of the public.</P>
    <P>The parties who requested licences to import the product have been advised of the legal situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowan) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 425 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of planned temporary hospital bed closures for the final quarter of 1998 are set out <Col N="1653" /> in the attached table.  The average monthly ber of beds closed will be in the region of 456. This represents approximately 3.7 per cent of the total number of 12,267 acute hospital beds available nationally.  The 456 beds are located in 25 different hospitals out of a total of 55 hospitals nationally.  Temporary bed closures in the final quarter of the year normally take place in the lead up to the Christmas period due to annual leave and reductions in elective admissions.</P>
    <P>When temporary bed closures occur they are generally not confined to particular specialties but are spread across the range of specialties provided in a hospital.  In this regard if closures occur in a ward normally associated with a particular speciality, patients due for treatment in that speciality would be accommodated elsewhere in the hospital.</P>
    <P>It is important that temporary bed closures are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans.  In this context, the number of overnight beds in the system at any given time <Col N="1654" /> does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  For example trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to June 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day activity is 9.7 per cent.  This significent increase in day work clearly underlines the fact that a temporary reduction in bed numbers in any given location will not necessarily correlate to a similar reduction in activity in terms of total bed days used.</P>
    <P>My Department does not collect information on out-patient appointment cancellations.  While in certain circumstances in-patient beds may be closed on a temporary basis to enable activity to be brought in line with service plan targets and available funding, out-patient appointment cancellations are normally not directly used for these purposes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396, 397, 401 and 452 together. The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services, such as respite and residential services, community therapy services, home support services, <Col N="1657" /> including personal assistance services and the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officers of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of services in their functional area.</P>
      <P>In 1998, funding totalling £8.4 million was provided for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of this funding £2.4 million was allocated for the provision of existing services, £3 million was allocated to the health boards to decide, in consultation with their local co-ordinating committees, on the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities in their functional areas and £3 million was allocated for capital projects, including £1 million allocated to the health boards to address their waiting lists for aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in June 1997, this Government has provided funding totalling £18.4 million for health and personal social services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  I am not yet, however in a position to comment on the overall level of funding available in 1999.</P>

The board has indicated that it is hoped that a residential placement will be provided in the next two weeks for the person referred to by the Deputy.  This placement, I understand, will be a provisional one in a community residence in the catchment area of St. Brendan's Hospital for a number of months until a suitable permanent placement becomes available for him in a high-support community residence in the catchment area of St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The development of new facilities at the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf is an important element of the overall development of rehabilitation services in North Dublin.  Following the completion of the first phase of the new development in 1996, a project team comprising representatives of the hospital and officials from my Department began work on a development brief for the second phase of the work required at the hospital.  The brief for the second phase of the development includes provision for: three 32 bed wards; physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities; X-ray and out-patients departments; new kitchen and canteen; boiler room and service accommodation; and new main entrance and reception area.</P>
      <P>The brief was submitted to my Department in December 1996 and is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department met the secretary-manager of the hospital on 23 June 1998 to discuss this issue and it was agreed that he would meet Eastern Health Board officials to discuss the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital's role within the health board area as a whole.  I have been informed that the hospital and the health board are working together to examine a number of service options and to this end they have agreed to set up a joint working group.</P>
      <P>I recognise the important role played by the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital in the North Dublin hospital service and I am committed to ensuring that the hospital has the necessary infrastructure to properly fulfil its role.  When my Department has been briefed on the outcome of this working group's deliberations, I will then be in a position to consider its proposals as favourably as possible within the constraints of the available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  Various steps are being taken to follow through on this commitment and ensure the introduction as soon as practicable of this new and highly complex service.</P>
      <P>An expert group was set up, comprising key personnel from the Mater and St. Vincent's Hospitals, Dublin and officials from this Department to examine the existing level of service for Irish patients.  The group has undertaken a detailed examination of heart/lung transplant services in the UK to establish whether the existing service can be improved in any way for Irish patients, while our own programme is being established.  The group has held discussions with four UK centres in recent months in this regard with a view to establishing a contractual arrangement with one of the centres for the treatment of Irish patients.  This work is at an advanced stage and I anticipate it will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In terms of advancing the local arrangements required to establish an Irish based programme, I announced in recent months, as part of the launch of a national strategy on cardiovascular health, that the Mater Hospital has been designated as the surgical site in Ireland for heart and lung transplants.  The Mater Hospital will provide this service, in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, which as the Deputy knows is the major centre in Ireland for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  The Mater Hospital, at the Department's request, is co-ordinating and preparing a detailed examination of the infrastructural and service issues involved in developing the programme. It is anticipated that a full submission will be available to the Department in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>A critical factor in the establishment of a successful programme in Ireland will be the training of the surgical, medical, nursing and support staff who will operate the unit.  It will be necessary to ensure that staff are equipped with the skills necessary to achieve results for the programme which are at least on a par with the best international standards.  It has been estimated that an initial training programme, linked with the UK, and lasting approximately two years will be required to ensure that staff are properly trained.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the establishment of a heart/lung transplant unit is being treated as a top priority and the importance attaching to the project has been emphasised to all parties involved. My Department will continue to work with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and other interested groups in implementing the new heart/lung transplant programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even through a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review the medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department will be having discussions with the health board chief <Col N="1661" /> executive officers regarding their views on these issues.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication including the drugs refund scheme whereby any expenditure by the family, on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <P>The issue of food allergies is one to which my Department attaches particular importance.  The health boards and voluntary hospitals have been alerted to the problem and have been asked to raise awareness of the issues amongst all appropriate medical personnel in the relevant hospital or health board area, including, in particular, general practitioners. Special emphasis has been placed on outlining such issues as the likely symptoms and the appropriate treatment of patients presenting allergic reactions.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland will play an important role in increasing public awareness in all areas of food safety and nutrition, including food allergies.  It may also consider conducting research into the causes and treatments of food allergies.</P>
      <P>St. James's Hospital, Dublin, has a dedicated allergy clinic which treats all allergies including food allergies.</P>
      <P>A critical issue for those who suffer from food allergies is that of food labelling.  My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for labour, trade and consumer affairs, is responsible for Directive 79/112/EEC concerning the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs.  The Directive (as amended) has been incorporated in the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982 to 1997.  Persons responsible for placing foodstuffs on the market must abide by the Regulations, which are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Compulsory labelling particulars include the indication of the list of ingredients in a manner specified in the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> The European Commission has tabled a draft proposal for a Directive amending Directive 79/112/EEC.  Under the draft proposal certain substances, which are recognised scientifically as being the source of allergies or intolerances, would have to be declared in the list of ingredients. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be urging the Commission to bring forward the draft directive at an early date.</P>

      <P>The statutory responsibility for the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the County Meath region lies with the North-Eastern Health Board.  The facility referred to by the Deputy was originally developed by the board to offer long-term residential placements together with respite facilities.  However, due to a number of unforeseen emergency cases which have arisen over the last eighteen months, the respite beds have been utilised by clients requiring full time residential placements.  The need for these placements resulted from elderly parents, who had been the main carers, being hospitalised and unable to continue to care for their adult son/daughter.  The North-Eastern Health Board has informed me that although only one respite place is currently available in this facility, the board is endeavouring to accommodate clients in need of respite care in conjunction with the voluntary mental handicap agencies which provide services in the region.  Earlier this year I also asked the health boards to begin to put in place mechanisms to assist them in managing the emergency cases which arise within their regions, with a view to providing continued access to respite facilities by those who require them.</P>
      <P>I understand that the development of further respite facilities, including one in the Navan area, has been identified as a priority need for the region.  I am not yet, however, in a position to comment on the overall level of funding which may be available for any particular service in 1999.</P>

      <P>The provision of mental health services in the County Donegal area is a matter for the North-Western Health Board.  The board has indicated that St. Agnes's ward in St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny will be developed to facilitate the establishment of a rehabilitation unit for older people. This will mean a change of use for this ward area. St. Agnes's ward currently accommodates 22 long-stay psychiatric patients as well as long-stay older people.  These patients will be accommodated in other wards on St. Conal's campus or in facilities for older people or existing psychiatric community facilities as appropriate to their individual needs.  As I indicated previously, the board is also planning to provide a number of supervised community residential facilities in County Donegal which will include accommodation for some patients who are currently in St. Conal's Hospital.</P>
      <P>I would point out the policy of affording people who have been residing in psychiatric hospitals the opportunity of living in community residences has been accepted by successive Governments as providing a much enhanced quality of life and independent living for these people.  The development of active rehabilitation services for patients is an integral part of this policy.</P>

      <P>Following consideration of the health service requirements of refugees and asylum seekers, including those who may have suffered from traumatic events such as torture, my Department identified the need to develop a psychological/counselling service for refugees and asylum seekers which would be associated with the medical service provided for this group by the Eastern Health Board.  This medical service is provided in a unit located in the Refugee Application Centre operated by the Department of Justice and Law Reform at Mount Street in Dublin. I have provided additional funding to the Eastern Health Board in 1998 to develop an appropriate psychological/counselling service for refugees and asylum seekers.  The association of the psychological/counselling service with the Eastern Health Board's medical unit for refugees and asylum seekers, together with its location in Dublin, was considered to best meet the needs of refugees and asylum seekers who require psychological support.  The service is currently based in the department of psychology at St. Brendan's Hospital pending a move to a more easily accessible location.</P>

      <P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy operates a private facility for people with alcohol related problems.  The policy adopted by successive Governments in relation to mental health services, including the treatment of alcohol related problems, is centred on a community based model with in-patient facilities as appropriate. Health boards are developing their alcohol treatment services in accordance with this policy and any available resources will necessarily be channelled towards the enhancement of community oriented services.  Nevertheless, a grant of £15,000 was recently provided to this organisation from national lottery funds towards it running costs. <Col N="1665" /> The question of providing further financial support for this organisation is essentially a matter for the Western Health Board in the context of its overall priorities for the provision of health services in the area.</P>

    <P>Each health board has the services of a full-time consultant orthodontist with the exception of the Midland Health Board.  The Midland Health Board has endeavoured on several occasions to recruit a consultant orthodontist but to date have been unsuccessful.  There are no full-time orthon-dontists in this board but services are provided by sessional orthodontists.</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic conditon.  Children are assessed therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department in 1985 to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to <Col N="1667" /> the orthodontic services including the 1985 guidelines. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>
    <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment and the maintenance of waiting lists for the Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the number of patients currently on the category two waiting list for assessment is 6,514.  Those assessed as requiring treatment are facilitated immediately.  The number of category three patients is currently 1,500.  As outlined in my reply to the Deputy to Question No. 251 on 13 October 1998 the resources currently available for orthodontic services do not permit the treatment of category three patients.  However, these patients are being assessed on a phased basis on the overall direction and supervision of the consultant orthodontist to establish the level of their treatment need.</P>
      <P>It is the board's intention to extend the regional orthodontic department at St. James's Hospital and to develop a second regional orthodontic department based at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services.  This group is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>
      <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>

      <P>The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989 set out statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and food premises and are designed to provide a code of hygienic standards to be observed by all those operating a food business.

      <P>Under Part IV of the regulations a health board is obliged to keep a register of all food premises.</P>
      <P>Article 42(1)(c) states that the local health authority shall:</P>
      <P>if one or more of the appropriate provisions are not complied with in respect of the premises or there are not suitable facilities for compliance with the appropriate provisions in respect of the food business carried on thereat and they do not consider it expedient to permit the food business to be carried out in the premises, refuse to register the premises and issue to the applicant for registration a notice informing him of such refusal and of the grounds therefor.</P>
      <P>Article 46(1) of these Regulations states:</P>
      <P>A person who is aggrieved by a decision of a health authority in relation to the refusal of such authority to register a food premises or to make provisional registration of a food premises unprovisional or in relation to the cancellation of the registration of a food premises under Article 44 may appeal in writing to the Minister against such decision within one month or such longer period as the Minister may, in any particular case, allow, of the date on which notice of such decision is issued.</P>

      <P>In relation to waiting time, I presume the Deputy is referring to waiting times for appointments for the taking of cervical smear tests, rather than the waiting period for the laboratory analysis of such tests.  I am informed by the South-Eastern Health Board that approximately 16,000 smear tests are carried out annually for women in its region.  In excess of 15,000 of these tests are taken by general practitioners/gynaecologists and in these situations there are no waiting lists.  The remaining smears, approximately 800, are carried out in health board community care clinics and the waiting period for appointments is as follows:</P>

    <P>I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that at no time were existing appointments for cervical smear tests terminated in the Carlow/Kilkenny community care area.  However, because of the waiting period for tests in this area a decision was made to refer all new patients to their general practitioner for smear tests until this waiting list has been eliminated.  The board will, however, continue to provide a service for patients who do not wish to have the procedure carried out by their general practitioner.</P>
    <P>In relation to the laboratory analysis of cervical smear tests, smears from the South-Eastern Health Board region are analysed in centres outside the health board area.  The majority of tests are sent to three centres; University College Hospital Galway, St. Anne's and St. Luke's, Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin. The waiting period for the analysis of tests in these centres ranges from 5 weeks to 8.5 weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to my Department's proposals for the establishment of an organised breast cancer screening programme.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, a major action plan was introduced to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>Following the launch of the cancer action plan, a national steering committee, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, was established to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer.  Since its establishment in April 1997 considerable progress has been made on a number of fronts.  The principal developments in this regard are:</P>
      <P>(i) The passage of the Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 which facilitated the development of a population register.  A population register for the programme has now been compiled.  It is currently being validated and fine-tuned and will be operational by the time screening commences.</P>
      <P>(ii) A decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for phase I of the programme in November 1997.  It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist. In addition, there will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote/rural areas within the three health boards in phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
      <P>(iii) The appointment of Dr. Jane Buttimer as project director for the programme in May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv) The establishment of the programme as a legal entity in September 1998 to facilitate the appointment of consultant and support staff as well as for budgetary control and financial accountability reasons.  To this end, the programme <Col N="1671" /> was recently established as a joint board under section 11 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>(v) Recent advertisements for dedicated consultant and support staff for the programme in the national press.  The recruitment process is now under way and interviews will take place in November and December 1998.</P>
    <P>(vi) Preparation of quality assurance guidelines by the national QA committee, which is a sub-committee of the national steering committee. The final report is expected this month.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start up date for the programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were recently placed in the national press.  Once the relevant staff are ready to take up their appointments we should be in a position to start the programme.</P>
    <P>I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start up costs and minor capital equipment. In addition, I recently approved the following capital allocations: £1,035,000 towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street (Mater Hospital) as a screening and assessment unit and also as head-quarters of the programme; and £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsequent phases of the programme, I will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place.</P>

    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with <Col N="1676" /> the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals.  However, as the determination of eligibility of the persons concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need to develop the home help service which provides a key service in supporting dependent people in their own homes.  Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be submitted to me and published shortly.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the recommendations of the report will be fully considered with a view to early implementation.  Although not within the terms of this study, I understand that the question of payments to home helps has been referred to.  In this regard, I acknowledge that the system of remuneration of home helps nationally needs to be addressed.  My department is currently examining how this might be achieved in the context of the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>The low-dose brachytherapy unit (selectron unit) was transferred from St. Anne's Hospital at the end of 1997, as part of the planned amalgamation of services from St. Anne's to St. Luke's.</P>
      <P>The unit became operational in St. Luke's Hospital in January 1998 and has been in continuous use up until 12 October 1998.  The unit has been temporarily out of commission since 12 October and returned to normal service yesterday, 2 November 1998.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that as well as the low dose brachytherapy service which had been provided at St. Anne's Hospital, an additional high dose selectron brachytherapy service has been in operation for the last number of years at St. Luke's Hospital.  This allows for some flexibility in the choice of treatment machines, particularly for cases of cervical cancer.  This service has not been affected by the recent curtailment of the selectron low dose rate brachytherapy service.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one-year full-time degree course which University College Galway is offering to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration/diploma programmes, the first of which was introduced in 1994.</P>
      <P>The position is that successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing registration / diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse.  Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification.  Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees.  I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the whole area of pre-registration nursing education and training was examined in depth by the Commission on <Col N="1681" /> Nursing.  The commission recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four year degree programme in each of the disciplines of general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing, approved by An Bord Altranais, which will encompass clinical placements, including twelve months continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service.  The commission envisaged that the start of the academic year in 2002 would be specified as the commencement date of the proposed new degree programme.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended that a forum be established by the Minister for Health and children involving the third level institutes, schools of nursing, health service providers and An Bord Altranais.  The objective of the forum would be to agree a strategy for the implementation of degree level pre-registration nursing education and training.  I am currently in the process of establishing such a forum, which will be expected to report within two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463, 464 and 465 together.</P>
      <P>The appointment of dentists to the Belmullet area and the provision of dental and orthodontic services to eligible persons in the area is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Western Health Board.  I understand that a competition has recently been advertised in the press for a dentist in the Belmullet region with a closing date of mid-October.  Arrangements are being made by the board to interview interested candidates.</P>
      <P>I understand that the last permanent appointment of a dentist in the Belmullet area was in 1994.  That person left the service in 1995.  A temporary dental officer was appointed in January 1998, this person left the service in August 1998.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Western Health Board provides secondary care orthodontic treatment services for its area through the consultant led orthodontic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> I have been advised by the board that the normal procedure that operates in the board's area is that school children are examined in sixth class by the board's dental officers attached to the local community care dental service.  Depending on the outcome of this screening process, children are then referred by the dental officer for further specialist orthodontic assessment by the professional staff attached to the regional orthodontic unit in Galway.  A subsidiary assessment clinic is held in Claremorris for the convenience of Mayo patients.</P>
    <P>There are a total of 18 primary schools in the Belmullet area.  Nine of these schools are currently serviced by two health board dental officers covering the area.  School children attending these nine schools will be referred for orthodontic assessment in the normal way following the screening process conducted by the schools' dental service during sixth class.  The remaining nine schools in the Belmullet area are serviced by a different dental team but due to the fact that a post is currently vacant, operational difficulties are currently being experienced in providing dental screening programmes in the schools.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated the board is endeavouring to have the post filled as urgently as possible.  In the meantime, special arrangements are being put in place to ensure that the children in sixth class are screened in the normal way.  The board's principal dental officer in Mayo is making arrangements in conjunction with the board's consultant orthodontist, to have these sixth class children examined and referred for further orthodontic specialist assessment as the need arises.  This will ensure that the children in all 18 schools in the Belmullet area have equity of access to the orthodontic service.  Depending on the outcome of the orthodontic assessment, children will then be put on the treatment waiting list in accordance with the qualifying eligibility criteria prescribed under my Department's guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Tom Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472 and 473 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted with health boards regarding the recent outbreaks of salmonella and they have reported no evidence that these outbreaks are associated with the presence of antibiotics in food.  However, I am aware of concerns relating to antibiotic-resistant organisms. Much international research has been carried out in this area and, at a European level, Ireland is involved in surveillance of antibiotic-resistant organisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the initiative of EU chief medical officers, a major international conference on this subject was held in Copenhagen in September 1998.  My Department was represented by the deputy chief medical officer and service providers were represested by a range of health care professionals. The Department of Agriculture and Food was also represented at the conference.  Arising from recommendations made at the conference, my Department is entering into discussions with appropriate agencies, including the new national <Col N="1688" /> disease surveillance unit, with a view to disseminating relevant information through the Irish health services and monitoring any further developments in this area.</P>
    <P>In addition the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has identified the need to improve systems for the typing of foodborne disease, to provide more detailed information and to provide better linkages between information systems dealing with diseases in both human and animal populations.  The authority has initiated a number of projects and has identified this area as a key priority in its work programme.</P>
    <P>However, it should be borne in mind that all foodborne bacteria, whether resistant to antibiotics or sensitive to antibiotics, are killed by cooking and that simple hygiene measures at all stages of the foodchain can prevent human foodborne diseases.  This point emphasises the need for continuing education in this area.</P>

      <P>Research in the area of electromagnetic radiation is carried out by bodies like the World Health Organisation, the International Radiation Protection Association and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.  I am advised that the general body of scientific evidence to date has not established substantive evidence of any adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields generated by mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>Research is on-going and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the International EMF Project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and mangnetic fields.</P>
      <P>At EU level the Council of Health Ministers is currently considering a recommendation on the subject of public exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This recommendation if adopted will establish a European wide standard which each members state will apply to its own country.  The measure as currently drafted provides <i>inter alia</i> for a system of on-going monitoring of the ambient exposure of the public to electromagnetic fields from all sources including mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports this measure and I will make a further statement on the matter when the European measure has been finalised.</P>

      <P>The most common charge is levied under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997.  A person is liable for a statutory charge, currently set at £25 per night subject to a maximum payment in any twelve consecutive months of £250, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  Medical card holders are exempt from this charge.</P>
      <P>Long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations.  Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment.  These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient <Col N="1692" /> Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.  These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.  Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.</P>
    <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance.  In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 and 531 together. <Col N="1693" /> The current situation under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1998, is that, while the Acts confer extensive powers on local authorities to preserve buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest, their use is discretionary.  Local authorities may include in their development plan objectives for the preservation of buildings or interior features of buildings which are of artistic, architectural or historic interest, and for the preservation of sites or places of archaeological interest.  If a building or archaeological site is included for preservation, planning permission is required for works of a kind that would normally be exempt.  Where a planning application is received for development which, in the opinion of the authority, would be unduly close to any site of archaeological interest or would detract from the appearance of any building of artistic, architectural or historic interest, the authority must notify a number of bodies, including the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Heritage Council and an Taisce, of the application and must take their submissions and observations into account when deciding on the application and on any conditions that may be imposed in granting permission.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and I announced a package of measures intended to significantly improve the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage.  These include the enactment of legislation which will make the protection of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest, a mandatory function of local authorities.  Authorities will also be obliged to have regard to any recommendations of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to protect particular structures.  A planning Bill to implement these proposals will be published shortly.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is also preparing a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory footing.  The inventory will act as a crucial database in identifying buildings throughout the State which are worthy of protection.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that older buildings of historic and archaeological interest may be registered on the Register of Historic Monuments or may be subject to a preservation order under the National Monuments Act, 1934 to 1994.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has responsibility in relation to legislation on national monuments which operates independently of the planning code.</P>

      <P>A new house grant is payable only where a house meets the conditions and the standards specified by my Department and set out in the explanatory memorandum (HA1) on new house grants supplied to each applicant for a grant.  In particular, construction of the house must be in compliance with the requirements of the building regulations.  The suitability of new materials used in the house must be demonstrated through certification by a competent body, such as the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)/Irish Agrement Board (IAB). In this case, the certification required is not available in respect of &ldquo;Euroflex&rdquo; piping which has been used in the house for hot water and central heating systems.  As a consequence, a new house grant is not payable and the applicants are being notified accordingly.</P>

It is a matter for each local authority to make appropriate provision for its own pay and pension costs and no specific funding is available from my Department for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The recent policy statement on waste management outlines a range of objectives and targets which should be achieved in order to give practical expression to the requirements of the waste hierarchy and improve national waste management performance.  A major objective is to reduce our current reliance on landfill, so that such facilities become a subsidiary element of an integrated waste infrastructure, dealing with residual waste which cannot be prevented or recovered.  The policy statement is addressed <Col N="1700" /> chiefly to local authorities, who will play a key role in the provision of the requisite infrastructure, within the framework of regional and local waste management plans.</P>
      <P>The four local authorities in the Dublin region have adopted a regional waste management strategy study and are currently engaged in the preparation of a joint waste management plan, which will incorporate proposals for infrastructural development.  Community organisations should address any concerns in this regard to these local authorities.</P>
      <P>In light of the responsibility of the local authorities for giving effect to waste policy and for decisions in respect of appropriate waste facilities, a meeting of the kind proposed would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 504, 515 and 528 together.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the new urban renewal scheme has been deferred until its terms, in so far as they relate to tax incentives for commercial and industrial development, have been approved by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The negotiations with the Commission are being led by the Department of Finance, with information, assistance and other support provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government as appropriate.  The negotiations are continuing with a view to resolving issues which have been raised by the Commission with regard to the future availability of certain urban renewal reliefs relating to business.  In the meantime the expert advisory panel has been examining the 78 integrated area plans submitted by local authorities so that decisions on designation of areas and the tax incentives to apply can be announced and the new scheme commenced as soon as possible after the completion of the current negotiations with the EU.</P>
      <P>Pending the making and announcing of these decisions, I am not in a position to specify the towns to be included in the new scheme.</P>

      <P>Where a driver tester is unable to fulfil test appointments, the tests would normally be carried out by a tester assigned to provide emergency cover for such eventualities or by the supervisory tester.  Where these, or other alternative arrangements, are not possible, the tests are rearranged for an early date.  Up to 10 October 1998 more than 97 per cent of appointments were met in the present year.  Every effort is made to manage the operation of the testing service to ensure the convenience of persons who have been given test appointments.</P>

      <P>I am advised that it would not be appropriate to prescribe a mandatory limit on the gradient of the driveway to a house in the building regulations.  The gradient of the driveway must be decided by the designer or builder taking into account all the circumstances, including the topography of the specific site and the needs of the potential purchaser or tenant.  It would not, therefore, be possible to lay down a hard and fast maximum gradient rule which would be appropriate in all cases.</P>
      <P>However, I agree it is desirable to have some general guidance in this area.  My Department will shortly issue an updated edition of the booklet &ldquo;Recommendations for Site Development Works for Housing Areas&rdquo; which will include a recommendation on gradients for driveways.  My Department accepts there are many sites where compliance with any general recommendation may not be possible if housing development is to be permitted.</P>

The remainder of the scheme is included in my Department's 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme as a scheme to be advanced through planning.  Mayo County Council's proposals and recommendations on the appointment of consultants for the detailed design of this element of the scheme are currently awaited.  The council's latest estimate of cost of the scheme, including the advance section, is £5 million.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 343 and 318 of 6 and 13 October 1998, respectively. The environmental protection legislative code provides adequate powers to local authorities, and the Environmental Protection Agency, where appropriate, to address problems of noise pollution.  In addition, any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise, giving reasonable cause for annoyance, abated.  It is a matter for the courts to decide on the evidential requirements in each particular case of alleged noise nuisance.  I have no proposals to <Col N="1713" /> amend the legislation in the manner proposed by the Deputy at this time.</P>

      <P>In July 1996 my Department issued Guidelines on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures. These guidelines set out a hierarchy of suitable locations for the siting of telecommunications masts and at paragraph 4.5 state that &ldquo;all applicants will be encouraged to share and will satisfy the authority that they have made a reasonable effort to share&rdquo;.  In carrying out their planning functions each planning authority is required to have regard to the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The interconnection regulations &mdash; S.I. No. 15 of 1998 &mdash; which the Minister for Public Enterprise signed into law earlier this year, provide that in cases where operators cannot come to an agreement on facility sharing, the Director of Telecommunications Regulations is empowered to intervene to resolve disputes.  The director may impose facility or property sharing arrangements after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views. Furthermore, I understand a Bill which will provide for an up-to-date and balanced regulatory regime in relation to the development of telecommunications infrastructure, including further provisions in regard to infrastructure sharing, is currently in preparation in the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 513 and 520 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, who by agreement with Fingal County Council are acting as lead authority for this project, are currently assessing tenders for the scheme.  The contract covers the construction of 1.2 km of urban single carriageway road from the existing Ayrfield-Hole-in-the-wall Road to the Baldoyle Industrial Estate, including a roundabout and a bridge over the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  The corporation expect construction to start shortly and it is expected that it will take 56 weeks to complete the works.  When completed the road will connect to the existing road linking the Grange Road to the M1-M50 interchange.</P>
      <P>The corporation were allocated £1 million in February 1998 towards the project under the EU co-financed grants scheme.  Subsequently in July 1998, the corporation requested my Department's approval to the transfer of £275,000 of this allocation to another project.  This was agreed, thus reducing the Grange Road allocation to £725,000 in 1998.  The corporation has recently submitted three proposals to my Department for funding totalling £4.07 million in 1999 under the EU scheme.  These proposals include an application for further funding of £3.52 million for the Grange Road, Baldoyle project.</P>
      <P>This application, together with all other applications under the EU co-financed scheme, is currently under consideration in my Department. Decisions in relation to the selection of projects for funding in 1999 will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>While the planning acts confer extensive powers on local authorities to preserve trees their use is discretionary.  The primary mechanism available to a planning authority in relation to tree preservation and protection is its discretionary power to make a tree preservation order, under section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended.  Planning authorities may also include objectives which will afford protection to trees in their development plans, and, when granting planning permission, they can impose conditions requiring developers to preserve particular trees.  My Department issued comprehensive guidelines for planning authorities concerning the use of tree preservation orders in March 1994 which reminded planning authorities of the <Col N="1719" /> important role they play in preserving trees of amenity value in their area.</P>
      <P>In the current review of planning legislation the existing provisions in the planning code regarding tree preservation orders are being examined with a view to updating and simplifying the procedures used to make these orders.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 533 and 545 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.</P>
      <P>However, a number of self-employed persons, who were aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988, when social insurance was extended to the self-employed, failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension because they could not satisfy the ten year qualifying condition, outlined above.</P>
      <P>Prior to the general election last year, in our election manifesto a commitment was made to introduce new arrangements to tackle this problem, and in accordance with this commitment, I have, for the last year, been exploring a number of options to alleviate the difficulties experienced by this group of people.</P>
      <P>I have now decided that the most equitable way to address the issue is through the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for those self-employed who were over the age of 56 in 1988 and who have between five and ten years contributions paid since April 1988.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that up to 10,000 people 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of £18 million in a full year.  The total estimated cumulative cost of the measure in the future is over £170 million.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware, from discussions and correspondence with representative groups in the construction industry, of allegations that some persons are being forced into involuntary self-employment to obtain work. It is not possible to establish the extent to which these allegations are correct.</P>
      <P>The C45 system is designed for persons who are self-employed sub-contractors.  Under this system principals and sub-contractors creating self-employed contractual arrangements must both sign a declaration that the contract is a self-employment contract.</P>
      <P>The fact, however, that an agreement is made between a contractor and a sub-contractor to operate the C45 system does not automatically mean that a contract for service situation applies. Ultimately, it is a matter for deciding officers in my Department and, if necessary, the social welfare appeals office to decide whether a self-employment situation exists, or whether an individual is employed under a contract of service and hence fully insurable under the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing contact with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to taking whatever additional measures are necessary to ensure that contractors and sub-contractors in the construction industry fully comply with their legal obligations.  My Department's inspectors make some 7,500 visits each year to employers, many in the construction industry, to ensure that they are complying with legal obligations under social welfare law.  One aspect of these inspections is to ensure that the correct class of PRSI is applied to persons found in employment.</P>
      <P>My Department has also taken steps to ensure people working in the construction industry are aware of the differences between employment and self-employment.  In this connection a guide, jointly prepared by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, has recently been made available to outline the distinguishing features of each type of arrangement and the importance of the issue as far as social welfare entitlements are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to whether a person or company is entitled to tender for a publicly funded contract, I am aware there are guidelines drawn up by the Department of Finance which require that those <Col N="1721" /> seeking these contracts must have a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. Such a certificate is given only to those whose tax and PRSI affairs are in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 budget provided for an increase of £10 per week in the income thresholds used to determine the level of family income supplement payable.  In addition, it provided for the first step towards the calculation of FIS on a net income basis by providing that income was to be assessed net of PRSI contributions, levies and superannuation payments.</P>
      <P>These measures took effect in June, 1997 at which time some 12,045 families were in receipt of the payment.  By end September 1998 that number had risen to 12,973.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in this Government's first budget in 1998 we provided for the assessment of income on a net basis for FIS purposes with effect from October 1998.  It is envisaged that this measure will enable more than 7,000 additional families to qualify for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision the rate of take-up of FIS.  Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment.  Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35 per cent and 38 per cent of potential expenditure. It should be noted, however, that the number <Col N="1723" /> of claimants has continued to rise in the interim &mdash; from some 10,600 claimants at the end of 1994 to 12,973 at end September 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to take every opportunity to increase awareness of the scheme with a view to increasing the level of take-up.  For instance, information on FIS is provided on child benefit payable order books and by the Revenue Commissioners when they issue tax free allowances. Both of these measures ensure that information in relation to the scheme is available in every eligible household in the country.  In addition, the scheme is extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.</P>

      <P>The imminent establishment of the Foundation for Investing in Communities arises from the provision of £750,000 in the 1998 budget for the creation of a community trust &mdash; an organisation which would support and fund voluntary and community activity, additional to that already supported by the State.</P>
      <P>This joint venture between employers and the State has as its objective the provision of a new funding and support source for voluntary and community activity in Ireland and underlines Government and business commitment to a process of social inclusion in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new body will concentrate initially on the following areas of activity: the continued development of local enterprise networks, as funded and supported currently through The Enterprise Trust, which will form part of the new foundation; support for voluntary and community based projects on the basis of additionality rather than duplication of existing funded activities; and seeking new ways of addressing the needs of disadvantaged children, including supporting research into the root causes of disadvantage among children, and distributing funds to voluntary and community organisations involved in the welfare of <Col N="1725" /> children on the basis of additionality rather than duplication.</P>
    <P>Following the deliberations of an interdepartmental working group, a steering committee was established with the aim of setting up a new body along these lines.  The task of the steering committee was, <i>inter alia</i>, to look at ways of optimising the development of and benefits from the concept of voluntary participation; to put in train the setting up of a community trust-foundation this year, either as a company or charity, using funds available from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and The Enterprise Trust; to consider the make-up of a board of directors and supporting organisational structures for the Trust-Foundation, based on the following principles: that the board should not be seen as &ldquo;representational&rdquo; in nature; an independent voluntary entity, setting policy and implementing strategies and should be clearly perceived as such; be supported in its work by advisory committees made up of relevant expertise, if that is considered appropriate; and of a size to allow for efficient working and be seen to reflect a model which is flexible, non-bureaucratic, innovative, and, most importantly, reflecting the energy and enthusiasm which is the hallmark of volunteering.</P>
    <P>The take of the steering committee also included keeping in touch with and developing co-operation with relevant initiatives in Northern Ireland; and considering a suitable name for the trust foundation.</P>
    <P>The steering committee's membership is as follows: Chair: Mr. John Hynes (An Post), Ms Deirdre Carroll (Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs), Ms Anna Lee (Combat Poverty Agency), Dr. T. Mitchell (Provost, Trinity College), Mr. Jim McCaffrey (Department of Finance), Mr. Tony Hynes (MD, Green Isle Food Group Limited), Mr. Steve Costello (MD, Marks and Spencer (Ireland) Limited, and Mr. Philip Mullally (The Enterprise Trust).</P>
    <P>The steering committee is currently completing its consideration of the above issues, and arrangements are being made to form a legal entity.</P>
    <P>I recognise that consultation and engagement with the voluntary sector is crucial for the success of this initiative and the establishment of advisory committees, as outlined above, will assist in harnessing the expertise that this sector has to offer. I understand that arrangements are in hand for the steering committee to meet representatives of the sector.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.  The Deputy will be aware that in September of this year, I introduced a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins, in recognition of the additional difficulties which may be faced by the parents of twins.  The full year cost of this measure amounts to some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>The question of further enhancing these arrangements is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and of other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and to certain people with disabilities under the age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  In addition, widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to free travel retain that entitlement. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last September, free travel passes had been issued to over 519,000 people at an estimated annual cost of more than £34 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a concession the spouse-partner of a free travel holder is also allowed to travel free when accompanying the free travel pass holder.  There <Col N="1727" /> are no plans at present to extend the concession of free travel currently available to spouses-partners of free travel pass holders, to allow the spouses-partners to travel alone.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the Deputy may have a particular case in mind, namely, that of a civilian employee of the Department of Defence.  The terms and conditions of such employment and occupational pension arrangements are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Defence.  Issues relating to public sector pensions are currently being examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
      <P>In relation to social welfare pensions, any person in industrial, commercial and service-type employment who is employed under a contract of service with reckonable earnings of £30 or more per week from all employments will pay pay related social insurance at the full rate &mdash; i.e. Class A. Under this class of social insurance contribution, entitlement is conferred to the full range of benefits available under the social welfare code, including, of course, the old age (contributory) or retirement pensions.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 548 and 549 together.</P>
      <P>A person who is engaged in long-term fostering of a child can qualify for one-parent family payment. Similarly, child dependant allowances will also be paid to a lone parent who is claiming for a foster child in addition to his-her own children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foster children are not specifically provided for in the regulations governing the operation of the one-parent family payment.  However, I am satisfied <Col N="1728" /> that the provisions are sufficiently flexible to accommodate people within the scheme, including those who are not married and who are engaged in long-term fostering of children and therefore changes to the regulations are not required.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there was a difficulty in a particular case recently, which the Deputy brought to the Department's attention, and that this has now been resolved.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>There were 11,138 persons in receipt of carer's allowance at the end of September 1998, of whom 9,052 &mdash; 81 per cent &mdash; were in receipt of a payment at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>In its An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed and launched by me last month.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the Government is committed to improving the situation of carers in our society.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people aged 66 or over who are in receipt of a welfare type payment.  It is also available to people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions.  In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement. To qualify, people must also be either living alone or otherwise satisfy this condition. <Col N="1729" /> The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older and disabled people to enable them to summon help in an emergency.  The allowance, which is only for landlines, covers the rental charges and a small number of free calls.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of all the free schemes is planned for 1999.  The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance has been completed and was published last month.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals put forward in the review concerns the relaxation of the full-time care and attention requirements to allow carers to undertake ten hours part-time work per week having due regard to the care recipients' needs.  This would be a further extension of the relaxation of these rules earlier in 1998 which allowed carers to attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities, for around ten hours per week, provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his-her absence.</P>
      <P>This proposal, and the other proposals contained in the review, are being considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>A person is not permitted <Col N="1730" /> as a general rule, to engage in work while receiving disability benefit.  Legislation provides, however that a person may, be granted an exemption from this rule where he-she is engaged in part-time work in the nature of rehabilitation or occupational therapy.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 13 February 1997 in respect of an incapacity certified as depression and asthma.  An application for permission to engage in part-time work for rehabilitative purposes was received on her behalf from the National Rehabilitation Board and was refused, following consultation with the medical adviser who has advised that, as the proposed part-time work does not differ significantly from the person's previous employment which she states had adversely affected her medical condition and which resulted in her incapacity for work, it would be neither rehabilitative nor therapeutic for her to commence such employment.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week &mdash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &mdash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last five years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £45 million in 1997.  This year a sum of £45.2 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of extending the fuel season by one week would cost almost £2 million.  Any extension to the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications and could be considered only in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account.</P>

      <P>The area at Tom Roe's Point is within a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated as such under the EU Birds Directive. The area is not proposed for designation under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>I understand that Drogheda Port Company has secured planning permission for this development having gone through a full environmental impact assessment procedure.  Therein it is provided that the eastern edge of the site at Tom Roe's Point, which faces out towards the SPA mudflats, would be realigned to provide a neat boundary at that extremity of the development.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged by the port company that the current site boundary or working boundary, does not exactly correspond with that for which planning permission has been granted.  The planning line has been exceeded in two relatively small locations.  In the two areas referred to, which are insignificant in overall terms, the material will be pulled back to the planning permission boundary line.  It is confirmed by the port company that, in compliance with the planning permission, trees and shrubs will be planted to provide a natural screen between the port development and the mudflats.  This will help eliminate any port activity disturbance to birds within the SPA mudflats.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that no long-term adverse impact will result from this encroachment into the SPA at Tom Roe's Point.  Whatever view may be taken of this situation by the planning authority, in the light of the reassurances given by the port authority I have no major concern about any nature conservation issue here at this time.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, will continue to monitor this development to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to avoid significant detrimental impacts on the SPA.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 557, 572, 578 and 583 together.</P>
      <P>I have received correspondence recently from APIC &mdash; Awareness, Publishing, Information, Communication, the National Arts and Disability Centre, with regard to the proposed closure of its operations this month.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of APIC in September 1997 and again in May this year at their request as they wished to provide me with information on their activities.  On the issue of funding I stressed to them that the revenue funding for arts organisations is not a matter for my Department but for An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; The Arts Council.  I advised them that An Chomhairle is an independent autonomous body which has statutory independence and that I have no function in its assessment or decisions on individual applications for grant assistance.</P>

    <P>The education programme is marketed by advertising in teachers' magazines such as <i>Intouch</i> and <i>Tuarascáil.</i>  Mail-shots are sent occasionally to those who have used the programme in the past, informing them of the ongoing service and also of new activities in the coming year.  Flyers advertising the programme were placed in ENFO in Dublin, which is visited by a large number of school groups.  In addition to this, the programme is advertised in Dúchas publications which are widely available and it will soon be advertised on the Heritage Ireland Internet Site.  All publicity is actively sought, including, this year, in the <i>Irish Times</i> Education and Living supplement on foot of which many inquiries were received.</P>
    <P>As the education programme has expanded in recent years a cottage in Glendalough has been renovated to accommodate it.  The Deputy may be interested to know that I propose to officially open the new Wicklow Mountains Education Centre on Friday next.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1996 licences for jaunting cars were issued by Killarney Urban District Council.  The numbers of licences issued by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department for the operation of jaunting cars in Killarney National Park since 1996 were as follows: 1996, 88; 1997, 93; 1998, 90.</P>

      <P>As the education centres referred to by the Deputy are both operated on contract for Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, the number of persons employed at the centres is a matter for the contractors concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been only one previous contract to run the Killarney National Park education centre, which covered the years 1989 and 1990.  The total amount paid on foot of that contract was £22,420. The education centre at Killarney National Park was run on an informal basis from 1990 to 1997 and accordingly no visitor figures are available. Dúchas has endeavoured to put the centre on a formal footing for some time and has reached agreement with Cappanlea outdoor education <Col N="1735" /> centre to run the centre and a contract will be signed shortly.</P>
    <P>The former contract to run the education centre at Knocksink spanned seven and a half years (including extensions) and involved direct payments totalling £158,854.  As the former contractor for the Knocksink education centre is no longer involved in it, the visitor numbers for previous years are not readily available to Dúchas.</P>
    <P>There are various education programmes in existence at other national parks.  A formal programme has been running at Wicklow Mountains National Park since 1992.  While there are no proposals at present to open full education centres at other national parks, the issue of education in national parks and nature reserves is reviewed from time to time.  Aside from site based education programmes, Dúchas rangers and other staff visit schools and other institutions to give educational talks.</P>

    <P>Note: The number of deer shot is based on data submitted by applicants in relation to the previous season.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 29 (3) of the wildlife Act, 1976, I as Minister, in determining applications under section 29, must have regard to the conservation requirements of the species of exempted wild mammal concerned and to the suitability of the applicant having regard to those requirements or the purposes of the Act.  It is the practice, for conservation reasons, to refuse applications based on lands where there is insufficient deer or on lands which have insufficient deer to support the number of applications based on such lands.  To date, three applications in the current season (98/99) have been refused on this basis.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements in relation to the issue of Deer Hunting licences under section 29 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 do not compromise the conservation status of the deer population.  However, the statutory provisions set <Col N="1739" /> out in section 29 are currently being reviewed in the context of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill and in the light of recent developments arising from the determination of the High Court in relation to the issue of licences to out of state residents under section 29 of the Act.</P>

      <P>My Department has no funds available to cover the preservation of national monuments other than those where I am the owner or guardian.  As I am neither the owner nor guardian of St. Mary's Church and graveyard, I am not in a position to fund its protection or restoration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, however, be aware that the main source of public funds for heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995.  Under that Act, the council has powers to provide advice and assistance (including financial assistance) in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage, including the built heritage.  The council is located in Rothe House, Kilkenny City (Telephone number 056-70777 and fax 056-70788).  It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of plans for a new system of protection and grant-aid for buildings and structures of interest which I have advanced in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Funding for grant-aid towards the cost of repair and maintenance of such buildings and structures is due to come on stream from next year.</P>

      <P>Scaffolding which is currently on site is intended to restrict public access to the tower area of the priory for safety reasons until essential works are carried out.  Works which it is intended to carry out this year include the provision of a pedestrian stile and an access for the disabled at the watergate, as well as the repair of a damaged wall.  It is intended to commence a more extensive programme of conversation works in 1999, and it will be necessary to retain the scaffolding for the duration of those works.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of medieval tiles have already been removed from the priory site and are in storage in my Department pending the completion of the archaeological report on the excavation at Kells Priory.  While a number of fragmented pieces of tiling remain on site and have been covered over for security reasons, I am not aware that these are under threat.  While the removal of these fragmented tiles to elsewhere on site would require the agreement of the National Museum of Ireland, I am sympathetically disposed to the idea of displaying this material on site.</P>
      <P>Adequate sign-posting of Kells Priory was provided in the village but, because of local objection, it was initally moved and then withdrawn pending agreement with local interests which I hope will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Craft gardeners in the Botanic Gardens were suspended from duty, arising from their refusal to co-operate with training programmes for Teagasc horticultural trainees and in response their union has taken strike action.</P>
      <P>It has been a traditional aspect of the gardeners duties to co-operate with practical training assessments for Teagasc horticultural trainees.  When Teagasc sought to revise the format of these assessments, the gardeners reactivated an earlier claim for a universal upgrading, which had been rejected by the Labour Court in 1992.  The claim was again rejected by the Labour Court in 1996. Since then my Department has made extensive efforts to reach an accommodation with the gardeners but unfortunately all such approaches have been rejected.  While my Department is, of course, anxious that this dispute be resolved at the earliest possible date I can see no useful purpose in my personal intervention in the dispute.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy is primarily one for An Post for which the Minister for Public Enterprise is responsible.  However, as Minister of State with responsibility for the offshore islands I have met with An Post to discuss this matter and I understand that it is still being carefully considered by them.  An Post have assured me of their continued commitment to the <Col N="1743" /> provision of services on the offshore islands and also of their desire to ensure that a post office will be available on the island in question and that it is hoped to make progress in this regard soon.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 120 of 8 October 1998, all papers relating to the matter raised by the Deputy may be inspected at the offices of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department. My private secretary will be pleased to arrange an appointment for the Deputy with Dúchas.</P>
      <P>The papers relating to this matter, including maps, are voluminous and consequently it is not possible to provide the data by means of an answer to a parliamentary question; nor would it be practical to provide it in written form to the public under either the Freedom of Information Act or the Freedom of Information on the Environment Regulations.  In such a situation special inspection arrangements would also be necessary.</P>

This review will also take into account the existing structures and resources in the remainder of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 July 1998 I appointed 20 members to the board of the new National Disability Authority (NDA).  In appointing persons to be members of the authority, I gave due regard to the desirability that a majority of the authority would be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers and that each member of the authority would have knowledge or experience of matters pertaining to disability or any other subject which would be of assistance to the authority in the performance of its functions. As a result, 13 of the 20 appointed members, or 65 per cent, have been drawn from people with disabilities or their families, a further three persons, or 15 per cent are representative of service providers and four members are representative of employers, unions and Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the important role which the Department of Education and Science has in regard to the provision of services to people with disabilities.  It is not unique in this regard.  I would also see a number of other Government Departments as having major roles to play in the development and improvement of these services. These would include the Departments of Health and Children, Social Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise Trade and Employment, Public Enterprise and Environment and Local <Col N="1745" /> Government.  I am confident that the authority appointed will carry out its functions effectively and that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for there to be direct representation of the relevant Departments for this to be achieved.  I do not consider that it would be helpful to have increased representation of Government Departments on the authority as this would have to be at the expense of representation of people with disabilities, their families and carers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main establishments dealing with juvenile justice both statutory and non-statutory for which my Department has responsibility are set out as follows:</P>
      <P>Garda:</P>
      <P>The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is an extra-statutory scheme to divert juveniles away from the judicial system, where possible. It provides for the cautioning and supervision of young offenders of 18 years or under as an alternative to prosecution.  Under the scheme an attempt is made to see why the juvenile in question has offended and where a problem is identified the juvenile liaison officer refers the family to the appropriate statutory or voluntary agency with expertise in the matter.  The JLO deal with the offender as an individual, a member of a family and a member of the community. Even where the actions of a child do not amount to a criminal offence parents/guardians regularly seek support and guidance from the Garda Síochána who will activate the scheme for the benefit of such children. There are currently in excess of 90 Garda personnel of various ranks directly involved in the operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Prisons:</P>
      <P>Male offenders aged 16 and 17 (and up to the age of 21) may be committed on remand or to serve a period of detention to St. Patrick's Institution.  Male offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to the four adult committal prisons, Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise Prisons.  Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the four adult committal prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield Place of Detention, Fort Mitchel and to Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.  Shanganagh Castle is an open centre reserved exclusively for male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years.</P>
      <P>Female offenders aged 17 years (and over) may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick Women's Prisons.  However, very few female offenders aged 17 years are committed to penal institutions each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offenders under the age of 15 years cannot be committed to a prison under any circumstances. Fifteen year old male offenders and 15 <Col N="1747" /> and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances. This can occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908, that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he or she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act.</P>
    <P>The legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 years will change on enactment of the Children Bill, 1996.  The Children Bill, 1996 proposes that where a court imposes a period of detention on a child, it shall, (a) Where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school (operated by the Department of Education and Science); (b) Where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, order the child to be detained in a place of detention (provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform).</P>
    <P>There are two non-statutory establishments under the aegis of the Probation and Welfare Service, namely Lions Villa Hostel and Cork Probation Hostel which deal with juvenile offenders from the ages of 14 to 17.  There are no statutory establishments under the Probation and Welfare Service of this Department that deal with juvenile justice.</P>
    <P>Courts:</P>
    <P>Matters relating to juvenile justice can be heard at any level in the courts, i.e. the District, Circuit, High or Supreme Courts, depending on the issue being considered.  It has been the practice, in the Dublin Metropolitan District, that juvenile cases at District Court level are heard in a separate designated building.</P>

      <P>When making an application for refugee status it is necessary for all asylum seekers to produce, as far as it is possible in their particular circumstances, some sort of evidence as to their identity i.e. passport, national identification card, driving licence or birth certificate. Most asylum seekers are not in a position to provide conclusive evidence of identification.  Each asylum seeker is provided with a card by my Department with their basic details and photograph. While this card does not guarantee the identity of the holder, it certifies that the person to whom the card relates has sought asylum in this country.  The asylum seeker's application reference number is quoted in case any third party needs to verify with my Department that the card actually relates to an asylum seeker.</P>
      <P>As I indicated earlier this year work is under way to facilitate the issue of a new asylum seeker card to all existing and new applicants by the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was originally received from the person referred to at the end of March this year.  However, the statutory application form had not been completed fully nor was all of the necessary documentation enclosed.  Accordingly, the application was returned.  The fully completed application form was received in my Department at the beginning of June.</P>
      <P>It might be of benefit if I outlined the procedures involved in processing an application for naturalisation.  Soon after a completed application is received, the documents submitted with each application (passport, birth certificate etc.) are examined, verified, and where all is in order, the original documents are returned to the applicant. A report is then sought from the Garda in relation to the applicant's financial circumstances, his/her character and any other information that is deemed appropriate in support, or otherwise, of the application.  The Garda usually conduct an interview with the applicant to obtain this information. Other inquiries related to work permits, tax affairs etc.  may also be necessary.  Finally, when all this information is received, the application is submitted to me for a decision. Because of all the elements involved together with the level of applications being received, this process usually takes in excess of 12 months to complete.</P>
      <P>The application of the person referred to is in the early stages of this process and it is likely to be well into next year before it is finalised.</P>

      <P>An application was received from the person referred to on 10 December 1996.  The application was not accepted because the applicant's status in the State was that of a student and students' permission to remain in the State is on the basis that they are here for a limited duration.  The application was returned along with the original supporting documentation to the applicant, through his solicitors, in February 1997. My Department has no record of any subsequent correspondence regarding this application.</P>
      <P>Because of all the elements involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation, coupled with the number of applications being received, the process normally takes in excess of 12 months from date of application to complete.</P>

He is due to appear in the Court of Criminal Appeal within the next few weeks.  Depending on the outcome of the appeal process he may wish to reactivate a request he made under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 for transfer to his own country.

      <P>Safety at sports fixtures is the responsibility in the first instance of those who organise events and those who own or administer the grounds or venue in which fixtures are held.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy in a previous reply, issues relating to crowd safety at sports fixtures are governed by a number of legislative provisions operating under the aegis of my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>For example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government advise that the Fire Services Act, 1981, places a duty on every person having control over certain premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises and to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an out-break of fire.  The Act also places a duty on any person on the premises to conduct themselves in such a way as to ensure that any person is not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of their behaviour.  The Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations, 1985, provide that in specified places of assembly, certain fire safety precautions relating to escape routes and exit doors should be taken by every person having control over a place of assembly and that a person in a place of assembly should not prevent or obstruct the person in control from complying with the regulations.  The Act also empowers fire authorities to inspect buildings and to serve fire safety notices on the owner or occupier prohibiting the use of all or part of a building. Provision is also made for recourse by a fire authority to the High Court in certain cases.</P>
      <P>The building, extension or material alteration of a sports building is governed by the national building regulations, made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I am advised by his Department that the Minister has issued technical guidance on compliance with the regulations.  Compliance is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of sports buildings who must obtain a fire safety certificate from the local building control authority prior to the commencement of work.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has advised me that issues in relation to public order and law enforcement at sports events would, of course, be a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Thus, local authorities and the Garda play a central role in assisting ground management in meeting their responsibilities and may, in certain circumstances, have to insist on specific measures being taken in order to achieve reasonable standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters relating to health and hygiene are the <Col N="1762" /> responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should contact the relevant Departments directly for any further information he may require regarding these matters.</P>

      <P>Grants of £5,000 and £10,000 were allocated to the club in question in 1993 and 1994 respectively under the sports capital programme. In line with standard procedures, payment of the grants is subject to the club providing specific documentation and information confirming that the development complies with the terms and condition of the programme.  My Department has recently been in contact with the club to arrange a meeting to discuss what information still outstanding is required in order for payment of the grant to be made.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme is currently being reviewed by my Department.  When the review is completed, which I expect will be towards the end of 1998, details of the new schemes will be widely publicised and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new programme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the carding scheme benefits Ireland's high performance players/athletes and incorporates innovative features such as the development of sports specific performance related criteria, and the provision of a range of sports science and medical support services.  As 1998 represents the scheme's first year of operation, a process of evaluation is in train to ensure the scheme's overall aims and effectiveness are maintained.  In addition, the Irish Sports Council will shortly be meeting with a number of national governing bodies of sport to discuss aspects of the sports specific criteria to be agreed for the 1999 scheme.</P>

      <P>The primary focus of the consultation process under the integrated services project was on end-users of services in the selected areas and front-line staff in State agencies and, therefore, the issue of direct consultation specifically with local elected representatives did not arise.  It was carried out under the auspices of ADM Ltd.  on behalf of the Inter-Departmental Policy Committee on Local Development.  An informal advisory group was established in each area to assist with the consultation process. Research teams for each of the target areas were chosen in consultation with the advisory group.</P>
      <P>In some areas, elected representatives may have been directly involved in the process in a personal capacity.  In other areas, localised fora, of which elected representatives are members, put forward nominees to the advisory groups.  In Dublin's NE inner city, for instance, the research/consultation process was carried out by the ISI group and built on work carried out by researchers over the past two years in which local representatives had been involved.</P>

The Bill addresses a number of issues, including the creation of a new framework for the future execution of sports policy, including policy in relation to sports bodies.  It is expected to have the Sports Council established on a statutory basis and operational in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The intention is to have the matter of recognition of individual sports and recreational activities for national lottery funding, including bridge, revisited in the context of the new framework.

    <P>Section 5.2 of the terms and conditions of the programme under which the grant was offered, specifically provides that &ldquo;an organisation which <Col N="1767" /> has been allocated grant-aid should arrange to have the relevant documentation submitted to the Department within three months from the date of grant allocation.  Failure to furnish this documentation or to communicate with the Department within a reasonable period following grant allocation may result in the grant being cancelled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the organisation on 1 July 1997 seeking additional information.  As no reply was received to this correspondence, two registered letters were issued on 25 June 1998 and 17 August 1998 informing the organisation that the grant would be withdrawn if a reply, outlining how it was proposed to draw down the grant, was not forthcoming.  As no reply was received to either of these letters, the grant was withdrawn on 1 October 1998 and the organisation was informed accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am currently examining a range of options, including the level of capitation rates to primary schools, with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.  It is important to note, however, that the difference in grant level between primary and post primary levels reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second-level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools.  In addition, the second-level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in my Department are examining all <Col N="1768" /> the issues involved.  When that review has been completed I will be in a position to decide on any further phasing out of the local contribution requirement.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.  While I am fully aware of the views of the education partners on this issue, there can be no question of a multi-annual agreement with the INTO, management bodies and parents.  Any increases in the capitation grant at primary level must, obviously, be considered in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The proposed engineering block is the latest component of a rolling capital programme of building works approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>Since 1990 almost £12 million has been invested in capital projects in Sligo Institute of Technology.  These include the national toolmaking centre, a new technology block, a new business innovation centre, the purchase of sections of St. Columba's hospital, the provision of a new main entrance, internal roads and additional car parking facilities, and extensive modifications to the existing building.  Provision has also been made for the purchase of replacement equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1997, I gave approval for a major £5.5 million extension to the institute which comprises <Col N="1769" /> 5,000m 2 of accommodation and will provide a new library, two new 128 seat lecture theatres, central administration and student services facilities.  This project is due for completion in the summer of 1999.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I gave approval to the Institute to proceed with a new languages and marketing building with £1.3 million in funding from the Exchequer and from the INTERREG Programme of the European Regional Development Fund.  I understand that the institute is in a position to invite tenders for the building work for this project.</P>
    <P>In late 1997 the governing body of the institute reviewed the institute's development plan and decided that the next phase of the institute's development should be the technological, engineering and computing facility.</P>
    <P>My Department gave approval for the appointment of a design team by the institute, and for the planning and design of the project to proceed. It is at an early stage of development, and will be implemented on a rolling basis, similar to previous capital projects at the institute.  The institute has been advised that the project must be designed to facilitate its implementation within a rolling capital programme.</P>
    <P>The timescale for the implementation of the project will be decided when a more advanced stage of planning has been reached and approved in the normal way.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the project is not being held up at this stage due to lack of funding, in fact it is only proceeding because of the funding which this Government has allocated.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 657, 658 and 659 together.</P>
      <P>The transport service to the school in question has been recently reorganised following the retirement of a contractor.  The school is now served by a bus which operates a feeder service to a post-primary centre and also caters for another national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to re-organise this service so as to <Col N="1770" /> ensure that pupils would be in a position to fulfil their minimum school day of 5 hours and 40 minutes.</P>
    <P>This service would arrive at school at 8.45 a.m. and depart at 2.30 p.m. Alternatively, the pupils could be set down at school at 9.45 a.m. and depart in the afternoon at 3.45 p.m. However, the school has advised my Department that neither of these options is acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, my Department is currently examining the position to establish whether any other arrangement can be offered. The Deputy will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The pupil teacher ratio in primary schools for the 1997-98 school year was 21.7:1. It is projected that this level will decrease to 21.2:1 in the current school year and fall to below 21.1:1 in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level for the 1997-98 school year was of the order of 15.64:1. In the current year, projected enrolments indicate a reduction of about 4,000.  Therefore, the actual pupil teacher ratio is anticipated to reduce further in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The latest avilable information (1995) relating to other EU member states indicates that at primary level the pupil teacher ratio varies between 11.3:1 in Denmark to 21.9:1 in the UK.  At second level, the ratio varies between 6.9:1 in Belgium (Flemish community) to 15.0:1 in Germany. These figures relate only to State funded schools, while data relating to Finland, Portugal, Greece, Luxembourg and The Netherlands is not available.</P>
      <P>Any further improvement on the PTR must be considered in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>There are 93 primary schools and 126 second level schools which have disadvantaged status and are not currently included in the home school community liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the equivalent of 103 additional teacher appointments would be required to extend the service to all first and second level schools with disadvantaged status.  It should be noted that some of the smaller primary schools involved could be quite adequately catered for on the basis of sharing a co-ordinator with an adjacent school.</P>
      <P>Primary schools are selected for inclusion in the home school community liaison scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the concentrations of disadvantaged children attending the schools.  In inviting second level schools to join the scheme, priority is given to schools which receive pupils from primary schools which are already in the scheme.</P>

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is currently in the final stages of preparation of the new programmes and it is intended that all curriculum statements and teacher guidelines, including those for science, will be introduced to schools within the current school year. Among the issues for which guidance will be provided is the question of curricular timetabling.</P>

      <P>The position is that arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement.  The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary. My Department's plan to complete the work of paying the arrears by September of this year was based on the required temporary staff being in place in the spring.  It was not possible, however, to appoint them until June, following protracted negotiations with staff unions.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, the pace of the work has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering phone queries between 10 and 12 in the morning in the case of secondary teachers and between 2.30 and 4.30 in the afternoon in the case of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before Christmas.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due by Christmas, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since I came into office, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers.  Specifically, I have ensure that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed. degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full-time postgraduate course.</P>

      <P>I have further decided that, from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Finally, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided that they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

      <P>My Department's focus is on support for the development of educational programmes in schools and in the youth services for the prevention of substance misuse.  This support is provided through the development of educational resource materials on substance misuse and through in-career development programmes for teachers.

      <P>My Department is finalising, at present, a set of educational resource materials on substance misuse prevention for primary schools, having previously developed materials for post-primary schools.  Substance misuse prevention education will be included as part of social, personal and health education in the revised curriculum for primary schools and it is envisaged that this subject will be introduced, as well, to the junior cycle curriculum at post-primary level.

      <P>It was indicated to the joint union body of St. Angela's College on 1 April 1998 that it was proposed to convert certain posts in the college to permanent positions as part of a process which would also see the conclusion of a PCW agreement for college staff.  In the period since 1 April, extensive contacts took place between my Department and college management with a view to expediting all relevant arrangements. However, the PCW agreements have not been processed as quickly as anticipated.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, my Department has chaired an intensive series of management-union meetings recently, involving all the relevant unions.  Those meetings were aimed at clarifying the individual staff members who are to be appointed in a permanent capacity.  Agreement has been reached on this and permanent appointments will take effect from 1 November 1998.  Formal letters of sanction are being prepared and will issue very soon.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 686, 718, 752 and 754 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of complaints concerning management issues at Carndonagh community school. These complaints related to the level of financial accountability to the board and the accuracy of returns of pupil enrolments submitted to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community schools are established under a deed of trust and managed by an 11 member board of management separate from my Department. The board comprises three representatives of the religious communities, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two parent and two teacher representatives.  The principal teacher of the school is a non-voting member of the board of management.  My Department is not represented on the board.  Each board is responsible for the governance and direction of the school and for the procedures in place to <Col N="1782" /> inform board members concerning the affairs of the school.  My Department provides guidance to boards in relation to school management generally and it also supports initiatives taken by the representative management body for boards &mdash; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &mdash; in this regard so as to ensure that best practice obtains.  Where internal board difficulties arise, these fall to be dealt with by the board in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The complaints received concerning Carndonagh community school were referred to the board of management for its consideration and report to the Department.  The board responded stating that it was satisfied with the accountability arrangements in place at the school.</P>
    <P>In March 1995, the school informed my Department of an error in the return of enrolments submitted for 1994-95 which resulted in an overstatement of pupils attending the school.  This error was the result of inadequate checking of the return before it was submitted to my Department. The board was reminded of its obligations to ensure that such returns are accurate and complete. Roll keeping procedures have been reviewed on a number of occasions since then and my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of pupil returns.</P>
    <P>My Department's internal audit unit visited the school in May 1996 to examine its operations and procedures and prepared a report on its findings. The board of management was requested to consider the report and outline the measures being taken to address weaknesses identified in the school's systems.  Following two further visits in 1997, the internal audit unit confirmed that progress was being made in upgrading procedures at the school but further work was required in a number of areas.  Outside accounting expertise was also sanctioned for the school.</P>
    <P>My Department has also met with members of the board in 1997 and 1998 and outlined to them the board's responsibilities for the overall management of the school and the need for improved procedures.  Guidance has been given to the board in relation to good management practice generally.</P>
    <P>The complaints made did not refer to any impropriety on the part of school management and my Department's inquiries have not uncovered any evidence in this regard.  The school has co-operated fully with my Department's inquiries and the board has undertaken to accept and implement the internal audit unit's recommendations.  However, a number of issues remain to be resolved and my Department will continue to monitor progress at the school in consultation with the board of management.</P>

      <P>The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of primary schools.  In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools.  The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase the awareness of the problem among school management, staff, pupils and parents.  A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>My Department investigates specific complaints which involve an alleged breach of the rules for national schools, including bullying complaints, but only after every effort has been made to resolve the matter at local level.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the comlaint received by my Department alleges bullying of the complainants' son by another pupil.  When the matter was originally brought to my Department's attention, my officials replied to the child's parents by outlining the responsibilities of the board of management of the school in relation to bullying and discipline and setting out the Department's complaints procedure.</P>
      <P>My officials subsequently received permission from the parents of the child to pursue the matter on their behalf with the board of management of the school.</P>
      <P>A report has been received from the board of management and is being considered in my Department.  In an effort to bring this matter to a conclusion, the local inspector has now been requested to interview the various parties involved, including the child's parents, and to submit a report on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the investigation will be concluded on receipt of the inspector's report and the child's parents will be informed of the outcome at that stage.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to conclude this matter as speedily as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> The 18th teaching post at the above school was lost at the end of the 1997-98 school year because the enrolment at the school had declined from 552 pupils in September 1996 to 519 pupils in September 1997.  The retention figure for the 18th teaching post was 541.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, in addition to a principal and 17 class teachers, the school also has the services of a remedial teacher, three special additional assistants and a shared resource teacher.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in light of the overall enrolment decline at the school I regret that I am unable to accede to the Deputy's request in this matter.</P>

      <P>The present pilot phase of the escort scheme is focused on facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools for children with physical disabilities, and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus or train at weekends.</P>

      <P>Thirty primary schools in County Mayo have been assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department.  This number of <Col N="1785" /> schools represents a substantial workload and it is not intended to allocate any more schools to the psychologist concerned.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that, during my time in office, my Department will begin to make psychological services available to all school children.  I therefore established a planning group in 1997 to advise me on the setting up of a national educational psychological service.  The Department of Health was represented on the planning group in order to ensure a coherent approach to the provision of psychological services for children.</P>
      <P>The report of the planning group for the service has now been published.  The report includes an account of the current availability of psychological services to children and young people, as well as recommendations as to the developments that will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all areas.  This includes liaison at local level between all providers of support services for children.  I have now set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased, orderly expansion of the national educational psychological service to all schools.  It will necessarily take some time before the service is universally available.</P>
      <P>It is my view that children of school age should have access to both clinical and educational psychologists so that they may receive the psychological support that is appropriate to their particular needs.  Representatives of my Department's psychological service have recently contacted the child care managers and other relevant officers of the regional health boards.  They have supplied them with the lists of schools that have been assigned to psychologists employed by my Department.  My Department's psychologists are prepared to work closely with their counterparts in the health services in order to ensure effective and coherent provision in the various regions.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have up to date data on the number of pupils with the conditions referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Children with dyslexia, dysgraphia and other similar conditions have access to a range of support services.  In some cases, the severity of the condition is such that placement in a special school or special class is the required response.  A range of such facilities is available.  Each facility operates at a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and pupils attending such facilities attract special increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>In other cases, the children can cope quite successfully in ordinary school settings with the assistance, if necessary, of the remedial, resource or visiting teacher service.  A total of 1,302 remedial teachers, 104 resource teachers and 42 visiting teachers are currently in place in the primary system.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available for the purchase of specialised equipment to support such children within the education system.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training progrmme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides an educational psychological service to all post-primary schools and to more than 700 primary schools.  The psychologists provide assessment services and advice to teachers and parents in respect of students with specific learning disabilities.</P>

      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The current position is that under the scheme all secondary schools with 200 pupils or more who do not already have a secretary are eligible for assistance.  In the case of primary schools the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>My Department has already included primary schools in the scheme which share the same campus or building and whose combined enrolments meet the qualifying threshold.  However, I am not in a position to extend the scheme at this stage to include schools other than those which satisfy the shared campus criteria.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 707 and 710 together.</P>
      <P>Two of the primary schools in Ballymun, Dublin 11, participated in the pilot-testing of the educational resource materials being developed by my Department, for the support of substance misuse prevention education programmes in primary schools, when this pilot-testing began at the beginning of the school-year 1996-97.  After the first revision of these resource materials, in the summer of 1997, their use was extended to other primary schools and three more primary schools in Ballymun opted into the project.  The resource materials were further revised last summer after their use in schools was evaluated.  The full package of materials is being finalised and prepared now, in readiness for dissemination to primary schools generally, in the context of the introduction of social, personal and health education, as part of the revised primary school curriculum.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why the five primary schools in Ballymun, currently using the resource materials, should not continue to use them in support of their school programmes on substance misuse.  They will, of course, receive the revised set of resource materials when they become available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 719 and 741 together.</P>
      <P>The graduate diploma in education (primary teaching) is a full-time course of 18 months duration. It is designed to enable students having graduate status to train as primary teachers.  The content of this course is designed to provide students with the professional and academic foundation for teaching at primary level.  It seeks to equip students with the competence to teach at all levels of the primary school and students are required to have a mastery and competence in all the curricular areas of the primary school.</P>
      <P>The status of the graduate diploma must be equivalent to that of the bachelor of education degree.  It involves 16 weeks' teaching practice in primary schools.  In addition, in order to equip students to teach in schools where competence in Irish is required, all students must study professional Irish.  As schools in Ireland are predominantly denominational, students also complete a course leading to the certificate in religious studies. These latter requirements are not necessary in Britain or in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomalous position whereby, under the current higher education grant scheme, students who are studying overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, do not benefit from free fees even though they may be eligible for and awarded a full maintenance grant based on a means test; if he will ensure that financial assistance towards fees is also provided to these students, in particular the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Irish students, along with all other EU students, including UK students, who commence courses in the UK in 1998-99, will be asked to contribute up to £1,000 per annum towards tuition fees for undergraduate courses.  However, all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance from the UK authorities towards their undergraduate tuition fees, subject to the same conditions including means testing as will be applied to UK students.  Irish students must apply for assistance, to their appropriate UK local education authority.</P>
      <P>I would advise that the student in question contacts the appropriate UK local education authority to apply for grant assistance towards his tuition fees.  In this regard, I understand that the means test arrangements are such that students who qualify for maintenance grants under the higher education grant scheme will generally qualify for grant assistance towards their tuition fees.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the third level maintenance grants schemes were extended to include full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration, pursued in a university or third-level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds, in another EU member state.  Courses in colleges of further and higher education, which are at higher national diploma level or higher, are also covered under the schemes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, among the changes to the tuition fee arrangements in the UK, with effect from the 1998-99 academic year, the UK authorities are introducing an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000.  However, all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance from the UK authorities towards their undergraduate tuition fees, subject to the same conditions including means testing as will be applied to UK students. Irish students must apply for assistance, to their appropriate UK local education authority.</P>
      <P>At postgraduate level, a small number of postgraduate scholarships and fellowships for study abroad are awarded annually by foreign Governments to Irish students who are engaged in, or have completed, a course of third-level education. These would be mainly in EU countries and also in Switzerland, China, Japan and Australia.  My Deparment also awards a small number of scholarships to postgraduate students studying at the European University Institute in Florence.</P>

    <P>The estimate of the demographic dividend likely to emerge as a consequence of declining enrolments at both sectors is dependent on a broad range of variables.  These variables are subject to considerable fluctuation.  The actual dividend is determined following a close scrutiny of every single school's actual enrolment.  In the circumstances, <Col N="1797" /> I consider that accurately estimating the demographic dividend is difficult at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she-he is attending.</P>
      <P>In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college.  If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which she-he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.  However, where an independent mature student can produce supporting evidence that she-he is maintaining a residence other than his-her address while attending college, it will be open to the awarding authority to regard that address as the candidate's normal residence.</P>
      <P>I understand from Sligo Vocational Education Committee that the normal residence of the student in question is within 15 miles of the Institute of Technology Limerick and she has, therefore, been awarded the correct rate of grant.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  I have honoured this commitment with the introduction of a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses in the current academic year.</P>
      <P>The maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses was issued to the vocational education committees on 28 August 1998.  The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday, 16 October.  It is anticipated that vocational education committees will make the first payments to students, which will be retrospective to September 1998, in January 1999. From February 1999 payments will be made on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the new administrative arrangements which have had to be put in place for the introduction of this scheme, and also the number of students involved, I consider that January is a reasonable date to commence payments and I would reiterate that the payments will be retrospective to September 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 734 and 750 together.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools not already in receipt of clerical assistance on a full or part-time basis, under a scheme introduced in 1977 for the employment of school secretaries has been expanded in line with PESP/PCW undertakings. The current position is that all schools with 200 or more pupils are eligible for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>This scheme provides a grant to schools, which is not directly related to any objective pay scales. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The level and extent of the service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for caretaking and clerical services as resources permit.  The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per student in 1997 in respect of the costs of employing a secretary, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>
      <P>Regarding the community enterprise programme, I remind the Deputy that the responsibiity for the operation of FÁS schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the provision of additional assistance to schools for clerical services. This must be, of course, subject to available resources.</P>

      <P>Representations have been received from the two schools in question regarding their current staffing allocations.</P>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.</P>
      <P>Schools with disadvantaged status, including the schools in question, are entitled to a level of staffing which enables them to operate at a maximum class size of 29:1.  Schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the Breaking the Cycle scheme, including the schools in question, are entitled to a level of staffing which enables them to operate within a maximum class size of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  In line with the agreement referred to above, these staffing allocations are also determined by reference to the schools' enrolments at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>A member of my Department's inspectorate visited the schools in question recently and has reported that the staffing allocations in both cases are adequate to enable the schools to operate within the maximum class sizes referred to above.</P>

      <P>Since being appointed Minister I have effected substantial improvement in the capital funding of special schools.  It has been the practice for these schools to provide a local contribution of 15 per cent towards the cost of a capital project and last year I reduced this to 5 per cent.  These new arrangements have been widely welcomed by the special education sector.</P>
      <P>The question of harmonising the capital funding of all national schools is under consideration at present in the context of the work of the Commission on School Accommodation Needs.</P>

    <P>Traditionally where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.

    <P>For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty or physical impairment which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
    <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in assessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability, irrespective of whether they are brought to the attention of the Department, are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The change will not impact on the actual marking process.  All candidates, including those who may have a specific learning difficulty will, as in previous years, have their work assessed under the common marking scheme for the subject in question.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since I came into office I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers.  Specifically, I have ensured that there are more than 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during <Col N="1804" /> the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed. degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full time post-graduate course.</P>
      <P>In addition, B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for a degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who either have Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to Grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I have further decided that, from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Finally, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

      <P>I considered it inadvisable to publish the report during the summer, when many of the persons and organisations with an interest in the matter would have been unavailable due to holidays. Pressure of other commitments, including, most particularly, legislative commitments, since the summer break has meant that I have not had the opportunity to publish the report over the period. However, I intend to publish the report in the near future.</P>

Plans for this service were included in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to my recent decision whereby from 1 September 1998 all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this decision also applies to Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, provided they have attained at least Grade C at Higher Level Irish in the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A circular outlining the details of this new initiative is being finalised and will be distributed to all schools in the near future.  Thereafter, the <Col N="1808" /> necessary arrangements will be made to pay the trained substitute teacher salary rates to all persons to whom the provisions of the circular will apply.</P>

      <P>The psychological service to primary schools provided by my Department is still in the development stage.  As the Deputy is aware, this service is not yet available in County Waterford. However, I understand a psychologist has already assessed the student in question.  As his school has the services of a shared remedial teacher, it should be possible for the recommendations in the psychological report to be implemented.</P>
      <P>In 1997, I set up a planning group to survey the current availability of psychological services to students in schools and to make recommendations to me on the developments that would be necessary to ensure effective provision in all areas.  Its report has now been published.  I launched it publicly on 15 September and have set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased expansion of the psychological service to all schools.</P>

      <P>I have recently received the report of a working group which I set up last autumn to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlines a number of recommendations which have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers.  One of the main recommedations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department is in the process of initiating an awareness raising campaign by arranging for the dissemination of the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.  Furthermore, information leaflets and posters will also be distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential problems and outlining a range of local measures that can be adopted to alleviate them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the report has only recently been made available to me, but I can confirm that all aspects of it will be considered within my Department and appropriate action taken, including liaison with the Department of Health and Children, where necessary.</P>
