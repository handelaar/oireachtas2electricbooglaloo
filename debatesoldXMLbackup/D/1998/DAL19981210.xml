      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12, Supplementary Estimates [Votes 1, 10 and 15]; No. 27, Motion re Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1998; No. 30, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [1998] (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) No. 12, [Votes 1, 10 and 15] shall be moved together and shall be decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; and (2) No. 27 shall be decided without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my concern about motion No. 27.  Exactly a year ago there was a similar motion in order to allow for a review of the Central Fisheries Board.  We have had two consultants' reports and a value-for-money report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on inland fisheries, and the Minister wants to defer this for another year.  I am very unhappy with the timescale that is involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern. The review of the inland fisheries service boards is well advanced in the Department and will be submitted to the Minister shortly.  The Minister intends then to bring forward proposals to Government, early next year, in relation to the legislative, organisation and the operational changes that are needed.  The objective is to progress the scheme quickly with a view to publication of the Bill and passage through the Oireachtas in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be taking issue with me rather than understanding my concerns.  I am fully aware of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> All I am saying is that a year was given and nothing happened.  The Minister is looking for a further deferment.  I have already expressed my concerns privately to the Minister on this issue. There are many reports on central fisheries, but it is action we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has promised to introduce a disabilities Bill setting out the rights of persons with a disability together with a means of redress for those whose rights are denied.  Will this enable persons in wheelchairs who cannot get access to Dublin Bus to vindicate their rights? Will the Taoiseach explain why a decision was taken to invest several million pounds in Dublin Bus without requiring Dublin Bus to make their buses wheelchair accessible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is being prepared.  On the other matter, there are low-floored buses in service.  I understand that a prototype of a new double-decker bus is being set up at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join with me and other Members of this House in sending our congratulations to Oslo today to the joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize?  I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to a debate on Northern Ireland next week.  Will he structure the contribution from the Government side so as to bring us fully up to date in regard to the legislative programme we have to introduce in order to fulfil our side of the overall agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made arrangements for my officials to brief the Opposition leaders.  We will have the debate next week.  In the briefing we can look at the legislative base.  Much of the work I thought we would be able to do during November and December on the remit of the North-South bodies has not been possible as they are in no way agreed.  However, we will be able to make some progress on the other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has just admitted that the Government is behind on its legislative programme, will he and the Government be prepared to accept the Labour Party's Bill on the establishment of a human rights commission which meets all the needs set out in the British-Irish Agreement, including the incorporation into Irish domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>

      <P>My question refers to legislation, since the Government cannot produce its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said &mdash; I am sure the Deputy did hear me &mdash; was that we are unable to produce legislation on the North-South implementation bodies.  The reason for that is that these bodies have not been agreed.  That aspect involves legislation from Westminster and here. Another part of the legislative process involves human rights legislation.  As I have said many times in the House, the heads of that Bill are almost ready.  When they are ready they will go before a committee of the House where they will be discussed.  I am sure good proposals from the Labour Party or elsewhere can be discussed in that format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is still under consideration. The Government wants to do that. However, it is a matter of dealing with staff and related issues which have been the subject of negotiation for some time and in the context of which there has not been a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a motion on the Order Paper in my name and the names of other Deputies relating to taxi sharing legislation, the Taoiseach indicated yesterday that the whips could consider the matter.  The Fine Gael whip raised the matter with the Government Chief Whip.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to report to the House whether that legislation will be introduced in time for Christmas?  Those of us who were partying last night know how hard it is to get a taxi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a debate on taxis is scheduled for Tuesday night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which I tabled last year and which went through Second Stage.  An order was made for Committee Stage. The Taoiseach requested that the contents of the Bill be referred to the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.  It was considered by the committee and the principle of the Bill, which provides for a popular nomination by 20,000 citizens, was endorsed so enthusiastically that the committee decided to reduce the figure to 10,000. The report is now available and I am keen to get the legislation on to the Statute Book.  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration as to how we might progress the Bill and present it to the people for a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt comprehensively with <Col N="560" /> that issue on Tuesday during Question Time.  I made the point that the report would be discussed by the Cabinet, probably in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a Bill which is on the Order Paper, which went through Second Stage in the House and which, with my co-operation and at the request of the Taoiseach, was deferred for a committee view rather than proceeding to Committee Stage.  We now have the report of the committee and the Bill is ready to go to Committee Stage.  I am referring to the Bill rather than the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the Deputy will appreciate that this is one aspect of the third report of the all party constitutional review committee.  It would be far more beneficial if the Government deliberated on the totality of the report.  Otherwise we would have amendments willy-nilly on all aspects, as there are 15 recommendations which would require constitutional amendments.  The Government's effort will be to take the first, second and third reports, together with the reports due on the gender neutral issue and ambiguities in the Constitution regarding the English and Irish language translations, examine the totality of issues and then bring forward amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an order of the House which needs to be dealt with.  I do not want the order to be put on the long finger.  I am prepared to leave the matter until early in the next session, but I want a decision so that the order of the House can be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the point raised by Deputy Noonan, surely on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it is ironic that article 13 affirms the right to freedom of movement and yet people in wheelchairs cannot have access to buses.  Deputy Noonan referred to the disability legislation.  I wish to raise the Equal Status Bill which was due much sooner but which has been deferred.  It would guarantee some transport rights to people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave me figures for the top ten earners in the Prison Service in terms of overtime, ranging from £30,000 to £38,000.  In the light of this scandalous squandering of taxpayers' money, when does the Government propose introducing the Prison Service Bill to put in place an over-arching management system to manage the prisons in a proper manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is proceeding on this as a matter of priority and the legislation will be introduced sometime next year.  In the meantime the Minister has been working on an interim Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of today's business deals with Financial Resolutions.  Will the Deloitte and Touche report presented yesterday to the Minister for Health and Children regarding Tallaght Hospital be made available to Members so that we can contribute to the debate in a more informed manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated publicly yesterday that he has discussed the report with the board and is awaiting a response from it in the next few days.  As he stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be made available to Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be given to Members of the House at this stage.  Yesterday evening the Minister announced he will not make any further comment until he receives the hospital's response to the report.  The report is about the responsibilities of the hospital board and it would be inappropriate to make the report public before the board has had a proper opportunity of examining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.  At this stage it is important that the board members, whom the Minister met yesterday, respond.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the 1999 budget introduced by the Minister for Finance last week. Members, and the public generally, will already be fully aware of the principle features of the budget so I do not propose to dwell on the individual measures in it.  However, the strategies outlined by the Minister for Finance provide clear evidence of the determination by this Government to ensure it was a budget for the elderly and the lower paid and a budget to reward work.  It was also a budget to ensure the current levels of unprecedented economic growth are sustained, that the benefits of economic growth are maximised with significant steps being taken to maintain social inclusiveness and effect major personal tax reform to benefit the lower paid, by taking a further 80,000 people out of the tax net, the number increasing from 324,000 to 404,000 now out of the tax net.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This is five times the average number taken out in any other previous budget. The budget ensures the economy is managed in a prudent and effective way in planning for the longer term.  This budget was geared to providing better public services, better infrastructure with capital expenditure up by 30 per cent and long-term planning to take care of our increasingly ageing population in the future, thanks to dramatic changes in our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak about the work and objectives of my Department in developing a sustainable tourism sector, an active culture in sport and recreation and an enhanced partnership approach to local development.  I will elaborate on how the 1999 budget measures and increased Government funding will impact in supporting the strategies under way to develop these areas.  Over the past <Col N="567" /> ten years Ireland has climbed to the very top of the international tourism performance league with the number of visitors and, more importantly, foreign revenue earnings from tourism increasing annually.  In that period, overseas visitor numbers have more than doubled from 2.4 million to 5.2 million while foreign revenue earnings have almost trebled from £800 million to £2.1 billion.  Over the same period employment has doubled from 60,000 to 120,000.  Three out of every four jobs in tourism are full-time.  I have every reason to believe that 1998 will be yet another record breaking year for tourism nationally and Bord Fáilte's growth targets of 8 per cent in visitor numbers and 9 per cent in revenue in 1998 will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last week to secure by way of Supplementary Estimate further funding amounting to £6.4 million which will allow Bord Fáilte to reinforce and build on the activities and programmes initiated last year.  These extra resources will also support a special effort by the board to boost activity in continental markets, including Germany, where a number of initiatives are planned to redress the decline of recent years and to organise, with the representatives bodies, a special initiative involving the small players in the industry, such as bed and breakfasts, farmhouses and other guest houses to promote their facilities.</P>
    <P>The additional funds will facilitate a review and further development of the tourism brand Ireland project.  This is one of the major tools available to Ireland's tourism marketing effort and, as with any branding strategy, there is a requirement to review its progress and measure its vitality and impact.  Ensuring the effectiveness of tourism brand Ireland is essential if the challenge of creating further economic growth and employment in the years ahead is to be successfully met. The targets set for tourism in 1999 at 7 per cent growth in visitor numbers and 9 per cent in total foreign earnings are very challenging, particularly given the ever expanding tourism economic base as a competitive pressure facing the industry. However, the increased funding will help to ensure that Bord Fáilte's marketing campaigns reach a sufficient level to make the necessary impact in our core markets, and thereby achieve those targets.</P>
    <P>Virtually all capital funds under the operational programme for tourism projects have been committed.  However, the independent product management boards in Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development have worthwhile tourism projects on hand which merit funding support if such is available.  At the same time there is a possibility that decommitments will occur prior to the conclusion of the programme at the end of 1999.  The Government was concerned that because of the very strict deadlines in terms of approval and draw down of funds, any such decommitments might occur too late in the programme to allow them to be reallocated to other <Col N="568" /> projects.  Accordingly, to allow for an orderly completion of the programme, a special allocation of £6.5 million will be made available by the Government in 1999 to the Bord Fáilte product development board and £1 million to the Shannon Development product development board essentially to underwrite possible future decommitments.  These funds may be used only in respect of applications received in the normal way under the tourism operational programme.</P>
    <P>The contribution which two successive EU operational programmes for tourism have made to our recent tourism performance cannot be overstated.  They will have leveraged investment of £1 billion in product development, marketing and training.  We have delivered on key targets and demonstrated value for money in terms of use of EU funds.  There is no doubt that my Department has been active in preparing the most persuasive case possible for the continued funding of the tourism industry under the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Tourism has much to offer in terms of addressing many of the key priorities being put forward by the European Commission for the next round. These include protection of the environment, regional development, encouragement of small and medium sized enterprises, social training and employment creation.  Moreover, the potential level and depth of co-operation in tourism marketing on an all island basis is also something that the EU should be anxious to support.</P>
    <P>As regards the critical issue of a tourism destination marketing fund for post-1999 period, I am considering a range of options as to how such a fund might be constituted and operated on a partnership basis with the industry.  Given the uncertainty over future EU funding, we have to be prudent and consider all alternatives.  No decisions have been taken at this stage in terms of tourist levies but it is one option under consideration. Any such levies would have to be considered in the widest context, including the implications for tourism and the use of any funds raised.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in 1997 to approve grant assistance, up to a maximum of £5 million, towards the cost of implementing a bid to host the Special Olympics world summer games 2003 should it be successful.  Subsequently, Special Olympics International sought an interim guarantee of £2.5 million from the State against potential financial loss by the 2003 Special Olympics summer games organising committee.  It was impossible for the Government to issue an unconditional guarantee that it would undertake to underwrite any debts arising from the holding of the games.</P>
    <P>However, with the approval of the Minister for Finance and the agreement of the Government, I have informed Special Olympics Ireland that, in order to enable the games organising committee to step up the momentum of its fundraising efforts and to leverage financial backing on the scale required from other sources by the end of 1999, the allocation for the games in the 1999 Estimates will be increased from £250,000, as provided <Col N="569" /> in the Abridged Estimates, to £2.5 million, which represents 50 per cent of the total grant approved towards the cost of organising the 2003 games in Ireland.  Last week's budget made provision for the additional allocation and the new allocation will be published in the Revised Estimates for 1999.  The 2003 Special Olympics to be held in Ireland will be the biggest sporting event anywhere in the world in that year.  I was in contact with Mr. Tim Shriver during a recent visit to New York, where I also met Ambassador Jean Kennedy-Smith, and they assured me of their continued support for the event.  I am very hopeful of a positive announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to sports and recreation.  I very much welcome the additional moneys being made available by the Government for the sports capital programme in 1999, which will increase by £5.3 million or 58 per cent over the Estimate allocation in 1998.  The development of a quality infrastructure is crucial to the future of sport in Ireland.  In this context the sports capital programme administered by my Department is very important.  This programme provides National Lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sport and recreational facilities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, in the context of the 1998 round of grant allocations, I announced that I was initiating a comprehensive review of the programme. The review, which has been ongoing for a number of months, was undertaken in the context of the implementation of policy for sport and recreation in line with the commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The review of the programme, which I expect will be completed before Christmas, has involved the examination of the objectives, terms of reference and criteria for existing schemes and the role of other Departments and agencies in the provision of sport and recreation facilities.  The main objective of the review is to develop a new programme which will provide a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation, particularly in areas of greatest need and assist with the creation of opportunities to participate in sport and recreation through access to facilities, especially by young people.  Upon completion of the review, details of the revised programme will be widely publicised and it will be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement in the budget of £500,000 in 1999 for the Ridge project on the north side of Cork city.  This is a unique and ambitious project to transform 100 acres of land on the north-western ridge overlooking the city into an important focal point for sport and recreational activity for young people in the area. The total cost of the project is £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>As the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has responsibility for the sports capital <Col N="570" /> programme, which included provision for swimming pools, it is logical and reasonable that it should have the additional responsibility of the operation and management of the swimming pools programme.  In this regard I am conscious of the objective in my Department's strategy statement to adopt a more strategic approach to sports facility provision.  Having responsibility for both programmes will facilitate a more balanced and integrated approach to the provision of swimming pool facilities.</P>
    <P>The swimming pool programme is funded by surplus national lottery funds.  Under this programme, capital grants are available towards the approved cost of refurbishing an existing swimming pool and building a new pool, inclusive of the cost of modest ancillary facilities.  All proposals must be supported by the local authority. Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, in the first instance, by the local authority concerned.  Before supporting an application, the local authority would have to be satisfied the proposal is viable, the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and the project, when completed, will have a satisfactory level of access available to the public.</P>
    <P>I consider capital investment in this area to be positive and worthwhile.  Many counties do not have proper facilities and conditions and others leave a lot to be desired.  The vast majority of people using swimming pools are under 18 years of age and it is estimated that several thousand children are using pools every day.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government decided to initiate a tender procedure for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre pool.  This competition has attracted considerable interest from both the private and public sectors, and nine qualified candidates were issued with a comprehensive and detailed project brief.  The deadline for the submission of tenders was 27 November 1998 and the proposals received on that date will now undergo a detailed evaluation process with a decision expected early in the New Year.  The Government has agreed to provide capital grant assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, in my Department's Vote in 1999 towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, is currently before the House.  It provides for the establishment, for the first time in the history of the State, of a statutory agency exclusively dedicated to the promotion and development of sport.  The role of the new agency, to be known as the Irish Sports Council, will be to plan and support the future development of Irish sport in conjunction with the various sports organisations and thousands of volunteers throughout the country who have been sport's lifeblood in Ireland for generations. The introduction of this legislation has been one of the Government's priorities since coming into office and a key commitment in An Action Programme <Col N="571" /> for the Millennium.  I have every confidence that the new council, when established, will constitute the lynchpin of the Government's policy of securing a more focused, strategic approach to the future development of sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased Exchequer resources made available to my Department this year and in 1999.  The additional funds reflect the ongoing commitment and determination of the Government to develop tourism as a key sector of the Irish economy, a recognition that sport and recreation is a major contributor to the social and economic life of the country and provides an assurance to enhance the development framework to assist in the integrated approach to local development and related issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  I would like more time, but it contained so many nice things that many Members are anxious to express their thanks to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  No budget has been so well received as this one.  Last Wednesday I was extremely happy with what my fellow county man had achieved in presenting his second budget.  I only became worried when I read an article by Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien in the <i>Irish Independent</i> paying tribute to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister and the Government indicated that while the economy has been going through an exceptionally good period in recent years, certain areas still suffer serious disadvantage. It was with a view to tackling that problem that the Minister decided to focus attention on areas of greatest need.  The cake has not been spread equally throughout the country and the Minister tried to correct that imbalance last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The main aspects of the budget have been covered repeatedly but it is important to acknowledge the major changes in income tax. Some 80,000 workers will be removed from the tax net and the number of taxpayers in the marginal relief system will fall from 82,000 to just less than 25,000.  A number of Members expressed concern that work held no great attraction for young people because they might be better off on social welfare.  The fact that people will earn £100 per week before paying tax is a major advance and I hope we can continue such progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One provision in the budget which attracted much comment, some by people who were not aware of the full picture, was the change in betting duty.  The Minister has decided that from 1 July next, provided alternative arrangements are put in place for funding the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon, duty on off-course betting will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, and the levy on on-course betting will be abolished.  Many people thought it was because the Minister comes from Kildare and was familiar with horses and punters that he was giving them some corn, but it is not as simple as that.  Over the past few years there have been major changes <Col N="572" /> in the betting industry, not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  Off-shore bookmakers have been advertising for Irish clients and offering tax free facilities.  While we received £45 million in betting duty during the past year, that was threatened, as were jobs in the industry, by the 10 per cent tax rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the right decision in reducing the rate.  It will reduce the attraction of off-shore betting but in two to three years the amount of betting duty received by the Government will rise again and this step will have been self-financing.  When Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance he reduced betting tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and he received much criticism, but within three years revenue under the new rate had returned to the level received under the old rate.  For the first year or two there may be a smaller return but there will be accelerated growth in the amount of betting taking place.  In the long-term, the decision is in the interest of the Department of Finance and Ireland because revenue and jobs will be protected.  Thousands of people are employed in the racing industry and the issues are connected.  It was important that the Minister dealt with on and off course betting. They are interlinked and the Minister indicated that the funding will not be made available unless alternative arrangements are put in place.  I have spoken to a number of people involved in the racing industry and they welcome the Minister's decision.  I am sure all those involved will work out a new funding arrangement for the future.</P>
    <P>The price of a packet of cigarettes was increased by 5p in the budget.  There is a long tradition of smoking in Ireland.  Unfortunately, thousands of people are addicted to nicotine.  This is doing untold damage and having an enormous effect on people who are giving up their lives for the sake of a cigarette.  They also take up many beds in hospitals and the cost to the Exchequer is enormous.  This is aside from the personal cost to families and in terms of people's health.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce a ban on tobacco advertising.  It is important that such a ban is put in place quickly.  Successive Ministers have, for health reasons, increased the price of tobacCo. Sexy advertisements are sponsored by the tobacco industry, which is one of the most powerful industries in the world.  These campaigns are targeted particularly at young people because many of its older customers are dying and the industry must replace them.  I encourage the Minister for Health and Children to introduce such a measure as quickly as possible.  It would be in the interests of everybody.</P>

      <P>I welcome the budget which is good, just and fair.  The poor, the elderly and the disadvantaged will all benefit.  I particularly welcome the reduction in the tax burden on the lower paid and the provision of extra benefits for older people and the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Government entered a contract with the people.  The budget is a continuation of <Col N="573" /> the implementation of elements of that contract. The Minister is ensuring that the revenue generated by the economic boom is distributed to the less well off in our society.  Lower paid workers and people on social welfare share the benefits. The emphasis throughout is on social inclusion and improving living standards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of over 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net.  Nobody with an income under £100 a week will have to pay income tax.  This will provide more incentive to people to work by making it preferable to social welfare.  It will encourage more people to join the workforce. This should help alleviate the labour shortages in certain areas of employment.</P>
    <P>Farmers have suffered a great loss of income as a result of poor weather conditions and the collapse of the Russian market.  The Minister should be congratulated on the measures he has taken to date.  His continued commitment to agriculture is evident in the further new measures in the budget.  The introduction of the new farm assistance scheme to address severe income difficulties is most welcome.  This scheme will provide vital support for those worst hit.  It will benefit 13,600 farm families, or twice the number currently availing of the smallholders' scheme.  A further £15 million will be provided for the existing smallholders' assistance scheme, which is already worth £33 million a year.</P>
    <P>In excess of £40 million has been allocated to farm investment schemes next year.  These schemes were withdrawn by the rainbow Government. It is also worth noting that members of both left wing parties have continued to add insult to injury by their comments in recent months about developments in agriculture.  The farm pollution control and dairy hygiene schemes will facilitate more farmers to avail of the REP scheme.  In doing so, farmers can avail of £50 per acre which is payable under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the VAT refund worth almost £11 million in a full year.  I am glad the Minister has also looked after our elderly citizens and rewarded them for the sacrifices they made in order to create our healthy economy.  These people worked hard at a time when working conditions and pay were much worse than today.</P>
    <P>The £6 increase in contributory pensions and the increase of £13,000 per couple in the amount a pensioner can earn before tax is due are most welcome.  They will improve the quality of life of pensioners, particularly those who wish to remain gainfully occupied in later years.  The increase will remove 15,000 older people from the income tax net.  Approximately 10,000 people over the age of 70 will be eligible for medical cards for the first time because of a change in income guidelines. The introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for the self-employed, which includes farmers, is another positive step.</P>
    <P>The provision in the budget for remedial teaching services to every school is evidence of the Government's commitment to improving opportunity at all levels of education.  Access to <Col N="574" /> remedial teaching is most important and is a key element in ensuring that all children receive the best possible education.  This measure, together with the decision to give disadvantaged schools home liaison officers, is vital to the promotion of social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Other measures, such as the £50 million for rural water and sewerage schemes, are also welcome. They will help to address the problem of rural depopulation by encouraging industry and people to move to towns and villages.  The extra money for local authorities for disabled persons' and essential repairs grants will benefit those in need of changes to their homes to facilitate a disabled person.</P>
    <P>The valuable role of carers in society has been acknowledged by an allocation of £18 million in addition to an existing allocation of £45 million. The improvement includes a significant relaxation in the residency conditions which formerly attached to carers looking after elderly or infirm relatives.  Up to now, they had to live with the person for whom they were caring.  They will now qualify if they live within a reasonable distance of that person.  This will benefit a huge number of mothers.</P>
    <P>The importance of having people cared for in their community cannot be over-emphasised. Moving a person in need of care to accommodation outside the security of their own homes and into the relative social isolation of nursing homes and hospitals must be a last resort.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the many positive elements of the budget.  I welcome it and compliment the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>When the Government has millions of pounds to divide, a duty is imposed on it to look after those most in need.  I do not criticise the budget because it gives too much to income taxpayers. All those measures are most welcome and everybody who will receive extra money is delighted and grateful to the Government.</P>
      <P>As politicians we have a duty to look after the poorest in society.  If we are in politics for any other reason we have been led astray in our ambitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming a Member I have spoken time and again about the way in which widows have <Col N="575" /> been treated.  That is the test that tells me the budget is a failure.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, does not lack kindness.  I know from experience where his heart is.  It was a deliberate policy by the Government to decide the poor can wait.  Regardless of what ambitions the Government may have in five years time, the poor should not have to wait.</P>
    <P>The role of widows has never been recognised by Government.  They are given an allowance of about half what they should get.  This year, in a land of milk and honey, they are given a miserly £3.  Given that the rate of inflation is currently 2.3 per cent, by the time they receive this allowance in June it will not have kept up with inflation. What philosophy dictated, at a time of plenty, that for a widow &mdash; playing the role of husband and wife, depending on social welfare and with barely enough on which to survive &mdash; the rate of inflation was sufficient?  She received nothing extra for her children under the child dependant allowance.  I am completely baffled by this.  The £3 increase was given to everybody on social welfare &mdash; the long-term employed and those on disability. Oliver Goldsmith's poem, <i>The Deserted Village</i>, written in 1770, has more sense than many others.</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:</P>
    <P>At a time when Ireland is regarded as a wealthy country it would be a pity if we forgot those who need assistance.  If the increase granted to widows was 40 per cent it might make sense.  The pattern of giving them far less than enough is being repeated here, with the view to increasing the payments to those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I know from experience, when I was in charge of football teams and so on, the efforts made by widows to ensure their sons have an opportunity to play games.  They have a difficult role in life and the least we can do, at a time of plenty, is grant an increase which would justify the pretence that they are being looked after.  The budget is a failure given that there was an opportunity to help those in need; instead, it was decided to look after those with plenty.  It was not a question of the Government deciding either to give a break to income taxpayers or increase allowances for the poor, given that the Government had £1,400 million at its disposal.  The children in the Gallery, no more than some of us here, have no concept of £1,400 million.  That money was available.</P>
    <P>Given the promise that the next budget will look after the poor, I hope there will be some extra money for widows.  I do not mean a miserly increase of 3 per cent or 5 per cent.  Even pensioners who got an increase of £6 per week are caught up with inflation and under the drugs refund scheme will have to pay £2.50 per week extra.  This is an area where the Government should have delivered.</P>
    <P>When I heard the previous speaker say how the <Col N="576" /> poor and the elderly were looked after, I realised it was difficult to have a sensible debate on the budget.  If he thinks the poor and the elderly are looked after he has not even read the budget speech.</P>
    <P>Those on disability have many disadvantages. The £3 increase was an insult to them.  Hospital waiting lists have been left almost untouched.  I know a lady on morphine who has spent two months waiting to get to a specialist for an operation on her arm.  One person has suffered a second heart attack while on the waiting list.  The Minister had the money and it should have been directed at those who need help.</P>
    <P>That farmers were treated well in the budget, as claimed by the last Government speaker, is beyond belief.  Farmers are genuinely in trouble financially.  What they got is miserly.  Even the £2 million for installation aid will not go half way towards helping those in the queue.</P>
    <P>At a time of plenty it was decided our cars were not dear enough and VRT was increased.  The motor industry had made marvellous presentations indicating how they increased employment. The price of cars is put even further beyond the realm of the realistic.</P>
    <P>Given that the budget did not look after those in need it has to be classed as a failure.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Since the Dáil resumed on 30 September we will all acknowledge that we have had to wriggle our way through the protesters outside the gates.  All the interest groups &mdash; not pressure groups but people with legitimate interests looking for their rights &mdash; looked to the budget as providing their moment in the sun when their grievances would be addressed.  I was amazed at the instant media euphoria and I must commend the budget as an excellent PR exercise. It was sold in advance to the media but the glamour, the glitz and the sheen is beginning to wear off.  It is seen as a missed opportunity.  From the point of view of those interest groups it does not address their needs.</P>
      <P>The farmers came to Leinster House on two occasions in the past two months, 4,000 on the first occasion and 40,000 on the second.  Never before has agriculture been on the broad of its back.  All kinds of initiatives were mooted because people are genuinely in dire need.  A whole way of life is being swept aside.  There is no doubt that come spring, unless some drastic measure is put in place, there will be major casualties. Neither the factories nor the export markets have been tackled.  Yet the remedy for the plight of farmers was the farmers' dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an expert on farmers' dole, given that when the system was changed in the 1980s I represented a constituency which had a high density of people on farmers' dole.  I was one of those who fought to put in place a proper regime which would be means tested and where expenses necessarily incurred in running the farm would be taken into consideration.  The current system is elaborate, painstaking, difficult and sometimes <Col N="577" /> unfair.  There is a long and difficult appeals process. God help those who wait for their share of the additional farmers' dole to come onstream. They will not see it until this time next year.  It takes up to six months to deal with one appeal. In relation to disabilities Deputy Browne has hit the nail on the head.</P>

      <P>As regards disabilities, millions of pounds will be spent on millennium projects.  This budget was a missed opportunity in regard to people with disabilities. If we are serious about people with handicaps and disabilities, we should make a clear commitment that the new millennium will mark the dignifying of rights, facilities and services for them.  That is the kind of tangible initiative which would strike a chord with the public rather than build white elephants and towers in the sky which are a sad reflection on our paucity of thought.</P>
      <P>I had hoped this budget would look after carers. A mere token was offered in regard to the £200 for respite care and an extension of the domiciliary care.  At a time when we are trying to nurture the extended family and encourage people to look after senior citizens during their so-called &lsquo;golden years&rsquo; in order to allow them to live in a natural home environment, we should be making more money available to people who are prepared to stay at home and carry out that important duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £12 million was allocated to alleviate health waiting lists last year and the figure is £8 million this year.  The Minister of State will be aware that people are sitting in corridors in the casualty ward of University College Hospital Galway waiting for a bed.  I know of a person with cancer of the bowel being brought into the hospital and sent away again.  People in need of heart, hip, cataract and prostate treatment must <Col N="578" /> wait for 20 or 25 months.  In some cases, their conditions are life threatening.</P>
    <P>A total of 600 new housing starts have been approved.  When I joined Mayo County Council in 1979, we built 232 houses in urban and rural areas.  Dublin Corporation was building 600 houses ten years ago.  Young couples are attempting to secure loans of £90,000 or £100,000 in an overheated housing market.  Modern marriage is difficult enough without people having the millstone of a debt they cannot repay around their necks for up to 30 years.</P>
    <P>A serious danger is posed by the threat that the economy may overheat and the bubble may burst. Economies operate on a cyclical basis.  I hope I am mistaken but I believe this so-called boom, which is irrelevant to the vast majority of people, will come to an end and I am concerned this will happen sooner than people expect.  One must consider the context in which the boom has occurred.  It has occurred against the backdrop of a ten year major expansion in the United States and a huge surge in Asian markets up to 1997.  It has occurred against a backdrop of a major recovery in the UK economy and a stable performance by EU economies.  It has occurred against the backdrop of the opening up of new markets for our products in Russia and the former Eastern bloc countries.  When Krups closed down, it cited global factors as the cause.  Difficulties in the Russian market have affected our agriculture sector. Fruit of the Loom management pointed to cheap labour costs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The boom in house prices here is incongruous in a world of deflation.  The housing market defies the economic laws of gravity.  Credit borrowing increased by 20 per cent last year whereas our economy grew by only 8 per cent.  That could be sustained if the worldwide economy was booming. However, the Russian economy is in tatters, the Japanese economy is on the broad of its back and the UK economy is going into recession. When the UK sneezes, we get pneumonia.  This budget represents a missed opportunity.  We are living on the top of a credit bubble which will undoubtedly burst.  I hope I am mistaken but past experiences indicate that will be the case.</P>

      <P>The Government parties, together with sections of the media, have hailed this budget as the panacea to all our ills.  It is said it strikes the right balance, that the Minister for Finance is a Santa Claus figure and that the budget demonstrates the Government's commitment to wiping out disadvantage, poverty and injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many welcome provisions in the budget.  The Minister, having undergone a startling conversion, has begun to make the taxation system more equitable.  He has begun to ease the tax burden on people on low incomes and has increased child benefit and old age pension payments. These increases could and should be much better but we acknowledge the improvement.  The Minister has tinkered around with the carer's <Col N="579" /> allowance which, though insufficient, is at least a start.  We have listened to a succession of Ministers praising the Minister for Finance and delighting in the allocation of money to their Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, spoke yesterday of the Government's commitment to continuously advance the position of people with disabilities to enable them to achieve greater independence and to participate more fully in the life of the nation.  The Government has placed disability on the agenda of every Government Department and public body.  I wonder where on those agendas disability is placed. Is it item 1 or item 3, or is it simply another item under Any Other Business to be addressed if and when all other agenda items have been dealt with?</P>
    <P>How high on the agenda of the Department of Public Enterprise is disability placed?  On 11 November 1998, the Minister for Public Enterprise announced that for the first time the Exchequer was providing direct capital funding for public transport.  Of the £56 million provided, the Government was providing £17 million for 100 additional buses.  In addition, 50 new buses were approved for purchase as part of the reallocation of the Luas EU assistance.  There is a total of 150 new buses on our roads.  The Minister stated that this was the first time the Government provided direct capital grants to CIE for investment in public transport.</P>
    <P>Good news travels fast especially when the Minister for Public Enterprise makes an announcement.  We could be forgiven for believing that this announcement would be good news for all people when the Government is committed to the core principle of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.  However, it was not good news.  Good news may travel but wheelchair users may not, even on one of the 150 new buses which are funded by the taxpayer.  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, the Minister for Public Enterprise stated it was her policy that all transport providers should, as far as possible, make their services and facilities accessible to people with disabilities. The Minister pointed out that the new buses were urgently required to meet traffic congestion problems in Dublin.  However, they are not wheelchair accessible.  The Minister also said there are low floor buses available which may be suitable and will shortly be in use in London; that Dublin Bus is seeking to obtain a single bus for trials; that a pilot programme will begin in March, and that Dublin Bus should be in a position to begin ordering wheelchair accessible buses from the year 2000.  Despite the Government's commitment to promoting access for people with disabilities to public spaces facilities and the transport chain, the Minister did not ask Dublin Bus to buy low floor buses.  Was she not aware of the technical difficulties and that trials would have to <Col N="580" /> be conducted, when in opposition her party demanded instant solutions to the transport problems encountered by people with disabilities?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil policy document, &ldquo;Meeting the Challenge of Equality &mdash; A Policy on Disability&rdquo;, published by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, in opposition stated that there was no economic reason for Dublin Bus to continue investing in non-accessible buses.  I agree.  There is but one reason for the continuation of this policy, the lack of political will.  The Minister promises much but delivers little.  The Government's philosophy is, &ldquo;That was then, this is now&rdquo;.  It is all style but no substance.</P>
    <P>This morning on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio programme I listened to John Doyle who has spent the past two nights in his wheelchair protesting outside the headquarters of CIE at Heuston Station.  He described how he has to crawl on to a bus.  I am ashamed that there are no wheelchair accessible buses for people with disabilities unless they live along the No. 3 bus route.  Donal Toolan said that many disabled people would not show the same determination as John Doyle, that they would be beaten down by the system and remain imprisoned at home, trapped, excluded and marginalised.  People with physical and sensory disabilities have to listen to buzz words such as &ldquo;independence&rdquo;, &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; and &ldquo;participation&rdquo;.  Is it any wonder they are cynical and angry and that John Doyle has had to take such extreme action?</P>
    <P>How much more empowered or mobile are people in a new wheelchair if they cannot get on a bus?  How much more independent are they if they cannot get a taxi?  How much more confined are they if they cannot get on the DART whenever there is a strike?  All the fine words and promises are not of much use to them if they are not backed up by fine deeds.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Fine Gael Private Members' motion on transport the Minister agreed with my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, that &ldquo;we are not a proper nation if we do not allow public transport access to disabled people&rdquo;. I agree.  The Minister has admitted defeat.  Even though the money was available to make us a proper nation she did not bother.  Another year for some could be a life sentence for others.</P>
    <P>The budget tinkers with the edges of the problem. It pays lip-service to the commitments in the programme for Government and nods in the direction of promises.  Aided by Deputies Fox, Blaney, Gildea and Healy-Rae, the Government voted down two motions tabled by Fine Gael and supported by all the Opposition parties which would have forced Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to live up to their promises at a time when the coffers are bulging and in a budget in which the gamblers were granted concessions worth £24 million.</P>
    <P>On the rights and entitlements of people with physical and sensory disabilities and a mental handicap, carers and advocates need not look for assistance from Deputies Fox, Blaney, Gildea and <Col N="581" /> Healy-Rae.  They lost an opportunity to ensure the needs of people with disabilities and a mental handicap would be addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is to be made available to organisations and groups which support carers. While this is welcome, there is no meaningful commitment to smaller national agencies.  There is a severe lack of investment in the personal assistance schemes for people with disabilities who need help to get out of bed, wash, dress and eat.  Most of those with physical disabilities are not in the tax net.  The budget, therefore, is of no use to them.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Government to support family members who for too long have had to shoulder an unfair burden and to ensure equality of treatment for those who cannot speak for themselves.  It is an indictment of the Government that at a time of unprecedented prosperity it failed to provide the necessary resources to vindicate the human rights of people with a mental handicap and with physical and sensory disabilities who require improved and additional services. People should not have to take to the streets to demonstrate they have a right to day and respite care, education and training and transport.  It was our hope that following the budget there would not be a need for them to do so again but we were wrong.  John Doyle is proof of that.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the motion on services for people with a mental handicap Deputy Hanafin quoted the mother of a mentally handicapped child who said that if her child was a criminal, a cow or had a hurley in his hand, he would get money from the State.  She can now add that if her child was a gambler, he would also get money from the State.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities stated that its report was an ambitious one and once its recommendations were implemented would change the world for many people with disabilities, their families and carers. They deserve no less.  It is the least to which they are entitled as equal citizens.  The budget could have changed the world but it did not.</P>

      <P>I have listened to and read with great interest the comments which have been made by Opposition Deputies and others about the Government's second budget which has been widely welcomed.  Those who have been critical have had to scratch around to find something about which to crib.  In introducing the budget the Minister of Finance explained that it was his intention and that of the Government &ldquo;to benefit those who have not done as well as most of us in recent years, in particular the old and lower paid. <Col N="582" /> However, in delivering fairness, we must not abandon prudence.  We must remember that the world economy is in a volatile state.  The open nature of our economy and the high level of foreign investment here are reminders that economic booms do not last forever&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The budget measures in the area of housing for which I have special responsibility come on top of the 20 per cent increase provided for in the 1999 Estimates for social and local authority housing, the largest increase since 1986.  Deputy Higgins said there would only be 600 housing starts next year.  The correct figure is 4,500.  The Deputy does not appear to understand anything about the local authority housing programme if he believes his own statement in the House today.</P>
      <P>In housing the budget will benefit people who are most in need.  However, we did not throw caution to the wind and there can be no apologies for this.  The housing measures were targeted very carefully.  We set out to improve the position of some of the weakest in our society, the elderly, those with disabilities and the young homeless.</P>
      <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly is specifically designed to enable elderly persons living alone to enjoy decent housing conditions. At no cost to the occupier, it provides for the carrying out of basic works to prolong the useful life of the house so that for as long as is necessary it can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.</P>
      <P>The scheme is operated at local level by health boards, is funded in full by my Department, and has, since its inception in 1982, improved 35,000 houses.  I recently visited some houses which had been improved under the scheme and was impressed with the improvements made under this well targeted scheme to enhance the quality of life of the elderly in a very cost effective manner.</P>
      <P>The budget provided an extra £1.6 million for the task force bringing the total funding in 1999 to £6 million &mdash; the highest level ever.  I expect improvement works to be carried out under the task force to 3,500 houses in 1999.</P>
      <P>The essential repairs grant scheme has been a modest but worthwhile social housing measure.  It enables people in accommodation which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost to have basic repairs carried out to their houses so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The scheme has generally been used to secure essential repairs to dwellings occupied by elderly persons, often in isolated rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential repairs grant is improved in two respects in this budget.  First, for works commenced on or after 2 December, the effective maximum grant limit generally imposed by local authorities is increased from £1,800 to £4,500. Second, rules governing the scheme are being amended to allow it to be operated in urban areas &mdash; a significant change.  An additional £1.25 million <Col N="583" /> is being provided in 1999 to facilitate the introduction of these significant improvements.</P>
    <P>One of the undertakings in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium was to review the disabled persons grant scheme, the terms of which had not been improved since 1993. Under this scheme, local authorities grant aid necessary adaptations and improvements to houses to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household.  The budget provides for significant improvements to the scheme.  First, local authorities are being enabled, at no cost to themselves, to increase the effective maximum grant by 50 per cent, from £8,000 to £12,000 where works commence on or after 2 December. Second, in the case of private houses the grant can now amount to up to 75 per cent of the approved cost of the works rather than twothirds, as previously.  The cost of these improvements to the terms of the scheme are estimated at £3 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>In the case of young homeless people, it is often necessary to provide more than accommodation to meet their needs &mdash; it is necessary to equip them with the employment and other skills necessary for life.  Foyers are specifically designed and managed to provide both accommodation and training opportunities for young homeless persons.  I am especially pleased that a £1 million special grant has been made available in this year's budget for St. Catherine's Foyer in Dublin which, along with funding under the capital assistance scheme, will enable the first Foyer to be developed in this country.</P>
    <P>Our relatively small private rented housing sector is under considerable pressure at present.  A significant factor in rising demand for private rented accommodation over recent years has been the growing numbers of third level students who require accommodation outside the family home during their studies.  The growth in third level student numbers has been remarkable in recent years.  In 1990, the number of third level students stood at about 68,000.  There are now more than 105,000 and numbers are expected to continue to grow, reaching 120,000 over the next five years.</P>
    <P>This pressure is in addition to the increased demand generally for private rented housing associated with high levels of net immigration, including returning emigrants and, of course, our high rate of new household formation.  I am very pleased that new fiscal incentives to assist the third level colleges to provide suitable student accommodation have been announced in the budget.  This incentive has considerable potential to ease pressures in the private rented sector over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Last April, the Government's action on house prices abolished tax deductibility of interest on borrowings used for investment in residential property.  However, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, recognised that some investors would have entered into binding contracts to purchase <Col N="584" /> properties prior to 23 April but the properties would not have been completed until after that date.  In these circumstances, transitional tax relief was made available if the borrowed moneys were employed by the investor on or before 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The 31 December deadline has been represented as causing problems in certain circumstances. In particular, it was argued that the end of year deadline could encourage developers to force projects through during these dark winter months with attendant risks on certain sites.  The budget, therefore, extends the transitional relief arrangements to 31 March 1999.  It remains a requirement that the binding contract must have been entered into before 23 April last.</P>
    <P>In much the same way I was aware there were difficulties in a number of on-going urban renewal projects meeting the extended 31 December 1998 deadline for the current urban renewal scheme because of delays in getting planning permission, archaeological problems and the bad weather.  I was pleased, therefore, not least for reasons of safety on building sites at this time of year, that the Minister for Finance was in a position to announce a further short extension of the deadline for the current scheme up to 30 April 1999, subject to certain conditions being met.  While this extension had to be confined to residential developments only, having regard to the current position with regard to the negotiations with the EU on commercial development, I am nevertheless satisfied that it will facilitate the completion of a substantial number of developments which could not otherwise have met the deadline.  The residential development at the west end of Temple Bar has also been delayed because the highly important archaeological dig in the area took longer than expected to complete.  The deadline for completion of the residential development there has also been extended, therefore, from 5 April to 31 December 1999.</P>
    <P>Housing and urban renewal projects must have the interests of the community at their heart.  Projects which ignore the needs of people are fundamentally flawed.  I refer to the special £700,000 allocation made in the budget to enable the provision of a new civic centre for Darndale in north Dublin.  This allocation will be additional to funding which has already been secured from various sources.  The proposed centre will incorporate an integrated enterprise centre, a comprehensive work related training centre, a child care facility, community health centre, a one stop shop for Dublin Corporation services, community shops, a community resource centre and a Garda office. The centre is not only important in its own right but also as a new model for delivering local services where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>I have not heard any Deputy question the steps we have taken in the budget.  Rather, they have concentrated their fire on areas they feel might be taken up by the public or commentators as omissions.  I will deal with some of these.</P>
    <P>There were some comments that the new house <Col N="585" /> grant should have been increased in the budget. Such a suggestion is naive in the extreme.  Any increase in the level of the new house grant would, in present circumstances, merely go on to the price of new houses.  This would undermine all the efforts we have made to take the steam out of house prices.  Anyone who, at this stage, suggests an increase in the new house grant shows little understanding of the operations of the housing market.</P>
    <P>Some may argue that stamp duty might have been abolished on all houses purchased by first time buyers.  This is to ignore the radical overhaul of stamp duty rates undertaken in our action on house prices package last April.  It also ignores the fact that tinkering with stamp duty rates in favour of one sector tends to cause bottlenecks and distortions.</P>
    <P>However, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is currently working on a model which would link the application of residential tax incentives to the provision of affordable housing for those whose incomes are at a level which means they cannot purchase housing under current market conditions.  I also hope that any new model of affordable housing provision to be piloted in the docklands area might be capable of being applied elsewhere, in the context of the integrated area plans for the new urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Others have asked what the budget has done to ease social housing waiting lists.  This conveniently ignores the fact that the Estimates for the coming year increased the local authority housing programme to its highest level since 1986 with record levels of funding.  It also ignores the very substantial increases to the levels of assistance under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme which I announced last month &mdash; the second such announcement within a year.  It is to suggest that housing lists, which started to grow in the early part of the decade, can be dealt with in one fell swoop.  This is dangerous talk.  It is akin to suggesting that we should forget all we learned during the 1980s about building large single class housing estates on the edges of our cities and towns and put bricks and mortar before the wider needs of communities.</P>
    <P>Complaints about this Government's housing record are self-seeking and designed to whip up anxieties among the public.  They are not only poorly judged, they are misleading.  In the short time we have been in office, we have taken more action on housing, both public and private, than the previous Government did in its entire term in office.  If the previous Government had been alive to the growing mismatch between demand and supply in housing and had acted swiftly, as we did under our action on house prices package, we may not be facing current difficulties in housing.</P>
    <P>Some might ask what the budget did for people in local authority housing.  I am very much committed to improving the living conditions of people who reside in local authority houses.  In addition to providing for the continuation of the <Col N="586" /> remedial works programme and further resources for the regeneration of the Ballymun housing estate, I am happy that the 1999 Estimates provide for another major initiative in relation to existing local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, Dublin Corporation approached my Department proposing the redevelopment of nine inner city flat complexes over a five year period.  These are Lourdes House, Mountainview Court, Sean Treacy House, St. Joseph's Mansions, St. Jude's Gardens, St. Michael's Estate, Poplar Row-Courtney Place, Marmion Court-Queen Street and Bridgefoot Street-Island Street.  The overall estimated cost of the proposals put to me by Dublin Corporation was £87.8 million.  This project has now been approved and expenditure is provided in this year's Estimates for the commencement of the work in 1999.  A special allocation of £6.5 million is provided in the 1999 Estimates and the full amount will be available from my Department. This has been the best budget for housing for many years.  There will be no apologies for the legacy of neglect by our predecessors.  Our programme will continue to focus on action on behalf of all those in housing need.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the need for safety in building sites.  I would like to refer briefly to water safety, which has long been one of my particular interests.  At present, responsibility for providing public awareness of water safety, for education on prevention of accidents in water and for provision of instruction in water rescue and resuscitation, rests with the National Safety Council.  The council has similar responsibilities for public awareness of road and fire safety, and I am pleased to acknowledge the council's contribution across all its programmes since its establishment nearly 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>However, I am convinced that we should reestablish a separate and distinct body to promote water safety.  This activity depends, almost uniquely, on the efforts of about 5,000 volunteer activists who give selflessly of their time and energy.  In the final analysis, it is the views of these volunteers which is paramount.  From my contacts with them, I know they feel a distinct parent body is required to give due recognition to their efforts.  I am pleased to respect their wishes and I very much welcome the provision of £200,000 in the budget to assist in establishing a separate and distinct body to promote water safety.  I also hope that the separate identity for water safety which the new body will provide will enable additional funds to be raised through corporate sponsorship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the budget.  It hits the right note.  It should achieve the stated aims of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  It will help to sustain a vibrant economy by having a minimal effect on inflation and encouraging a welfare to work movement and it will make it more attractive to start up and stay in business.  Giving tax relief for personal allowances at the standard rate <Col N="587" /> of tax is a major reform which allows the possibility for all taxpayers to benefit through changes in personal allowances in future years.  The generous increase in old age pensions, services for carers and social welfare payments will help to maintain social inclusiveness.</P>
      <P>One of the highlights of the budget was the doubling over three years of the income guideline of the medical card for those over 70, with a third increase in 1999.  Plans are being implemented for the longer term and I welcome the publication of the Stability Programme 1999 to 2001 which sets out the Government's budgetary strategy for the next three years.  The Stability Programme 1999 to 2001 is the best produced, most interesting and easily readable booklet produced by the Department of Finance.  It is an ideal Christmas present for anyone who is interested in how Ireland's economy got to where it is today and where it is going in the future.  There is fairly detailed information about the next three years, but the detail diminishes as we approach 2050, in 50 years' time when it is expected there will be one million persons over 65 years of age, with roughly the same overall population as at present.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to read the Department of Finance's view on the reasons for Ireland's recent strong growth.  They include macro economic stability and social partnership.  They can be attributed to the work of all the Governments in the 1990s, particularly to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, the former Minister, Ray MacSharry and the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern in the 1987 Government who kick-started the sound economic policies and partnership agreements.  Other reasons for the success are the baby boomers of the 1970s or, as described in the parlance of the Department of Finance, a dynamic demographic structure.  This allowed for buoyancy in labour supply and, together with Donogh O'Malley's free secondary education, it raised the quality of the labour force.  There was strong business investment.  A high level of public investment in physical and human capital was undertaken with the help of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
      <P>There are nuggets of information in the Stability Programme 1999 to 2001 such as growth in Ireland is expected to be more than double the European average each year over the next three years.  It is expected that the general Government debt will be down to 43 per cent of GDP by the end of 2001 as against 59 per cent today.  In the three years to the end of 2001 it is projected that employment will increase by 1,700 jobs, and that the unemployment rate will reduce from 7.8 per cent today to 5.9 per cent at the end of 2001.  That is about as near as we can get to full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to basics, I would like to address the matter of the integrated services project, ISP, which is designed to tackle the problems associated with pockets of acute deprivation in urban areas.  The first phase of that project related to research which involved a close examination of <Col N="588" /> the position in four areas, including the canal communities of Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House and Dolphin House.  Following that work, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs decided to proceed with the implementation phase of the project.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is committed totally to the implementation of the project.  At my request he attended a very successful meeting with the local task force in the area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach launched the implementation phase of the ISP last Friday at a special meeting of the secretaries general of relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant agencies.  The Taoiseach, in unscripted remarks, passionately appealed to the organisation chiefs present for a fair deal for those children growing up and living in flat complexes.  Those children deserve the same educational opportunities as children in Foxrock or Malahide.  High standards of pre-school care, schooling and after school care is a right of all children, irrespective of their parents' means.  Co-operation between the Department of Education and the communities in the flats is required, among other things, to achieve these high standards in flat complexes.  It will also require resources to be put into the early education of the children in those flats so that they are on a level playing field with the children of Foxrock and Malahide in terms of secondary and third level schooling and getting a job.</P>
    <P>What has been the response of the Department of Education to date?  Nothing.  For years all the public representatives of the area and the local activists have been trying to get a representative of the Department to attend the monthly meeting of the Dolphin House Task Force, all to no avail. I asked other organisations about the Department's attitude to meetings which deal with deprived areas and social exclusion and I have got the same reply, &ldquo;A very poor response.&rdquo; I ask the Department to take on board the Taoiseach's passionate plea to all service providers to co-operate fully with the integrated services project. I look forward to the Government cooperating fully and wholeheartedly.  As there were no funds in the Estimates or the budget for this matter, I hope a supplementary Estimate will be needed for the Department of Education and Science as a result of funds well spent on children from areas of acute deprivation who, we hope, will become the high earners and the heavy taxpayers of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of great pleasure for me to speak on this budget debate.  It is the first occasion on which many of the Opposition Members will agree with most of what I have to say.  I cannot remember a budget which has been so widely acclaimed.  Many complained last year's budget was tailored to suit the wealthy.  They cannot say that of this year's budget.  This is a budget aimed at the current and long-term needs of society and which will ensure the continuation of <Col N="589" /> the social partnership, the bedrock on which the economic climate we enjoy today is built.  It is pay back time for those who exercised pay restraint for many years in the interests of national well being.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be complimented on his radical reforms of the tax system which focus on the low and middle income groups.  This initial move in the direction of a system of tax credits will enable the Minister to focus on the different groups in the taxation brackets in the next and forthcoming budgets in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tackled the serious problem of the high tax rate for those on low income.  I foresee further improvements to the levels at which people move into the higher tax bracket in future budgets.  The Minister will finalise his shift in the direction of tax credits in next year's budget.  He has made major moves to simplify the tax system and has made it more equitable.  The concentration by the Minister on the lower paid is the correct and desirable approach for this year's and future budgets.</P>
      <P>Those who wish to take up part-time work can earn up to £100 per week without incurring income tax liability.  This will prove to be of immense benefit to people who are unwilling to undertake part-time work because of the tax implications.</P>
      <P>Some Opposition Members have said the tax cuts, which will cost £581 million next year are mean.  They have also said the £310 being allocated to social welfare is miserly.  Some have focused on the reduction in betting tax.  If one looks hard enough, one can find fault in anything. If some Members on the other side of the House had been present at the wedding feast of Cana, they would have looked for a better quality wine. If they had been present at the miracle of the loaves and fishes, they would have complained that the fish was not fried and would have asked for a portion of chips as well.</P>
      <P>I ask the knockers to look at the positive aspects of this budget which have received widespread support from the general public and all bodies of opinion.  One does not have to criticise because one sits on the Opposition benches.  It would be nice to see critics adopt a positive approach.  It would be good to hear some balance. Maybe I am expecting too much.</P>
      <P>The removal of 80,000 people from the tax net, following the decision not to tax incomes under £100 is the greatest bonus the low paid have ever received from any Government.  This is a milestone in taxation history.  I would like to think that all Members of the House share this opinion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked for reports on social welfare, public sector pay and pensions &mdash; in the light of our ageing population.  These will have a significant impact on the framing of next year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, for the first time in many years, PAYE workers can see appreciable benefits. There is a major impact on the earnings of single <Col N="590" /> people and married couples.  The overall context of provisions mean there is a significant improvement in the take home pay for the employed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the substantial increase in the level of the old age pension.  The increase of £6 per week for those who fully qualify is greatly appreciated.  This signals the intent of the Government and of this Minister to deliver on the £100 per week pension within the timeframe specified.  There is a Government commitment to do this on a staged basis and it will be honoured.  I was pleased to see the provisions for those on occupational pensions.  This body of people will make significant gains.  They have not received the treatment they deserve in many past budgets.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dramatically reformed the area of pensions for the self employed in the following ways: he has increased substantially the level of tax deductibility for pension contributions up to a maximum of 30 per cent and the self employed will now own and control the fund as it is being built up.  There will be no compulsion to invest in the fund upon retirement in a single inflexible annuity.  The pensioner will retain ownership of the capital sum invested at retirement.  In this budget the Minister changed this system which was grounded in the dark ages.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients have received increases in line with the minimum recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare. There are additional payments for those in receipt of children's allowances and increases for families in receipt of the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given substantial sums to the areas of mental handicap services, the physical and sensory disability services and the elderly community support services.  In total, he has given these services an additional £24 million.  He has tackled the problem of waiting lists by investing £9 million in community support services to free up beds, and an additional £8 million to the existing waiting list initiative of £12 million.  In doing so he has delivered on another Government promise.  No one can deny the Minister's positive financial input into ensuring the best of health care in the areas mentioned and his commitment to tackling the waiting list problem.</P>
    <P>He has widened the bands for those who qualify for carers' allowance and has granted a free telephone allowance for all qualified carers.  He has abolished the tax on benefit-in-kind to employees who are provided with child care facilities and has granted capital allowances to employers for buildings for child care facilities. This was a most desirable move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I could go on about the many benefits accruing to many sectors.  Everyone is aware of the many positive and worthwhile provisions in the budget. There are always areas where people feel more could have been done.  I expect that all areas of social welfare where there are perceived inequities will be catered for in the coming year and in <Col N="591" /> next year's budget.  Anything more would be an exercise in gilding the lily.</P>
    <P>There has been a strong reaction from the motor trade and the public to the additional VRT on cars over 1,400 cc.  I hope the Minister will look again at this aspect of the budget and take into account the major contribution the industry, which has had many lean trading years, and the hard pressed motoring public, have made to today's buoyant economy.  I hope he will address the issue of those who have already committed themselves to the purchase of vehicles which are not yet available and cannot be registered before January 1999.  If he must impose such a tax for budgetary reasons, perhaps he would raise the entry point to 2,000 cc.  That is the only problem I have with this budget and the Minister should look at it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy has done a magnificent job in framing the budget.  He deserves our full support and acclamation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear my colleague express his views on the budget.  Let us be clear, however, that following last year's budget, we were the ones who made the Government change its tactics in respect of tax concessions.  Practically all the concessions last year were given to the better off.  I welcome the concessions given to the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>With a budget surplus of £4.1 billion available to the Minister, he has not earned much kudos. He had the money in the bank.  I would hate to see what he would do if there was a deficit as there was for many years previously.</P>
      <P>In the time available we can only speak on a few areas of the budget.  I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has withdrawn from the House because I want to deal with the current housing situation.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report has been published and certain sections of it put into operation.  It is having no effect on the price of housing.  The Government can claim that the price of houses is stabilising but it is stabilising at a very high level.  I am not satisfied the Government took action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consultation with my county council, I will put forward a motion.  There have been complaints again and again that we are not being constructive in our criticism and we are not making alternative proposals.  I hope the following motion will be taken by next Monday's meeting of Wexford County Council: &ldquo;To call on Wexford County Council to utilise existing land resources and purchase further lands within the county, for the provision of fully serviced sites to build houses under the builder licence scheme and other suitable schemes in all areas of County <Col N="592" /> Wexford, and where agreement can be reached between the three main urban councils in County Wexford.&rdquo; House ownership is one of the greatest ambitions of Irish families.  This ambition is unique to Ireland and is a very steadying social requirement which contributes greatly to the foundations of family life.  The rapid rise in house prices is inhibiting growth in the economy.  It is also putting upward pressure on costs through wage inflation.  Present housing prices are outside the capacity of the average wage earner and are putting undue pressure on available disposable earnings, putting discomfiting pressure on marriages and family life.</P>
    <P>A fully equipped three bedroom house in Wexford now costs in the region of £85,000, which is almost as dear, if not dearer, than prices in every big English town.  The mortgage repayment on that level of borrowings, including insurance, is in the region of £600 per month.  These prices and repayments will force huge numbers of people onto the council's housing list.  The current annual housing programme in Wexford is approximately 100 houses per annum and there are 1,000 applicants on the list, which means there is currently a ten year waiting list.  Proposals to build 100 houses a year are completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>There is a moral obligation on the Government and Wexford County Council to step into the breach before the housing list reaches saturation point.  Wexford County Council has the legislative facilities at its disposal to carry out an alternative system to provide private housing at reasonable prices.  The only small hitch is that we do not have adequate finances to so do.  We must move swiftly and aggressively with a new policy and programme.</P>
    <P>Adequate safeguards must be built into the system to avoid speculation by potential house purchasers. I make that statement in the full knowledge of what it means.  I am sure Members of the House who are also members of local authorities would agree.  I cannot understand the Government, given the amount of money it has in the bank, allowing the building industry to be taken over by speculators, at a cost to the average wage earner.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has left the Chamber because I wish to make an important point about housing.  Wexford County Council gives borrowers housing loans at fixed interest rates which are greater than the current market rate.  Given the significant fall in interest rates over the past few years and the likely continuation of this trend, many local authority mortgage holders find themselves locked into high fixed interest rate loans.  For example, Wexford County Council has 1,640 mortgage account holders, 65 per cent of whom are on fixed interest loans of between 8 per cent and 12.5 per <Col N="593" /> cent.  The Minister of State knows that because he is a member of a local authority.</P>

      <P>The total value of these mortgages to Wexford County Council is £9,320,491, or 46 per cent of the total loan book due to the council. That is being operated by the Department of Finance. I proposed a resolution to Wexford County Council at the October meeting before the estimates, calling on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance to permit local authorities to refinance their capital debt in order to facilitate the council in helping its mortgage holders remortgage at a much lower market rate.  I was unaware that much of the council's own borrowings from the Office of Public Works are at a high fixed interest rate.  The experience of Wexford County Council in this regard is undoubtedly similar to all local authorities.</P>
      <P>I accuse the Department of Finance of working illegally.  It has a house finance management committee and has secured situations where it is borrowing money at 4.5 per cent and is insisting on Wexford County Council and every other council paying it 12.5 per cent for most of the money. That is scandalous and is bordering on illegality. I call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to put this matter right immediately.</P>
      <P>When our council looked at our estimates over eight or nine meetings, as does every council, we found that this was a very taxing situation.  The people who must pay the 12.5 per cent rate are the poorest sections of the community because they cannot qualify for a council loan unless they are refused a loan by other financial institutions. Despite the amount of money the Government has, it is not prepared to allow the county councils to operate a fair and honest scheme.  I accuse the Governments of acting illegally in this regard.</P>
      <P>I will turn now to agriculture, although it is impossible to do it justice in the time available to me.  The recently released GDP figures for County Wexford have conclusively proved what many of us have been saying for some time, that County Wexford is the third most disadvantaged county in Ireland, with 55 per cent of EU GDP. Only Roscommon, at 51 per cent, and Leitrim, at 48 per cent, are more disadvantaged.  This deplorable statistic for Wexford reflects the failure to provide sustainable manufacturing and service jobs and throws on the county's agricultural sector the task of sustaining its economic and social fabric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Wexford is the victim of sustained erosion of its economic base.  If this had happened elsewhere, there would be task forces across the county, as has happened in most of the other <Col N="594" /> counties where the problems lie.  Donegal has 72 per cent of EU GDP, Kerry has 64 per cent and Clare has 89 per cent.  These counties have obviously benefited much more from Government support than Wexford has, but they are given task forces and inclusion in the Objective One retention proposals.  That is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the core of Wexford's economy. We have the highest dependency on full-time farming of any county in Ireland.  Between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the economy of County Wexford depends exclusively on farming.  The survey released by Teagasc this week, which indicates that only 18 per cent of farmers intend to make additional investment in the coming year, has grave implications for the servicing sector in all counties, particularly in County Wexford.  This is reflected in the figures.  In 1996, on-farm investment was £400 million; in 1997, it was £250 million. The projected figure for 1998 is £268 million and for 1999 is £168 million.  The Acting Chairman, who is from a rural constituency, will know the effect this will have on rural towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I was surprised yesterday to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Food describe this as a landmark budget.  However, it is certainly marking the agricultural sector which is going backwards at a terrible speed.  At the moment, 5,200 farmers are leaving farming annually and this figure is expected to increase considerably next year.  The Minister's reaction was to reintroduce the farm installation scheme, at a cost of £2 million. However, he did not tell us that he suspended it. The French Government spends £38,000 on young farmers starting up in agriculture &mdash; we spend £5,400.  The Government had the cheek, knowing that agriculture was in difficulties, to suspend that scheme.  I cannot understand the Minister's attitude to giving farmers the family income supplement.  He refused to do so, but he is providing £15 million, a kind of &ldquo;special dole&rdquo; for farmers, which will come into operation next June.  What about the thousands of small farmers who will have little or no income for the rest of the winter?  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs does not want to know about them.</P>
    <P>The VAT refund was increased from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent.  The VAT refund from the German Government is 13 per cent, and we are competing with German farmers.  The French figure is around 10 per cent.  The Government could have given some money back to agriculture by giving a decent VAT refund and a direct payment through the family income supplement, but it has refused to do so.</P>
    <P>I concentrated on two areas because it would not be possible to go into much detail on the budget as a whole.  I welcome certain measures in the budget.  However, two areas, housing and agriculture, were completely neglected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I too will concentrate on just one <Col N="595" /> aspect of the budget because I am sure we will have plenty of time to talk about the other areas where there are deficits, child benefit, carers and the paltry allocation for overseas development, all affecting the most impoverished, desperate people in our society and worldwide at a time of unprecedented economic boom and in the context of national experience of our own deprivation and devastation at times in the past.  The budget is a national disgrace, and we all feel embarrassed and ashamed of it.</P>
      <P>The Government excelled itself in the cavalier way in which it treated the whole area of child care in the budget.  It could not claim not to know that there was a crisis.  It could not claim to be unaware that an expert working group has been working for 18 months on a package that took in all aspects of supply and demand in child care, the crisis within it and the resources that are needed.  In particular it could not claim not to know of the recommendation presented before the budget to begin a seven-year strategy to cope with an ever increasing crisis not just for the economy but also for family life.  This was totally side-stepped and ignored.  There was a complete cop-out, even in the language in which it was treated in the presentation of the Minister for Finance &mdash;&ldquo;The Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system.  The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As if we did not know, as if the Government did not know, as if it had not been advised by every agency in the country, from the child carers associations to IBEC.  Even IBEC never centred on family needs until it had to made recommendations and pointed to the crisis that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national children's nurseries associations, among others, gave us the facts on child care. Irish parents pay 20 per cent of their income on child care.  European parents pay, on average, 8 per cent.  Child care costs are not listed in the cost of living index because they are still seen as marginal and, in this patriarchal society, they are still seen as the responsibility of women.  I believe there is a view among certain politicians that if women went back to the home and looked after their children we would not have to worry about this problem.  Never mind the economy, never mind equality of opportunity, never mind the cost of educating and training women who until 1973 were forced back into the home.  Now not even when they are needed is it accepted that the work of women inside or outside the home has any value.  This is totally depressing 20 years after I and many others sat on a working group on child care for working parents back in 1978.  What has changed?  There has been no change in the attitude and mindset that demands that women take responsibility for the domestic and parenting needs of this country while housing costs and the <Col N="596" /> economy demand that they work in the workforce with no resources and no help.  It is a scandal, and it shows how little we have moved psychologically, philosophically and politically in the whole area of equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>This budget is a reflection of the Cabinet and, unfortunately, of many politicians on the other side of the House who do not have child care problems because they have women in the home looking after their children.  They are not forced to juggle, to miss meetings, to make apologies, to worry about their children being sick, and miss out on their employment as well.  This is a crisis that the Government has signally failed to address.  I would like to think, since the budget has been announced, and particularly since they have gone back to their own constituencies and their own communities, that they realise this is not a middle class problem as has been alleged, in an ill-informed and biased way, by certain people on current affairs programmes.  This is a problem that particularly affects our children, one third of whom are deemed to be living in poverty.</P>
    <P>The package that the expert working group and the National Women's Council have been working on is not middle class and it is not exclusive. It takes in every area and concentrates particularly on the needs of parents and lone parents in disadvantaged areas.  The package started a seven-year strategy, modestly and practically. One aspect has been taken out &mdash; that benefit-in-kind should be given as a subsidy to employers for the most privileged parents, the few who have child care facilities within their workplace.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to recognise, and the women and working parents to let it know, how signally it has failed to meet expectations and the further crisis into which it has plunged us by doing nothing in this budget and delaying doing anything for at least another year.  Some 90 per cent of the children being minded by childminders in this country are being minded by people in the black economy.  That does not do the children, the work the childminders do or the income and rights of the childminders, any good.  It shows how we have marginalised this work and treated it in the same way as the unpaid work of women down through the years.  It is forcing highly qualified women, who are needed within the economy and whose income is needed in households to help pay the extraordinary housing costs we now have, out of an economy that does not allow them equality of opportunity or choice as to whether they will have their children minded in their own home, of flexible working hours that will allow them to take part in child minding themselves or to avail of high quality registered care in well run child care centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is not an urban problem.  Every working politician knows that one of the greatest disadvantages that rural areas suffer from is the lack of a structure that allows women in those areas to go out to work.  One of the things that astonishes me is that, given the focus on farming and the fears for its future, there is no inclusiveness, <Col N="597" /> no recognition that providing child care structures in rural areas would enable women to contribute towards farm incomes which are devastatingly low in many places at the moment.  I am sorry to say that the lack of planning, value and professionalism in this area is a reflection of the patriarchal society which has never really come to terms with women's work inside or outside the home or paid or unpaid in the community.  We are faced with a crisis which started 20 years ago. The same old arguments are being used.  I am old and weary enough to remember the debate on equal pay, equality of opportunity, the employment equality legislation and paid maternity leave which was grudgingly given with the shortest amount of paid leave provided in the whole of Europe.  Just recently in this session there was a debate as to whether unpaid parental leave would grudgingly be given.</P>
    <P>This budget, delivered during the best times we have ever had, for all the economic, social and family reasons I have outlined, failed on every level and has written into the record the extraordinary marginalising, devaluing and undermining of the work of women and their status in society.  I say this in sorrow, particularly as we approach the millennium and after 25 years of a women's movement which continues to be denigrated by people as some sort of middle class community organisation working for privileges rather than rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate.  Over a number of years, and in particular over recent months, there have been several attempts to fly around the world in a hot air balloon, all of which have been doomed to failure.  I suggest to Richard Branson that if he harnessed the hot air generated by the budget not only would he get around the world once, but he would probably make it twice.  Never was there a budget from which so much was expected and which delivered so little.</P>
      <P>I accept and understand that it is a big man's budget for big business, big farmers and big gamblers who are friends of the Minister for Finance. All these people will do well out of the budget. However, the ordinary people whom I represent are totally devastated by the miserly tuppences which have been handed out in various benefits. Absolutely nothing has been done for small farmers, small businesses, people on social welfare, the aged and those on hospital waiting lists.  However, big business with big Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil connections has been looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable for the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to state in the House that nothing could be done for young couples seeking to buy their first house and that an increase in the first time buyers' grant would have resulted in increases in house prices.  This one statement clearly indicated how inept the Government is in dealing with crises.  There will always be problems and crises and if the Government is not able to deal with them it should pack its bags and leave <Col N="598" /> and allow in people who can deal with them as Fine Gael dealt successfully with problems and crises when they arose during two years in Government.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is stumbling around the country from one industrial closure to another, unable to deal with them before they happen.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has stated that nothing can be done for young couples seeking to buy their first house.  This shows how inept the Minister and the Government's advisers are.  Is the Minister of State aware that there is a means test for third level grants for students at universities and regional colleges?  There should be a £10,000 first time buyers' grant for young couples buying a house costing up to £80,000, with no grant for houses costing in excess of this.  This is a simple solution to the problem.  If this is introduced builders will address a market they will have to meet.  This is achievable and possible.  The Government has washed its hands of house prices because its friends are the big builders who are creaming off profits.  The other evening I overheard a builder saying in the city that houses costing £110,000 left him a profit margin of £35,000.  This is outrageous, scandalous and totally unacceptable.  The first time buyers' grant should be available for houses up to £80,000. Cavan Urban District Council has decided to move on this in the context of starter houses for young couples, namely, two-bedroomed bungalows.</P>
    <P>It does not surprise me that the Minister for Finance said farmers are whingeing and have nothing to whinge about.  This is outrageous and shows how far out of touch the Minister is.  How could he be so out of touch?  Is he talking about Kildare and Meath, the areas he is closest to?  I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to find out where the Minister for Finance is getting his information.  The Minister is correct in saying his friends and neighbours are doing extremely well in farming.  However, the small farmers I represent in counties Cavan and Monaghan are far from doing well and there is no gravy train.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on the record the average payment in 1997 to the 100 top recipients and the bottom 100 recipients under the various grant schemes from Brussels.  In the case of the special beef premium, the average annual payment to the top 100 was £15,583.78, while the average received by the bottom 100, the people I represent, was £51.03. This is less than £1 per week for the bottom 100 and over £300 per week for the top 100 recipients.  In the case of suckler cow premia, which are very important to the farmers I represent, the amount received by those in Kildare and Meath was £20,571 while farmers in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Leitrim and the west of Ireland received £77.42. I again emphasise that these are annual payments.  It gets better for counties Kildare and Meath and worse for counties Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim.  The figures for the extensification premium are £12,399 for the top 100 recipients, while farmers <Col N="599" /> in counties Cavan and Monaghan received £27.85, or 50p per week.  In the case of livestock headage, which is very important nationwide, the big farmers with whom the Minister for Finance socialises and goes gambling, received an average payment of £5,378 in counties Kildare and Meath while those in counties Cavan and Monaghan received £20.02. The real boys with the four wheel drive vehicles who go to the races and benefit from the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance are the top 100 who receive arable aid, the average payment to whom was £92,972.28, or £2,000 per week, which is hardly available in counties Cavan and Monaghan. However, there are some poor farmers receiving an average payment of £145 per week.  These are not going to the races or rubbing shoulders with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  The big boys are doing well and this is why the Government is so out of touch with the reality of life and the hardship on farms and in small businesses.  The Government has washed its hands of the people whom I appreciate and recognise and who are struggling to live.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is a decent man and I am glad he is in the House.  He is aware of the crisis in pig farming in Cavan.  I was at a meeting in the Kilmore Hotel last Friday evening and saw hard working decent men in tears with their businesses in ruins.  Like the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Agriculture and Food says there is nothing he can do.  There is huffing and puffing, plenty of hot air but no solutions.  I ask the Government to pack up and get out, for God's sake, before the country is ruined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Noel Ahern, Haughey and Kelleher.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Boylan and must say he has the shortest memory in the history of Dáil Éireann as only a year and a half ago he sat on this side of the House and things have not changed much in that time &mdash; only the weather has changed.  I agree with some of the points mentioned by Deputy Boylan which were of a nonpolitical nature.  Deputy Boylan went over the top on the weaknesses of the Government.  We have achieved a great deal in the past year and a half, and I will enumerate what we have done.</P>
      <P>This budget is prudent in its treatment of the public finances by providing a radical change in the tax system and significant increases for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly the elderly.  It has also been a very good budget for the agri-food sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year has been difficult for the agri-food sector.  The CSO's preliminary estimate for total farm income for the year, released last Monday, shows a decrease of 4 per cent.  This is accounted <Col N="600" /> for mainly by substantial increases in input costs, which went up by more than 6 per cent.  Despite the problems experienced by several sectors, particularly in the second half of the year, output value declined by less than 1 per cent overall.</P>
    <P>Depreciation rose by nearly 6 per cent, reflecting the record levels of investment by farmers in recent years.  Also on a positive note, direct payments increased by nearly 9 per cent to £1,024 million.  These payments now account for nearly 55 per cent of farm income.</P>
    <P>This is a remarkable level of public subsidy, and it will have helped many farm families in what has been a difficult year.  That is the gross income, for Deputy Boylan's information.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the problems faced by the farming community and the many measures that have been taken to alleviate the situation.  In recent months I have travelled the length and breadth of the country to attend meetings to listen to farmers air their concerns and grievances.  Be it three or 300 &mdash; in one case it was 450 &mdash; they all got a hearing and an opportunity to suggest solutions and, just as important, hear explanations from me as to why things were going wrong and how we thought we could sort the problems out.  Those meetings produced some very engaging discussions which were very valuable.</P>
    <P>Farmers need to know they have access to us and that we listen and respond to their needs.  We have responded well to their needs, but we are certainly not calling it a day yet.  We have to continue listening and being as responsive as possible, and that is what I intend to do.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat industry is in crisis.  This has been addressed in export refunds, aids to private storage and other methods of alleviating the crisis. The problem is not new, nor is it confined to Ireland; it is worldwide and arises out of the BSE crisis and the classing of swine fever in Holland, where numbers have grown enormously.  I am aware of the crisis experienced by farmers in the northeast and northwest due to the lack of slaughter facilities in another part of the island.  I have met those farmers, and I sympathise fully with their plight, as they are very efficient farmers. I have received representations from all the Cavan-Monaghan Deputies, including Deputy Boylan, on this matter and met them at the Virginia Show.  We must work within the confines of the EU, and pigmeat is not an intervention product, so there are different mechanisms for that industry.  The EU is 108 per cent over supply, and my understanding is that the North American market has not reached full expansion yet.  It will not reach its full target, a 5 per cent increase, until March 1999.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan mentioned small farmers.  We all know small farmers and identify with them. We feel passionately for small farmers and what they have done for our communities.  Rural Ireland without farmers or people living in it is not Ireland.  The fodder crisis has been devastating. We have had high levels of rainfall since <Col N="601" /> August 1997 which has devastated poor quality land, mainly in marginal areas.  I visited north Meath with Deputy Johnny Brady, west Limerick with Deputies Collins and Finucane and the Duhallow area of north Cork to see the damage. We have tried to address this situation.</P>
    <P>There is always a future for farmers, be they big or small.  There is a perception abroad that we will have to rationalise and limit the number of farmers.  That is not my philosophy, and I never want it said that it is.  I believe in a vibrant rural Ireland with farming families, who have been the backbone of our society for many generations.  I do not doubt that those farming families will survive. They will get the full support of this Government, which has always had a great commitment to rural Ireland and to agriculture.  Let nobody doubt where I stand on this issue.  I am not promoting rationalisation or the removal of families for viability; that is not my philosophy.  In its assistance to small farmers the Government has committed itself to the viability of that sector.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget and Estimates introduced some very significant measures for dealing with rural exclusion, and providing for a more competitive industry structure in the future.  The gross estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food for 1999 has increased by £73 million to £814 million &mdash; another record for expenditure on agriculture and food.  This represents a net increase of 19 per cent.  Total expenditure, including FEOGA guarantee expenditure, which is not included in the Vote, will be almost £2 billion in 1999.  This expenditure will be run on an administrative budget of £133 million, less than 7 per cent of the total amount spent.</P>
    <P>The changes to the smallholders assistance scheme will be very important in terms of providing an income safety net for severely disadvantaged farmers.</P>
    <P>The means test which applies to the existing smallholders scheme will be modified by giving child related income disregards of £100 to £200 per year per child.  Other income will be assessed at 80 per cent, which is a very fair assessment.  We have been looking for it for some time.  In practical terms, a farmer with a spouse and two children, earning £100 a week, will have assistance payments increased by £28 a week to a total of £66.  A farmer with a spouse and two children earning £150 a week would not have qualified for assistance under the old scheme.  Under the new scheme that family will receive £26 a week in assistance.</P>
    <P>The number of participants is expected to almost double from 6,800 to 13,600.  The new scheme will cost £15 million in addition to the £30 million already being spent on smallholders assistance.  That is a substantial amount.  In addition, the fodder money has been a major contribution. I compliment Teagasc on the assessments it has carried out in all these areas.  These were efficiently done and the assessments were very prudent.</P>
    <P>Funding for the rural environment protection <Col N="602" /> scheme has been increased by 21 per cent to £176 million.  The scheme has attracted a great response with some 38,500 farmers currently participating. The 1999 allocation will allow for more farmers to participate in the scheme and to avail of attractive supports for farming in an environmentally friendly way.</P>
    <P>An additional £25 million is being allocated to the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes for 1999. These on-farm investment schemes are targeted towards smaller farms, and that is a focused commitment to rural Ireland.  This additional amount brings the total funding available for those schemes in 1999 to £36.5 million.  This is in addition to the £45 million which has already been secured in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a new targeted national scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  The scheme will be funded by the Exchequer, at a cost, over three years, of £10 million. There were several other expenditure items which I do not have time to go into such as headage support payments of £111 million, £42 million for disease eradication and controls, which is a terrible state of affairs, £6.5 million for the national beef assurance scheme, and an allocation of £40 million for Leader and INTERREG.  The disease eradication schemes cannot continue to burden the taxpayer.  We cannot have this inefficiency at farm level from a number of people who continuously wreck the system.  Our record on brucellosis and tuberculosis is not good and must be improved.</P>
    <P>Rural water and sewerage schemes have been allocated £50 million over the next three years. Although not specifically aimed at agriculture it will benefit the sector greatly.  Two programmes are involved, one of which relates to facilities in small rural towns and villages while the other is directed towards improving water quality in private group schemes.  This was an outstanding budget on behalf of the people and great credit is due to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for the effort they are putting into running the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the disadvantages of announcing the budget before Christmas is that one gets to speak for only five or six minutes rather than the 30 minutes one would get if it were announced in February.  I agree with the final remarks of the Minister of State as it was an outstanding budget.  All of us have certain ideas which we want implemented every year but there is no doubt that the budget was good.  It was so good that the response from the Opposition has been all over the place, not just as between the two main Opposition parties but as between different spokespeople within them.  Some called for everything to be spent while the initial response from Deputy Noonan was that it was inflationary and too much was spent.  However, his colleagues on the backbenches said the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> Part of the political process is that every party puts a spin on issues but recently it has not just been a case of putting the best spin on them as there has been absolute abuse of facts and lies have been told.  I briefly saw the Labour Party budget address by Deputy McDowell on television earlier this week and it contained incorrect facts and spin.  He stated that the back to work allowance for the long-term unemployed had been reduced, when in fact it was increased.  I wanted to get a copy of the broadcast because it totally distorted the facts.  It appeared that the statement had been prepared prior to the budget and the party just ran with it anyway, ignoring what the budget actually contained.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to CORI's document.  It is a very good group, which I greatly admire, and it operates in my constituency.  I listen to their submissions and presentations on basic income every year.  However, when I glanced through the group's document it contained incorrect figures. Statistics are misleading given that some may be technically right.  The document quotes a figure of £91 million for the social welfare package and much of the analysis in it is based on that figure. However, the package amounted to £305 million. I do not know where that figure came from, given that social welfare is funded from different sources.  It is sad that a group for which I have great respect used incorrect figures and then presented such a document.  Once the foundation was wrong, much of the comment following it was also wrong.</P>
    <P>The tax proposals in the budget were very reforming.  Every year the House debates the need for tax reform but it is rarely dealt with. However, the increase in personal allowances this year was staggering and the problem now is to ensure the threshold at which the higher rate of tax is paid is increased by widening the bands so that one does not reach the higher rate quickly.  I hope that direction will be taken.  Much was done for the elderly this year but I hope the allowance is increased so that more elderly people escape the tax net.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs and many of the proposals worked on by the committee and sent to the Minister were more or less carried through by him.  Our assessment of the situation was good and there is no doubt that many of the proposals in our submission were acted upon, which is a tribute to our realistic approach.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, although he did not respond to a request that the living alone allowance should be increased.  It is very important and, while the £6 per week increase for the elderly is marvellous, there is no doubt that when one partner dies and the other is left with one welfare payment the allowance helps.  I hope the committee's proposal for a significant increase in the allowance will be looked at again.  For many years it was ignored.  It was increased by £1 per <Col N="604" /> week a number of years ago and prior to that it was only increased by 10 pence per week per year.</P>
    <P>The CORI document constantly refers to poverty and states that not enough is given to the unemployed.  When measuring the poverty index if one averages incomes the same number of people are bound to be in the poverty trap; if they are given an increase of £100 each, the same number of people will still be in the trap if poverty is assessed in that manner.  Poverty is not just about money.  It is about involving people in their community, giving them something worthwhile to do and making them feel at the end of the day or week that they are making a contribution to their families, communities and society.</P>
    <P>I wish to see reform of the community employment schemes, which was not touched on in the budget.  They have been taken over by lone parents. These schemes are not equally attractive to everyone.  A great deal of social work needs to be carried out, especially in my constituency, and it could be done if the benefits of these schemes were distributed fairly.  Everybody should get something out of them but they have been hijacked by lone parents and it is not fair to those receiving unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to contributions from all sides of the House in budget debates spanning many years, this year has taken the biscuit in the sense that we have heard about paltry social welfare increases and missed opportunities. These Members are not meeting the same people as I am throughout the country because by and large the budget has been very well received by all sectors and all the social partners.</P>
      <P>That is an indication of the way the Government went about formulating the budget.  It analysed areas of need and addressed them.  The most significant area was tax change and the direction that has been taken in terms of radical tax reform, a topic which has been bandied around the House for many years.  At long last we have recognised there is a need to adjust personal taxes to ensure fairness to those in the low and middle income brackets.  The budget has started a process of trying to eliminate the wedge that exists between those on low pay and those on social welfare.</P>
      <P>While social welfare allowances were increased by 3 per cent across the board, which is well ahead of inflation, the manner in which personal allowances have been addressed is very significant for those on marginal incomes.  For example, those earning less than £100 will not be taxed. Over the past few days it has been stated that social welfare payments are paltry and major increases were not provided.  However, the facts speak for themselves over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government has contributed enormously to the advancement of payments to old age pensioners, in particular, and over the past two years it has increased such payments by £15 per week.  When the parties opposite were in <Col N="605" /> Government and had resources available to them, they did not significantly increase these payments. I am confident the Government will be early in meeting its election commitment to increase pensions to £100 per week by the end of its term.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, unemployment assistance has risen by £3 per week but over the next few years we must increase funding for training.  As unemployment levels fall we will have a hard core of people without skills.  We must divert funding towards those people, who could find work if they were trained.  There is more to be done in that area.  On Grafton Street and every major shopping thoroughfare, all the shops are advertising for staff.  We must ask ourselves how this can be, when such a high number of people are long-term unemployed.  I am confident there will be major improvement over the next few years in training, improving skills, and redefining a person's worth to the community, and that the unemployment figures will continue to tumble.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned the living alone allowance.  The payment should be changed because it militates against elderly people living together for company and security.  If one elderly neighbour moves into another's house, both lose the allowance.  We could reduce tension in areas with elderly people.  Many of them have asked me about sharing houses.  It would also alleviate problems associated with housing the elderly in local authority areas, because it is not always possible to find suitable ground level housing.</P>
    <P>There will be major improvements in funding for education and health.  The Opposition is making great play of the hospital waiting lists but this problem was inherited and steps were not taken in recent years to counteract the increasing waiting lists for acute hospital services.  I am therefore delighted the Minister has announced a waiting lists initiative to address these problems.  For some time I have called for a comparative costefficiency study of hospitals to see how efficiently they perform operations.  Those that are efficient should be rewarded and those that are inefficient should be asked why they are not performing as well as other hospitals with similar staff and facilities.</P>
    <P>I would like to continue but unfortunately, as the previous speaker said, pre-Christmas budget debates are short.  I have more to say but I will say it at another forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget, which is one of the best for many years and has been wellreceived. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, had a difficult job &mdash; expectations were high and we have seen the development of the new phenomenon of intensive lobbying, possibly because the resources were there on this occasion.  Interest groups were well organised and bodies undertook effective lobbying.  Pressure groups which had not previously been well organised put forward detailed submissions on this occasion and campaigned actively at the political level to achieve <Col N="606" /> their objectives.  Rightly or wrongly, the view was taken that he who shouts the loudest gets the most.  Also, many groups asked for a great deal in the expectation of getting less than they requested.  This lobbying made the Minister's job particularly hard; it also made life more difficult for a backbench TD, but that is part of our lot.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the Minister succeeded in satisfying most people with the budget, while keeping a firm grip on the public finances and the economy.  Like other speakers I welcome the income tax changes.  On this occasion we saw real reform of the tax system.  I welcome the emphasis placed on the lower paid and the removal of 80,000 people from the tax net.  I also welcome the generous social welfare increases, particularly those to the elderly.  The caring social philosophy of Fianna Fáil came to the fore in this budget.  All this has occurred against the background of a fall in interest rates, which is putting more money into people's pockets.</P>
      <P>I applaud the £400,000 allocated to the Mater Dei Institute of Education, Drumcondra.  This is a third level institution with a special ethos which was struggling because it did not receive State funding.  The Minister for Education and Science has responded to legitimate lobbying and, for the first time, has introduced State funding for the institute.  This is a good investment.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the allocation of £700,000 for the building of Darndale community centre, as mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. Much is happening in the Darndale area &mdash; it is planned to develop a village centre, with much funding from the EU, which will make many facilities available to local people.  They have put up with a great deal since some bright spark designed a so-called state of the art corporation estate which did not work in practice &mdash; it never could have, given its design, its laneways, and the type of housing provided.  The houses are now all but refurbished, a new park is being developed, and this budget allocation adds to those measures and shows the Government's commitment to improving this estate.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased about the allocation of £300,000 for the restoration of the Pearse family home.  It was a disgrace that this house, on Pearse Street, was falling into dereliction.  Many of us pass it every day on the way to the north side.  I welcome the purchase of the House by the Ireland Institute, a private organisation, and this Government allocation.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the money made available for the demolition of flat schemes in the north and south inner city.  The Taoiseach's hand can be seen in this decision.  If the Celtic tiger rids the city of poor quality flat schemes it will have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I had wished to speak about child care but my time is up.  Perhaps the next speaker will mention it and I can discuss it at another stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  This debate gives us a <Col N="607" /> chance to reflect on the values and priorities of our society and the policies of Government.  It gives us clear indicators of the choices being made in terms of public policy priorities.  If one analyses the budget one must come to the conclusion that certain values were predominant. Certain areas were dealt with efficiently, but others were comprehensively ignored.</P>
      <P>Many years ago Disraeli wrote a book called <i>The Two Nations</i> in which he described England at the time as a country divided between rich and poor.  The book brought home to people the divisions in English society at that time and he wanted to put in place policies to address them. Many countries try to do this but fail dismally. Ireland is in a unique situation at present.  We have a successful economy and thousands of jobs are being created effectively and efficiently.  The investment put into our education system has undoubtedly paid off and many things are going well.</P>
      <P>However, there is a deep sense of unease among many people.  Even with the Celtic tiger economy, 217,000 people are unemployed. Ireland has the worst problem of low pay in the OECD, with the exception of the USA.  There are 50,000 people on local authority waiting lists and there are in excess of 35,000 people on hospital waiting lists.  In addition, Ireland has the highest level of functional illiteracy in the OECD and there is a growing number of young people on our streets.  People who are benefiting from the Celtic economy are very disturbed by this.  They see the evidence of these social problems every day.</P>
      <P>One will find up to ten people sleeping on Baggot Street in my constituency every night.  The budget provided £1 million for homelessness. How many houses in south County Dublin would that buy to deal with this problem?  The answer is not enough.  As a statement of values, £1 million to start to interrupt the cycle of homelessness on the streets of Dublin is not enough.  There is a serious shortage of hostel places and people cannot move on from temporary accommodation.  A sum of £1 million is not a sufficient allocation to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar to Disraeli's England of the time, two Irelands are emerging.  A key issue is what the budget does to begin to deal with that divide which, at a time of plenty, is taking people by surprise.  The average person is very saddened by this divide in society which was not dealt with effectively in the budget.  I welcome the tax reform measures.  The Minister had the money to do what was required in that regard.  He is probably the first Minister to have such a golden opportunity and I welcome the fact that he took it.  However, the chance to tackle poverty, particularly child poverty, which is developing in society and to give those on long-term social welfare adequate money to ensure they are not excluded from ordinary life was not taken.  I <Col N="608" /> regret this statement of values by the Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the lack of real increases in social welfare, the underlying philosophy appears to be that to get people to take jobs in areas with skills shortages, social welfare payments must be kept low.  The idea is that this will force people into jobs.  This shows a lack of understanding of the needs of the long-term unemployed.  The issue of training and education in terms of helping those people, many of whom are caught up in generational unemployment, to move on from long-term unemployment to training and educational schemes and into jobs is not as simple as the budget implies.</P>
    <P>The decreases in the unemployment register must be welcomed, but some of the underlying thinking behind the budget does a disservice to those groups.  It does not recognise the problems they face in re-entering the jobs market.  I refer Members to the report on long-term unemployment prepared by the National Economic and Social Forum which addressed this issue very well.  It pointed out the range of initiatives which are needed if people are to move away from long-term dependency on social welfare.</P>
    <P>However, this does not deal with the needs of those who are on long-term payments because of illness or disability.  There was a moving debate recently on the needs of the physically handicapped. Thousands of people are unable to get out of their homes because of the lack of aids, appropriate day centres and appropriate supports. This is a major problem.</P>
    <P>Another area which was completely fudged by the Government was the issue of child care.  I hope the debate surrounding child care will serve as a wake up call not only to the Government, but also to the Department of Finance.  It was an insult to the expert working group which prepared a report.  We should not pull any punches in this regard.  The best thinking of the expert group was available to the Government and the Department of Finance, but for some extraordinary reason the Government decided to ignore this issue totally.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that this was an insult.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of trying to get this issue onto the agenda and numerous reports, Ministers then said that we need to start a debate.  Where were they for the past 20 years when one report after another recommended a range of initiatives in this area?  Finally an expert working group, which included representatives of all the social partners, brought a realistic plan to the Government, asked for £5 million in seed funding to begin to work out an approach to this issue throughout the country, but the response of the Minister for Finance and others was that we need a debate.</P>
    <P>They should wake up, find out the progress of this debate over the years and inform themselves. If the Minister for Finance knew as much about the child care industry as he does about the betting industry and if his understanding of it was at the same level, I guarantee there would have <Col N="609" /> been movement on this issue.  This matter involves investing in children and families.  Why was a decision not taken in the budget to invest in children?  People ask if it is the role of the State to invest in children, but what better place to put investment than the future of children and families? Why fudge the issue?</P>
    <P>Approximately £20 million is already spent on child care across ten Departments.  The principle of involvement in child care has been established by various Departments.  Why did the Government fudge a perfect opportunity when its own expert group made realistic, reasonable and necessary recommendations?  Why avoid taking any decision on child care?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>The answer is that this issue does not affect male Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to use the current opportunity in the debate on child care to move the issue forward.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, understands the situation and has spoken about it previously.  He knows the complexities facing families in his constituency who are paying between £500 and £700 a month, which is more than the cost of a mortgage in many cases, for child care.  The Minister of State should ensure that the Government begins to address this issue in a realistic way.  It is a very serious problem with many dimensions given that there are approximately 150,000 children under the age of nine in some form of paid child care at present.</P>
      <P>There is a totally false debate about women in and outside the home.  It is outrageous to hear people, primarily men, using the unpaid work of women in the home as an excuse for not doing something for another group.  We all want to recognise the unpaid work of women in the home and none more so than women.  They have strived to ensure that the work of women in the home becomes visible.  However, that should not be used as an excuse not to tackle the real problems all women face.</P>
      <P>Up to 30 per cent of women working full-time in the home will avail of some form of child care outside the home.  Everybody knows this from our daily experiences.  Women who work full-time in the home at one stage of their lives work outside the home at another.  Women who have reared families will still need some support at a later stage.  The artificial divide put forward is that this matter is very complicated and nothing can be done about it because there is a problem in relation to unpaid work.  The problem of unpaid work will not go away in this society or any other for many years.  It is a worldwide issue. Unpaid work has always been done by huge numbers of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the bigger equality issues include what is still happening in terms of the positions of women and men, the lack of women in decision making and the lack of access to child care.  I appeal to the Ministers who understand this problem to talk to their colleagues and to ensure this <Col N="610" /> issue moves forward.  The recommendations of the expert group should be taken on board so we can begin to adopt a comprehensive approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>In the British economy, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is beginning to address this issue with some interesting initiatives.  We owe no less to children and parents in this economy.  Apart from the equity issues involved and the quality of child care, there are economic reasons for addressing this issue.  If anything succeeds in moving policy here or elsewhere, it is the economy.</P>
    <P>There are skills shortages.  There are many women who wish to enter the workforce but cannot because of the lack of supports.  Grandmothers are leaving the workforce to look after their grandchildren.  Because of inflexibility in the workplace young women are leaving.  This is another key issue that must be addressed.  Incentives should have been introduced in the budget to deal with that issue.  Developing measures to address the crisis in child care should have been an integral part of the budget.  Questions must be asked as to why it was completely fudged.</P>
    <P>It is likely the number of women in the workplace will grow by 37 per cent by 2011 as a further 218,000 women join or rejoin the workforce. Some 600,000 Irish women are in the workforce. Some 46 per cent of men and women in the workforce have children under the age of four.  We have a responsibility to ensure they get supports. The doubling of child benefit for children under five, which was a Fine Gael recommendation, would have gone a long way to giving more income than the paltry increases provided.  Up to 30 per cent of women in the home use child care. Let us not have an artificial divide.</P>
    <P>There are new registration regulations for child care facilities.  There is a problem on the supply side but some minor measures were taken to deal with it.  Parents on maternity leave who wish to return to work are stressed in an effort to make child care arrangements.  This is a major issue for families.  It is very expensive for child care nurseries to comply with the regulations.  Yet, they have to comply with them from a quality point of view. In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled two weeks ago, I was informed that there are about 3,000 facilities in the country, very few of which have been inspected.  The Minister for Finance must support these nurseries to ensure they are brought up to standard where quality care can be provided.  It is very dangerous not to address this issue.  I hope the Government will commit itself to a national child care plan over seven years.  It should begin to put a package of measures in place to address this issue.  If the issue is to be fudged let it not be for the reasons put forward. They are unacceptable at any level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is avoidance of a major issue of huge concern to families all over the country.  It is a real issue.  The proportion of <Col N="611" /> income being paid by families in Ireland on child care is way above the European average.  This matter must be prioritised.  The budget was a missed opportunity to begin to show a commitment by providing £5 million seed funding.  Why was the £5 million seed funding not given since it was recommended by everybody involved in Partnership 2000?  What is the philosophical and practical reason for not doing this?  It is unacceptable.  I hope this issue will be dealt with in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
      <P>There is no question but that people are under huge pressure in the Dublin area because of the housing crisis.  In my constituency many men and women who have lived in rented accommodation all their lives are being asked to leave and are under enormous pressure to find alternative accommodation.  More money should have been allocated to develop sheltered accommodation of various types.  Obviously there is huge pressure in Dublin and in other parts of the country.  Will the Government introduce more schemes to provide sheltered and co-operative housing to those in this situation?  It is a crisis for many people.  Social welfare can only do so much in providing a rent supplement.  Given the enormous rent increases in the Dublin area this problem will add to the number of homeless and will be very stressful for those involved.  Not enough has been done in the area of housing.</P>
      <P>On health care, I have already mentioned the needs of the physically handicapped on which we had a debate recently.  The waiting list issue is a huge crisis.  I welcome the resources provided by the Minister.  While the substantial increases provided are welcome they do not deal effectively with hospital waiting lists.  In relation to women's health there are long waiting lists for cervical cancer smear tests and mammograms.  Not enough money is being put into screening to ensure people have access to quick services.  This area needs to be highlighted.  Health needs are endless. In an economy that is doing well we have to highlight these areas and show a sensitivity and understanding at a time of budget surplus.</P>
      <P>The transport issue remains a serious problem. Not enough money has been allocated in the Dublin area for traffic calming measures. Obviously this allocation comes through local authorities.  It is clear the scale of traffic calming measures is much too slow in all areas of Dublin. Extra money should be allocated to the suburbs for traffic calming measures.  Traffic calming measures would make a huge difference to the quality of life for people in the Dublin villages, all of which are under severe pressure.  Every Dublin TD is conscious of the problem.  This is not an impossible problem, there are solutions. Measures can be implemented in residential areas to improve the quality of life on the transport side.</P>
      <P>This is a time of great prosperity.  Many improvements have been made.  In his budget the Minister dealt very well with tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> However a number of areas were missed.  I welcome the extra allocations provided.  It is the job of the Opposition to point out the gaps and areas where policy should develop.  I hope we can continue the debate on these areas in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle the budget was a good one but it has a number of inadequacies. My colleagues, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Barnes, highlighted one such inadequacy, the area of child care.  Deputy Fitzgerald made a strong case in relation to this matter.  A problem which will cause the slow down of the economy is the shortage of people to take up vacancies in the workforce.  There is a shortage of people to take up low paid jobs.  This problem will increase unless we succeed in getting more people off unemployment.  Some housewives may wish to return to work but it is not financially viable for them to do so.  We must encourage such people back into the workforce if we are to keep the economy growing at its current rate.</P>
      <P>We must also consider the issue of child care in regard to retraining.  The vast majority of women who return to the workforce return to low paid and part-time jobs in catering or other labour intensive industries.  It suits them to work part-time while their children are at school as they do not have access to child care facilities. The money they earn is quite minimal when tax is deducted, yet they need it to make ends meet. We must consider retraining women who were in the workforce previously and now wish to return to it.  If we are going to provide adult education and training courses for them, we must have the necessary child care back-up facilities.  We must address the current skills shortage before it starts to retard our economic growth.  As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, we must not overlook women who choose to stay at home and look after their families.  I urge the Minister and the Government to accept the recommendations of the expert group and implement a national child care plan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kitt, the Tánaiste and Deputy Treacy travel through County Roscommon when they return home.  Unfortunately, they do not leave many jobs there.  I hope they will provide the industrial jobs required in Longford and Roscommon and the midland counties in general.  The rural economies of Tarmonbarry and Clondra received a huge blow last week with the loss of 180 jobs at Atlantic Mills.  These two villages have a combined population of no more <Col N="613" /> than 200 people.  The factory floor space measures nine acres.  Textile industry closures have also occurred in Donegal and in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Serious problems are being experienced within the textile industry and I hope the Minister of State and his colleagues ensure replacement employment is created in rural Ireland, not just in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The Atlantic Mills closure resulted from over-production and lack of sales, the same reasons cited for the closure of Fruit of the Loom.  Cheaper labour and production costs are available elsewhere which allow these companies to make better profits.  We must ensure industry is located in the areas in which closures occur and that retraining is provided as soon as possible.  We must also consider the remaining textile industries and ensure the necessary back-up facilities are available to them should anything go wrong.  The Tánaiste should maintain close contact with these companies through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as they are undergoing severe difficulties at the moment.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will ensure additional employment is created and is evenly spread throughout the country.  Recently, she announced jobs through Enterprise Ireland but not one of them came to County Roscommon in spite of the fact that one third of the workforce of Atlantic Mills lives in the county.  It will be very difficult to find another industry for the area.</P>
      <P>Advance factories are available in Longford and Roscommon towns.  Several companies have visited the factories but to no avail.  The Minister for Finance announced rural tax designation measures in the last budget which could have attracted this badly needed investment.  However, the proposals did not go forward to Brussels until last September because the Government wanted to finalise the Dublin docks development and other developments throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Investment is badly needed in these rural areas which have suffered severe population decline over the years.  It would be advantageous to Dublin constituencies for employment to be created in rural communities as it would reduce pressure on the city's infrastructure.  Basic infrastructure is available in rural areas but we do not have the population.  Schools are closing because there are fewer young people.  I hope the Minister of State will seek to ensure an alternative industry is found for the Atlantic Mills premises, that retraining is provided for the workforce and that funding is put in place immediately.  The factory site spans 23 acres on the banks of the River Shannon, nine acres of which are under roof.  The closure represents a huge loss to two rural communities which have been badly hit by emigration and migration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the £6 increase in the old age pension. However, not every old age pensioner will receive a £6 increase.  Adult dependants will only receive a £3 increase. In other words, a husband will receive a £6 increase while his wife only receives <Col N="614" /> £3.  Sometimes, she will be lucky to receive even the paltry increase to which she is entitled.  I came across a case recently where a husband had given his wife an extra £6 but when he discovered she was only entitled to a £3 increase, he deducted £3. All old age pensioners should receive the same increases in payments.  In effect, most of the increase in pension payments goes towards increased rent prices in local authority accommodation. By the time inflation is taken into account, the increases are negligible.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Naughten that the Government is determined to pursue a policy of regionalisation.  The Deputy said that whenever Galway plays Mayo or Roscommon I wear the Galway colours but, as Deputy Callely is aware, when it comes to representing our constituencies in Dublin, whether it be in regard to the Luas project, the ring road, schools or employment, we do the job that we have been sent here to do. Many of my constituents in Dublin South come from a rural background.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the three areas for which I have responsibility, labour affairs, international trade and consumer affairs.  This is the most pro-active budget in the history of the State when it comes to addressing social exclusion, the theme of many contributions.  This sends the right signal.  From next year no one earning less than £100 a week will pay income tax.  This is a clear incentive to move from unemployment to a job.  There is now a greater incentive to stay in employment and increase the number of hours worked.  The national anti-poverty strategy makes it clear that the best and most effective route out of poverty is a job.  The budget is about the empowerment of employees on low and middle incomes.  For the socially excluded, it is about opening the gateway to participation and opportunity.</P>
      <P>We are exceeding our key labour market goals. We are extremely successful in translating economic growth into jobs.  The unemployment rate has fallen to 7.8 per cent and continues to drop. The long-term unemployment rate has fallen dramatically in four years from 9 per cent to 3.9 per cent or 63,500.  There is no complacency about these figures.  We are determined to reduce the unemployment rate to 5 per cent through reintegrating the long-term unemployed into jobs and preventing drift into long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element of the strategy is the activation programme for the under 25s introduced in September as part of the employment action programme which gives effect to the EU employment guidelines.  The programme operated <Col N="615" /> through FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs provides intensive support and guidance for job-seekers with 7,500 FÁS places reserved for referrals.  In September 884 persons were referred for supports, of whom 345 or about 40 per cent had signed off by the end of October.  Of the persons interviewed by FÁS about 42 per cent were placed in a job or referred to a training programme.</P>
    <P>For persons at a remove from the labour market it is not enough to open the door.  It is essential to equip them with the skills and experience necessary to match programmes to the needs of job-seekers and employers.  That is what we have sought to do in a targeted set of labour market initiatives.  The critical factor is that they are targeted and closely linked to the labour market.  In this way they should produce good progression into jobs.</P>
    <P>Consistent with this approach, five targeted initiatives are being introduced in the programmes operating under the aegis of my Department creating over 8,000 extra active labour market places at a 1999 cost of £13.75 million.  More places will be created in subsequent years.  A total of 4,800 jobs clubs places are being provided at a 1999 cost of £2.5 million.  Jobs clubs are internationally recognised as being an effective and cost-efficient way of helping the unemployed in their job search activity.  They are based on the self-help principle and provide a forum in which information on job vacancies is made available and where assistance and coaching in the form of CV preparation, interview skills, printing, copying, telephone services, etc., are made available to the job-seeker.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,500 places are being provided in bridging programmes for the long-term unemployed at a 1999 cost of £4.35 million.  Evidence suggests that many long-term unemployed persons do not have the skills necessary to participate in specific skills courses direct from the live register.  The purpose of this initiative is to bring them up to a level where they can participate in the training programme with the best progression into jobs.</P>
    <P>The jobs initiative is being extended by a further 875 places, giving a total of 2,875, at a 1999 gross cost of £4.9 million.  The jobs initiative is a targeted programme focused on persons over 35 who have been unemployed for five years.</P>
    <P>Two specific programmes are being introduced at a total 1999 cost of £2 million to facilitate lone parents to take up jobs.  For the first time FÁS will have a part-time training programme with 800 places for lone parents at a cost of £1.8 million. This is in recognition that lone parents have particular difficulties in accessing the labour market and that flexibility is required.  A total of 400 jobs clubs places, in addition to the 4,800 places mentioned, are being provided for lone parents at a 1999 cost of £200,000 in the areas of greatest concentration, Dublin North and Dublin West.</P>
    <P>With a view to the roll-out of the activation <Col N="616" /> programme to persons over 25 in 1999 we have secured £500,000 to strengthen staff resources in the FÁS employment service.  These are important measures which the budget and the 1999 Estimates have allowed us to introduce.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the crucial role played by social partnership in our economic success.  After four national partnership programmes there has been a dramatic turnaround in our fortunes and we now have the fastest growing economy in the developed world.  Much of the credit for this is due to the system of social partnership put in place in 1987 and developed since then.  I hope a further agreement will be concluded.  Progress has been made towards the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage which is but one example of the Government's assault on exclusion and marginalisation.</P>
    <P>We are spectacularly successful in attracting foreign investment.  We are creating new jobs at a record rate.  Further reductions in tax rates, with other reliefs such as widening bands, have been announced.  Inflation has been kept low.</P>
    <P>With the onset of EMU, increasing globalisation and the adverse consequences of economic slow-down, particularly in Asia, the pressures and competitive forces impacting on the economy are increasing.  The continuation of partnership and the negotiation of a new three year national agreement are crucial and central to the Government's social and economic strategy.</P>
    <P>The remarkable and sustained growth of the economy has been export led.  The pattern remains strong with exports to August up 31 per cent on the same period last year.  The trade surplus in August was £1.1 billion, £8.8 billion for the first eight months of the year.  This represents a massive increase of over 50 per cent on the same period last year.  There is, however, no room for complacency.  There is economic upheaval across the globe.  With an open economy world events have a significant impact here.</P>
    <P>From 1 January Ireland will share a common currency with ten of our neighbours in the European Union.  Many have said that in preparing for the introduction of the euro the consumer will lose out.  We are determined to be vigilant.  I intend to launch a draft national code of practice on dual displays of prices on 18 December.  This will require that dual displays of prices be unambiguous, easily identifiable and clearly legible.  It will be an important part of my Department's strategy to protect consumers in the change-over process.</P>
    <P>The budget has been subject to much criticism.</P>
    <P>Although there is always room for improvement &mdash; child care and other issues remain to be dealt with &mdash; I long for the day when Opposition Members will say that a Government is doing a good job.  I commend the Minister on introducing an historic budget in the run-up to the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I compliment the Minister for Finance for introducing a caring budget. <Col N="617" /><i>Business and Finance</i> magazine described it as a left wing budget while last year's budget was described as right wing.  If it is a left wing budget I am pleased.  It is the Fianna Fáil Party's backbencher's budget because many of the aspects we pressed at our parliamentary party meetings and other fora have come to fruition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the old age pension by £6 per week with an extra £3 per week for an adult dependant.  This moves pensioners' entitlements to £100 per week.  It is a commitment we made when coming into Government and we will honour it.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the changes in the social welfare area.  We proposed many of them to the Minister throughout last year.  The changes he announced in the budget and to be included in the Social Welfare Bill will be of major benefit to the less well off and the poorer sections in the community. I welcome the extra funding for improved mental handicap services, physical disability, child care and convalescent care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister for Health and Children.  Any Minister dealing with the problems in the health service has a major task.  I have long held the view &mdash; Deputy Callely disagrees with me &mdash; that all the health boards should be disbanded and reconstituted.  The majority of politicians on health boards take little interest in the running of the boards and they usually leave it to the chief executive officers.  I do not include Deputy Callely in this.  Cutbacks do not take place at the administrative end, or from the chief executive officer down, rather they are manifest in ward closures or reductions in nursing and medical staff.  Administration in the health boards appears to be increasing at an alarming rate and the Minister needs to look seriously at the operations of boards throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that more than 80,000 people on low pay will be taken out of the lower end of the tax net.  Those earning £100 per week will not pay tax, which is a welcome development. Over the past ten years the PAYE sector has been crucified.  When all of the tough decisions were taken in the late 1980s and early 1990s this sector had to bear the burden of the cutbacks. Now when the country is flush with money it is right that we should reward those who are working. The Minister for Finance is moving fast in that direction, which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the changes introduced to farming, especially the reintroduction of the on-farm investment schemes and the targeted national scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  We promised this prior to the last general election and we are honouring our commitment.  I especially welcome the farm assist scheme for low income family farmers.  All Members of the House argued for this in recent months.  I compliment the Minster for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance for recognising that there is a significant number of small family farmers who are barely surviving and who <Col N="618" /> need the farm assist scheme.  I hope it will be introduced as quickly as possible.  In his circular the Minister said he hopes to have it implemented by the middle of next year.  I hope this will happen early next year.</P>
    <P>There are always one or two aspects of a budget that do not fit into place.  The gurus in the Department of Finance always include aspects that cause concern to politicians and members of the public.  The measures on VRT bands for cars based on their cc is a major mistake.  I have discussed the matter with him and with other members of the Cabinet.  We should revisit the measure in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>For too long motorists have been easy prey for successive Governments.  We have raised car tax and petrol and now there are to be increases in the VRT.  Motorists are already paying huge prices for their cars and pay high petrol prices and road tax.  In addition, car insurance charges are way above what is available elsewhere in the EU.  VRT is not compatible with EU tax harmonisation, which is being much talked about.  Six years ago an Oireachtas committee on EU secondary legislation recommended that VRT should disappear within four years.</P>
    <P>The tremendous success of the scrappage scheme will be undermined when new car buyers are penalised by the increase in VRT.  The threshold of under 1,400 cc is too low a level at which to make changes.  Cars of 1.6 or 1.8 litres include the Ford Mondeo, Mitsubishi Carisma and Honda Civic.  These are normal family cars.  Families with four or five children need decent sized cars.  The Minister should look seriously at this area.  Motor dealers and their staff tell me that customers are up in arms and are cancelling orders placed for next January.  The Minister should revert to the old system or at least amend the threshold to 2,000 cc or 2,500 cc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent budget.  When the Minister made his Budget Statement I cast my mind back to the budgets introduced during difficult economic times in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Most economists would agree the difficult decisions taken then, especially the social partnership arrangements and the models established for subsequent years, which are continuing, established economic stability.  This contributed significantly, along with other factors, to the present excellent budgetary position.</P>
      <P>A Leas Cheann-Comhairle, you were in Government at a very difficult time when harsh and hard decisions had to be taken.  The country faced bankruptcy when a minority Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1987.  It made the necessary decisions with courage.  When the economic history of that period is written much credit will go to those who took decisions at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents and taxpayers had invested substantially in the education and personal development of the many young people who emigrated at that time and there was a serious haemorrhage of natural talent.  Many secured worthwhile employment <Col N="619" /> abroad, but a significant number have now returned to participate in the present economic growth and activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national debt overhung every decision taken by the Minister for Finance. However, with the necessary political resolution those problems have been confronted successfully and I hope we have set the scene for continued economic growth in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This budget is a pay back to all those who have made sacrifices and to those who have followed in their footsteps.  It signals continuing significant investment in our education structures.  There has been a substantial increase in social welfare payments to those who have retired and to the less well off.  The Department of Health and Children, is demanding an increasingly bigger slice of budgetary expenditure, and the budgetary provisions have addressed many of the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Economic growth brings change.  The economic growth in recent years has increased the demand for housing stock across the country, particularly along the east coast.  There has been a significant increase in the unit cost of housing.  That gives rise to a concern that people on a low or middle income will not be able to provide their own accommodation.  The Government introduced changes in line with the recommendations of the Bacon report.  The rate of increase in house prices has slowed down, but the cost of building land is an inflationary factor underlying problems in that area.  Local authorities, particularly those on the east coast and none more so than Louth County Council, are faced with a significant dilemma. The escalation in house prices in Dublin has resulted in an overspill in demand for houses in the neighbouring counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The indigenous population of those counties are finding it increasingly difficult to secure building sites at a reasonable cost. It may be necessary to revisit some of the county development plans and to make adjustments. Louth County Council has decided to focus on 42 development centres in the county.  That policy objective is admirable, but is it possible to implement it within a five year period, which is the normal timespan for such a plan?  There may be a need to introduce flexibility or a provision to review these development plans, if the policy objectives are not being met within, say, a two year period.  Such plans must have a policy objective of ensuring that the supply of building land is such that it will not spiral inflation in the price of land which would affect those who wish to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>Many of the traditional industries were significant in the economy in County Louth.  Its significant mix of rural and urban industrial development was a microcosm of the national economy. Dundalk had a significant footwear industry.  The county also had a significant textile industry and many people worked in the agricultural industry, <Col N="620" /> but many modern industries, which require skilled personnel, have taken the place of those traditional industries.  I hope those new industries continue to grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with what my colleague, Deputy Browne of Wexford, said about the health boards.  I have served on the Eastern Health Board since 1985 and have found the board members, regardless of their party affiliations, very committed to the provision and delivery of health services.  Deputy Neville is present and I served with him on the Association of Health Boards of Ireland, on which all eight health boards are represented.  The health boards are working well and their board members are dedicated and committed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  The budget represents the buoyant economic position Ireland enjoys.  The Government is working well and delivering on its promises.  As targets are achieved, the Government sets new horizons in the knowledge that the world economy is in a volatile state and that we have a high level of foreign investment.  As witnessed this week, our current strengths can be hit at any time.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging our large national debt and our underlying financial position, which has greatly improved, the true measures of our public finances are good and we must be cautious.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on his overall approach to this budget.  He took advantage of the current favourable economic and budgetary conditions and indicated that if we wish to continue on this path and avoid painful and disruptive adjustments in future, we must think strategically and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>From a taxpayer's point of view, the budget is impressive and significant.  For the first time a Government is not only tinkering with the system. The budget provides £581 million in personal tax reliefs and more than 80,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net.  The number of taxpayers availing of exemptions will increase or marginal reliefs will fall.  Tax bands have been increased and individuals will not pay tax on income up to £100 per week.  I particularly welcome the move in the right direction in respect of provisions for the elderly, in particular pensions. I welcome the move in tax and social welfare reforms, but I put down the marker that much more could be done in this area.  The system is changing, particularly the taxation system as we move towards a system of tax credits.  At long last we are on the way to real tax reform.  I welcome those moves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some good initiatives in the budget and, as in all budgets, some issues that give rise to concern.  Many people, like my wife and I, who have a weekly outgoing on cre che and child minding were hoping for a tax credit allowance.  The Minister indicated he was anxious to go down <Col N="621" /> that road.  I understand he is awaiting a further report to get a clearer picture of what is needed in this area.  In the meantime, a small, but important, step in respect of benefit-in-kind and capital allowance write-offs are positive measures, especially as a means of facilitating and encouraging the supply of child care facilities.  I also welcome the benefit-in-kind in respect of the provision by the employers to employees of bus, DART and rail passes valid for a month or more which will not be subject to tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald castigated the Minister for not addressing the problem of homelessness. She was wrong in that.  The Minister has doubled from £2 million to £4 million the allocation to local authorities for hostels for the homeless.  I particularly welcome the Minister's special allocation of £1 million to address the problem of homelessness in Dublin.  This is a serious problem and that allocation will be well spent.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the measures to increase the income guidelines for eligibility for a medical card, especially in respect of persons over 70 years of age.  For a single person, aged 70 and living alone, in the Eastern Health Board area, the income under the current guidelines is £97, and under the new guidelines, £133; for a single person aged 80 and living alone, the income under the current guidelines is £101, and under the new guidelines is £140; and for a married couple, aged 70 the income under the current guidelines is £144, and under the new guidelines, £199.  That shows a significant improvement in respect of those who may qualify for a medical card, particularly those aged 70 and over.</P>
    <P>The £21 million pounds additional funding allocated to the provision for community and family support groups and the special allocation of £100,000 for the development of St Vincent de Paul services, are very welcome.  However, I am not satisfied that the calculations, as contained in the budget, will stack up.</P>
    <P>Under environmental tax issues, the Minister proposes to take a number of positive steps.  In respect of VRT, he proposed a three tiered structure applicable from 1 January 1999, which will yield £43 million additional revenue.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister for Finance to modify and amend these calculations.  They are incorrect and the industry will prove that.  I welcome the fact that since I raised this matter with the parliamentary party yesterday, the Department of Finance has made contact with SIMI to make progress on it.  This has been referred to as a green tax.  An imported used vehicle of between 1,200 and 1,400 cc can be more damaging to the environment than a new vehicle of between 1,600 and 2,000 cc.  The Minister should listen to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Deputy Yates to my replies to a number of parliamentary questions taken on 30 September 1998 and 10 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The position as outlined to the House on those occasions remains essentially unchanged.  As I stated, the Government agreed in principle in September that Aer Lingus should seek a partner, that the partnership could be equity based and that the process could move to the next stage which would include discussions with other airlines. As I indicated in September, this stage could take up to six months.</P>
      <P>While I have regular contact with the Chairman of Aer Lingus, there are no specific developments to report at this time.  Aer Lingus is currently undertaking discussions with a number of prospective partners of which, I understand, Lufthansa is one.</P>
      <P>Neither my officials not I are involved in these discussion, the purpose of which is to generate proposals for my consideration and that of the Government in due course.  Shareholder involvement will, of course, be a major feature of the next phase of this process, perhaps from March or April next year, and depending on the options which the current phase generates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, as a shareholder and the person accountable to this House, these are valid questions about public policy? Is the Minister aware of detailed reports of statements made by the Chairman and Chief Executive of Lufthansa, Mr. Juergen Weber, that detailed discussions are taking place between Aer Lingus and Lufthansa and that such discussions are on the basis of Aer Lingus joining the STAR alliance?  Will the Minister clarify whether discussions are taking place with one group only, because the previous reports were in relation to British Airways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the discussions are in regard to the STAR <Col N="623" /> alliance, do they concern a marketing and seat sharing alliance as an affiliate member or full blooded equity involvement?  This may not be finalised but I would like the Minister to tell me down which road we are heading.  Are we still at the crossroads between one group and another or are we past that stage and in the STAR alliance as an affiliate member or equity shareholder?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that these are valid questions of public interest.  The Deputy asked whether we were at the crossroads or if we were involved with one grouping, as distinct from talking to many companies.  The chairman told me on Tuesday that he had an initial round of discussions with many airlines, including Lufthansa. He now hopes to engage in more detailed discussions with the same number of airlines.  He has not yet homed in on any one alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying.  Is she therefore denying the suggestion that Aer Lingus has a clear preference for the STAR alliance, that it does not involve equity and that the board has been briefed along these lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying anything &mdash; there is nothing to deny.  I met the chairman on Tuesday and asked him for guidance on the position of the discussion.  He told me that the next board meeting was in February.  I asked him directly if he was homed in on one alliance and he replied that he was not.  I can only repeat what he said to me, that he proposed to re-enter talks with many airlines before coming to an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With the resources of her Department and the Government, is the Minister carrying out any analysis herself?  Whenever the discussions reach a conclusion, will the Minister investigate the matter at that stage?  Would it be more prudent that the Department form its own view on this and not consider the Aer Lingus proposal as a <i>fait accompli</i>, but develop its own thinking?  It may well be the case that the Government, as a shareholder, might have its own opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid point.  The chairman meets the Minister alone, that is the precedent.  It is a valuable exercise because it gives an insight into the thinking on policy matters. My officials met and we talked over the discussions with the chairman.  The Department would have its own knowledge of all of the airlines, although not in the strategic sense of forming a relationship with Aer Lingus.  The aviation section of the Department would have knowledge of all the major airlines in the world.  When the chairman told me he was about to begin a more intense round of negotiations with a number of <Col N="624" /> airlines, I was satisfied the discussions were still at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my intervention in the threatened Bus Éireann strike in July 1997, I discussed the matter with my Cabinet colleagues. During those discussions the possible need for a facilitator to assist in resolving the dispute was mentioned.  I subsequently held a series of consultations with management and unions in the CIE companies and with the Labour Relations Commission. There was general agreement that the negotiations on their restructuring programmes in each of the CIE companies should continue with the assistance of facilitators appointed by the Labour Relations Commission.  There was also a view that CIE should retain the services of a suitably qualified person from outside the company to assist in the co-ordination of its approach to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I put this view to the company and suggested that the person referred to in the Deputy's question might fulfil that role.  The company considered this view and in a press statement dated 31 July 1997, the CIE chairman announced that in order to facilitate swift progress in these negotiations CIE was willing to appoint a facilitator with a view to achieving early agreement.  CIE subsequently appointed the person referred to in the Deputy's question as a change management specialist to assist the individual operating companies in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>I tabled the question to try to <Col N="625" /> resolve the contradictions in the statements which the Minister made previously in the House, for example on 24 November 1998.  I am paraphrasing the Minister because I am not allowed to quote her during Question Time.  She said that the Government appointed John Behan.  On the same date she said that he was employed by CIE. Who appointed John Behan?  Is &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; different to &ldquo;employment&rdquo;?  The Minister has said that CIE employ him but the Government appointed him.  Who pays him?  What does he do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the last question first, which was about the role he plays.  He continues to play that role in Aer Lingus.  I was very involved with him in regard to TEAM Aer Lingus.  CIE pays him.  I do not know how much he is paid and I do not intend to ask &mdash; CIE can supply that information if it so wishes.  That is the situation.</P>

      <P>That does not resolve the matter.</P>
      <P>We need dictionaries now to find out whether &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; and &ldquo;employment&rdquo; have the same meaning.  The Government appointed this man and someone else employs him.  We are not quite sure what his role is, although we are told that CIE pays him.  Is this man causing more problems than he is solving in CIE?  Is he second guessing the management there?  Did that give rise to the statement by the chairman of CIE that the Minister and her change facilitator, John Behan, should butt out and mind their own business? However, I do not think the Minister should butt out.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, she has had, or will have, with representatives of Ryanair or other carriers using Dublin Airport in the context of the proposed removal of the discount and rebates scheme on landing and departure charges with effect from 1999; and if her attention has been drawn to the recent announcement by Ryanair to switch the development of five new routes into Europe from Dublin to London in 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26895/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed airport charges with the chief executive of Ryanair, Mr. Michael O'Leary.  As I already stated in the Dáil, I have also had discussions on the matter with the chairman of Aer Rianta in the context of my regular meetings with him.  I will continue to consult on this issue with the air carriers and with Aer Rianta in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I am aware that Aer Rianta has decided not to introduce a new cycle of discount schemes for airport charges at Dublin airport in January next. However, benefits from the 1997 and 1998 discount schemes will continue to accrue to air carriers until 2003 and 2004, respectively.  I believe this represents a prudent interim position for Aer Rianta, pending further decisions on airport charges by me in due course.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Aer Rianta has informed me that he has commissioned a study on the existing structure of airport charges levied by the company. Consultants are expected to submit a report before Christmas, to facilitate the board in developing comprehensive proposals on airport charges to be submitted to me in due course for regulatory approval.  In considering any such proposals, I will take all relevant factors into account, including the impact any change in the level of charges would have on airlines and, consequently, on air travellers generally, and including also the prospects for achieving a postponement of the loss of duty free within the European Union.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Ryanair has announced its intention to develop five new routes out of London next year.  Under European Union regulations, European airlines are free to operate on any routes within Europe, in accordance with their own commercial judgment.  While I have no statutory function in this regard, I will obviously continue to encourage all airlines to provide as many new services as possible from Irish airports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept she has a role in this regard, not only as a shareholder of Aer Rianta but also as the <i>de facto</i> regulator of landing charges?  From her discussions last Saturday with Ryanair, does she agree that when the rebates are fully unwound the charge per departing passenger will rise from £4.31 to in excess of £8?</P>
      <P>The last question concerned an appointment by the Minister.  There is a number of carriers involved and would it not be a prudent measure to appoint a mediator, given Aer Rianta's reluctance to budge on the issue, pending the outcome of the duty free deliberations which will definitely have to be before the middle of next year?  The airline business survey said that Dublin Airport was the most profitable airport in the world for passenger bases.  Will the Minister agree that such an intervention is now urgent and timely?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I am troubled by the issue, which is clearly imminent and will not go away. At the same time, I want to be fair to all airlines.

      <P>He times his arrival well.  As I said before in the House, Europe is also looking at this issue and they are reading about and having discussions on what they might regard as State aid for a particular airline.  Over the years, a series of subsidies for airlines, depending on what year they started and what new customers they got, have grown in Aer Rianta.  The study which will be received by Aer Rianta prior to Christmas should clear away much of the enveloping fog which has arisen over this issue.  I hope we will be able to come to a solution, but it would have to be an equitable one.</P>

      <P>I met both sides and I presented each other's figures to each side, because I thought there was fog surrounding this.  However, I found there was not much fog.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's statement about EU rules and other EU airports, I put it to her that other UK and European airports are offering Ryanair, and any other carrier, £1 per passenger starting rates for landing and departing charges. The discount and rebate schemes, particularly in the UK, mean that we are now uncompetitive among the 47 airports used.  Will the Minister look specifically at maintaining a moratorium on the present schemes until the duty free issue is resolved, which will be no later than June 1999? That would be a fair outcome which would not prejudice anyone's position subsequently.  If Aer Rianta are saying they need the extra revenue to make up for the loss of duty free sales, and the campaign is won, then the whole pitch is changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>The enhanced Operation Freeflow programme announced in early December includes the provision by Bus Átha Cliath of a number of additional services to cater for the anticipated demand over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>The Nitelink bus service will operate daily, except Sundays, from Monday, 7 December until Saturday, 1 January 1999.  Southbound Nitelink routes will now serve St. Stephen's Green and northbound routes will serve O'Connell Street. Departures are hourly commencing at 12.30 a.m. and ending at 3.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>Additional off-peak buses will operate at weekends to cater for shopping traffic in the city centre and at suburban locations.  Twenty additional buses will operate at morning and evening peak hours for the duration of Operation Freeflow.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath is participating in the pilot park and ride scheme for shoppers.  There are park and ride sites at Whitehall Church and RDS Simmonscourt and a dedicated bus service runs between them, operating at 10 minute frequencies. Additional capacity will be provided on Saturday and Sunday DART services between 5 and 20 December.  A special three-day rambler ticket for travel on all Dublin Bus services will be available at a cost of £5.50. A special &ldquo;DART into town-Nitelink home ticket&rdquo;, priced at £3.50, will also be available.  Twenty additional inspectors have been recruited by Dublin Bus to improve operational control, adjust services to deal with traffic conditions, reduce congestion at bus stops and control layovers.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services. To be considered for a passenger licence an operator is required to submit an official application form, a map, a timetable and various other documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks, I received an outline proposal from the Federation of Transport Operators that passenger licences be granted to its members for <Col N="630" /> a six-week period to help to relieve traffic congestion over Christmas.  This proposal was of a general nature and did not contain any concrete plans nor any individual applications for licences.</P>
    <P>I welcome the spirit in which the proposal was made.  However, it raised some complex policy issues including the possible exclusive use by private sector operators of one of the corridors normally operated by Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it will not be possible to deal with the matter in the short time before Christmas 1998.  I have asked my officials to contact the federation to discuss the general matter in the context of my Department's current review of bus licensing policy.</P>

Would it not be a novel step to totally deregulate the area between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. and allow anyone who wants to run a bus? Would the Minister agree that would be an imaginative step forward?</P>
      <P>The Minister announced that the DART was to run at night.  However it is not running at night. Has agreement been reached on that.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I note that the advertising campaign for the Nitelink service has such novel phrases as &ldquo;do you prefer to be on top&rdquo; and &ldquo;the only guaranteed ride at the end of the night is Nitelink&rdquo;.  Was the Minister consulted on that campaign?</P>

The Deputy asked would it not be an imaginative step to allow private operators to run from 12 midnight to 6 a.m. They put in a general application.  We give out about CIE all the time, but it has done much in laying on additional services.  The southbound Nitelink service from St. Stephen's Green is new. CIE also introduced several other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the DART, I made an announcement. What happened was that Deputy John Bruton, speaking on the radio, said he went to see the chief executive officer of CIE and two days later he welcomed the proposal for the DART because it was a proposal he put to the chief <Col N="631" /> executive officer.  On another day, on Marian Finucane's radio show, he said he was sorry CIE had not concluded their negotiations with the unions before making their announcement.  As of now the information is that it is not proposed that DART services will run at night beyond closing time.</P>
    <P>One of the points raised by the unions with CIE was that stations are in locations which are unsafe in that they are behind shrubbery and so on, and there have been many incidents involving DART passengers.  There is no proposal to run the DART service at night, but CIE have introduced the interesting &ldquo;DART in, bus out&rdquo; service.</P>

      <P>That is a fanciful description of the facts.  In the emergency recommendations given by the DTO it is stated that there must be substantial external operating finance provided, and that without this the entire plan will fail to achieve its goal.  Does the Minister accept this was an emergency short-term plan aimed merely at maintaining congestion at its current levels, not solving the problem, that it was clearly calculated at a cost of £14 million, and that she had already promised this matter would be considered in the context of the Estimates?  We now know this was not done and that what is being considered is a fare increase.  Does the Minister accept there is a considerable difference between a State subvention to improve a service and a fare increase for a very deficient service?</P>

      <P>I have spoken to the unions since last July about a fare increase.  This is a matter of record and the Deputy may check it with whomsoever she wishes.  Months ago I had correspondence from the chairman of CIE asking if the company could at least have a minimum fare increase in light of an eight year delay.  Therefore, this matter has not just arisen now.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I gave a list of the times when the new buses for Dublin Bus will come onstream, beginning in April and June and monthly after that.  We will examine the input of the new buses, how they will operate and what call they will make on the Exchequer through the subvention CIE gives to Dublin Bus.

      <P>I have no objection to a fare increase in the context of an efficient, flexible service which is responsive to people's needs.  A good service would not be as price sensitive and people would be willing to pay more for a comprehensive service.  Does the Minister accept that at present a fare increase is a positive disincentive to trying to achieve the aim of the current campaign, namely, to make people switch from private to public transport and that what is necessary is State subvention which has been clearly catalogued in the recommendations of the DTO? As there will be no budget before next April when the buses come onstream, from where will the money materialise?  The estimated cost of £14 million should have been provided for in the budget.  Does the Minister accept that what is necessary is a State subvention which will improve the service and allow a good service to be put in place and that when a better service is in place a price increase could be considered?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 34 of 10 November 1998 in which I stated that WaveGen Ireland, the winning applicant in the wave to energy competition, had written to me regarding the conditional offer of a power purchase contract for its proposed wave energy project.  My Department has replied to the company on the issues raised and their response is now awaited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue again as I am concerned that there is a timespan within which the company must draw down and spend the funding made available to it by the EU through the Minister's office.  Will the Minister indicate how much time is left to the company in this regard?  Will he consider phoning the company to see if the conditions he has set out are acceptable or if they might be varied and if there is any way the matter might be progressed, given that he has indicated on a number of occasions that he is supportive of developing wave energy and carrying out the necessary research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my support for wave energy and all forms of renewable energy which we all have an onus to promote.  The things the Deputy suggested have all been done.  Nobody more than Deputy Stagg knows how these competitions operate.  Indeed he was very proactive in promoting the competitions as a Minister of State.  The independent evaluator of the appropriate adjudicating body, the operational programme monitoring committee, has expressed a view that this project is more suitable to R&amp;D than the type of project before us.  This is regrettable but factual.  In other words they are saying that the technology has some catching up to do with regard to wave energy.  The Deputy will also be aware of a rather unfortunate incident in Scotland with a similar project.  Despite our insistence and desire to promote this particular type of project, we would like to see one wave energy project up and running.  This is why we have endeavoured to find a way forward in this regard.</P>
      <P>It would appear that funding is not available. In order to progress the situation the winning project by WaveGen Ireland, a Scottish registered company, was informed that funding was not forthcoming from the European Regional Development Fund but that the Minister was prepared to consider authorising a 15 year power purchase agreement with the ESB at the bid price if it proceeded with the project.  The company asked further questions which contained legal implications.  We sought legal advice and returned to the company in late November.  We are now waiting to hear further from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very worried by what the Minister has said.  This monitoring committee is another quango outside the democratic process which dictates to people elected to rule Ireland and Europe.  This is the third part of the funding for alternative energy which they have successfully scuttled.  Is the Minister and the Department sufficiently proactive in securing the original opinion of the masters of the monitoring committee, which is only a sub-committee and lower level body?  The masters of the monitoring committee originally sanctioned the proposals.  They have now scuttled the wave energy and waste to energy projects.  Funding has been withdrawn from both.  I am sure the Minister of State is doing his best but when the money is taken out of particular <Col N="635" /> alternative energy projects, it should at least go to other projects in the alternative energy area.  The Minister of State will agree there are plenty of sections in his Department who will grab that money for their projects if they are allowed.  I commend the Minister of State on getting a system in place to allow this project to go ahead and I urge him to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the frustrations expressed by the Deputy on this.  The European Commission has an important presence on that committee, and it pays the piper.  It is not prepared to pay, but we must motor on with this project. We have not given up on wave energy or on biomass.  We hope these projects will still come to fruition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that the site was proposed for an area in west Clare that is very underdeveloped and quite close to the ESB station in Moneypoint.  It would be relatively easy to link the networks.  In the absence of European funding &mdash; there was approximately £1 million involved &mdash; the project is unlikely to proceed on the scale originally proposed.  Are there alternative ways to raise funds for this project to go ahead according to the original scale?  Will the Minister ask the ESB to enter a joint venture with the company involved to put the station in place? That would give this project the opportunity to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Daly has discussed this issue with me on a number of occasions.  As the proposed site is in his constituency, it is obviously close to his heart.  A number of reports have advocated this type of energy production on the western seaboard, and experts have noted the suitability of the waves there.  I have indicated to the Deputy that is still ongoing, and I hope that WaveGen, the company concerned, will find a way to proceed.  I expect to hear from it as we responded to its latest questions on 26 November.  I hope when it evaluates our responses it will find a way to proceed.  If there is a way we can assist it, or if we can assist Deputy Daly in assisting it, we are very anxious to find it.</P>

Is it possible for a research and development project to be recognised as developing into a commercial project under the European Commission rules on which we depend for funding?

      <P>I would encourage all parties to make every effort to resolve their remaining difficulties and bring these restructuring negotiations to a successful conclusion.  This will be in the longer term interest of everyone in the company and ultimately for the benefit of the travelling public.</P>
      <P>The unofficial action on 24 November caused inconvenience and hardship to rail passengers and the general public.  It also damaged the reputation of the railway as an effective and reliable means of transport.  I would therefore strongly urge the parties to avoid any repetition of this type of action.

What assurance can she give the travelling public that there will not be a repetition of the unofficial action which caused the stoppage of trains on 24 November? What action has she taken since to ensure that industrial relations in the company are improved? In particular, has she met the chairperson of the company and restored a working relationship with him?  Has she met the unions or received a report from the Labour Relations Commission?

Following my discussions with the French Minister for Transport, Mr. Jean-Claud Gayssot on 28 September about the options available the Taoiseach wrote to the French Prime Minister, Mr. Lionel Jospin, supporting use of the series of options set out in the Capet study.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I provided letters of introduction of support to a deputation from Aer Rianta who wished to meet with Commissioner Monti on this issue and to lobby various member states in an effort to widen support for a deferral option. Arising from these letters, members of the board of Aer Rianta met with officials of the Portuguese Ministry of Finance, the Finnish Transport Ministry and the Swedish Minister for Transport and Finance.  In addition, on 28 October last, I wrote to my Danish counterpart, Mrs. Sonja Mikkelsen, following which the worker directors of Aer Rianta met with officials of the Ministry for Transport and the Ministry for Taxation on this issue.  I also wrote to my German colleague, Mr. Franz Munterfering asking him to meet Aer Rianta delegates with a view to considering arguments in favour of retaining duty free.</P>
      <P>On 19 November I met Commissioner Kinnock, as did the Taoiseach separately, and raised the issue of duty free.  I also raised the matter in the margins of the EU Transport Council on 30 November.  At ECOFIN on 1 December the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, supported a French proposal to maintain duty free. For the first time Germany supported a request for the continuation of the duty free concession, and this is a significant development.  I will continue with similar efforts.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the prospect of retaining duty free has greatly <Col N="641" /> increased, largely as a result of the change of Government in Germany and the change of position by a number of other Governments?  In that context, has she discussed with the Taoiseach the possibility of raising the matter at this weekend's summit?  Can she now express confidence that duty free facilities will be retained?</P>

      <P>As I have said publicly, the winds of change are blowing in favour of retention. When I started this 14 months ago, there was general approval in the House for what I was doing but some Members felt I was tilting at windmills and there was no hope.  I always maintained the strong belief that duty free shopping would be retained, and I did so when few agreed with me.  The change of Government in Germany has made the difference.  I understand Chancellor Schroder promised this in his election manifesto. He represents an area which is strongly connected with duty free, and all politics are local.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this with the Taoiseach and he will raise it at the Vienna summit.  I think prospects have improved.  This measure was meant to blend with overall tax harmonisation, but that has not happened, so it would be an aberration if brought in on its own.  I think Commissioner Monti's attitude is extraordinary.  He says drink is bad, and presumably perfume and other delicacies are also &mdash; we already know cigarettes are bad.  He is basing his objection on the premises of health and luxury.  It appears the elected members forming the Council of Ministers will be on one side and the Commission on the other. The sooner the Commission understands that those who are sent to represent the people in a democratic fashion want a change, the better it will be.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's efforts to retain duty free.  Does she recall whether she was a Minister on 11 December 1991, when Ireland did not send a political representative to the ECOFIN meeting?  Does she further recall that was when Fianna Fáil was trying to get rid of Mr. Haughey, and was busy at home during that time?  Does she recall that Mr. Pádraic McKernan, then ambassador, represented Ireland at that time, that Ireland was the only country not to have a political representative at the meeting, and that the ambassador was instructed by the then Government to support the decision to abolish duty free?  Does she agree, arising from that knowledge, which she must have had all along, that the flurry of activity by the Minister and her colleagues over the past two years would have been unnecessary if Fianna Fáil had sent a representative to that ECOFIN meeting and vetoed the decision, which Ireland had a right to do?  The Minister is now running around Europe, trying to reverse her party's decision and making a big issue of it, as if she were a heroine.  She should take credit for the decision to abolish duty free in the first place.</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister does not deny Deputy Stagg's central point, which is that the current Taoiseach was responsible for this dilemma.  How does the Minister see the conflict being resolved between Commissioner Monti and those member states supporting change?  Can she clarify the precise procedure?  My understanding is that the 22 member Commission must agree or assent to the reversal of this decision &mdash; is that the case?  Would a qualified majority of ECOFIN or the Council of Ministers be able to reverse the decision, or would unanimity be required?  At what point would the Minister consider it to be too late to make such a change?  Whatever about progress to date, what sequence of events is now necessary within the Commission and ECOFIN?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission does not take the decision, it requires a unanimous decision of the Council of Ministers.  The difference this month, as distinct from a few months ago, is that Germany and France are tabling the motions at ECOFIN, not our Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who tabled the motion when the issue was first passed from the Transport Council.  The steps which should now be taken include an increase in the contact between the various Finance Ministers &mdash; I will do whatever I can among the Transport Ministers and we have decided to continue lobbying.</P>
      <P>Before I arrived in the House today I received a telephone call from a person involved in the campaign to retain duty free.  I have not had time to check it out but it appears the Swedish Finance Minister has changed his mind on the matter and is willing to support the retention of duty free sales.  However, that remains to be verified.</P>

Has the Minister met officials or Ministers of the German Government to confirm that position and to give greater effect to the support of the German Government for our case to retain duty free sales?  Will the Minister outline the salient points of argument?  All Members are aware of the main points, such as the employment factor.  However, does the argument include peripherality, a matter with which the German Greens sympathise?  Will the Minister outline the <Col N="644" /> extent of the arguments which are many and varied?</P>

      <P>I met the new German Transport Minister at the last Council of Transport Ministers meeting ten days ago.  I specifically talked to him about the duty free sales issue because the previous German Transport Minister was supportive.  I do not know which party he represents.  The new Minister and I had a good discussion about the duty free sales issue.</P>
      <P>The main issues are employment and that duty free sales offers a shop front for goods in the relevant country.  It offers a show case of the best local produce.  Commissioner Monti continues to suggest that air travel is for the elite and the retention of duty free sales would pander to such people.  This is a very antiquated notion.</P>

      <P>Air fares were reduced considerably by a man who was mentioned earlier and people are now in a position to travel by air. It is no longer only posh people who travel by aeroplane.  Ordinary folk now travel by air and the abolition of duty free sales would deny them a small luxury and an enjoyable part of their journey. Duty free sales provides employment and good money.  In addition, it is a show case for local goods.  The overriding aspect is that there is no tax harmonisation of which the abolition of duty free sales was to be an integral part.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Kinnock told me he does not collect his bounty.  He makes a point of not being classed as a diplomat with regard to duty free goods.  I accept his word but I do not know whether Commissioner Monti accepts his bounty. It would be worth finding out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister was galloping around Europe, did she pause at any point to count the number of states which may now support the abolition of duty free sales?  Given the deadline on the abolition of this concept and the slow and ponderous way in which agendas for Council meetings are arranged, will she indicate at what Council meeting we can expect a decision on the retention of duty free sales?  Has she or her colleagues had any discussions with the incoming Presidency of the European Union to ensure the matter is on the agenda and will be dealt with prior to next July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House and the Minister that I support the restoration of duty free sales. <Col N="645" /> Rather than trying to secure full and permanent retention at this stage, is it possible to defer the decision beyond 1 July 1999?  Is there an indication of a level of support for such a move?  Which countries want duty free sales to be retained and which counties are opposed to it?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this is effectively another fine mess she has got us into by taking her eye off the ball at a critical time?  Is she aware the current Taoiseach who takes credit for the derogation of nine years was not the Minister at the time?  The Minister responsible was the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  He had just sacked the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and the current Taoiseach was not appointed until a few days later.  As a result, Ireland took its eye off the ball. We had no representative at the ECOFIN meeting in Europe because Mr. Haughey was at home battling for his political life with his colleagues. Consequently, duty free sales were abolished throughout Europe, although Ireland could and should have vetoed the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ignore Deputy Gilmore's comment that I was galloping around Europe, although it is probably a good description. However, the Deputy is correct about the agendas.  Talks take place and agendas are then prepared.  It takes time to get an item on to the agenda.  Germany is the incoming President of the EU and that is a fair cause for optimism.  If duty free sales are abolished, it will happen during the stewardship of Germany because it is due to end on 29 June.  This is another reason that Germany's interest has been reawakened.</P>
      <P>One must be ready well in advance to ensure items are placed on the agenda.  The summit this weekend will I hope advance the issue.  Germany and France tabled the matter at the last ECOFIN meeting and I presume other countries will continue to raise it.  However, in European terms there is a short time in which this can be done.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked which countries support or oppose the retention of duty free sales.  When I raised the matter at the Transport Ministers Council on 17 March last, 12 of the 15 countries were supportive while the other three did not say anything.  The issue was then referred to ECOFIN. The number of supporting countries at ECOFIN is now growing.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Stagg's point about deferral, there appears to be a growing belief that a decision will be deferred for five years.  However, when I read this in the newspaper or I am told about it by representatives of the duty free sales campaign, I do not know whether it is a case of &ldquo;dúirt bean liom agus dúirt bean léi&rdquo;.  It is in the realm of conjecture.  Only a short time is available but the EU will be under the stewardship of Germany.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  While there are many good aspects to the budget I will deal with one area, that of children, where there has been total neglect. The budget did little to improve the lot of children in crisis, especially those who are deprived due to family poverty.  It failed to deal with the crisis in child care.  The Government should deal with this matter urgently.  This issue was flagged as one where considerable progress would be made in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should develop a national strategy for child care and provide the necessary funding.  The budget failed to provide a reasonable level of funding to develop child care facilities. Action must be taken to provide day care facilities.  Parents combining work with family life must be supported.  Many families have no choice as most parents must work.  Even where both <Col N="647" /> spouses work they cannot afford to own their own homes.  The economy needs women at work.  One of the reasons for the success of our economy is the availability to it of the skills of women who have returned to the workforce.  That should be encouraged.  However, it creates an urgency for child care.  The Government has failed to address the issue.</P>
    <P>Proper training initiatives are required for people looking after children.  The child care crisis concerns the provision of places and the monitoring and inspection of day care places.  It is extraordinary that in this time of the Celtic tiger, Ireland has the second highest rate of child poverty in the European Union.  Investing in our children should be a key priority.  This matter has not been given priority, despite a great deal of lip service to families and children.  Services for children at risk, as well as thousands of children who need quality day care, are at crossroads.  As a proportion of average earnings in the EU, Ireland has almost the highest child care costs.  Child care costs in Ireland are 20 per cent of average earnings while in other European countries they are 8 per cent.  Parents pay a high proportion of their income on child care.</P>
    <P>A new factor in Ireland is the huge growth in participation by women in the labour force.  The female labour force is projected to grow by 218,000, an increase of 37 per cent by 2011.  This will be a dramatic increase in the workforce by married women and mothers.  It is clear the demand for child care will increase dramatically, possibly by 50 per cent.  Even now there is a crisis in child care because providers in the formal sector are not expanding, despite ever increasing demands for places.</P>
    <P>A number of problems confront this sector which need to be addressed urgently.  There are difficulties in recruiting people to work in the child care sector.  There is a shortage of places particularly for very young children and a lack of part-time care for parents, all of which is putting huge pressure on the supply of child care services.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the position in regard to monitoring and inspection procedures which come under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the 1996 regulations which deal with the provision of pre-school services?  How many premises have been inspected since the regulations came into force?  What funding is provided for inspections and monitoring?  Will he indicate what action he intends to take to help this sector deal with the severe problems it faces?</P>
    <P>It is clear high quality pre-school education can play an important role in offsetting the effects of social disadvantage and in preventing school failure. The importance of reconciling employment and family life must be recognised.  The pattern of family life has changed dramatically and the Government must recognise this and take appropriate action to deal with the changing situation. Part of supporting the family is supporting quality <Col N="648" /> child care.  The child care issue is complex and must take into account the needs of children, mothers who choose paid employment, those who remain at home, fathers and child care providers. Action is needed on all fronts.</P>
    <P>International research has shown the three most important hallmarks of quality child care in day care facilities are: accommodation and equipment; personnel qualifications and the child-adult ratio.  There is a severe danger, given the shortages and the pressure on parents to find child care, that we will fail on all fronts.</P>
    <P>A policy to promote the highest standards of quality care nationally, must be developed as a matter of urgency.  Will the Minister indicate whether it is correct that up to half of the registered pre-schools throughout the country have not been inspected by their regional health boards and that hundreds of other child care providers have failed to register their centres and are ignoring the two year old Act?  Nothing less is at stake than the physical and mental welfare of thousands of our children.</P>
    <P>Some 600,000 women are in paid employment. Of those it is estimated that 46 per cent have children under the age of four.  The demand for child care from women who have chosen to care for their children at home is also increasing.  Some 25 per cent of full-time mothers use child care facilities as they combine parenting with other responsibilities, continuing education, training and voluntary work.  Many more women working at home should have further supports, including the option of child care, to assist with their wider participation in the family and community.</P>
    <P>The Government must deliver even-handed support structures to all parents.  It must respect and value equally the work of women who provide the bulk of this essential unpaid role whether caring full-time at home or combining that role with work outside the home.  Initiatives in this area must support parental choices as between paid care and care by family members on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Child care is a complex issue and demands a complex solution.  It must be approached primarily with the needs of children at the centre but also those of the parents, those at home, in part-time, full-time or seasonal employment and those who may wish to return to education, training and employment.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a national child care plan which defines all issues and identifies where responsibility for progress lies. Financial benefits to families with children is one of the most effective ways to support families, and address child poverty. Doubling child benefit for all children under five years of age would be a simple and effective way of enhancing child income support and supporting the cost of child care.  A £3 per week increase will not address this issue; it is a mere sop.  For a considerable period, Fine Gael policy has identified the doubling of child income support as the first step in tackling this problem.  A <Col N="649" /> systematic approach to the development of appropriate child care facilities is also necessary and must occur in partnership with the services which have already been established and which have worked hard to provide quality services in a difficult economic environment.  Work must also be carried out on standards, registration, quality and training as we work to bring a sector previously considered to be on the margins of the economy into the mainstream.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we treat the sector with respect and allow it to grow and develop.  We must support good employment practices and quality service provision.  Local authorities have a particular role to play in planning service provision. All county councils should include child care provisions in their development plans.  In particular, planning provision must be available for child care facilities, which meet requirements under the Child Care Act and cater for a minimum of ten children, in residential areas .</P>
    <P>IBEC recently published an excellent document in which it was estimated that 70 per cent of employers are facing recruitment difficulties and that more than 40,000 additional child care places will be required in the next ten years if people are to be in a position to take up paid employment.  Investment in child care should allow the State to make the most of the investment made in education and training.  It will allow the State to maintain and develop skills for women, reduce labour shortages and offer women greater choice in the manner in which they participate in our economy.  At this time of unprecedented growth, investment in child care and children must be a priority.</P>
    <P>There must be a planned approach to creating a safe, high quality, accessible and affordable system of child care and pre-school provision for all parents who wish to avail of it.  The plan must be built on meeting children's needs and offering them a service which has proven long-term benefits. It must respect and support parents' choices and recognise that child care provision is an emerging economic sector which, in addition to the services it provides to children and their families, can offer good quality employment to many.</P>
    <P>In partnership with parents and the wider community, the Government has a number of vital roles to play in addressing the child care crisis and creating an effective and responsive range of services.  It has reneged on an opportunity to begin that process in this budget.  The Government must facilitate the development of child care and pre-school services and must view it as an important element of the social, educational and economic infrastructure.  It must facilitate parents to make choices concerning the care of their children and create the necessary mechanisms through which services can be financed.  It must also address the issues of child poverty and disadvantage and must seek to reduce the element of coercion which currently forces some women into or out of the workforce against their will.  The Government must set standards at <Col N="650" /> national and regional level which guide the provision and delivery of child care and pre-school services.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to address the anomalies which exist within the system, for example the pay levels for child care workers versus the cost to parents.  While we must keep children and families at the centre of child care policy, there are economic arguments which support the development of child care.  Investment in children will have a long-term benefit in breaking the cycle of child poverty and will give more children a better start on the road to education and economic independence. Quality child care provision is economically smart and socially just.</P>
    <P>Service providers are faced with providing proper salaries in order to attract and retain people with the appropriate qualifications.  They are also faced with the difficulty of finding the necessary capital to develop facilities to comply with standards. The Government should address these issues.  More women are seeking to continue working while caring for children and more women are opting to return to paid employment while their children are young.  More employment is available and will contribute to economic growth and long-term sustainability.  I am disappointed at the Government's failure to use the opportunity to address the child care issue through this budget as it said it would.</P>

      <P>There is an old adage which runs &ldquo;self praise is no praise&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance thought there might be a chance that the media would not be able to praise elements of his budget and built self praise into his speech.  He described the budget as radical and hoped the media might pick up on that line and sell the budget for him.</P>
      <P>I do not deny there were welcome elements in the budget.  The income tax system will be fairer. Some of the money allocated is bound to do some good in a number of sectors.  However, some of the increases heralded from the rooftops as being radical improvements do not seem quite so radical on closer examination.</P>
      <P>The budget was a lost opportunity.  This country has an additional £1 billion in revenue this year.  Week after week, we hear of increased revenue from income tax, VAT and so on.  When one analyses this budget it is obvious there will not be any significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty.  There will not be any significant change in housing and hospital waiting lists. Adult and child illiteracy will remain untackled to any great degree and rural poverty will grow with the result that more people will be driven into cities and towns, further pressuring urban infrastructure.  If I were a member of Government, I would not sing the praises of the budget so highly.</P>

    <P>I urge the thousands of Fruit of the Loom workers who were so devastated yesterday at the closure announcement to put pressure on the Government to ensure the task force which has <Col N="651" /> been set up will deliver the required retraining and jobs.  County Donegal is essentially represented by five Government TDs and one Opposition TD.  The five Government TDs will not rock the boat or pressurise the Government.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Fruit of the Loom workers at a time when they could have hoped for some extra money to provide extra pleasure for their families at Christmas.  They now face a short working week and closure this Friday. A total of 770 people will lose their jobs by the end of January.  By the end of 1999 only 600 will remain and that will be the position until 2005.  The Minister has had this information for some time but failed to tell the workers what she knew.  It was apparent when I visited the plant that they wanted to know what was going to happen as quickly as possible so that they could seek alternative employment or retraining.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not been sure-footed.  She had an uncivilised public row with Mr. Bill Farley on whom the workers depended for their jobs.  They deserved better.  I urge her to adopt a more hands-on approach and provide the necessary resources for the task force.</P>
      <P>In the past month it has been announced that the Krups plant in Limerick, Betatherm in Ballinrobe and Tarkett in County Westmeath are to close.  More than 100 jobs will be lost at Southborough in Kells.  I heard yesterday that another textile firm based at the former Farah slacks plant in County Mayo is to close.  While the Government is claiming credit that the economy is thriving, it should not be forgotten that in the run-up to Christmas many are suffering, having lost their jobs.  Negotiating a redundancy package is not a pleasant task.</P>
      <P>The budget fails to tackle in a radical way the problem of the skills shortage.  To meet demand provision should be made for in-house training. While hundreds of millions of pounds are available to FÁS, only £8 million is available to employers this year.  Additional funds have been sought by the Small Firms Association, ISME and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland which dealt with this matter in a recent document.</P>
      <P>In the technology area an additional 8,300 professionals and technicians will be required each year from 1997 to 2003.  The estimated number of graduates, returned emigrants, immigrants and upskilled employees is 6,100.  This needs to be supplemented by 900 professionals and 1,300 technicians according to the expert group on future skills needs.</P>
      <P>We will not attract new industries if we are not in a position to provide the necessary staff.  Thirty years ago the need for good education standards was recognised by Donogh O'Malley and others. If this problem is not tackled, hotels and restaurants will be forced to close down.</P>

      <Col N="652" /> On community employment schemes, the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended the removal of certain categories, including public bodies.  There are 3,457 such schemes in operation in schools under which secretarial assistance and caretakers are provided, 2,826 in local authorities and 831 in other public bodies.  I have received a letter from a school in my constituency which is situated on the N1 in connection with its caretaker who is 59 years of age and has performed many tasks, including helping the children to cross the road.  He has given the principal his first computer lesson and assembled all the new computer equipment following the introduction of the IT2000 programme.  He has trained the football and the Olympic handball team.  He has fitted shelving and renovated a prefabricated building to provide a remedial teaching room, a library and a medical examination room.  It is his intention to renovate the school desks.  He is involved in every aspect of school life with management, teachers and pupils.  If the community employment scheme is not extended beyond the three year period specified, this school will suffer enormously.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children had a great opportunity to show that inside his blustering exterior lies a heart, but he did not fight his corner at the Cabinet table.  An additional £8 million, £4 million less than the amount allocated last year, is to be made available to reduce the number on hospital waiting lists which currently stands at 35,000.  The Minister did not, however, refer to the number awaiting appointments with specialists.  He kept the report secret.</P>
    <P>I have received a letter from a constituent in connection with his wife who has cancer and sought a CT scan.  Because of the long delay she eventually decided to go private.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>My wife was able to get an earlier CT scan when we made the decision to go private and pay the shortfall that our VHI did not meet. My wife had the CT scan in mid-October and it turned out that the cancer had spread to the liver.  I am only telling you this in an effort to highlight the fact that (1) my wife has now been able to get treatment earlier because she can afford to &mdash; she will have her third chemo session this week &mdash; and (2) it begs the question how many other people may be reaching stages of irreversible illness because of hospital queues.</P>
    <P>Women have to wait between three and six months for a mammogram.  One cannot wait that long to learn whether a lump is cancerous.</P>
    <P>A young man who graduated recently and requires dental treatment for which his parents cannot afford to pay has been on the waiting list for one year.  He was offered a day appointment. On the day in question he was informed by the hospital by telephone &mdash; the call was taken by his eight year old sister &mdash; not to turn up and that it could not give him another appointment even though he is in constant pain.  He cannot sell himself <Col N="653" /> well at interviews as a consequence.  This is affecting his confidence.  The Government needs to put flesh and blood on the statistics they announce so that when it deliberates on spending it directs money to those most in need.  It did not do this in the budget to the extent possible.  The budget is not radical.  It is a lost opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Fox, Ó Caoláin and Donal Moynihan. This budget is the second of five.  It is focused and balanced.  For the elderly and those on low incomes there are extra supports.  Never before has there been such radical action on taxation. PAYE workers are now in a position to earn up to £100 and remain outside the tax net.  The major items sometimes eclipse the many other smaller points that equally help ensure that we are better off after this second Fianna Fáil budget.  It will take time to assimilate it.</P>
      <P>By its nature, a budget is wholeheartedly welcomed by some, generally welcomed by many and not well received by others.  Of all budgets this, the second of a series of five, has pleased a very large section of the community in its balance and its focus on some of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>It was the elderly who helped create today's Ireland.  In their older age they deserve recognition and received it not only in the increase of £6 in their pensions but also in respect of many small measures, such as the move to double the medical card income guidelines, which will bring so many more of our senior citizens within the safety net of the medical card system, and the increase in guidelines for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>The carers scheme has been expanded so that more people will be eligible to participate.  Carers in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and carers of all those who need full-time care and attention between the ages of 16 and 65 years are now to be included.  Also welcome is the free telephone rental allowance for all qualified carers.</P>
      <P>The £200 allowance provided for respite care is one of the most significant first steps announced in the budget.  Respite care is a vital issue, not only for the carer but also for the cared for.</P>
      <P>As a Border Deputy I received many representations, both last year and this, in relation to an important source of employment &mdash; the filling stations.  Petrol prices have not increased in either of the two budgets introduced by the Minister. This has had very positive consequences for those industries along the Border in helping them maintain a favourable differential.  Usually one of the ways in which positive aspects of budgets were balanced was through taxing the motorist, but not this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job creation measures and incentives to return to work are key issues in my area.  The budget takes 80,000 out of the tax net.  It is an initiative that will encourage people into work.  It is very important I put on the record my sincere sympathy for those workers from Buncrana, <Col N="654" /> Malin, Milford, Raphoe and surrounding areas who, until today, were gainfully employed in Fruit of the Loom.  Other jobs are vulnerable in Lifford.  These people put many years of their lives into building the reputation of this company and would like to benefit from the improved tax reliefs introduced by the Minister.  Unfortunately, for them a bleak Christmas lies ahead.  We do not want to see them added in the long-term to the already extremely high unemployment figures in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The £3 increase in social welfare assistance is welcome, but replacement industries and increased supports for local enterprises are what my constituents want.  The energetic, enthusiastic and loyal approach they bring to their employment is what they are used to and what they wish to return to in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen has commented on the public representatives in the area.  Representatives in the locality have all worked actively to secure a positive resolution of the crisis.  We are not sitting on the sidelines.  I welcome the various improvement to the FÁS placement service, the jobs initiative places, the bridging programme for the long-term unemployed and the £13.5 million in improvements to the self-employed pensions provisions. Those seeking employment deserve every assistance in terms of skill analysis, re-training and placement.  That has already begun in terms of the existing task force and it is ready to immediately help at skills, retraining and replacement. The immediate needs of almost 1,000 people in north Donegal must be a priority within such supports, which have been improved by Minister McCreevy in the budget.</P>
    <P>In an area where farming and fishing are the only alternatives for employment, I welcome the focus in the budget on the low income farmer.  On examining the details of the £15 million scheme, the farming community, especially the smaller farmer, will appreciate the benefits of the move away from the £1 for £1 assessment The new scheme, importantly, will not be confined to people whose only income is from farming but will enable the farmer, within a means test, to have an income from other activities.  The projection that double the number currently on the smallholders' scheme will qualify for the new scheme and that most of those in the existing scheme should be entitled to increased payments suggests that the goal of assisting those most in need in what has been a difficult year will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate the work being done by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, for the fishing industry.  It is a major source of employment in a region with so many difficulties.  Over the past year he was able to support projects on pier repairs in Greencastle, Moville and Malin and he addressed the age profile of the whitefish fleet, which was becoming historical.  The budget shows continued support for developing facilities at small harbours and landing places.  Given that the island has such <Col N="655" /> potential for marine development, this is an especially significant aspect of the budget.  I would like to see increased recognition of this from the Minister for Finance.  Indeed, there issues beyond the facilities available to fishermen which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Throughout the year and again in the budget money is targeted within the Department of Education to help those most in need.  I commend the work of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in his approach to his portfolio and acknowledge that, like the Minister for Finance, he is also working to a five year plan that will see continued improvements across the board in education.  His recent announcement of more books for school libraries is reflected in the budget measures which give tax reliefs on donations to public libraries.</P>
    <P>The need to develop the love of reading is linked to having facilities available.  I acknowledge the good news within my constituency of the advancement of the library project in Buncrana to construction stage.  I trust the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will ensure that the fire station will also proceed to construction in the next few months.</P>

      <P>Many areas have been addressed in the budget, but many remain to be addressed. The difficulties in the farming sector are among those which achieved the highest profile during the year.  I am happy that the smallholders' allowance is to be revamped with an income disregard which will benefit families especially.  This will be a welcome step for small farming families who are worst hit by the income crisis, which has prevailed in every sector of the farming industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reintroduction of the control of farm pollution grant, dairy hygiene and installation aid grant for young farmers is long overdue and to be welcomed.  These schemes have been suspended for far too long.  It is very important that <Col N="656" /> no further time be lost before they are put into place to benefit farmers who wish to improve their farms and young farmers who will be involved in legal costs associated with transferring farms.</P>
    <P>Depopulation is more than a word bandied about from time to time.  It is a real concept in rural areas and small towns and in some of the villages I represent.  Every effort must be made by the Government to support smaller schools, post offices and Garda stations.  Simple measurers like maintaining railway stations and keeping them open can make a huge difference to encouraging young people to reside locally instead of moving to Dublin and other cities where they work and study.  The two stations at Glenealy and Avoca in my constituency are examples.  I am sure there are many more throughout the country. These stations have been closed because of the neglect of platforms.  It would cost less to keep them open than what is being spent on pollution reduction measures and traffic gridlock.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that Bray Garda station is to benefit under the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That station is inadequate, but that problem is being addressed with the allocation of money provided to upgrade it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge and welcome the budgetary measures in respect of the carer's allowance scheme.  The extension of the free telephone rental allowance to all recipients will be of great benefit.  The extension of that scheme to the carers of children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance is also welcome.  I welcome the measures to modify the requirement that carers should live in the same house as those for whom they care, which acknowledges that it is unrealistic that they should be expected to provide care 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed more was not provided in the budget to address the problem of child care, particularly in regard to tax relief.  A report is being drawn up on this area and recommendations will be made to the Minister.  I urge him to ensure those recommendations are implemented without any unnecessary delay.  I am sure all Members will keep a watchful eye on proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>The removal of low income earners from the tax net is one of the main moves to be welcomed in the budget.  The increase in the tax bands by £4,000 and in the personal allowance of £1,050 for single people will make a difference.  A single person will no longer have to pay tax on earnings under £100 per week.  That means that 80,000 PAYE workers on low pay will be removed from the tax net.  As a young person, I welcome that move.  It will encourage young apprentices and those who have only begun to work to continue working.</P>
    <P>I welcome the substantial increase in the old age pension.  The increase of £6 per week in the full personal rate and £3 per week for a qualified adult is welcome.  Although the much talked <Col N="657" /> about target of £100 has not been reached, these increases are a significant step in that direction.  I hope the Government will deliver on meeting that target during its lifetime.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the additional money provided for education services and that special education needs and the needs of the disadvantaged were highlighted.  I am pleased there will be a focus on the provision of a remedial service which will ensure that children who may have learning disabilities at a young age will not be discriminated against from day one, but will be given an equal opportunity, which they deserve.</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last week suggested that the children's allowance should be paid to parents who have children living at home up to the age of 30.  I am sure many laughed at that suggestion.  I am not suggesting it should be taken seriously, but the article made a good deal of sense when one considers there are many people of my age &mdash; I am 27 and still living at home &mdash; who are still living at home because they cannot afford to buy their own homes.  How many young couples can afford to pay the prices demanded for houses in Wicklow?  The minimum price for an average house is £140,000.  Furthermore, one cannot get planning permission for a house in Wicklow unless one has three or four generations of ancestors in the local graveyard.</P>
    <P>A serviced land initiative provided by Wicklow County Council sought to provide sites to young couples to give them a chance to build houses in their local areas.  The scheme was a major success, but it is only a drop in the ocean when it comes to addressing the problem in this area.  Housing and subsidised sites will have to be given top priority in the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Browne said about the provision for VRT.  The Minister made a mistake in his approach to it.  I ask him to revisit that proposal in the Finance Bill.  To do that, he will have to change the implementation date of 1 January for the increase in VRT.  Deals have been struck and cars ordered and that implementation date has put car dealers throughout the country in an awkward position of having to impose a £600 increase in some cases and an average of £3,000 on two litre cars.  According to the SIMI, deals have been cancelled, even though cars have been ordered.  Unless this issue is revisited we will see far too many secondhand imports on our roads. They will bring very little revenue into the Government's purse and such secondhand imports will cause as much pollution as that which we are trying to reduce.</P>
    <P>I concede the budget was a good step forward for the country.  It is important to ensure no one group is left behind and that we all move forward together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's budget clearly reflects the criticism of what was done last year.  The Minister said it is all part of a five-year plan with the outline of each year's budget <Col N="658" /> already mapped out until the end of this Government's term of office.  I admire his optimism.  The political reality is very different.  The Government had to respond to the widespread dissatisfaction with its last budget.  In doing so, it had to acknowledge, as the Minister did in his speech, that everyone is not benefiting equally.  It was then obliged to address the growing inequalities in our society.  To the extent that it has done so, I commend it, and I have no hesitation in welcoming the positive aspects of the 1999 budget while pointing out its many shortfalls.</P>
      <P>Twenty years ago people throughout this State took to the streets in protest at the gross inequality of the taxation system in which PAYE workers bore a massively unfair burden.  Through all the years since those massive tax marches of 1979 the call for a fairer taxation system has been made but has gone unheeded by successive Governments.  However, this year's budget takes some significant steps towards a fairer tax system and that is welcome.  It vindicates the efforts of people over many years to inject more fairness into the taxation system.</P>
      <P>The removal of workers earning £100 per week or less from the tax system is a very welcome and long overdue measure.  The other tax changes favouring the lower paid are also positive.  We must ask what it says about the nature of our Celtic tiger economy when we hear that 80,000 workers are earning &mdash; and up to last week were being taxed on &mdash; a paltry wage of £79 to £100 per week.  Much is made of the incentive to work which these tax changes are supposed to bring, but there is as little incentive to work for £100 per week untaxed as there is when tax is deducted.</P>
      <P>Here we encounter one of the major shortfalls of this Government's tax and employment strategy and a huge gap in the budget.  That is the whole issue of a minimum wage.  Given the widespread democratic consensus in favour of this progressive and long overdue measure, the tardiness of the Government approach is totally unacceptable.  Why do people have to wait until April 2000 at the earliest before they see a minimum wage enshrined in legislation and who knows how long, if ever after that, before a minimum wage is implemented, with workers having the benefit in their weekly pay packets?</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the reduction in corporation tax in last year's budget will cost £102 million in 1999.  The corporate sector is set to benefit to the tune of at least £227 million every year in the next couple of years and this will rise dramatically as the corporation tax is reduced to the Government's 12.5 per cent target.  Instead of giving bonuses to the corporate sector, the Minister should have retained the tax and used it to press needs of our health and education systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disappointing part of this budget was undoubtedly the deplorably low level of social welfare increases.  The increases barely keep pace with the rate of inflation.  They lag behind the growth in the average industrial wage.  The Minister has thus continued the trend which has seen <Col N="659" /> a 22 per cent growth in average income over the past four years compared to only a 16 per cent increase in social welfare payments in the same period.</P>
    <P>Given the resources available to the Minister the £3 per week increase is not only insubstantial but will serve to widen the poverty gap.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, described this budget as a radical one.  A truly radical departure would and could have been made by linking social welfare rates to the growth in the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>It is a very sobering thought to realise that 30 per cent of our population have social welfare as their only source of income.  Yet despite some welcome provisions this budget largely failed to benefit them.  Once again other sectors moved ahead and left a widening gap between the welfare dependent and the rest.</P>
    <P>In the face of a housing crisis the measures announced are totally inadequate.  Only 4,500 housing starts in 1999 throughout the 26 Counties will leave tens of thousands on the housing waiting lists.  A comprehensive public housing programme with greatly increased funding is needed to address this crisis.  In the months ahead this will perhaps be seen as the greatest failure of this budget as the assessment of housing need, which is due to be published next spring, will certainly show an unprecedented growth in the need for accommodation, only a tiny fraction of which is being met.</P>
    <P>The relief for low income farmers which was included in the budget is welcome, so far as it goes.  However, the depth and breadth of the farming crisis has not been recognised.  I highlight in particular the now very acute fodder crisis.  I had the opportunity last week in north Monaghan, in conjunction with Monaghan IFA, to witness at first hand the state of the situation on the ground.  The recently announced fodder scheme of the Minister for Agriculture and Food is far too narrow in its remit, with entire counties where farmers are going to the wall being excluded.  I call on the Government to take urgent action to widen the remit of the scheme and to increase the supports available.</P>
    <P>Today is the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In concluding my contribution I want to cite some of the neglected social and economic clauses.</P>

      <P>In deference to that I will conclude with this comment.  Those clauses include, under Article 23, &ldquo;the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.the right to equal pay for equal work.the right to just and favourable remuneration. <Col N="660" /> .supplemented if necessary by other social means.&rdquo;. Under Article 24 &ldquo;the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing&rdquo; and the right to education under Article 26 are asserted.</P>
      <P>Despite much progress the State has yet to live up to its obligations as so clearly and idealistically set out and adopted by the United Nations in 1948.  The budget for 1999, despite its positive aspects, confirms that underlying reality and challenges those of us who seek real and lasting social and economic social change on this island.  We will meet that challenge.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for delivering a budget which has targeted the old and the less well-off, given encouragement to job creation and provided almost £600 million in tax relief.  The decision to allow the first £100 earned to be free of tax will be widely welcomed and will be of particular benefit to young people entering the workforce for the first time, the lower paid and part-time workers.</P>
      <P>The major tax reform is very welcome, as is the increase in old age pensions and the easing of the means test for qualification for medical cards for old people, especially those of 70 years.  Also welcome are special arrangements for the self-employed who started paying into the PRSI scheme in 1988.  This measure confirms the commitment of this Government to the aged and the sick in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the low prices many farmers receive for produce from the processors and the fact that these low prices are not passed onto the consumer.  Consequently, foreign companies have seen a niche in the market and are exporting their produce to us.  Shoppers are choosing with their purses and opting for the cheaper produce which is often the imported item.  Last year we imported 15,000 tonnes of beef at a cost of £25 million, 30,000 tonnes of pork at a cost of £56 million and 25,000 tonnes of poultry <Col N="661" /> at a cost of £60 million.  If this money was spent on Irish produce, Irish farmers would not be experiencing the present difficulties.  We could compete with foreign produce and prices if the processors would reduce the price to the consumer in line with the reduced price the farmers are getting for their produce.  I ask the farming representatives on the boards of management of the processing plants to ensure a reduction in the price for the consumer.  The Irish consumer knows that our own produce far exceeds foreign produce in quality.  We must increase the promotion of Irish food.  I ask An Bord Bia to take steps to clearly indicate the origin of all food and let the public make an informed choice.</P>
    <P>The budget should be commended to the House.  It is a budget which is aimed at the less well-off, the sick and the elderly and which has also promoted job creation.</P>

      <P>The announcement by Fruit of the Loom was far worse than anticipated.  It was generally expected that 800 workers would be made redundant.  However, it now appears that the remaining 1,300 jobs can only be guaranteed until the end of next year.  As few as 600 of the present workforce of 2,300 can be guaranteed until the end of 2005.  Yesterday's announcement was shattering news for the employees of Fruit of the Loom and it has dealt a particularly severe blow to the economic fabric of three towns in Donegal &mdash; Malin, Milford and Raphoe.  These three small towns will be left with virtually no industrial employment within the next few months.</P>
      <P>While our first concern must be with the workers who have been made redundant and their families, we should also realise that ancillary services will suffer from the effects of the redundancies. We cannot overlook the scale of the tragedy.  Workers with family and mortgage responsibilities will be left without adequate income and resources to meet their financial commitments, be those a house mortgage, car loan or family education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's handling of the situation leaves a great deal to be desired.  Loyal and dedicated employees were left at the mercy of rumours predicting impending gloom since last summer.  It has been an over-long death watch.  It is our duty to hold out some hope for the future.  We must build on what is left to provide a future livelihood to <Col N="662" /> those who have lost out as a result of yesterday's decision.  It is essential to retain hope and not sink into despair.  We must learn the lesson from similar disasters in other parts of the State.</P>
    <P>One that springs to mind is the loss of 800 jobs at the Digital plant in Galway in 1993.  The Mayor of Galway at the time, Deputy McCormack, succeeded in establishing a task force.  Within six months Boston Scientific arrived in Galway and took over the premises and today more than 1,600 people are employed there.  What could be done in Galway in 1993 can, with commitment and dedication, be achieved in Donegal in 1999. We cannot afford to be overly dependent on the labour intensive clothing industry where we can be subject to fierce competition from Third World cheap labour economies.  Instead, we must attract modern high tech industries with a longer life expectancy.  We already have thousands of young, skilled and educated people in Donegal with the necessary qualifications to take up such positions.</P>
    <P>Three initiatives must be taken immediately. First, there must be a comprehensive retraining programme for those who have lost their jobs and require new skills.  It should be established immediately.  Second, there must be a generous severance and redundancy agreement for those who have been made redundant.  Their loyalty and dedication to the company deserves nothing less.  Third, Donegal must be a top priority area for the establishment of new industries and the provision of alternative employment.  The employment initiative task force already established, must be afforded every possible support to attract new industry to the area.  Local companies and enterprise must also be generously supported.  Only by adopting such a policy can we attempt to undo the massive damage inflicted on the county by yesterday's announcement.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for sharing his time with me.  I express my sympathy to the workers and their families on yesterday's announcement of the closure of the plants in Malin, Raphoe and Milford and the loss of more than 100 jobs in Buncrana.  I also extend my sympathy to the people in Lifford who have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>This is a black week for north Donegal and for many this will be one of the bleakest Christmases ever.  While there is no good time for bad news, laying off people so close to Christmas has been a terribly cruel blow, with which it will take some time to come to full terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all those involved, the priority now must be to focus on the challenge that lies ahead.  The workforce is second to none and has the ability to adapt.  Every resource must be made available to ensure a skills analysis can be carried out and appropriate training programmes set up immediately. That the Donegal initiative, under the leadership of Michael McLoone is already in place will help to enable positive action to commence straight away.  We have seen examples <Col N="663" /> around the country of where task forces were able to get very positive results quite quickly.</P>
    <P>Many issues will exercise the minds of the workforce, such as mortgages and redundancy payments.  Given the loyal service which Fruit of the Loom has got over the years from people who joined the company straight from school and stayed with it, building up its reputation, it is only just that this is reflected in the settlements reached.  I have expressed my commitment to do all I can, and I know this is the feeling of all the public representatives in the locality.  I ask that pressure will continue to be brought to bear on all State, Government and local commercial agencies to ensure that every effort is made to deal with the immediate needs and to replace all job losses, both by outside investors and the expansion of existing local enterprises.  I trust that in the very near future issues such as access to the north-west will receive a major boost.  Support, such as that given by the Minister of State and the Tánaiste, are very helpful and I ask for their continued commitment to all the areas which have lost jobs.  I look forward to a more positive 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement yesterday that there will be almost 800 jobs lost in the Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal is a grave blow to the workers, their families and their communities.  I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government, to express our disappointment at the announcement, coming as it does so close to Christmas, and to stress that everything possible will be done to find replacement jobs and industries for the communities affected.</P>
      <P>Recent months have been a very difficult time for the workers in Fruit of the Loom.  While the company's announcement yesterday provides no comfort for those who will lose their jobs over the coming months, it has at last dispelled the widespread air of uncertainty about the future of the company's entire operations in Donegal and now enables everyone concerned to focus more clearly on the challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern has been at all times to ensure that the maximum number of jobs were retained.  The agreement between the IDA and the company means that 1,300 jobs will now be retained at the Buncrana plant until the end of 1999.  The additional commitment by the company to retain 600 of these jobs which are connected with fabric production at least until the year 2006 reflects the higher level of capital intensity associated with these activities.  The other 700 remaining jobs are in less capital intensive areas and are, therefore, more vulnerable to international market forces.  The Tánaiste and the IDA will work with the company and the trade unions to secure the future of these jobs beyond the beginning of 2000 but this will depend very much on international competitive pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> There has been some misleading comment about the agreement between the company and the IDA as it relates to grant repayments.  The IDA agreement has ensured that the maximum number of jobs are protected and that the company will meet all its outstanding grant liabilities through the job commitments given in this agreement.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, refute reports that IDA Ireland had dropped demands for repayment of a £5 million liability in a deal to save the jobs at Fruit of the Loom.  There has been no such cancellation.</P>
    <P>Fruit of the Loom will repay £5 million to IDA Ireland in January 1999.  In relation to the remaining £2 million immediate liabilities, the proceeds from the sale by Fruit of the Loom of the three factories at Malin, Raphoe and Milford will come to the IDA.  The remaining outstanding liabilities will continue to be carried by Fruit of the Loom on the basis that they will meet the separate job commitments given in respect of the levels of employment set until 1999 and 2006, respectively.</P>
    <P>Others in the House appear to have adopted the contrary stance of arguing that the Tánaiste should not have insisted upon the company meeting its obligations to its workers and to the State, notwithstanding the grants paid to them for employment creation.  These criticisms were rejected last night by SIPTU, which emphasised that the Tánaiste was right to adopt a tough stance with the company and to insist on maximising the numbers retained in employment.</P>
    <P>On 16 September 1998, the Tánaiste established the Donegal employment initiative to offset and compensate for the expected job losses in Fruit of the Loom.  The initiative, which is chaired by the Donegal County Manager, Mr. Michael McLoone, includes representatives from the business community, relevant State agencies and Departments.  This is the first intensive effort to put Donegal on the industrial map.  The initiative has already received a wide range of submissions from business, community groups and individuals throughout the county.  It has met on three occasions to date and has agreed a programme of work to ensure that urgent action is taken to complete the tasks it has been assigned.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the job losses in Fruit of the Loom, IDA Ireland over recent months intensified its promotional programme of County Donegal, in close association with the Donegal employment initiative.  The certainty of the closure of the plants at Malin, Milford and Raphoe means the buildings can be marketed aggressively by the IDA and other agencies.  That Fruit of the Loom has agreed to maintain the three buildings to a high quality standard and make them available at attractive terms to potential new industrial investors will be of enormous help in attracting new industry.  A number of companies have already indicated preliminary interest in some of the Fruit of the Loom facilities.</P>
    <P>While it is too early at this stage to predict an <Col N="665" /> outcome, I hope that replacement industry will be secured.  The Tánaiste has directed IDA Ireland to do everything possible in all its markets to secure new employment opportunities for the region.  Both the Tánaiste and I, along with the IDA, have visited many companies in the United States in the past year.  We are confident there will be a positive outcome to our collective efforts for Ireland in general, and Donegal in particular.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy, and all the people likely to be affected by the job losses, that the Government regards the attraction of replacement industry to County Donegal as a top priority.  I thank all the Deputies from Donegal, including the Minister, Deputy McDaid, for their very positive support and unity of purpose.  This is a very difficult time for the people of Donegal, the workers in Fruit of the Loom and the families who have been so drastically affected just before Christmas. I assure them that, with our collective efforts, it is hoped we can address this problem in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter of the need for wheelchair accessible buses yesterday at the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and last night during Private Members' time in the House.  I am glad to have the opportunity to do so again tonight.  It is an appalling indictment of the record of this Government in regard to people with disabilities that the need to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles in the context of new investment in public transport should have to be raised here.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the protest being made at Heuston Station by John Doyle, who is the chairperson of the Bray branch of the Wicklow Wheelchair Association and who is active in the network of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities and Centres for Independent Living.  He is also a member of the Eastern Health Board. Mr. Doyle is an informed and consistent voice in the area of disability.  It is a disgrace that he must mount such a vigil at Heuston Station to have his voice heard.  For my own part, I can but salute his courage, tenacity and leadership.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister cannot but be aware that the expenditure on inaccessible double-decker buses, to which she has committed herself, directly conflicts with Government policy as stated in the Strategy for Equality, the excellent report of the Commission on People with Disabilities chaired by Mr. Justice Flood.  What has happened to the Government's commitment, arising from the work of that commission, to mainstream services for people with a disability? If the Minister with responsibility for transport is willing to set aside the principle of mainstreaming, as this decision indicates, what are the wider implications for initiatives such as the Human Rights Commission Bill and the Equal Status Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Was the Government merely wasting the time, energy and patience of people with a disability in engaging in a consultation process if a contemptuously discriminatory decision such as this is allowed to proceed?  Is the Minister aware of the Government commitment to disability-proof all programmes and expenditure to ensure that the needs and rights of disabled people are met within the general population as opposed to the historic default policy of ghettoising disabled people?  Is the Minister leading her Department and the public transport providers back onto an undistinguished path in associating her name and her reputation with this ignorant and most hurtful decision?</P>
    <P>The collective failure of the entire Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Cabinet in respect of this decision and in respect of the very significant expenditure involved is a blatant disregard of the stated commitment to mainstream service for people with disabilities.  The failure to provide a public transport infrastructure that is accessible to disabled people ensures the exclusion of that group of people within society from opportunities in the areas of employment and education as well as in regard to simple social and family outings and opportunities to exercise a meaningful independence.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is aware that such restrictions follow on as an inevitable consequence of this decision.  The budget of 1999, as announced here last week, included a scheme to encourage disabled people to take up employment opportunities. It provided a weekly payment equivalent to a single return taxi fare.  This decision on segregated buses for the able-bodied shows how pathetic that budget provision actually was and demonstrates that it was little more than a figleaf offered by a Government which has shown a monumental failure to understand the realities of the experience of people with a disability.  The European Union is a party to the decision that £8.5 million will be spent on the offending buses in a redistribution of funds originally intended for investment in Luas.</P>
    <P>The European Commission itself is committed to ensuring that Structural Funds should not be used for programmes or practices that exclude any group in a member state availing of the fund. Ultimately, that is where this decision may yet come undone and I urge the Minister to reconsider it in the light of people with a disability, who could be any of us here who may break a leg or have some other misfortune as well as, for example, people who are confined to a wheelchair for life.  I hope that will lead the Minister to review that decision and that efforts to deal with the tragedy of the traffic congestion which besets us all will not once again discriminate against the most disadvantaged in our society.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for his very fine contribution to this debate, for taking this issue to the floor of the House and for his question <Col N="667" /> today which was not reached but to which he would have got an answer.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date.  It is also my policy that all transport operators, private and public, should, as far as possible, make their services and facilities accessible to people with a disability.  Dublin Bus currently has 11 low-floor buses in service.  As part of its 1999 fleet replacement programme, the company plans to purchase a further 19 fully accessible 33-seater midi buses.  Dublin Bus expects to take delivery of the 19 vehicles during 1999.  It is not enough but it is a distinct mark of what Dublin Bus plans to do.</P>
      <P>Subject to CIE board approval, Dublin Bus also plans to begin a pilot-test programme in March for accessible double-decker buses.  Low-floor double-deck buses have been operating in London for the past three months and Dublin Bus states that it hopes to obtain three such models from different suppliers for pilot testing over a six-month period.  Up to three months ago there was not in production a double-decker bus with low-floor accessibility for disabled people.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann currently operates a low-floor bus on the Bishopstown route in Cork and a further ten vehicles destined for Cork and Limerick are due for delivery in 1999.  Therefore, the ignorance of which the Deputy spoke is not evidenced in CIE's activities.</P>
      <P>On the railway, it has been possible to achieve a high degree of accessibility of trains and stations to customers with a disability, including those who use wheelchairs.  It is now a firmly established policy of Iarnód Éireann that all new trains and stations, together with major refurbishment projects at existing stations, should take account of the needs of mobility-impaired customers. Almost all of the approximately 90 mainline stations are accessible by wheelchair users and all of the newer rail passenger carriages, including the DART, are accessible.  All DART trains, of course, are already accessible.  Recent practical examples of Iarnód Éireann's policy includes the new enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and the upgraded station at Kilkenny.  In addition, the new DART stations at Drumcondra and Clontarf Road and the upgraded Dún Laoghaire station are all fully accessible.  Iarnód Éireann has also published an accessibility guide for passengers detailing the accessibility features available to disabled users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The buses acquired by the two CIE bus companies in recent years have many features which make them more responsible to the requirements of people with a disability.  The Dublin Bus wheelchair accessible service provides accessible transport to local facilities provided by organisations such as Rehab, Cerebral Palsy Ireland and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland as well as to UCD in Belfield.  The company also operates a wheelchair accessible Omni-link service on the <Col N="668" /> north side of Dublin which has proved very popular with passengers.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus is committed to increasing its quota of accessible vehicles as evidenced by the company's recent announcement that it plans to purchase a further 19 fully accessible 33-seater midi buses.  Such low-floor buses are already operating in other European cities.  We hope to get those in 1999.</P>
    <P>All three CIE companies have established user groups involving representatives of people with a disability to advise on the inclusion and improvement of facilities for the disabled.  The user groups meet regularly and have visited various locations to inspect facilities and potential new equipment.  CIE recognises their input into the formation of their policy.</P>
    <P>The new low-floor double-decker buses are not currently available anywhere.  They have only just been built.  Models which may be suitable have been brought into service in London in the past three months.  They are manufactured by the Dutch company DAF, and Dublin Bus states that it hopes to obtain one of these models from DAF, one from Volvo and one from Dennis early in the new year for pilot testing over a six-month period. Dublin Bus has agreed to test these prototype buses here and if they are suitable it will get more of them in the context of its ongoing fleet replacement programme.  Dublin Bus has already given a commitment that all single-deck buses due for renewal will be replaced by low-floor equivalents.  The company will continue to adopt that policy.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that CIE, in all of its companies, has a very definite policy of accessibility and has proved it by those actions.  We would all wish that every bus in Ireland were accessible in the morning, but it is not physically possible to obtain suitable buses.  The company is moving along a very progressive route, and I have urged it to continue to do so.  We are not talking just about people with a disability, we are talking about mothers or fathers with young children and buggy cars.  We are talking about old people who cannot step up on high steps and people who have some disability caused by age or accident. It is not just wheelchair-bound people who are affected.  Many other people are also affected.  I will continue to closely monitor those developments. We have sent it to the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this matter.  St. Raphael's in Celbridge cares for people with learning disabilities. Its core values are respect, excellence, hospitality, compassion and justice.  It cares for 312 people, varying in ages from birth to retirement. The disabilities of these people vary from profound to moderate.  I compliment the staff and the voluntary helpers who care for these, the most deserving of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sufficient resources are not provided to cater <Col N="669" /> for existing pupils and patients and the order is forced to rely on various charities, including bingo, flag days and an annual fete.  It is an insult to these, our special citizens, that they are required to depend on the coldness of charity for their rights.  It is also a waste of very valuable professional time as professionals must get involved in organising these charity events to barely make ends meet.</P>
    <P>To cater adequately for the numbers now at St. Raphael's, a further 80 nurses are required.  These are not additional nurses as the centre is 80 short of its complement.  The additional annual cost would be £500,000.  The centre has long waiting lists, 25 people on which are acutely in need of residential places.  Pressure for respite from parents who care for these patients and children who are on the waiting list is increasing daily.  Currently there are only three respite places at St. Raphael's.  This lack of places leads to emergencies and a crisis for both parents and providers of the service.  There is a requirement to provide a 20 bed respite unit consisting of a ten bed unit for children and a ten bed unit for adults.  This would require £600,000 in capital expenditure and an annual revenue of £400,000.</P>
    <P>Another 30 to 40 patients who are suitable for sheltered community living could be provided with that thereby freeing places in the centre for those on the waiting list.  This would cost £200,000 in capital expenditure and £60,000 in revenue.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the St. John of God's centre provided for boys and men only.  It is now required to provide services for females, but the centre has no facilities for females.  Funding of £5 million would be necessary to provide places for these women who are now in the centre's catchment area and who are entitled to the services available to males.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to face up to the reality of the changed situation concerning learning disability. These people are now living much longer and as a result require a new range of services.</P>
    <P>St. Raphael's also has an acute problem as some of its patients with learning difficulties are psychiatric patients.  When these are sent to psychiatric institutions, they are returned to St. Raphael's as they have learning disabilities.  St. Raphael's simply has no suitable facilities for psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister visited the centre and gave certain general undertakings at the time.  I am not asking him to put his hand in his pocket this evening and create a miracle, but to examine the very special needs of the centre's catchment area which was previously serviced in various ways and is now required to be served by the Order of St. John of God.  I ask the Minister to examine how the additional top-up provision, which is not large as much provision has already been made, can be provided to meet the gap between the very large number of services being provided and what is required.  In particular I do not want the Minister to say everything is okay at St. Raphael's as <Col N="670" /> this is not the case.  A crisis exists there due to a shortage of staff and the waiting list.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I visited St. Raphael's and put on record my admiration for the work being done there.  As the Deputy said there is always room for improvement in all these services and only a fool would suggest everything is rosy in the garden in all respects.</P>
      <P>My Department's &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo;, which is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  We are aware of the requirement it has identified and the amount of money &mdash; £63.5 million &mdash; which needs to be spent over the period 1997-2001.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £21 million in 1998 to continue the process of delivering the services identified in the assessment of need report.  This funding, which includes £10.75 million revenue and £5.25 million from the new national capital programme, is being used to meet identified needs in existing services and to provide new residential and day care places.  I provided a further £5 million capital funding this year, over and above the national capital programme, to accelerate the process of providing the facilities required to deliver both the necessary volume and quality of services.  In total we have spent about £25 million since late 1997.  This compares with £12 million allocated in the previous year.</P>
      <P>The 1998 allocation to the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God for services to persons with a mental handicap included additional funding of £250,000 specifically for service issues relating to the changing profile of existing clients in St. Raphael's, Celbridge, referred to by Deputy Stagg.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of new services additional revenue funding of £432,500 was provided for the order's services in the eastern region in respect of 20 new day places and six new residential places.  This includes funding of £81,000 provided to meet the full year cost of additional services put in place in St Raphael's in 1997.</P>
      <P>A sum of £600,000 of the £3 million additional funding provided to the Eastern Health Board region for service developments in 1998 was set aside to assist in the management of any emergency cases which occurred during the year.  This fund worked very well and thankfully we have not experienced the perennial problem which arose at this time of year in relation to this and other facilities.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that approximately £36,000 of this funding was allocated to St. Raphael's in Celbridge for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital funding of £340,000 was also provided to the order's services in the eastern region in <Col N="671" /> 1998 for the development of new facilities and the up-grading of existing buildings.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £12 million is being provided in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of services to persons with a mental handicap and autism. This £12 million is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services.  This brings the total additional funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.  The 1999 allocation to the St. John of God Order includes additional funding of £150,000 to meet identified specific needs within the order's services in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>The additional revenue funding of £18 million will provide approximately 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places, 200 new day places, health related support services for children with autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  It will also provide for additional specialist and other support services.  I will be providing an additional capital funding of at least £10 million to support these developments.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Eastern Health Board region from this additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from these services are agreed by the central mental handicap planning committee, which includes representation from the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God.  Officials from my Department will meet the various voluntary mental handicap agencies, including the St. John of God Order, during 1999 to identify issues within existing services which are of concern to them, in the context of the transfer of responsibility for the direct funding of voluntary mental handicap agencies from my Department to the new Eastern Regional Authority in 2000.</P>
    <P>The additional funding being provided in 1999 will bring the total additional revenue and capital funding allocated by me to these services to £53 million in 1999 and £59 million with effect from January 2000, which underlines the Government's commitment to meeting the needs outlined in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need 1997-2001&rdquo; within the specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>Apart from that report, which gives an indication of the amount of unidentified need that must be met, I am aware that other needs arise all the time.  I have taken note of Deputy Stagg's points regarding St. Raphael's, and I will take the matter up with my Department to see what, if any, progress can be made on those matters.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tallaght (Dublin) Hospital Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the public interest that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report into the finances of Tallaght Hospital be published, as many media reports in the past 24 hours have grossly overestimated <Col N="672" /> the extent of the hospital's expenditure overrun and have misrepresented the likely contents of the report.  It is absolutely appalling that the Minister for Health and Children engaged in an unprecedented breach of faith with the board and management of Tallaght Hospital.  He met the board yesterday and handed the report to them.  I understand that both sides agreed that no public comment would be made on the substance of the report pending a further meeting that would address working out the various issues related to the hospital.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented and extraordinary breach of faith, the Minister issued a statement yesterday which stated that the &ldquo;Deloitte &amp; Touche report indicates serious governance and general management problems at the hospital.&rdquo; The Minister's strategy with this statement was to point the finger at the hospital board as being solely responsible and to target them as being to blame.  Because of the Minister's behaviour it is now essential that the report be put in a public forum and be made generally available.  The Minister has behaved in this manner to cover up what may be anticipated as criticisms of him and his Department in the report.  I challenge him to either confirm or deny that the report describes the allocation of funding by his Department to Tallaght Hospital as inappropriate, that it describes the methodology used to assess what funds were required as inappropriate and that it makes quite clear that when funding a new acute hospital, different principles should apply from those which apply on a year on year basis to existing hospitals in existing population areas.</P>
      <P>It is likely this report not merely voices some criticism of the management structures of Tallaght Hospital, but that it makes quite clear that in so far as there are financial shortfalls, the original financial allocation made by the Minister for the hospital was based on principles that were not appropriate and that, as a consequence, the hospital has run up a substantial overdraft.</P>
      <P>In the context of the breach of faith shown by the Minister and the critical comment in the statement he made, which was designed to pillory the management board of the hospital, he undermined public confidence so much that he should consider his position as Minister.  He has created extraordinary problems for this and other boards having confidential discussions with him.  His statement is not only damaging to the board of Tallaght Hospital; it is likely to undermine public confidence in the hospital itself.  I feel the Minister accepts it has operated well, as is acknowledged in the report according to other statements that have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tallaght Hospital is the only major acute hospital in the State with a Protestant ethos.  The Minister has been addressing issues related to the hospital with the sensitivity of a herd of stampeding rhinoceroses.  The manner in which he deals with the hospital will be seen as a litmus test of the Government's commitment to a new Ireland by many groups on all parts of the island.  The <Col N="673" /> Minister seems fixated by media control.  Too many reports dealing with health issues, including this one, are caught in the public relations stranglehold of the Department.  The Minister needs to be reminded that this is a parliamentary democracy, and Members of the House are entitled to see reports such as this, which have been prepared at public expense.  The media are entitled to access to such reports.  By issuing a selective statement which misleads and does not set out the position clearly, the Minister is undermining the freedom of the press to report in an informed way on important health issues.  If he has nothing to hide he should publish the report, and if he intends to remain Minister for Health and Children he should publish a public apology to the board of Tallaght Hospital for his breach of faith in making critical public comments in circumstances in which it was agreed that no substantive public comment would be made on the contents of the report.  The Minister should publish the report and let the public judge how the difficulties in Tallaght should be addressed and how the difficulties created by his Department should be addressed to ensure that a new hospital does not experience similar difficulties in future.</P>

      <P>I refute the allegations made by Deputy Shatter.  There is no question of a breach of faith.  That is certainly not the case.  I am surprised that on one hand he criticises me for seeking to maintain confidentiality while on the other he says I should be criticised for not making this report available to every person in the media all over the country.  His position is totally contradictory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Just publish the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify this matter.  I acknowledge, as the Deloitte &amp; Touche report does, that the move of three long established hospitals from the inner city to Tallaght was a significant logistical and operational task which was carried out well by those responsible.  It is only fair in the context of current problems that I make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of management of the hospital confirmed <Col N="674" /> to my Department at the end of September that there were difficulties facing it with regards to its budget.  These difficulties are of a much greater degree than it had envisaged when it submitted its service plan in April this year.</P>
    <P>The results of the first six months of this year were in line with the hospital's budget.  The Department received outturn figures at the end of August for July which report a major deficit &mdash; £2.4 million &mdash; in its revenue costs for that month alone and which projected that a significant element of this would recur for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The board was asked to confirm the situation and it confirmed a projected deficit for the year of approximately £21 million on 24 September.  I initiated an independent review of this data to be carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche, and this work began immediately.  The review also examined the arrangements within the organisation for service planning and associated staffing and financial budgets as well as the processes, systems and practices for reporting and control.  The report was delivered to the Department of Health and Children on Thursday evening last, 3 December. I met the chairman and representatives of the board of management of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, yesterday, 9 December, and gave them copies of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the hospital.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the board of management has responsibility for overseeing the effective management of this autonomous voluntary hospital.  I informed the board that I accepted the report and I am extremely concerned at its contents.  I told the board that I want the report to be implemented.  A £13.2 million revenue overspend and a potential £4.3 million overrun of capital expenditure is involved.</P>
    <P>Following adjustment in the normal way in regard to the hospital's claims for additional funding, such as increased pension costs, special pay awards, PRSI and superannuation, the projected net revenue deficit for 1998 is approximately £8.5 million.  I informed the board that I will not find this remaining deficit, the funding of which is a matter for it.  I am adopting the same policy with this hospital as I have taken throughout the year with all other hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly enunciated this policy in the House on a number of previous occasions.  Each element of capital expenditure is currently under review to establish if it was of a critical nature and absolutely essential to the opening of the hospital.  I will consider whether <Col N="675" /> any further capital funding is appropriate when I receive this assessment before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The report also refers to issues of governance and general management at the hospital.  It is comprehensive and runs to 211 pages.  I agreed with representatives of the board of management yesterday that we would work to resolve the issues raised in it as speedily as possible.  This starts with the board assessing the implications of this comprehensive review, recognising that it must deal with the financial problem and must agree a <i>modus operandi</i> with me for effecting change.  The board members have much to consider and I asked them to be speedy.  I must, however, give them the opportunity to consider all these matters.  I was obliged to issue a short statement last night setting out the main thrust of the report and the necessary approach to resolve the problem speedily.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department and I will work closely with the hospital so that we can resolve matters and ensure that this fine facility can be established on a secure basis.  My primary concerns are for the patients and staff of the hospital.  An enormous number of people have worked very hard to get the new hospital up and running in Tallaght.  I am particularly grateful for the enormous effort made by the staff of the hospital at all levels to ensure the smooth and safe transfer of patients and services to the new hospital at Tallaght.  The work to be done over the coming week is designed to guarantee the future of Tallaght hospital.  The letter of determination is the same as is available to every other hospital.

      <P>Neither my Department nor the Radiological Protection Institute, RPII, has seen a copy of the most recent data produced by Greenpeace.  However, on the basis of the reported findings of Greenpeace, their data corresponds closely with the findings already published by the RPII in respect of levels of concentrations of technetium-99 in seaweed on the east coast of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII undertakes a regular and comprehensive environmental radioactivity monitoring programme of Irish coastal waters.  The RPII publishes its results annually in their annual report and releases bi-annual detailed reports; the most recent bi-annual report deals with the 1996-7 <Col N="679" /> period.  These results are also available on the Department of Public Enterprise web site.</P>
    <P>The RPII's data indicates significant annual increases since 1994 in concentrations of technetium-99 in seaweed sampled along the north east Irish coastline as a result of increased discharges from Sellafield.  However, the highest measurements made by the RPII for the north eastern Irish coast are more than 100 times lower than the level detected on the Sellafield coastline. On the basis of such data derived from its own measurements, the RPII's view is that the resulting doses arising from radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea are very small and do not constitute a significant health risk.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective is, of course, the cessation of all radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.  I have availed of every opportunity to highlight Ireland's opposition to the radioactive contamination of the environment, particularly the marine environment.  I am determined to do everything possible to ensure that the positive commitments made by the UK in July this year at the OSPAR ministerial meeting in Lisbon are fully and speedily achieved.</P>
    <P>The most immediate issue relating to marine discharges from Sellafield is the decision to be made by UK Ministers on BNFL's revised discharge authorisations following the referral by the UK Environment Agency to the UK Ministers of the agency's draft decision in the matter. As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 33, 43 and 87 of 10 November, I have written to the UK Ministers objecting to the Environment Agency draft decisions on the grounds that the reductions in technetium-99 proposed are totally inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 43, 48, 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>Current installed capacity in Ireland is approximately 4450mw.  The bulk of this is provided by ESB power plants, with the balance provided by small scale generating plants.  The existing volume of electricity capacity is adequate to meet current demand for electricity from industrial, commercial and domestic users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;amber alerts&rdquo; require particular clarification. Recent &ldquo;amber alerts&rdquo; do not mean that the ESB has insufficient capacity to meet all current demands for electricity.  The ESB, like all utilities, operates on a margin which is the difference between available capacity and peak demand. Generally, if this margin falls below 300mw in current circumstances, the &ldquo;amber light&rdquo; goes on. If a major generating unit fails in such a situation, the possibility can arise of capacity being unable to match demand.  A series of &ldquo;amber lights&rdquo;<Col N="681" /> indicates a tightening of the operating margin in a growing economy and underlines the need to maximise the availability of existing capacity and to plan for additions to existing capacity.</P>
    <P>Record economic growth has fuelled an unprecedented growth in demand for electricity. Growth in demand for electricity has increased by approximately 31 per cent over the past five years.  New plants to meet continuing growth in demand include phase two of ESB's combined cycle gas plant at Poolbeg which came on stream last month, phase three of Poolbeg planned for December 1999 and the new independent 120mw peat plant at Edenderry to come on stream in mid-2001.  In regard to longer-term capacity planning, the Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the publication by the ESB of an annual statement estimating, for a seven year period, the generating capacity which is likely to be connected to the transmission system.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the enactment of the Bill, the ESB in consultation with my Department published a statement of estimated future capacity requirements up to 2005 for the information of the industry in October last.  This concluded that existing capacity together with the additions mentioned above, will be broadly sufficient to meet demand up to 2001.  New capacity in excess of 200mw will be required in late 2001 or early 2002, and further new capacity in excess of 800mw will be needed by 2005.</P>
    <P>A number of private sector interests are at present actively developing plans to enter the Irish market under the provisions of the new electricity directive to be implemented here by 19 February 2000.  These include Marathon, Northern Ireland Electricity and IVO/Elf.  ESB are making similar plans for new plant and I have recently given approval to ESB for capital expenditure in the preparatory work up to completion of the planning permission process.</P>
    <P>Both ESB and the private sector interests involved will, of course, require an authorisation to construct new plant from the new Commission for Electricity Regulation to be established in the near future.  On the assumption that all necessary approvals are secured during the coming year, I have every confidence that new gas-fired plant will be available, as required, by end 2001.  The recruitment process for the new regulatory commission has been completed and the first appointee will be in place in the very near future.</P>
    <P>On the issue of trading mechanisms, this will now be a matter for consultation among all interested parties.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to parliamentary questions on 10 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The sale of TEAM Aer Lingus to FLS should be completed within the next few days.  I understand that the number of TEAM Aer Lingus employees who have chosen not to accept terms for the transfer of their employment to FLS has reduced to 91.  These 91 employees have all returned to the airline with 42 having been accommodated with positions matching their skills and the remainder in other positions.</P>
      <P>I met this morning with trade union officials representing those workers who have been accommodated in positions that are not matching their skills.  I understand that many of these are not satisfied with their positions and I believe that this difficulty should be the subject of further consultations between their unions and Aer Lingus management.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus advises me that the amounts due to each employee transferring to FLS will, subject to completion of the deal, be paid before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 24 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer Deputies to my earlier reply to the priority question on Aer Rianta's charges, where I clarified the general position in relation to landing fees at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputies' more specific queries, Aer Rianta has provided me with details on the level of discounts achieved by each airline at Dublin Airport for the years 1994 to 1997 inclusive and these have been set out in a table appended as part of this reply.  Estimates of discounts applicable for the period from January to October 1998 have also been provided by Aer Rianta.  I wish to clarify, however, that these estimates may be subject to amendment, following final calculations by the airport company at year end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The Ryanair annual report for the year ending 31 March 1998 cites a figure of IR£40.96 as the average passenger fare for a Ryanair one-way ticket.  Aer Rianta has informed me that Ryanair is charged an average fee of £1.94 per passenger at Dublin Airport.  This charge by Aer Rianta (Mrs. represents 4.7 per cent of the average Ryanair ticket price.  The total rebates allowed to Ryanair for the years 1994 to 1997 was over £21.5 million. The estimated rebate in the current year to October 1998 is £7.2 million, but this figure may be subject to revision when figures are finalised at the year end.</P>
    <P>Turning to Deputy Shortall's question, the position is that last March, the European Commission sought information on aspects of Aer Rianta's airport charges regime and, in particular, the substantial discount schemes in respect of growth traffic.  The concern was that these discounts could constitute a distortion of competition. The Commission was supplied with full information and following this, in October last, the Commission met with Aer Rianta and officials of my Department.  The Commission's examination of the schemes has not yet been concluded.</P>

      <P>I am committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date.  It is also my policy that all transport operators should, as far as possible, make their services and facilities accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus currently has 11 low floor buses in service.  As part of its 1999 fleet replacement programme, the company plans to purchase a further 19 fully accessible 33 seater midi buses.  Dublin Bus expects to take delivery of the 19 vehicles during 1999.</P>
      <P>I understand that, subject to CIE board approval, Dublin Bus also plans to begin a pilot test programme in March for accessible double decker buses.  Low floor double deck buses have been operating in London for the past three months and Dublin Bus states that it hopes to obtain three such models from different suppliers for pilot testing over a six month period.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann currently operates a low-floor bus on the Bishopstown route in Cork and a further ten vehicles, destined for Cork and Limerick, are due for delivery in 1999.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 49 on 10 November 1998.</P>
      <P>I sought funding for a radon remediation grant scheme for households in the context of the 1999 Estimates.  Unfortunately because of budgetary constraints, funds will not be available for such a scheme in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Deputy, however, that while the Government is not in a position to provide direct financial assistance to householders in the current year, every effort is being made to address the problem of high radon levels in dwellings.  The Radiological Protection Institute's national radon survey is due to be completed by early next year and will give a comprehensive picture of the areas in the country where householders may be at risk. This survey has been complemented by recent radon preventative measures introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government <Col N="686" /> and local authorities in the context of the technical guidance documents related to the consolidated national building regulations 1997. These measures, which relate to the construction of new houses, came into effect in July last.</P>
    <P>The RPII has also initiated, at the request of the Minister for Education and Science, a survey of ground floor radon levels in respect of primary and secondary schools in Ireland.  This survey, which commenced in September, will be carried out over the next three school years.</P>
    <P>These measures are indicative of the Government's efforts to create an awareness of radon and to tackle the problem of high indoor radon levels in dwellings and schools.</P>

      <P>The subjects for the annual programme of special and commemorative stamps are selected by the philatelic advisory committee of An Post after very wide consultation, and are then approved by the board of the company and by the Government.  In order to allow sufficient time for design, printing and publicity, each annual stamp programme should be finalised well before the year of issue.</P>
      <P>The centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was one of many worthy suggestions put forward for inclusion in the 1999 programme, but which was not selected.  However, in view of the fact that it is the centenary of the association, given its extensive membership throughout the country and the many representations which I have received on the association's behalf from the Members, I am prepared to request An Post to reconsider issuing a stamp to commemorate its anniversary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are no safety standards in relation to overcrowding of trains at EU level, or in individual member states.  It is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular type of carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.  I have no statutory function in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the discomfort that passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times.  There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes.  However, ongoing investment in additional rolling stock will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the difficulties.</P>
      <P>My Department's railway inspecting officer was recently in contact with Iarnród Éireann to draw its attention to a number of complaints he had received from members of the public about overcrowding, and he requested the company to ensure that they take any appropriate action to discharge their responsibility for passenger safety in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there are no international standards in <Col N="688" /> this area and since Iarnród Éireann is responsible for railway safety, the question of the railway inspecting officer making recommendations to me does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The transportation review and short-term action plan, published by the Dublin Transportation Office in September, contains information on the growth in demand for transport in the greater Dublin area.  In response to the recommendations of that plan, I have given the go-ahead for the doubling of the rail line between Clonsilla and Maynooth and new signalling to cater for improved services on that line; the purchase of 150 additional buses by Dublin Bus; the purchase of 16 additional DART carriages to the ten already on order; the acquisition of 20 extra suburban railcars in addition to 27 new carriages already on order and the extension of DART and suburban station platforms to cater for longer trains.</P>
      <P>This investment was made possible by the reallocation of the Luas EU aid and by the provision for the first time of direct Exchequer capital funding for bus and rail projects.  The purchase of 100 buses is being fully financed by the Exchequer, as is the non-EU balance of the funding for the other projects.</P>
      <P>As part of the Luas reallocation, an additional £24 million is also being provided for mainline rail renewal.</P>
      <P>At my request, CIE has prepared a comprehensive series of reviews of medium term investment requirements for bus and rail.  These reviews were taken into account by my Department in making its submission to the Department of Finance on the post-1999 round of Structural and Cohesion Fund assistance.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that no attempt was made by anyone in my Department or in Iarnród Éireann to dilute, minimise or omit any findings of the International Risk Management Services review of rail safety in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the published report fully reflects the independent professional view of the consultants on the safety of the railways in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Any comments on, and suggested textual changes to, a draft of the consultants' report which were made by officials of my Department were made in accordance with the normal practice of Government Departments when dealing with consultants' reports.  The purpose of these comments and suggestions was to ensure that the report was clear and unambiguous and that it was easily read and accessible.  It was made clear in writing to the consultants that they were free to accept or reject the suggestions in accordance with their professional judgment.  This is precisely what the consultants did &mdash; they accepted some and rejected others.</P>
      <P>A Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas made various requests for documentation relating to the study.  These were fully and promptly responded to by my Department.  A copy of that documentation has been placed in the Oireachtas library.</P>
      <P>This was an independent study and the report which I published was the one which was submitted to me by the consultants.  It was a matter for the consultants to satisfy themselves that the report which they submitted adequately reflected the findings and conclusions of their work, including the working papers which they prepared. However, I can assure the Deputy that I have no concerns in that regard.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Lucan corridor, specific research was conducted for Dublin Bus in November 1997 and July 1998 on the 25A route.  The surveys show an encouraging shift to public transport.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained previously in this House, decisions in relation to the siting of transmission lines and infrastructural development are matters for the board and management of ESB and are not ones in which the Government nor I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>In order to be helpful, however, I wish to offer a number of observations.  Record economic growth is fuelling an unprecedented demand for electricity all over the country.  In accordance with its statutory mandate, ESB must take account of the implications of this growth for its generation, transmission and distribution capacity.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Aghada/Raffeen project is to provide essential reinforcement to the ESB national grid in the Cork area to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the region, particularly from industry and services.  Demand is growing at approximately 6 per cent per annum.  It has been clear for some time that if the necessary system reinforcement does not proceed, ESB will not be able to meet the emerging demands from industrial, commercial and domestic customers.</P>
      <P>ESB examined many alternatives such as the underwater cable option, local generation, reinforcement at 110k V, and the use of 110k V capacitors, before coming to the conclusion that the project as submitted was the most appropriate on the basis of technical merit, environmental impact, reliability, security and cost.  In the light of the concerns and level of objection from local people ESB have engaged in a major information/consultation process with many interested parties.</P>
      <P>ESB agreed to a proposal by Cork County Council that the centre for dispute resolution should be invited to broker a solution between ESB and the local interests opposed to the overland option.  Vattenfall Transmission of Sweden &mdash; acknowledged experts in all aspects of power generation and transmission &mdash; were duly commissioned to review the data supplied by the ESB and by the consultants engaged directly by the Cork Anti-Pylon Representative Association, CARA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vattenfall report has been completed and made available to CARA.  The report confirms that the underwater option would be considerably more expensive than an overland line and <Col N="693" /> would take a considerably longer timescale to put in place.  The urgent and growing power demands in the Cork region completely rule out such a delay.</P>
    <P>The project has been subjected to the full requirements of the planning process and has received the necessary planning approvals.  The power situation in Cork is becoming critical.  ESB are in continuing discussion with the objectors and hope to make progress with their objections so that work can start as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Arising from significant growth in passenger throughput in recent years, Aer Rianta has planned a total expenditure of £28 million for Cork Airport under a five year capital expenditure programme ending in the year 2002.  As part of that programme, approximately £10 million has been invested during 1998 in a range of infrastructural facilities, including the overlay and widening of the runway, provision of new cargo warehouses, extension of apron space, provision of new outgoing baggage facilities and check-in desks, together with additional car parking facilities and the upgrading of the electrical systems.</P>
      <P>Traffic at Cork Airport is expected to increase by almost 10 per cent this year, with the final outturn at year end anticipated to be in the region of 1.3 million.  The growth in traffic is being matched by Aer Rianta's continued investment in necessary facilities at Cork Airport, designed to keep pace with traffic demands and to act as an incentive to new economic activity at the airport and in the Cork region generally.</P>

      <P>The CCR agreement provides for a broad range of necessary change in ESB in order to prepare the company for the challenge of competition. These changes were agreed both nationally, and locally at Ferbane.  The management of ESB must retain the necessary flexibility to conduct their operations, including specifically the changes agreed in the CCR, across the organisation in a manner which will best secure the longer term interest of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement by ESB on 24 September <Col N="694" /> that it proposed to close Ferbane arose from a total loss of confidence by ESB management in the willingness of a small group of key staff at Ferbane to embrace and implement the changes agreed for the plant.  Following the ESB announcement, I had detailed and ongoing discussions with various interests, including the ESB group of unions, during October about the difficulties at Ferbane.  The focus of those discussions was on ways and means of resolving the issues involved at Ferbane.</P>
    <P>Following an initiative by the ESB group of unions, the issues involved were referred to the ESB joint industrial council which issued a recommendation on 28 October 1998.  The council's recommendation is a very positive and welcome outcome.  The main union &mdash; MSFI &mdash; representing the staff involved at Ferbane, had already signalled its prior agreement to be bound by the outcome of the council's deliberations.  The council made special note of this and went on to recommend immediate implementation of the new changes and work practices at Ferbane, given the situation that exists there regarding refurbishment at the plant.</P>
    <P>The council's recommendation provides an agreed basis to end the recent difficulties at Ferbane. I hope that the parties involved will now seize the opportunity to move forward without further delay in a spirit of real partnership at Ferbane.</P>

The ending of the use of nuclear power is to be reviewed by the German Government in the new year and this review will include talks with the nuclear industry.

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the 15 year safety investment programme recommended by IRMS in their recently published report on rail safety in Ireland.  The consultants estimated that safety investment, costing of the broad order of £590 million, would be required over that period.</P>
      <P>The consultants advised me that they considered 15 years to be the realistic time period within which to address all of the relevant issues. In any event almost half of the total estimated costs will arise in the first five years, and only £21 million of once-off expenditure arises between years six and 15.  The bulk of the expenditure after year five is, in fact, ongoing expenditure of £20 million per annum on rail renewal, and £6.5 million per annum on safety management systems. This is continuing annual expenditure which will arise irrespective of the implementation period.</P>
      <P>The Government has established a high level task force comprised of officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to prioritise recommendations on necessary rail safety expenditure requirements.  The task force report will be completed by end January 1999.</P>

I am advised by CIE that no increases in the regular annuity payments will arise as a result of the amalgamation.</P>
      <P>I understand that, by and large, the benefits arising from the amalgamation relate to increases in the pension lump sums, payable on retirement, in respect of some members who retired after 1 January 1994.

It has indicated its support for a joint approach by both Departments to the promotion of a suitable mix of fuels for public transport vehicles.</P>
      <P>My Department will be very supportive of any measures in the public transport area designed to improve air quality.  Improving the quantity and quality of public transport will have a particularly important role to play in so far as it encourages people to transfer from the private car.  The recent initiatives I have announced, including direct Exchequer support for bus and rail investment, will make a major contribution in this regard.</P>
      <P>If Dublin Bus was to specify alternative fuels for all or part of the order for 150 additional buses, it would have to begin a new tendering procedure.  This would significantly delay both the date for the first deliveries and the overall delivery schedule.  Given the existing critical traffic situation in Dublin, this course of action would not be desirable.  There are no funds available to me to provide a special subsidy.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the benefits of alternative fuels, there are a number of detailed issues which will have to be considered.  These include possible additional fuel and vehicle costs, additional infrastructure costs involved in new fuelling and storage facilities and safety considerations.  My Department has, therefore, suggested to the Department of the Environment and Local Government that an informal working group representative of both Departments and Dublin Bus should be established to address these issues in the context of the company's ongoing bus replacement programme.</P>

      <P>I have received no reports which suggest that a decision to put a section of the Dublin light rail system underground could cost an additional £300 million.  A firm cost estimate for the underground section will not be available until the necessary geotechnical work has been completed late in 1999.</P>
      <P>A recent preliminary estimate by CIE for the whole of phase one &mdash; Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to Ballymun/Dublin Airport &mdash; indicated a cost of £671 million.  This estimate included provision for inflation and a substantial allowance for working capital requirements, both of which would not normally be included in a capital cost estimate.</P>
      <P>The estimate for the underground section amounted to £174 million.  This was not based on new work but on figures in earlier studies by WS Atkins and Semaly.  CIE acknowledge that their figures require further analysis.</P>
      <P>The priority at present is to finalise firm budget estimates for the Tallaght to Abbey Street section, which has just completed the public inquiry phase.  I expect CIE to submit detailed figures for this section shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the increase in demand for electricity, the immediate challenge for ESB is to achieve the highest level of availability in all its existing generating plants.</P>
      <P>ESB reports on an annual basis to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and to the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide emissions from its power plants.  ESB has met its commitments in the past and has plans in place to ensure compliance in the future.  These plans include the additional use of gas, low sulphur oil and coal and the installation of low nitrous oxide burners at power stations in addition to those already installed.</P>
      <P>The future of the peat plants operated by ESB was considered by the peat review group which reported in 1994.  That report laid out a programme of phased closure for the older less efficient peat burning units together with a programme of refurbishment for other units as well as recommending the construction of a new 120 mv peat plant, to be located at Edenderry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other developing processes which will affect the future operating life of all ESB power stations.  These processes <Col N="701" /> include the forthcoming national emissions ceiling directive on sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions; the national strategy adopted to achieve compliance with carbon dioxide emission limits arising from the Kyoto agreement; the policy to be adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in licensing existing plant; the mechanism for environmental cost recovery under the new industry structure; the age profile of the plant; the need to maintain economic performance/achieve best new entrant performance standards at all existing generating stations and the intensity of competition in a future open market.</P>
    <P>In relation to carbon dioxide emissions, my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government jointly commissioned a report on the limitation and reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland' in the course of developing a national strategy to meet Ireland's target under the Kyoto protocol.  The report was published in June and consultations with all interested parties were invited.  A one day discussion forum on the development of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy was held on 28 October and work on the preparation of a strategy for Government approval is now progressing.</P>
    <P>In finalising a national strategy, the Government will seek to ensure that the burden of meeting Ireland's Kyoto commitments are shared equitably across all economic sectors, including transport, agriculture, industry and energy.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that my Department has undertaken an extensive consultation process to date regarding implementation of the EU electricity directive in Ireland which is due by February 2000.  The directive requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition at that time, rising to about 32 per cent within three years.</P>
      <P>The consultation process has included the following: proposals for implementing the directive were published in May 1997; a discussion forum was held in January 1998 and a further consultation document was published in May 1998. Approximately 60 sets of comments were received in response to the May consultation document.

      <P>The Government has welcomed the recently published statement by the national competitiveness council on telecommunications.</P>
      <P>The report highlights a number of key Government achievements in the telecommunications sector over the past year.  These include the bringing forward of the date for full liberalisation of the telecommunications sector from 1 January 2000 to 1 December 1998; the agreement signed by An Taoiseach and the President of the United States of America on electronic commerce; the scheduling of an initial public offering of Telecom Éireann shares for mid-1999; the announcement of significant Structural Funding for investment in broad band telecommunications; the decision to sell the State's shareholding in Cablelink on the condition that a significant investment is made in network upgrade as a multimedia platform and to provide voice telephony; the establishment and report of the expert advisory committee on telecommunications and the transposition of key EU telecommunications directives &mdash; Ireland is now regarded as one of the leading member states in terms of having a legal framework for effective competition in the telecommunications sector.</P>
      <P>The report also calls for Government action across a number of Departments.  Priorities identified by the council include business take-up of advanced telecommunications; deployment of advanced telecommunications infrastructure on a nationwide basis; development of policy in the area of electronic commerce; and development of digital TV.</P>
      <P>These issues are being addressed as priority work items across Government Departments, including my own.  We would all agree that we must maintain competitiveness if we are to sustain our exceptional economic success in recent years and the statement is a welcome contribution to the process of policy development to achieve this end.</P>

      <P>The local employment service &mdash; LES &mdash; support unit in FÁS was asked, in 1995, by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the training and development needs of staff in the LES.  One of the immediate needs identified for LES staff was training in career path planning which would provide an individual tailor made approach on a caseload basis.</P>
      <P>Tenders were sought by FÁS, in accordance with required tendering procedures, from companies to provide a basic foundation course to mediators.  The interdepartmental advisory group, on which my Department is represented and for which my Department provides secretariat services, oversees the operation and development of the LES and they agreed in principle for FÁS to award a contract to a particular company to deliver foundation training as from February 1996.  The contract was extended in 1997, with approval from the interdepartmental advisory group, as a result of the expansion of the LES to new areas during that year.</P>
      <P>The company has continued to provide such training as well as to develop a training support manual for mediators.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the extension of the LES to seven new areas.  The training needs of staff in those new areas, including the arrangements for the provision of that training, will be examined as they come on stream.  If the Deputy requires further details on developments I would be happy to provide them.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the call referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The issue of phthalates in the production of toys has been considered by the EU scientific committee on toxicity, ecoctoxicity and the environment. An opinion from this committee has led to the European Commission recommendation of 1 July 1998 covering childcare articles and soft toys made of soft PVC, which calls on member states to carry out some scientific tests.  In the case of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs has asked Enterprise Ireland to carry out such tests, the results of which are awaited.</P>
      <P>There is currently no proposal from the European Commission for action at Community level which would bind member states.  In the light of the results of such tests I understand that the European Commission may put forward a proposal for permanent legislation which will ensure a high level of safety and health under harmonised conditions.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Bill, 1998, which is being drafted at present, will provide for the transfer of responsibility for the regulation of insurance intermediaries from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Central Bank.  This follows the enactment of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995 which provided for a similar transfer of regulatory responsibility in the case of investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Bill, 1998, recently introduced by the Minister for Finance to the Dáil will, <i>inter alia,</i> enable him to take the necessary actions to guarantee the Central Bank against any losses it may incur under the Bank for International Settlements Facility in favour of Banco Central do Brazil.  Irelands participation in the facility will cover the capital and interest elements of US$50 million &mdash; IR£34.3 million &mdash; already pledged following the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Ireland has responded to the humanitarian crisis in Central America by approving a total of £500,000 from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Ireland's assistance is being <Col N="709" /> disbursed through Trócaire, APSO, the International Federation of the Red Cross, the World Health Organisation and the World Food Programme.</P>
      <P>The amount of assistance received by each agency and its purpose is as follows: grants totalling £100,000 to Trócaire for immediate relief which includes meeting, the needs in nine severely affected municipalities in Honduras &mdash; approximately 30,000 people; grants totalling £80,000 to APSO for humanitarian assistance in Honduras and Nicaragua; a grant of £120,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross &mdash; the federation, along with its national societies, is able to disburse these funds to where they are most needed including other countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador; a grant of £100,000 to the World Health Organisation for emergency medical supplies on behalf of all countries affected within the region; and a grant of £150,000 to the World Food Programme towards its emergency feeding operation for the most vulnerable victims of the hurricane in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>APSO at present has 31 Irish staff based in Honduras and Nicaragua who, along with the locally hired staff, are organising the supply of food, medicine and clothing for the communities with which they work.  APSO has reported the urgent need for fast growing rice and bean seed in the hope of producing some food within the next three months.  Part of the moneys allocated to APSO will fund the supply of emergency medical kits in some of the most affected areas of Honduras.  To avoid duplication, APSO is co-ordinating closely with other international agencies and particularly with Trócaire to whom it has provided a number of personnel.</P>
      <P>Trócaire has two Irish personnel in the region, however, through a network of local counterpart organisations it is also using local people in the response effort.  Seventeen of its development projects in nine municipalities of Honduras have been directly affected by the hurricane.  Grants totalling £100,000 have been allocated to Trócaire's initial programmes aimed at providing emergency assistance.  The main form of relief supplies consists of family food packages.</P>
      <P>The Government has given a commitment that Ireland will work with these countries over a longer period and play our full part in the international effort for reconstruction and rehabilitation.</P>

The recent disturbances there are a reminder that acting at all times within the law is an essential part of the confidence building required to achieve a resolution.

      <P>Mutual respect and local accommodation remain the only way of resolving this conflict. Officials from my Department continue to monitor the situation and are in ongoing contact with parties involved in order to encourage dialogue and a way forward.  However, no one party can of itself deliver a resolution.  It will take the determination of all parties.  particularly those most directly involved, to find a fair and peaceful resolution.

      <P>The amendments to the CIE salaried superannuation schemes, which in turn depend on the amalgamation of the schemes, have not been carried through because of two major legal difficulties associated with the legislation on which these schemes are founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these difficulties was identified towards the end of 1996 and the other was identified in February this year.  Since the difficulties first came to light, officials of my Department, together with officials of the Office of the Attorney General and representatives of CIE, <Col N="711" /> have been urgently addressing them but they are proving very difficult to resolve.</P>
    <P>I am now advised that primary legislation will be necessary for the amalgamation of the scheme to proceed.  It is only subsequent to the amalgamation that the amendments to the schemes in question can be made.  Significant progress has recently been made in identifying solutions to the legal difficulties.  I hope that these difficulties will be resolved through the passage of primary legislation at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Day-to-day responsibility for all matters relating to rail safety is a matter for Iarnród Éireann. However, the Deputy will be aware from the recently published report entitled A Review of Railway Safety in Ireland, that the condition of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure of Iarnród Éireann is poor.  The report highlights 17 sections of track on which passengers are most at risk.  This includes the Mullingar to Dublin line.</P>
      <P>In response to the report the Government immediately appointed a high level task force comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and representatives of CIÉ and Iarnród Éireann to prioritise recommendations on necessary rail safety expenditure requirements.  The task force report will be completed by end January 1999.  In the meantime CIE has begun implementation of the report's recommendations giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants. Pending consideration by Government of the task force report, CIE will undertake borrowings to finance the implementation of the immediate safety measures.</P>

      <P>The area aid for the person named has been processed.  He declared a forage area of 17.21 hectares.  However, the area found from the digitising process was 16.06 hectares.  As the difference between the area found and the area claimed is more than 3 per cent, a penalty reduction of double the difference was imposed on the found area in accordance with Regulation 3887/92, and as outlined in paragraph 16.2 of the terms and conditions of the scheme.  This means that his livestock payments will be based on an area of 13.76 hectares.  He also applied for 4.14 hectares of cereals and this has been processed. A payment of £1,134.60 in respect of this claim will issue as soon as possible.</P>

All farmers meeting the criteria of the scheme in the selected DEDs are included together with all sheep farmers with mountain grazings as per the sheep headage scheme.  No precise data is readily available on the number of suckler cow producers without quota.  However, over 31,000 suckler cow producers are included which represents the vast majority of those in the worst affected areas identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context I would point out that tax follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis of the treatment of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than they would if they were two single people living together.  The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment.  Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to tax free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the concerns of cohabiting couples.  An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  Consideration of tax measures in this area will await the group's report which is expected to be completed early next year.</P>

      <P>As I previously stated to the Deputy, each year hospitals are notified of their non-capital allocation and a service plan is drawn up by them and agreed with the Department.  This plan sets down parameters for activity for the year and hospitals are required to maintain activity levels within the hospital's agreed parameters.  Detailed decisions in relation to hospital spending area matter for the hospital management.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently completed the 1999 Estimates process and has furnished agencies with their letter of determination.  The Mater Hospital's allocation for 1999 represents a 14 per cent increase on its original 1998 allocation and includes a 100 per cent increase in its waiting list initiative funding.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the concerns which the Deputy may have about the reduction of CT services in the hospital.  In this regard, I have been advised by the hospital's management that it intends to bring its second CT machine back into service on 5 January 1999.  I have been further advised that CT services are not used on breast cancer patients.</P>

The illnesses covered by this scheme are: &mdash; mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for persons under 16 years only &mdash; phenylketonuria cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that .the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the Health Board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are two neurosurgical units in Ireland, one in Beaumont Hospital, the National Centre for Neurosurgery and one in Cork University Hospital.  I have made inquiries of both neurosurgical units and understand that they have adequate specialised trained neurosurgical nursing staff available to ensure specialist care to the adult and paediatric patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding neurosurgical services generally, the Deputy may wish to know that additional funding is being made available to the Southern Health Board in 1999 to enhance neurosurgical services at Cork University Hospital.  Additional funding is also being provided as part of Beaumont Hospital's 1999 allocation to provide for the resources required to support the reactivation of the sixth neurosurgeon post at Beaumont Hospital.  Once this replacement post has been filled the number of neurosurgeons in Ireland will <Col N="725" /> provide for a consultant population ratio considered reasonable by the most recent Comhairle na nOspidéal review of this area.</P>

      <P>The position is that medicines that are reimburseable in whole or in part under the general medical services scheme or the community drug schemes are medicines that are ordinarily supplied on foot of a prescription issued by a registered medical practitioner.  The medicines reimburseable must be &lsquo;allopathic&rsquo; medicinal products which are the subject of a product authorisation &mdash; PA &mdash; under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, or an authorisation granted or renewed by the European Commission in accordance with EU Council Regulation No. (EEC) 2309/93, that lay down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products.</P>
      <P>The granting of such authorisations ensures that the medicinal products concerned have satisfied certain minimum standards regarding their quality, safety and efficacy.  The position is that homeopathic therapies are not the subject of such authorisations.  Accordingly, there are no plans for the reimbursement of homeopathic products on the general medical services scheme or the community drugs schemes.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to people who have paid social insurance for 40 years and whose employment is then terminated, so by implication the question refers to a reduction in the qualifying age for retirement pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Retirement pension is available to those who are aged 65 and have retired from the workforce. Certain social insurance contribution conditions must also be satisfied, namely that the person commenced paying social insurance before reaching the age of 55; has at least 156 or three years contributions paid and has a yearly average of at least 24 contributions paid or credited from the time s/he started paying social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>The proposal by the Deputy would obviously have budgetary implications and I have no plans to make any change to these qualifying conditions at this time.  However, as I outlined in my budget speech to the House, my Department will be undertaking a review of the qualifying conditions for both retirement and old age contributory pensions early next year and I will report to the House on the outcome of that review in due course.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that where a person aged 55 or over opts to retire from the labour force or is made redundant, s/he may qualify for a weekly pre-retirement allowance, which is means tested and payable until the person reaches the age of 65.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in Ireland aged 66 years or over, irrespective of nationality.  It is also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to assist older people and people with disabilities to remain active in the community.  At the end of last September, free travel passes had been issued to over 515,000 people at an estimated annual cost of over £34 million.</P>
      <P>The scheme was extended in 1995 to cover cross-Border travel only between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is available to passholders in Ireland, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes and to Northern Ireland concession travel passholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental <Col N="730" /> review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal, which would have cost implications, will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 359 of 17 November 1998 and in recent replies to other similar questions, my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grants to voluntary groups and organisations, such as the group mentioned in the Deputy's question, who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow my Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.  It is important to realise that not all applications received under the 1996 and 1997 schemes were funded at a level of 90 per cent.  No decision has been made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme in 1998.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by it.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 <Col N="731" /> people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July of last year I have spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>The old age contributory and retirement pensions are based on a person's own social insurance record and payment is related to the average number of contributions over a given period.  A qualified adult allowance is paid where a dependent partner resides with the pensioner and is wholly or mainly supported by him/her.</P>
      <P>In the case of the means tested old age non-contributory pension, the allowance for a qualified adult is graduated in line with the personal rate of pension in payment.  Where the dependent spouse/partner is over 66, he/she may qualify for this pension in his/her own right, assuming that the means test is satisfied.</P>
      <P>In this context, the report of the Pensions Board, &lsquo;Securing Retirement Income&rsquo;, on the national pensions policy initiative recommended that available resources should be used, first, to increase the basic social welfare pension and, second, to maintain, at its current level at least, the relationship between the qualified adult allowance and the personal rate of pension.  This is based on the Commission on Social Welfare's &mdash; CSW &mdash; recommendation that the rates of payment for qualified adults should be set at 60 per cent of the basic payment for a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental working group, which is currently examining the treatment of one and two parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, is looking at the concept of &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; in the social welfare payment system, with particular reference to individualisation of payments. One of the group's specific terms of reference is to carry out research on equivalence scales <Col N="732" /> and I expect the group to report to me early in 1999.</P>
    <P>The extension of social insurance to the self-employed &mdash; 1988 &mdash; , part-time workers &mdash; 1991 &mdash; and to new civil/public servants &mdash; 1995 &mdash; means that over time a greater proportion of people will qualify for a contributory old age pension in their own right.</P>

      <P>Current legislation provides for the payment of unemployment benefit in respect of days of unemployment subject to satisfying the statutory contribution conditions and other conditions requiring the claimant to be available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work.  Consequently, unemployment benefit is not payable for days in respect of which an employee receives wages irrespective of the amount of the wages or the number of hours worked.</P>
      <P>An exception to this situation arises where a person, had, in addition to his/her normal occupation, part-time employment outside normal working hours, prior to claiming unemployment benefit.  If the full-time employment was lost, the part-time employment may in certain circumstances be treated as subsidiary employment and exempted for the purposes of qualifying for unemployment benefit.  I should also mention that part-time and casual workers may, subject to certain conditions, qualify for means tested unemployment assistance and have a proportion of part-time earnings disregarded in determining their entitlement.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment payments has always been based on the number of days of unemployment and any change in that regard would have fundamental consequences for the schemes.  Changes have been made in recent years to facilitate people in taking up part-time employment and there are no plans at present for any further changes in this legislation governing the schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department's Estimates for 1998 included an amount of £40 million to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus to the 715,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The long-term schemes comprise disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, disability allowance, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>The bonus payment amounts to 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum of £20.  It is payable to recipients of long-term social welfare payments and is therefore paid to those who are sick or disabled and in receipt of invalidity pension or disability allowance.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance at the short-term rate are not eligible.  The cost of paying the bonus to the 24,000 people in receipt of disability benefit for more than 12 months would be £1.5 million.  I have no plans at the present time to enable recipients of short-term schemes to qualify.</P>

      <P>Pay related social insurance contributions are made by employers, employees and the self employed.  The rate of PRSI contribution depends on the class of social insurance applicable which, in turn, determines the range of benefits and pensions to which contributors may, in due course, become entitled.</P>
      <P>The majority of PRSI contributors are in the industrial, commercial and services sectors. Employees in these sectors are covered by class A social insurance and pay full rate contributions. These contributors build up entitlement over time to the full range of benefits and pensions provided under the system, including invalidity pension and all other contributory pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Class H and class E contributors, consisting of enlisted personnel in the Defence Forces and certain ministers of religion respectively, are also covered for invalidity pension and all other contributory <Col N="734" /> pensions.  Self-employed contributors pay PRSI at class S and are covered for old age contributory pension and widow/er's contributory pension, but not for invalidity pension.  Contributors at PRSI classes B, C and D, mainly civil and public servants recruited before April 1995, are covered for widow/er's contributory pension only.</P>
    <P>Certain other employees, such as those earning less than £30 per week or under 16 years of age, are not covered for contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Persons who cease to become compulsory insured may opt to pay voluntary contributions at the appropriate rates.  These contributions provide the same level of contributory pension cover, excluding invalidity pension cover, in respect of which the contributor was insured while either an employee or a self-employed person.  Provisions also exist for the award, in certain circumstances, of credited contributions to persons in receipt of social welfare payments during periods such as illness or unemployment.  Credited contributions help maintain a former full rate contributor's social insurance cover when for reasons beyond their control they are unable to make the requisite contributions themselves.</P>

      <P>Irish nationality and citizenship legislation provides that persons born in Ireland are automatically Irish citizens.  The first person detailed by the Deputy is therefore an Irish citizen.

      <P>In general, there are three ways in which a person who is not a citizen of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship: by descent &mdash; foreign births registration, by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen &mdash; post-nuptial citizenship.</P>
      <P>The conditions governing the acquisition of Irish citizenship through the three methods mentioned above are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986 and, if the persons detailed are satisfied that they fulfil the criteria, it is open to them to make an application to my Department or to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was successful in the 1994 Garda recruitment competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission.  However, not-withstanding success in the commission selection process, the admission of persons as trainees to the Garda college is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The aforementioned regulations provide that the Garda Commissioner shall not admit a person as a trainee if he considers that the person is generally unsuitable.</P>

      <P>Arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement and Partnership 2000.  In order to calculate how much is due under Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
      <P>The pace of the work of payment has, however, been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making outstanding payments to retired teachers before Christmas.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due before Christmas, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers concerned.</P>
      <P>I should add that, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I am providing additional moneys in the current year to enable retired teachers to receive their December payment before Christmas.  The December pension payments in 1998, including arrears and payments on account of arrears, will be issued on 21 December.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that pupils benefit from an appropriately adapted and differentiated curriculum that matches their needs and abilities and builds on prior learning.  The development of the pupils' language and the teaching of pre-reading skills are part of that differentiation and of the essential groundwork at the early stages of learning and a considerable part of the success of future teaching and learning will build on those foundations.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum caters for the adaptation of teaching methods and lesson subject matter to pupils' abilities and levels of attainment. That differentiation is catered for up through the eight years of the primary school cycle and should imbue lesson content and teaching strategies at all class levels.  That flexibility will continue to be catered for when the revised primary school curriculum is introduced and curricular documentation will include a discrete manual on the issue of differentiation.  There are no plans, therefore, to extend the primary school cycle to nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strengthening of a differentiated delivery of the curriculum is part of the ongoing thrust of the in-career development of primary teachers and will receive a continuing emphasis through <Col N="745" /> the dissemination of information on the revised curriculum.</P>
    <P>The aims of the early start pre-school pilot project, which operates in 40 areas of disadvantage, reflect the issues raised by the Deputy and focus on the overall development of the children in the project centres and on the prevention of school failure.  The evaluation report on the project is under consideration in the Department.  It is expected that it will form a useful resource, together with the report on the forum on early childhood education, in work on the White Paper on early childhood education that has already commenced.  The White Paper will address the questions of provision of and access to preschooling and the important matter of targeting any provision at those children who are most in need of the service.</P>

However, due to delays beyond the control of my Department, the contractor did not begin on site until February 1998.  The preparation of tender documentation for the remainder of the roof was initiated by the Department immediately after the commencement of phase 1.</P>
      <P>The consultant architect was requested recently to proceed with the prequalification of contractors for this work.  It is my intention that this project will proceed to construction as soon as the tendering procedure is completed.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, a total of 67 schools, which would otherwise have been one teacher units, are operating as two teacher units as a consequence of my supportive initiatives for one teacher schools.</P>
      <P>For the moment I have sanctioned second teachers for one teacher schools which had an enrolment of 18 pupils or more as 30 September 1997.  Unfortunately, Ballymoney national school does not meet this requirement and I regret that I cannot sanction a second post in the school at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the context of considering staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1999-2000 school year I am examining a range of <Col N="747" /> options, with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.  The position of Ballymoney national school will be addressed in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The law on school attendance applies, and has always since its enactment applied, to schools which are not recognised primary schools.  The Deputy may be aware that a recent High Court judgment has raised serious issues about the applicability of the legislation generally.  The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an appeal by the State against that judgment early in the new year.</P>
      <P>Independently of any litigation, I have reviewed the school attendance legislation and the Government has approved proposals for new legislation.  A Bill is currently being drafted and I expect that it will be published early in 1999.  The Bill will provide for a comprehensive range of measures to address both the incidence and root causes of school attendance problems, including the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
