      <P>The insurance link scheme is a database compiled from information supplied by the commercial insurance companies and other subscribers to the scheme.  Many insurance companies, local authorities and some semi-State bodies are currently subscribing to the scheme, the aim of which is to reduce the number of fraudulent claims by allowing members to share information on previous claims.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor's Office is considering joining the scheme and has consulted with Departments to ascertain their views on the matter. Arising from this process, a number of legal issues need to be considered.  When this consideration is complete a decision will be made regarding membership of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not have any figures and am not too sure if the Department of Finance has any.  I have seen, as the Deputy would have, estimates by local authorities on this matter which are quite high.  It is a good scheme and as soon as the Chief State Solicitor's Office has gone through the process of consulting with Departments, it will probably join the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to congratulate John Hume and David Trimble on winning the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize.  It is a well deserved tribute to two of the principal architects of the British-Irish Agreement.  It will be a strong encouragement to the parties to work to ensure that the Agreement is consolidated, thus providing lasting peace, reconciliation and stability.</P>
      <P>I indicated in the House on 6 October that I had been meeting and liaising intensively with the parties and others, including Prime Minister Tony Blair, First Minister designate, David Trimble, Deputy First Minister designate, Seamus Mallon, SDLP leader, John Hume, Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams and Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam. I had a further very useful meeting on Friday, 9 October with a Sinn Féin delegation led by Martin McGuinness.  We discussed the current situation and how we can best achieve progress and I was encouraged by the depth of engagement in the discussions between Sinn Féin and the Independent Commission.  Since then I have continued to liaise closely with the relevant parties.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious of the difficulty we face on the issue of decommissioning.  What we need to do is to achieve a situation where there are common understandings and common ground. There must be confidence on all sides and we are working on that.  The people voted in overwhelming numbers for the British-Irish Agreement and we all have a duty, as public representatives, to deliver what the people voted for.  We must not allow the situation to fall behind.  For our part, the Government will continue to do everything it can to make progress in implementing the Agreement in all its aspects.  I believe that with a positive attitude on all sides this issue can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in reply to previous questions, I have been in regular contact with Prime Minister Blair. We are continuing our intensive contacts at all levels as we work to progress the implementation of the Agreement in all of its aspects.  I will meet with the Prime Minister at the European Council Meeting in Austria this weekend.  I will also meet with him when he visits Dublin before long, in <Col N="667" /> response to the invitation to address a joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is agreement across the House that it is totally unacceptable for any illegal organisation to have a massive store of arms.  I am sure the House and the Taoiseach will agree that it would be too late after &mdash; God forbid &mdash; another incident such as that in Omagh for us to become exercised about the issue of decommissioning. It is vital to the process that a start is made to the decommissioning process.  Did the Taoiseach raise with Sinn Féin the question of a starting date and a timetable for decommissioning as he has indicated is his view of how the process should take place?  Has the Taoiseach discussed with the British Prime Minister his meetings with David Trimble and Martin McGuinness?  What progress was made as a result of these discussions and the Taoiseach's discussions, if any, with the British Prime Minister? I conclude by joining with the Taoiseach in congratulating John Hume and David Trimble on their well deserved success in achieving the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  I discussed the issue of decommissioning with the Sinn Féin leader.  As I always do at these meetings, I emphasised that decommissioning is part of the British-Irish Agreement. All the parties involved have affirmed their commitment to the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations.  The terms of the Agreement are very clear.  All the participants confirmed their intention to work constructively and in good faith with the independent commission and to use any influence they may have to achieve decommissioning of paramilitary arms within two years. This is important.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, confidence in the process is an issue.  The necessary confidence will be built through the implementation of the Agreement. Good faith must be demonstrated by everybody. There is a need to ensure confidence, trust and progress from all the parties and to move on this issue.</P>
      <P>In terms of discussing timetables with Sinn Féin, the Deputy is aware that the answer to that question is that Sinn Féin does not have any arms to decommission.  However, I hope it has the ability to use its influence on the Provisional IRA to involve itself in decommissioning.  Another aspect is that others who have arms stated recently that they will not decommission.  Statements were made on this by Mr. Billy Hutchinson at the PUP conference.  This is another problem.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the British Prime Minister prior to the weekend before he met Mr. Martin McGuinness and Mr. David Trimble.  I also spoke to the Prime Minister today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the distinction is that the loyalist parties do not <Col N="668" /> expect and are not entitled to a place on the executive whereas Sinn Féin expects and, on the basis of the figures, is entitled to a place?  Does he agree that the risks to the Agreement at present are enormous?  On the decommissioning issue, the possibility is that the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party will lose the support of his party if he accepts Sinn Féin's membership of the executive without a compromise on this issue. Does the Taoiseach agree that, at the very least, a declaration of intent by the republican movement to disarm would be a step forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction only exists in terms of the executive.  The PUP is also committed under the terms of the Agreement to decommissioning within two years.  It is a more urgent issue in terms of membership of the executive and it is creating difficulty at present.</P>
      <P>The position is extremely difficult.  As I stated previously, I understand both sides of the argument. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and I have been trying to encourage the parties to move to the centre and to reach some solid ground on which we can make progress.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Sinn Féin is asked to do all it can within two years to ensure that decommissioning takes place.  It was not meant to be a precondition for its entry to the executive.  This is the first difficulty. If decommissioning is made a precondition, a bad faith issue will arise.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Mr. David Trimble as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and also as First Minister designate has made a commitment to his colleagues to achieve the beginning of a process of decommissioning before he moves.  This is a major problem for him.  The Agreement was sold on the basis of various pronouncements and 71 per cent of people voted in favour of it.  This leads people to the conclusion that his room for manoeuvre is limited.  I also understand that position. It requires both groups to move.  We are endeavouring to get them to act in good faith with the International Commission on Decommissioning and to strictly follow the terms of the Agreement.  I discussed this with Martin McGuinness.  There is real engagement between Mr. McGuinness, as Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, and General de Chastelain in trying to move this issue forward.  That will take some time and create undue delays which are not acceptable either.  We have to try to find a compromise. There is no easy or obvious answer but we have to continue to try to find a solution.  This solution must satisfy the requirements of the British-Irish Agreement that the executive and the North-South ministerial body are set up and that there is a real intent to achieve decommissioning.</P>
      <P>I answered the last point made by Deputy De Rossa a fortnight ago.  A statement of commitment by the republican movement would be immensely helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>In accepting that we all have responsibilities to ensure the implementation <Col N="669" /> of the British-Irish Agreement, does the Taoiseach acknowledge the special role and responsibility of David Trimble as First Minister in ensuring the essential elements of the Agreement &mdash; the executive and the all-Ireland ministerial council &mdash; are established without delay? Does he also agree the first and foremost constituency to which David Trimble must answer as First Minister is the overwhelming number of people who voted for the Agreement?</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach meets the British Prime Minister, will he raise the grave concern in the nationalist community and among human rights groups, including the Centre for Human Rights and the Committee for the Administration of Justice, at the presence of a serving RUC inspector on the staff of the Patten commission on policing? Is this not also a matter of concern to the Irish Government given the dissatisfaction expressed in this House at the make up of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government has already raised the issue of the Patten commission and asked for explanations on the role of the individual. The British Government and the Northern Ireland Office sees this individual as assisting the commission in gaining access to the views of the RUC.  We have made our views known on this issue.</P>
      <P>I am aware of everyone's responsibilities under the Agreement.  However, I am also aware of people's limitations.  It would be nice if people did not have such limitations.  David Trimble has limitations on this issue.  He cannot move without progress on other issues.  I pointed out to the Deputy some weeks ago that it is difficult to solve the decommissioning issue.  Sinn Féin has given a commitment to honour the Agreement and stated it will do all it can to convince the IRA to decommission its weapons over the two year period.  On the other hand, the IRA stated in April and September that it had no intention of decommissioning its weapons.  A clear statement from the republican movement would make it easier to make the argument.  I accept Sinn Féin is doing its best to achieve decommissioning within two years.  I discussed this issue with most of the Sinn Féin leadership and I accept their position. However, the IRA is saying there will be no movement.  This makes the situation very difficult for David Trimble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the Taoiseach's responses and the basis for them, he has not addressed the questions I put to him about where the primary responsibility lies regarding the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement and the position of David Trimble as First Minister.  As a Westminster spokesperson stated yesterday, there is an approaching deadline, not a target date.  Everyone who can impact on this situation has an absolute responsibility to ensure that what is intended from the Agreement is delivered within the specified timeframe. Responsibility for this issue rests in the first <Col N="670" /> instance with the First Minister and, while we are all endeavouring to play our part and face up to our collective responsibilities, I appeal to the Taoiseach, and the Government, to play their part in ensuring that the 31 October deadline is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agreement states we must move towards the setting up of the Executive and the North-South ministerial bodies by 31 October.  The Government is doing all it can to achieve that.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that Mr. Trimble is faced with practical difficulties. The First Minister is aware of his responsibilities; both I and the British Prime Minister outlined them to him on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore the comments which have been made in recent months and the commitments which have been given as those are political realities.  Neither can we ignore the intense preparatory work which has taken place on the North/South Ministerial Council, including the establishment of the implementation bodies.  We have moved a long way on that with the UUP and the SDLP working together satisfactorily. Discussions have been held with all of the parties, including Sinn Féin.  The process of prisoner releases is well under way.  Last week the release of a large number of prisoners was met with little comment although many had been involved in very serious crimes over the years.  Security installations and checkpoints are being dismantled and troops and military patrols are being withdrawn from many parts of the North.  Progress has been made in regard to the Agreement's provision on the Irish language and on the measures to promote reconciliation and agreement.  The victims' commission and the policing commission are also up and running.  I made it absolutely clear that decommissioning was not a precondition. However, whether we like it or not, the reality is that we must make some progress on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach feel it is somewhat unhelpful to have certain parties lecturing across the divide at others when all parties have obligations to fulfil under the Agreement? Does he agree that while the Agreement does not specify a start date on decommissioning, a timeframe of two years is specified and that implicit in that is the expectation there would be early movement on the matter?  What compromise is the Taoiseach advocating?  Is he seeking simultaneous movement on this issue with the establishment of an executive?  Is that the position the Government is advocating in these delicate negotiations and, if so, will the Taoiseach elaborate on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is good faith in a number of things.  Certainly there is good faith on the active participation of parties in working with the international commission on decommissioning. There is very useful work being done in this area. Work and action must be moved to a certain <Col N="671" /> stage, allowing a very quick setting up of the executive and the North-South ministerial bodies. We should not allow things to drift on unnecessarily. We are into the seventh month of the Agreement and the issue must be dealt with.  I know what is not possible and I hope I know what is possible.  There must be a meeting of minds and trust on these issues.</P>
      <P>A difficulty with many of these negotiations is that people would perhaps make a move in some direction if they knew that in doing so they would not be stalled again and asked to make another move, something which continually happens with these negotiations.  Sometimes a jump might be useful rather than taking small steps.  In this case at least one jump might be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply on the positive impact of a declaration of intent by the republican movement with regard decommissioning.  Does he agree that the Agreement was achieved through compromise on all sides; that there were no winners; that in the current situation no side can be seen to win out; that there must be compromise and that each side must lose in a balanced way some element of their position?  Does he agree that, therefore, acceptance by the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Trimble, of a declaration of intent without actual decommissioning would be a compromise for him and that a declaration of intent without actual decommissioning by the IRA would be a compromise for the republican movement and that this would be the most balanced way to achieve agreement by 31 October?  Will he indicate how we have reached a position where in the course of negotiations Sinn Féin claimed to be in a position to speak authoritatively on behalf of the republican movement but is now adopting the position that it is only speaking for itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Agreement Sinn Féin is asked to used its best efforts and endeavours to persuade those who have arms to decommission them within the two year period.  I believe Sinn Féin is and will continue to do this under the international commission on decommissioning. The early negotiations between Sinn Féin's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, and General John de Chastelain have been positive and constructive, something I am aware of from reports from both sides.</P>
      <P>The compromise suggested by the Deputy is one of the issues: the question is whether it would work on both sides.  I have no information suggesting the republican movement would give a declaration of intent on the matter or whether Mr. David Trimble, as leader of the UUP, would accept such a declaration as going far enough.  We must very quickly &mdash; we have been discussing this for weeks on end &mdash; see if we can move the various arguments to a stage where everybody moves a bit.  The Deputy is correct in saying that compromise and understanding is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> We know what the Agreement states &mdash; there is no argument about this.  It is absolutely clear that decommissioning is not a commitment.  The reality of the situation is what is relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is disingenuous to suggest or imply that Sinn Féin, which had a direct role in negotiating the release of IRA prisoners, does not have a role in negotiating the release of IRA arms?  He has indicated that decommissioning is not a precondition.  However, he has also publicly stated that a starting date for the commencement of decommissioning should be indicated.  If decommissioning must take place over a two year period, there must be a starting day for the process.  Did the Taoiseach specifically raise the question of a starting date for decommissioning during his recent meetings with Sinn Féin and, if so, what response did he get?  Has he explored the possibility of the Red Cross playing a role that would complement that played by General de Chastelain, given that the Oireachtas recently passed the Geneva Convention Act, 1998, which gives the Red Cross a statutory role in the collection of arms in such circumstances? What indication did the British Prime Minister give the Taoiseach of his view on the progress that has been made in this area following his meetings with David Trimble and Martin McGuinnes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's third question, I did not receive much indication in that regard.  In regard to what I stated about Sinn Féin, the terms of the British-Irish Agreement are clear.  It calls on all parties involved to confirm their commitment &mdash; which they have done &mdash; to the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations. In terms of my discussions with Sinn Féin on this issue, Martin McGuinness reiterated his party's commitment to honour the terms of the Agreement and to work through that with General de Chastelain and his team, who were assigned to deal with this issue under the Agreement. I do not see a role for the Red Cross or any other body in this area.  The International Commission on Decommissioning, which was set up under an international agreement has all the necessary international expertise and clout to deal with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The EU Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission will have an informal meeting in Pörtschach in Austria on 24-25 October.  Given the nature of the meeting, no formal decisions will be taken and no written conclusions will be issued.</P>
      <P>In preparation for this meeting, I met Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima on 12 October in Government Buildings.  The meeting took place as part of the Chancellor's tour of capitals in advance of Pörtschach, and was preceded by an official level meeting on Wednesday, 30 September.</P>
      <P>The subjects for discussion for Pörtschach have not yet been finally identified.  My discussions with the Federal Chancellor focused on the issues identified in the Cardiff Conclusions which included subsidiarity and democratic legitimacy, institutional issues, the role and proposed reform of the General Affairs Council, and the appointment of a high representative for common foreign and security policy.  Those issues have been discussed at recent meetings of the Ministers and Secretaries General group.  In addition, the Chancellor indicated that a number of essentially forward looking questions would be addressed at Pörtschach.  Among these are the economic role which Europe should play in a global economy and consideration of how best the Union can be represented externally, including the mechanisms available to co-ordinate policy in this area.</P>
      <P>In terms of specific priorities, I highlighted to Chancellor Klima Ireland's fundamental concern that every member state should retain the right to nominate a full member of the Commission, a principle which was respected at Amsterdam but which will undoubtedly come up again.  I will also be attentive to ensuring that whatever changes &mdash; procedural or administrative &mdash; which are suggested are examined with a view to maintaining the rights and interests of smaller member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met EU Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies in Cork on Friday, 16 October.  We had a very useful meeting which covered Agenda 2000 and the timetable for the completion of negotiations. I emphasised Ireland's strong case for generous transition arrangements and the need to continue a targeted approach in the areas of social inclusion and infrastructure.  The Commissioner confirmed our understanding that regionalisation is an internal issue for Ireland.  While it is open to the Government to decide whether to make a case for regionalisation, ultimately Eurostat will <Col N="675" /> decide whether any regions specified are acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the statement issued by the Combat Poverty Agency on 29 September in which it warned against proposals to prioritise selected counties for Objective One status?  Is he further aware that a report on poor households and spatial distribution of poverty in Ireland shows that there is poverty in every county and that the Combat Poverty Agency, whose role is to advise Government on poverty issues, strongly advises against a two region strategy, which appears to be favoured by the Government currently?  Have the statements and submission by the CPA and the report I referred to earlier been taken into account during current Government consideration of this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read large sections of the report and it will be taken into account in the Government's deliberations on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>What role has Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in the decision-making process? Will the Taoiseach confirm that she has no role in the designation of regions for Objective One status?  Will he also confirm that should the west, midland and Border counties not receive Objective One status, this would restrict the amount of grant aid which the State could give them for industrial and tourism projects?  Following a statement in the House last week by the Minister for Finance and a statement by some of his officials at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs will the Taoiseach confirm that the country as a whole will be a net beneficiary and receive increased Structural Funds through regionalisation compared to transitional status for the entire country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While the questions do not strictly deal with regionalisation, all of the cases referred to by the Deputy are correct.  The country would be a net beneficiary and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies does not make the decisions.  We will make the decision to go for regionalisation. Eurostat picks the region because it is based on a statistical fact and the definition it uses of GDP, not one which we would put on it.  The question regarding resources and how they would be divided is correct.  My discussions with the Commissioner were very much on the Agenda 2000 package which is her responsibility.  Her role is to hold such discussions over the next six months or so.  She reiterated her desire, which we strongly support, that the discussions should be concluded by Easter and should be discussed in detail at the Vienna Summit in mid-December 1999.</P>

      <P>The summit has been called to explore, among other things, ways to engage the public more imaginatively in the process of European <Col N="676" /> integration.  What ideas will the Taoiseach put forward?  Will he support the recommendation of the Delors group that each of the major groups in the European Parliament put forward its nominee for President of the European Commission in advance of the European Parliament elections to allow the public indicate its preferred party and thus give a mandate to the candidate of its choice for President of the European Commission? Did the Taoiseach raise with the Austrian Chancellor the recent change in immigration policy announced by the Austrian Government and discuss with him our immigration policy?  Did he discuss with the Austrian Chancellor the Austrian experience in Partnership for Peace and the reasons Ireland has not joined?  Did he discuss with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies his view that urban Ireland requires a special initiative, whether it be an URBAN II initiative, an extension of the local development partnership concept, territorial pacts or a specific project for urban villages such as Inchicore and Crumlin, to be pursued jointly by the Government and the European Union and, if so, what was the response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues to be discussed at the Vienna summit will be further considered this week.  It is unlikely much progress will be made on the institutional issue raised by the Deputy. There is no great demand for change.  How the General Affairs Council operates and how its time has been taken up exclusively by security issues will be discussed.  Issues which were not concluded in Amsterdam, including voting rights and the right of each member state to have its own commissioner, will not be reopened until the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified by all member states, probably in the middle of next year. There was an attempt to have them reopened. The Chancellor is anxious to reduce the number of Councils from 21 to 14 or 15.  That will be discussed with the effectiveness of the various institutions. While I did not discuss immigration policy with the Chancellor we did discuss the Partnership for Peace initiative.  He sent one of his senior officials here to discuss his vision of the way neutral countries should operate.  He has put forward proposals which we are prepared to consider.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Commissioner, I restated my belief that urban blackspots must be dealt with effectively in whatever arrangements are put in place, whether that is through the Exchequer, European funds, URBAN or Structural Funds. Urban blackspots are the among the most difficult parts of the country and they must be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the view of the Combat Poverty Agency that Structural Funds expenditure to tackle poverty and social exclusion is needed in all regions of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said a two region as against a <Col N="677" /> one region strategy would result in a net benefit to the country.  Will he indicate if the additional funding he envisages being available must be spent only in the 13 western, midland and Border counties?  Furthermore, has any study been carried out, on a fund by fund basis, of the advantages and disadvantages of a two region as opposed to a one region strategy?</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Finance told a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs last week that they had carried out no such study.  If no study was carried out, how can we opt for a two region strategy and claim it will yield a net benefit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance put forward a memorandum.  No outside study was carried out but the memorandum on the pros and cons of the strategy was compiled on the basis of its vast experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask if an outside study had been carried out.  I asked if the Department of Finance had carried out a study.  The officials told the committee it had not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The officials carried out an analysis of the situation.  They might not consider it a study, but it was an extremely useful memorandum.</P>
      <P>Until we see the calculations in the negotiations of the figures involved, I cannot say how much additional expenditure will be available. There will be additional expenditure.  The Deputy asked whether in a regionalised system moneys would be spent in the areas that were Objective One in transition or in the regionalised areas.  I assume they will be spent in the regionalised areas.  However, these questions cannot be answered fully prior to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa is extremely concerned about the Structural Funds but the issue is whether there will be expenditure.  Of the £11 billion spent on social expenditure, only a small percentage is co-financed.  The important issue, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, is to ensure the resources are spent in areas of disadvantage, areas we are anxious to include in society.</P>
      <P>One way or the other, this country will experience a diminution of European funds in all sectors. That is already happening.  Ireland is no longer using vast amounts of Structural Funds on social policy.  The aim is to ensure there will be programmes of expenditure to deal with the problems in areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>For a number of years we have had the benefit of European Social Funds and we will continue to have them in the next round.  In addition, in transition in the next round either the entire country or the areas which would not qualify for Objective One status in the long term will have co-financed programmes.  What happens after 2006 is an issue for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's discussions with the Commissioner about State aid strategies for urban deprived areas, did he raise the issue of whether the approaches advocated by the Taoiseach will be constrained by State aid rules?  This is important in view of having today learned the plans for the Dublin Docklands have been provisionally rejected by the Commission on the basis of those rules.  Does the Taoiseach agree this significantly undermines his strategy?  The docklands are among the most deprived areas of the north inner city.  Does that not imply that he will be severely restricted in the State aid he can give to deprived areas and that he will not be able to take significant economic action to improve those areas?</P>

      <P>Yes, they are.  I correct the Deputy regarding the discussions in Europe, which are ongoing.  The cases have not been closed, as reported in today's media.</P>
      <P>If the country remains a single status region and the entire country is Objective One in transition, no part of the country will be able to use the more advanced State aids.  This is one of the issues the Government has been deliberating.  If the country is regionalised, the areas in Objective One in transition would not be able to use the higher State aids but the other areas would.  That case has been strongly made by the Border region, which has not had the benefit of investment for 40 or 50 years, and this is part of the consideration being made.</P>

When does the Taoiseach hope to make that decision?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that without Objective One status, the west, midlands and Border areas would be seriously inhibited regarding Government investment to attract industry to those regions?  Those regions need that industrial investment if they do not have Objective One status.  Also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How can the Government make a decision on a one region or two regions strategy if a fund by fund analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, both financial and social, has not been made either by the Department of Finance or the Department of Enterprise and Employment? There seems to be a conflict between what the Taoiseach is saying today and what the Department of Finance told the Joint Committee on Social Affairs last week.  If the Taoiseach claims that there will be a net financial benefit to the Exchequer as a whole, what is the magnitude of that benefit?  Is it £5 million, £10 million or, as has been suggested in some quarters, as little as £20 million over the period from the year 2000?</P>

      <Quest>his views on the increase in juvenile crime by 5.5 per cent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1997 some 15,075 referrals were made to the National Juvenile Office, which represents an increase of 5.5 per cent &mdash; 790 referrals &mdash; on the previous year.  It would be unsafe to assume, however, that an increase in the number of referrals is matched by a corresponding increase in the number of crimes committed by juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that there was an increase in the overall detection rate for indictable crime in 1997 and it is not surprising, against that background, that there would be an increase in the number of referrals to the juvenile diversion scheme.  This is not to suggest that there are grounds for complacency in regard to the incidence <Col N="681" /> of juvenile crime but simply that statistics for referrals need to be treated with caution as indicators of the changing level of juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>The increase in detections may be attributed to the Government policy of greater enforcement of legislation such as that relating to public order offences and alcohol-related offences.  If one examines the offence of intoxication in public, for example, the number of referrals in 1997 increased by 491 from the previous year.  It must also be remembered that greater enforcement of this type of legislation will show a greater detection rate in relation to young people compared to adults as offences such as public order and drink-related offences are primarily committed by young people and, in some cases, can only be committed by young people &mdash; for example underage drinking.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to brief the House on other initiatives in the area of juvenile crime.  The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, announced on 22 July this year that the Government had decided to establish an expert working group to inquire into the increasing number of children &mdash; approximately 100 per week &mdash; coming before the Children's Court.</P>
    <P>The group is examining intervention and prevention strategies as a means of keeping children out of the courts; the reason there appears to be an increase in the numbers of children coming before the courts; the behavioural patterns of children coming before the courts in the lead-up to a court appearance; the present non-custodial options open to the courts when dealing with children; and best practice models in existence in this country and in a number of other countries where community sanctions are in place.  The group is also in the process of commissioning research into the numbers and profile of juveniles appearing before the Children's Court.</P>
    <P>A key priority in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium is the enactment of comprehensive juvenile justice legislation, and to that end the Government approved the restoration of the Children Bill, 1996, to the Dáil Order Paper on Committee Stage.  The Bill is currently being examined with a view to bringing forward Committee Stage amendments.  It would be wrong to view the Children Bill in isolation from crime preventative measures provided for in the Child Care Act, 1991, and in the Department of Education and Science's schemes and plans for legislation aimed at tackling the problem of truancy.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently funding 14 community-based youth diversion projects.  The projects are located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dundalk.  They are targeted at specific large, high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities.  The annual cost of funding these projects is in the region of £800,000 and proposals for a number of further projects are under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> In addition, the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department is involved in and runs a number of community-based projects which cater for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime. These projects include workshops and day centres where offenders are provided with training in a number of skills.  The purpose is to address offending behaviour, reduce recidivism and assist such persons in gaining employment.</P>
    <P>There are other schemes on which I can provide details if the Deputies wish me to do so, but there is one which I would like to mention in particular because I consider it to be of importance in tackling the problem of underage drinking.  I previously indicated to the House in response to parliamentary questions that I have arranged for the introduction of a voluntary age card scheme on the basis of provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The necessary regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation and will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that projects directed at young people at risk, which come under the aegis of agencies for which I have responsibility, are but a part of the Government's overall programme to tackle social exclusion and drugs.  The Taoiseach announced in January that the Government has decided on a programme for young people at risk.  The centrepiece of the programme is a young people's facilities and services fund of £30 million to be provided over the next three years to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas.  At least £20 million will be targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  The new fund is in addition to the £10 million provided in the current year to implement the plans of the local drugs task forces and the £13 million provided for youth services.  The allocations from the fund will be made by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the report of the National Crime Forum, to be published shortly, deals in depth with the issue of young people and crime.  I welcome the Opposition's interest in this subject, as evidenced by yesterday's media coverage, but as far as I am aware it did not make any submission to the crime forum on the matter.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Does the Minister agree the situation is serious, given that Superintendent Joe Dowling is quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as being extremely concerned at the increase in juvenile crime?  A 5.5 per cent increase on last year has been shown in the Garda report.  Some 15,000 youngsters were referred to the Garda National Juvenile Agency.  The age threshold is decreasing.  Ten per cent of juvenile offenders are 17 years old, 44 per cent are 15 years old and 25 per cent, one in every four, is between ten and 13 years.  Before they have entered their teens, they are on their way to a life of criminality.  These people feel society has abandoned them, or they have abandoned society or education has abandoned them.  Is the Minister working with the</P>

      <P>It is unsafe to make the assumptions Deputy Higgins continues to make about juvenile crime.  Crime figures are decreasing and the overall crime rate has decreased significantly. This trend continues as Government policies continue to hit home.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet subcommittee is assessing in an integrated and comprehensive manner the needs of young people in the disadvantaged areas referred to by Deputy Higgins.  Initiatives are now being taken to address different aspects of these needs, including measures to counter early school leaving and to provide for children at risk and for their families.  To underline the importance of a co-ordinated approach, the Government appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in addition to the Department of Health and Children.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Given the Minister acknowledges that 54 per cent of the offences are alcohol related and just as society in the 1950s was dominated by the scourge of TB, does he agree that underage alcohol consumption is the scourge of the 1990s and that there is an urgent need to tackle the problem head on?  Does he agree there is an immediate need to implement sections 40 and 41 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, which provides for an identity card scheme? There is an urgent need to introduce a national barcoded identity card scheme administered by the Garda Síochána which would be foolproof and would have to be produced in a public house to prove one is over 18 and entitled to drink.  Why have these two sections not been invoked?  Given these figures and that so much misery has been caused by teenage drinking &mdash; suicides, deaths, slaughter on the road, drop out from work and education, why is the sensible thing not done and the two sections implemented?</P>

      <P>I have taken particular interest in the issue of missing persons, and am concerned to do all I can to ensure the Garda Síochána has effective arrangements and the necessary resources to trace those reported missing.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will welcome the Garda Commissioner's recent decision to appoint a group with overall responsibility to review a specific number of these complex cases.  The group consists of an Assistant Commissioner, a superintendent, an inspector, two detective sergeants and two detective gardaí, and is based at Naas Garda station.  The group was set up to re-examine the original investigations of six unsolved cases of missing women, and will initially examine the cases of Annie McCarrick, Jo Jo Dullard, Fiona Pender, Ciara Breen, Fiona Sinnot and Deirdre Jacob.  None of the officers involved will be reviewing cases on which they worked in the original investigations.  They are all members of An Garda Síochána and have all the legal and investigative powers which that entails.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities continuously review the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases and, following a review of police work practices in other countries, several improvements were made earlier this year.  In the area of information technology, a database is being developed within PULSE, the Garda information system, to allow for cross referencing, linkages and analysis in dealing with missing persons cases and unidentified bodies countrywide.  This should be in place early next year.  The Garda information technology section is also developing a web site on the Internet.  More detailed and elaborate procedures were introduced earlier in the year involving the completion of more detailed forms when missing persons are first reported, and more stringent guidelines have also been introduced in dealing with missing persons cases.  The Garda also nominated liaison officers to keep the relatives of missing persons informed of progress and a juvenile liaison officer is also involved where the missing person is under 18.</P>
      <P>While overall statistics are no consolation to those involved or their families, the Irish situation with regard to missing persons compares favourably with international standards.  In 1997, the last year for which figures are available, 1,877 &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; missing persons were reported to the Garda. Of these, six remained missing at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Regarding resources being made available to the Garda, while I do not believe it to be a difficulty, if it should transpire additional resources are required, they will be made available.</P>

      <P>A total of 72 gardaí and retired members of the force have lodged claims for hearing loss against the State since 1982.  A <Col N="686" /> significant proportion of these &mdash; 53 out of the 72 &mdash; were lodged in the past two years.  Eight cases have been settled to date.  One of the cases related to a single incident where mortars, found in a bunker, were being detonated.  The remainder relate to claims from members who underwent firearms training and practice some time ago.  These cases have been settled at an average cost of £32,000.</P>
      <P>Gardaí are not exposed to gunfire to the same extent as soldiers.  Only members of special units would have any appreciable exposure to gunfire and their exposure would be low compared to soldiers in the Army.  Estimates of the risk of damage to hearing are generally based on average exposure over periods of weeks and years.  Recent reports commissioned by the Garda indicate that the necessary hearing protection is in existence to protect against the possibility of hearing loss to members of the force who would be exposed to noise.  It complies with legislation concerning the protection of workers from the risk related to exposure to noise at work.  The requirement for gardaí to wear adequate protection when undergoing firearms training has been rigidly enforced since the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>While the scale of the problem is not comparable to the situation in the Defence Forces nevertheless, officials in my Department have been in discussions with the Garda Síochána, the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Department of Defence on the issue.  The problem is being monitored very carefully and arrangements are in place to ensure that every claim is thoroughly investigated.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister agree that the amount of training in and day to day use of fire-arms by members of the Garda is far less than that of soldiers in view of the fact that they are not using artillery?  Will he agree that, based on the fact that the High Court decided some time ago that a 2 per cent hearing loss entitled one to £30,000 and that the average figure for Army deafness claims seems to be working out at £34,000, given that there have been 72 claims to date, one is talking about in the region of £2.5 million, in addition to legal costs if these cases are found to be valid?  Has he ascertained if those members making claims are current members or former members?  Were they members before 1983 when mandatory wearing of hearing protection was introduced for the Garda?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the potential cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of £32,000 per claim.  This would give a total liability in respect of the 64 outstanding cases in the order of £2 million.  That of course would be based on the average cost of past settlements.  I am not for one moment suggesting that the State has a liability in respect of the 64 outstanding cases. Indeed, today the plaintiff in a contested case withdrew a claim against the Department.  Liability generally is not something which will be conceded <Col N="687" /> easily.  Each case will be thoroughly investigated. I assure the House that there can and will be no question of any individual being successful without his claim having received a thorough and detailed investigation by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The scale of claims by both retired and serving members of the force is minuscule compared to the number of cases lodged by members of the Army.  For that reason there is no necessity to establish a tribunal.</P>

I can only express the hope that the gardaí, Deputy Higgins and I, in this context, are singing from the same charge sheet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.  I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase, notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources to the board.  I am circulating in the Official Report a comparison of waiting times at the board's law centres as at June 1997 and September 1998.</P>
      <P>The increase in waiting times at the board's law centres is attributable to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996. In the calendar year 1997, the Legal Aid Board provided legal services to 13,805 people.  The number of legal aid cases requiring representation in court increased from 4,460 to 6,021, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year. This was the seventh successive year in which there was an increase in the level of service provided by the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.  For example, 165 <Col N="688" /> of the 910 appointments offered in law centres in September 1998 were for priority matters.  None of those accorded priority was put on waiting lists.  In the Dublin area, 122 appointments were offered through the private practitioner scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and when, for whatever reason, they become excessive, appropriate remedial action is taken where possible.  The board has a number of vacancies for solicitor staff.  I am advised that a competition for the recruitment of solicitors for its law centres was held recently and a number of appointments will be made shortly.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely and I will give the board every assistance in dealing with problems.</P>
    <P>On 25 June 1998 when responding to a Priority Question by Deputy O'Sullivan concerning waiting times I said that I was optimistic that further resources would be secured for the Legal Aid Board to enable it to meet with the ever increasing demands on its services.  Subsequently in July 1998 I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board.  Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for the law centres.  In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff in the law centres, three relief solicitors and three clerical officers, and the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.  I am confident that these additional staff will be allocated by the Legal Aid Board in such a manner as to make the greatest impact on waiting times at the board's law centres.</P>

      <P>The purpose of free legal aid is that people should have access to justice in a reasonable time irrespective of their ability to pay.  Since I last tabled a question on this area, which was answered on 25 June, there seems to be no great improvement in the situation.  Have any of the law centres' waiting times improved since April 1998, the last time for which we were given figures?  If they have disimproved, to what extent have they disimproved?</P>
      <P>In the worst case, the South Mall in Cork, which had a waiting time of fourteen and a half months, has the waiting time improved since April 1998, the last time for which we received figures?  The Minister indicated in his response on 25 June that he had met with the chairman and chief executive of the Legal Aid Board in the previous week and that he hoped there would be a positive announcement in the near future.</P>

      <P>I undertook to have this matter examined.  On 25 June when I responded to a Priority Question by the Deputy concerning waiting times I said that I was optimistic that further resources would be secured for the Legal Aid Board to enable it to meet with the ever-increasing demands on its services.  In July 1998, I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board.  Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for the law centres.  In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff in the law centres, three relief solicitors and three clerical officers, and the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.  I am confident that these additional staff will be allocated by the Legal Aid Board in such a manner as to make the greatest impact on waiting times at the board's law centres.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing with the law centres to try to reduce the waiting periods.  I anticipate considerable improvements given that offers of appointments have been made recently to 15 applicants for positions as solicitors with the Legal Aid Board.  The positions to be filled include five posts recently sanctioned, seven existing vacancies and three temporary positions which I recently made permanent.  The board has also requested clerical and executive grade staff from the Civil Service Commission.  No appointments have been made to date in respect of these grades but I hope the applications received will be successful.  We have made some progress since the Deputy last raised this matter.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister agree that privacy is a fundamental right in any democratic society and it must be protected?  The Law Reform Commission report is quite detailed in terms of its determination that there is a huge intrusion on privacy, by virtue of the range of devices which enable persons to spy at long distances on the most intimate domestic situations as well as commercial activities.  There is an urgent need for legislation.  The right to privacy is enshrined in the Constitution as a principle but there is a huge gap between enforcement and practice.  There is an urgent need to introduce legislation.  Is the Minister aware that the heads of the Bill are contained in the Law Reform Commission report and therefore it is on a conveyor belt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that life were so easy. While the heads of the Bill may well be contained in the Law Reform Commission report, it will require a great deal of detailed study by officials of my Department and by the parliamentary draftsman.  There are legal provisions relating to surveillance.  The Non Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, provides statutory protection against harassment by another person, by virtue of persistent watching, pestering or communication. The common law offence of breach of the peace might provide limited protection against surveillance.  The common law offence of eavesdropping is a form of common or public nuisance. The Data Protection Act, 1988, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and the broadcasting and telecommunications legislation are relevant.  I do not pretend or try to convey the impression that the legislation referred to can be put forward as an answer to the need for protection from surveillance, which Deputy Higgins correctly identifies <Col N="691" /> as being a problem.  To illustrate that privacy of individuals receives some protection, in the final analysis new legislation will be required to deal with this problem.  The difficulty I have in the Department is that several Bills are listed for drafting so that I cannot give a timescale as to when legislation, along the lines of the Law Reform Commission's report, will be forthcoming.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister agree the figures for 1996 and 1997 represent a considerable increase over previous years and are the highest since the mid 1980s?  Does he see any merit in making it obligatory on new car manufacturers to fit each car with an immobiliser?  In this day and age when we are able to put in all kinds of safeguards, for example pin numbers for mobile phones, and draw money from automatic banking machines, it should be possible to install an automatic device in the steering column of a car which would be wired to the engine and would automatically immobilise it.  This would bring an end to joyriding in new cars.  It would filter through the system and would soon apply to all cars.  Does he see any merit in discussing this matter with his fellow Minister or Ministers and having it applied on a European level, as a standard in the same way that seatbelts are now standard equipment in cars?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not profess to be an expert on immobilisers.  If that were to be of assistance I would actively encourage it. We still have a serious problem in some communities in respect of joyriding.  It is one manifestation of the disorderly and criminal tendencies <Col N="692" /> of a small minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds where disadvantage is a common factor.  A number of measures are required to tackle this problem.  It needs to be tackled from the law enforcement perspective. We require initiatives which reduce the tendency towards wrongdoing in the first instance.  All of these approaches have a validity and are worth pursuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister information on the people who engage in this activity and what initiatives is he introducing to deal with the problem of unauthorised takings of vehicles?  If my estimate is correct, 500 cars per week are being stolen.  This is an indication of an enormous problem and one which would benefit from initiatives from the preventive wing of the Department.</P>

      <P>Those concerned are young people from a background of disadvantage.  My Department is funding 14 juvenile diversion projects in large urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  The purpose of these projects is to help young people to divert from crime.  These projects are proving very successful and have the support of local communities.  My Department and the Garda Síochána will continue to co-operate with the communities in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a statistical question, but if one deducts the number of vehicles stolen, and not define that as constituting joyriding, from the amount of unauthorised takings, one would come fairly close to the figure.  It is not possible to give the precise statistics without adequate notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Garda powers to seize motor vehicles pursuant to section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, there are a considerable number of hefty sanctions available to the courts, depending on the gravity of the offence.  The theft of a motor vehicle would constitute one offence, whereas the use of a motor car to commit another crime would constitute a second offence, and so on.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the sanctions that are available; I do not believe that is the difficulty.  The stinger gardaí use intermittently, where appropriate and having regard for public safety, is proving very effective and I am sure it will continue to do so.  The provision of a helicopter to the Garda Síochána has been of enormous benefit.  I anticipate the greater use of a Garda helicopter will over time prove extremely successful in preventing the unlawful or unauthorised taking of motor vehicles because it will be in a position to identify the motor vehicle on the ground and to engage in pursuit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to increase resources to the Garda for extra four wheel patrol vehicles?  They have proved a major asset to the gardaí in traffic, at checkpoints, etc., and in tracing stolen vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>Earlier this year the Government provided the Garda Síochána with a number of new jeeps and motor vehicles which have proved most effective.  In the context of the forthcoming Estimates I intend to provide the Garda with additional resources where these are required in the battle against crime.  That would include the problem of joyriding.  This practice is tortuous for communities around the country and they want it ended.  It should be possible to make an impact on this activity in the not too distant future.  I am sure the provision of further resources would assist in this respect.  With regard to Deputy Upton's question, it is an offence to steal a mechanically propelled vehicle irrespective of whether it is stolen to fulfil an order or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the provision of legal aid for victims in rape cases usually <Col N="694" /> arises in the context of separate legal representation in the course of trials in such cases.  The Deputy will be aware that last May I published a discussion paper on the law on sexual offences. The issue of separate legal representation is addressed in the chapter dealing with the trial of sexual offences.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was originally the end of August. However, this has since been informally extended to enable as many people and organisations as possible to respond to the discussion paper.  In that respect submissions are still being received. All submissions will be taken fully into account in the formulation of proposals for changes to the law which may ensue from the paper.</P>
      <P>Victims of rape and other sexual offences already qualify for free legal advice under section 26(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  That provision extends the civil legal aid scheme to allow a complainant in cases involving those offences to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany the complainant into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that while overall crime rates are falling, there is one exception relating to rape and sexual assaults on women.  Given that the Minster has shown concern about reducing crime levels, does he not accept that to leave this matter on the long finger will ensure those who are guilty are not brought before a court and punished?  Is he not aware &mdash; it has been well publicised &mdash; that many women are afraid to proceed to court in cases of rape and sexual assault because of a lack of legal representation? Does he not recall that he made a commitment last September, at the conference relating to the report, to consider the specific requirement to provide legal representation? Given that his answer is very disturbing for those involved in supporting women who have experience of this kind of crime, does he not accept he must differentiate between the general points in the report, welcome as they are, and the specific requirement to urgently provide for legal representation in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is complex and difficult.  The question of separate legal representation raises constitutional questions which, in turn, raises the possibility of tilting the criminal process significantly in favour of the prosecution. This would arise from a dual representation hostile to the interests of the accused.</P>
      <P>I have indicated I am in favour of providing separate legal representation where this is possible. It is possible to do so where an application is made to the court to allow in evidence the past sexual history of the complainant.  In those circumstances, I believe I would be well within constitutional parameters in allowing for separate legal representation in what I will describe as the trial within the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is very real difficulty for me &mdash; and for previous Ministers &mdash; in regard to the question of dual representation during the trial <Col N="695" /> itself.  The accused would almost certainly raise the issue that the prosecution had a form of dual representation as a result of the complainant and the prosecutor both being represented in the court.  Obviously, I cannot pre-empt what the court would say if that argument were put before it, although I have my view on what it would say. However, I feel I am on safe ground in allowing for separate legal representation when it is sought to raise the complainant's past sexual history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the nub of the question. Now that the Minister has agreed it is necessary to provide this legal representation, what are his plans to so do?  He is producing a great deal of legislation this term but there is no indication, despite his commitment, that this is an important measure.  Taking this action would certainly reduce the crime levels in this area.  What are his plans and his timeframe for providing, at the very least, legal representation in those specific circumstances about which there is no constitutional doubt?</P>

      <P>As I indicated on a number of occasions, the discussion paper will be the subject of analysis, as will the submissions which are being received.  It should be taken as read that legislation will follow that necessary analysis.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give a timescale to Deputy McManus.  However, I am committed to introducing, at the very least, legal representation for the complainant when her past sexual history is being raised and it is only right that I should do that.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the extension of legal representation beyond that does, unfortunately, have constitutional implications which would have to be very carefully considered.  However, I am committed to doing what I can within the parameters within which I must operate.  I am committed to doing this at the first opportunity, but analysis of the discussion paper, which will lead to legislation, must take place first.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give urgent separate consideration to the question of legal representation, aside from the other issues which will be dealt with in the discussion document? This has been the major recommendation made by rape crisis centres around the country and was the main recommendation in a recent report by Trinity College, Dublin, and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  It should be given urgent priority ahead of the other issues in the discussion document.</P>

      <P>It would not be prudent of me to consider any one aspect of the discussion document in isolation.  Opportunities to bring forward legislation in the area of sexual offences do not arise very often.  Now that the opportunity has arisen in the context of the discussion paper and the submissions which are being received, it is only right that I should bring forward comprehensive legislation to modernise our criminal law in this area.  Therefore, I intend to include that representation in an all encompassing Bill.</P>
      <P>That said, consideration of how legal representation might be further extended beyond the limits I have outlined will also be considered in the context of considering the discussion document. There have been improvements under successive Governments in the position of complainants regarding advice given to them pre-trial, impact reports and so on.  However, the issue of legal representation is, as Deputy McManus said, the nub of the question, which is why it is being addressed in great detail.</P>

Following today's Cabinet meeting and Labour's successful conference on Structural Funding attended by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, does the Government intend to facilitate or even participate in this debate by publishing its own proposals on regionalisation and Structural Funds?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of Exchequer grant aid which may be paid to Bord Fáilte to support tourism capital development works. Funding for this purpose is provided to Bord Fáilte under subhead B2 of the Department's Vote.  Provision for this statutory limit was first introduced under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1975, and most recently amended by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1995, which increased the limit to £22 million.</P>
      <P>Taking account of the 1998 B2 Estimate, this limit is set to be exceeded before the year ends. The Bill proposes that the limit be increased to £50 million to enable continued payments to the end of the year and in future years.  The Bill does not imply any commitment to provide funding at any level, nor does it commit the Government or the Oireachtas to any financial commitments, including the continuation of any particular grant scheme.  The provision of capital funding to Bord Fáilte will, as always, be considered by this House on a yearly basis in the context of the annual Estimates and the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> In addition to the periodic reviews occasioned by these statutory limits, legislative and procedural changes in recent years have created further new opportunities for the review of Bord Fáilte's expenditure.  These developments include the establishment of select Oireachtas committees dealing with Vote expenditure, and the making accountable, under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, of the heads of semi-State agencies, including Bord Fáilte, to the Oireachtas for the achievement of value for money.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of our economy and the Government's strategy for its development, Bord Fáilte is working in one of Ireland's most important and vibrant economic sectors.  Irish tourism has seen a dramatic acceleration of growth over the period 1986-96 after steady but unspectacular growth over the previous 15 years. This growth has continued consistently for more than a decade.  The World Tourism Organisation has reported that over this period, total foreign earnings from tourism in Ireland have grown by 370 per cent, compared to between 95 per cent and 191 per cent in other EU countries.  This growth has contributed significantly to the creation of a more mature, dynamic, expanding and profitable economic and business sector.</P>
    <P>The number of overseas visitors has increased from 2.4 million in 1988 to more than 5 million in 1997, a significant increase by any standards. Tourism is now our second biggest industry.  The Celtic tiger's most vivacious cub supports almost 120,000 jobs &mdash; one in 12 of the workforce &mdash; and when domestic tourism is taken into account, it generates almost £3 billion annually.</P>
    <P>With such economic indicators it is easy to see that tourism has become a vital force in the Irish economy.  The industry is performing at an unprecedented level of success, with new records being achieved each year in visitor numbers and in the yield in overseas revenue.  Figures released by the Central Statistics Office for the first six months of this year confirm that growth in visitor numbers from abroad is running ahead of target at almost 11 per cent, and the available figures for revenue are up by almost 13 per cent.  These are phenomenal figures by any standard.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimates on tourism revenue over recent years show that growth rates have been achieved in all regions of Ireland which are better than international and European annual averages. The continued promotion of a good regional spread and an extension of the tourism season are vital elements in our tourism policy, and while it is clear that we cannot direct tourists to areas where they do not wish to go, we can encourage and promote the beauty, quality of facilities and all-round attractiveness of our lesser known regions.  To this end, last year I sought from this House an additional £5 million for special international marketing with a specific regional emphasis.  Some of these initiatives targeted a range of advertising, publicity and other <Col N="708" /> activities in the area of niche marketing on activities such as angling, golf, equestrian and walking. Another dealt with providing additional funds to integrate and supplement local and regional marketing activity, consistent with national destination spend.</P>
    <P>Advancing the seasonality profile of Irish tourism has also received support with the promotion of early season events such as the national St. Patrick's Day festival.  This festival has gone from strength to strength in recent years.  I congratulate the St. Patrick's festival committee under its chairman Michael Colgan on the work they have put in and their commitment to its future.  I hope this festival will be an occasion people will wish to visit in the future.  I wish to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 31 March 1998 by Frank McDonald.  This is an excellent article which epitomised what has been achieved by the St. Patrick's festival.  While understanding that Ministers have to be abroad on St. Patrick's Day promoting the country, the article states:</P>
    <P>Ministers might have had their eyes opened had they been in Dublin on the night before St. Patrick's Day when the four elements &mdash; earth, wind, fire and water &mdash; converged in magical street theatre in the heart of the city on College Green.</P>
    <P>It was the night Dublin became a European capital city.</P>
    <P>It was an unbeatable spectacle.  The four elements gyrated through throngs of people, each trying to outdo the other, as figures waved huge white flags from the parapets and forecourt of the Old Parliament and a battery of rocket launchers on Trinity College's roof let off yet another fireworks display.</P>
    <P>The Americans who had come expecting something more traditional were taken aback. It was all just a bit too &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; with not a leprechaun in sight.  We have come so far. Seven years ago, when Dublin was European City of Culture, the organisers wanted a fireworks display at the Custom House.  There was every reason to do so, as Gandon's greatest masterpiece had just been beautifully restored in time to celebrate the bicentenary of its 1791 completion.</P>
    <P>The timidity of the times meant that any fireworks display could only take place in non-central locations, such as the 15 Acres in the Phoenix Park or in Dublin Bay, because of irrational and unfounded fears for &ldquo;public safety&rdquo;.  Dubliners were denied the vision of a fiery spectacle with the city as a backdrop.</P>
    <P>Seven years on, to mark the opening of the St. Patrick's Festival, we have matured to stage the biggest fireworks display Ireland has ever seen right in front of, and over, the Custom House.  It must have cost Aer Lingus a fortune, but that dazzling, unforgettable half hour in the hands of the Theatre of Fire was worth every penny.</P>
    <P>The city was back, centre stage.</P>
    <P>It was, in many ways, a celebration of how <Col N="709" /> far it has come in under a decade.  In 1991, there was not very much to celebrate but this is no longer the case.  Dublin today is different and there was a real substance in this year's St. Patrick's Festival.  It was not merely veneer to cover over the cracks.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this House had the foresight to approve support for these initiatives.  The response of the industry at large, and the regional tourism authorities in particular, has been very encouraging.  Following consultation at local level, the representatives of the regional tourism authorities have been involved with Bord Fáilte in producing literature in various languages to promote their individual regions; promoting new business in new markets; providing support for the various product marketing groups on a regional basis; assisting in the construction of regional tourism internet sites and exhibiting at the various international trade fairs what the individual regions have to offer.</P>
    <P>These are just some examples of where industry, working in conjunction with the regional tourism authorities and Bord Fáilte, can put in place sound business strategies to successfully market their facilities.  The evidence would suggest that those operators who apply professional marketing practices are winning market share over those who do not.  For my part, I will try to ensure that the benefits of the continuing record growth in tourism are spread throughout the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>The benefits of a vibrant and expanding tourism sector have led to continuing and increased emphasis on the sector as an engine for growth in successive national economic programmes.  The results of this have become very evident to anyone travelling around the country in recent years. The discerning visitor can now avail of a new and disparate tourism infrastructure such as conference, leisure and all-weather facilities which have added a new dimension and quality to the type of tourism product available in Ireland.  The scale of private investment which has flowed into tourism over the past decade is also highly evident in the development of hotel facilities and in the upgrading of accommodation and hospitality facilities generally to meet and even exceed international standards.</P>
    <P>The current Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 includes provision to support the development in Dublin of a dedicated national conference centre which will be capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates and the Government has made the attainment of a final decision on this project one of its main priorities.  The long process to identify a developer for this facility is now entering its final stages.  At its June meeting, the Management Board for Product Development, the decision-making body for grants under the programme, decided on the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Ltd.  to develop the project at a site in Dublin docklands.  Under the terms of the programme, the agreement of the Government and <Col N="710" /> the EU Commission is required, on foot of a cost-benefit analysis, for projects of this scale.  This cost-benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants and, on 16 September, the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ECU grant towards the cost of developing the project. We now await the Commission's response which constitutes the crucial final stage in the grant approval process.</P>
    <P>As we face the remainder of the decade and head into the new millennium, the challenge to create further economic growth and employment has never been greater.  The targets for our tourism industry are ambitious and ongoing investment in marketing, product development, training and visitor services is vital to maintain growth in the face of increased international competition.</P>
    <P>The substantial support of the European Union for the tourism industry over the past ten years has proved to be a sound investment.  Some time ago, my Department produced a draft discussion paper on the development of tourism into the next century in the run up to the negotiations for post-1999 and the next round of EU Structural Funds.  Preliminary consultations with the State tourism agencies and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation have already taken place on these proposals and indeed on some proposals of their own.  The objective of this exercise is to prepare the most persuasive case possible for the continued partnership between the Government, the tourism industry and the EU in the further development of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the progress of the peace process and the improved prospect of peace and stability in Northern Ireland will be of substantial benefit to Irish tourism, not only in the British market but in our markets worldwide. Tourism's future requires that the principle of co-operation be at the centre of our policies and marketing decisions as we work together to promote the whole of Ireland in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</P>
    <P>There is already much to build on in this regard as there has been significant cross-Border co-operation at both departmental and agency level for some time.  At agency level, co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has existed since the 1960s and this has been considerably strengthened and facilitated in recent years by the availability of financial assistance for marketing and product development from both the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland.  In addition, there have been regular contacts and co-operation between the two Departments on a range of issues of common interest in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>As we approach the new millennium, there will be a major focus on the twin issues of economic and monetary union and on finding the right way forward for the industry when the current operational programme for tourism ends.  For the <Col N="711" /> tourism industry in particular, the introduction of EMU in less than three months' time will not only mean the adapting of our marketing strategies to the new scenario but the modification of computer technology and the provision of relevant training.  With this in mind, a guide to the key issues of EMU has recently been produced as a co-operative venture between Bord Fáilte, CERT, ITIC and AIB, specifically for the tourism industry.  This is of course in addition to the national EMU awareness campaign and other private sector packages.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade or so, we have witnessed and indeed continue to witness the greatest programme of tourism infrastructural development in our history, which has involved huge levels of assistance from EU sources.  This assistance, amounting to £220 million under the current operational programme, has played a critical part in raising the standard and quality of Irish tourism and in bridging the gap between it and international destinations identified in the two co-funded operational programmes to date.  In view of the resultant progress achieved, it is probably unlikely that EU assistance will be maintained indefinitely.  Industry self-sufficiency will, to a far greater extent, become the order of the day and this is a scenario for which we should be properly prepared.  It is important, therefore, that with the advent of the euro we do not allow a perception to develop, especially abroad, that Ireland might be on the way to becoming a high priced holiday destination for foreign tourists.  This means that everyone in the industry must resist the temptation to edge up prices here and there, for one service or another.  I want our overseas visitors to be able to say they got good value and a fair deal in Ireland when they return home.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I mentioned that the number of visitors to Ireland over the past ten years had more than doubled.  Based on Bord Fáilte and industry growth projections for early in the next century, the number of visitors coming to our shores is set to rise to more than seven million by 2003.  This will present us with a number of new and additional challenges with regard to environmental and congestion issues and in the provision of adequate visitor services.  With this in mind, I launched a new initiative earlier this year under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, seeking proposals that would serve to demonstrate how particular problems affecting tourism and the environment might be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The intention of the initiative is to encourage projects which would point to ways of supporting tourism development while at the same time sustaining the environment on which it is based. Examples of the types of projects sought included visitor management schemes such as those proposed for individual sites, towns or cities, environment awareness projects and innovative litter control systems.  I am pleased to say that this initiative has already come to fruition with a number <Col N="712" /> of projects recommended for consideration by the product development management boards.</P>
    <P>With this increased level of visitors, it is important that the services provided by our tourist information offices keep pace with the changing times and increasing expectations of tourists, both domestic and foreign.  Investment programmes are being undertaken by the regional tourism authorities to expand their network and to upgrade existing facilities.  The major part of the moneys provided to Bord Fáilte under subhead B2 since 1995 has been allocated by the board to the regional authorities towards the implementation of these investment programmes.</P>
    <P>Other areas which benefit from expenditure allocations by Bord Fáilte under subhead B2 include the development of regional tourist amenity signposting and regional heritage and tourist projects. This work has also benefited from European Regional Development Fund support under the current operational programme for tourism. By the end of the programme approximately £10 million will have been contributed by the State and the EU for these developments, including the provision of a new computerised system to improve the quality and efficiency of information and reservation services.  The number of visits to tourist information offices last year was 4.3 million, an increase of 139 per cent on the 1988 figure of 1.8 million.  Over the same period the number of bednights booked through these offices increased by 153 per cent, to 670,000.  The tourist information office network is, therefore, a vital ingredient in the tourism infrastructure of this country, providing an after sales service to visitors as well as being a major player in the promotion of home holidays to Irish holiday-makers.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with grant expenditure for the development of tourism related facilities and amenities.  The existing statutory limit on grants of this nature is £22 million and expenditure up to the end of 1997 amounted to almost £21 million. The 1998 allocation for this type of grant expenditure is almost £1.1 million, bringing aggregate expenditure on amenity development by the end of this year to more than £22 million. The current statutory limit, last set in 1995, must therefore be increased to ensure completion of this year's amenity development programme.  I accordingly propose that the limit be increased from £22 million to £50 million.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The mission statement of the Department is to contribute to the economic and social progress of society.  I am very impressed by the Department's statement of strategy for the period 1998 to 2001, the three main points of which are to establish a sustainable tourist centre which champions high standards in marketing, service, quality and product development, an active culture in sport and recreation including the achievement of sporting excellence and an enhanced partnership approach to local development <Col N="713" /> with a particular emphasis on improving the quality of life of communities characterised by high levels of social deprivation.  I believe the final point will prove effective in many areas and I am delighted it is one of the three main focuses of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, as it is an area which deserves major attention.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit for supporting tourism capital development works from £22 million to £50 million.  I am very concerned that as things stand there are no grants whatever for the building of new hotels. There is a fund available for the renovation of old hotels, but there is little or no assistance for the building of new hotels which involves major capital development.</P>
      <P>I welcomed last year's announcement by the Minister regarding blackspots in Sligo in the context of hotel development, something which has also been taken up in south Sligo.  It is wonderful that this has taken place.  However, in areas where the scheme does not operate there is little or no encouragement from Bord Fáilte to build a hotel.  It costs up to £40,000 per bedroom to build a hotel, which means a 50 bedroom hotel would cost £2 million.  It is regrettable that there is little or no support from Bord Fáilte for the building of new hotels and this issue should be examined. The tourism development market, especially the development of approved accommodation, should also be examined, particularly in Border counties.</P>
      <P>Tourism is now firmly established as a key contributor to the economic prosperity of Ireland. Having languished in the doldrums for many years, in the past decade Ireland has witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the level of foreign visitors, foreign earnings and product investment. This is very welcome and the activities of the Department has been a spur.  The contribution of tourism to the national agenda has been equally impressive.  Foreign tourism is estimated to contribute in excess of £800 million annually to the Exchequer, while the rapid expansion of tourism employment is reflected in the fact that 80 per cent of all new jobs in the past five years have been directly supported by tourism.  National policy objectives will call for greater job creation in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest difficulty at present is getting people to work in hotels at weekends and getting people to train as chefs.  I am in the licensed restaurant business and I know how difficult it is to get skilled people to work unsociable hours.  The Department should encourage people on social welfare to work on Saturdays and allow them sign on on Sundays and still avail of their entitlements. This would encourage people to work in the business. A large number of people would be prepared to work in tourism but for the tax system. Married women, who are fantastic members of staff in hotels and restaurants, would gladly work evenings and Saturdays.  However, the tax system is a disincentive to work.  There should be an incentive for people in the hotel industry and <Col N="714" /> licensed trade to take on part-time workers and to encourage people to re-enter the trade.  The strongest asset we have is our capable staff.  Most visitors are very much impressed by the friendliness of Irish staff in hotels.  The best person to work is a housewife who has her family reared, is at home and has time to spare.  She could work for 20 hours per week which would be a major asset to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Much of the development and investment in the sector has been assisted by EU Structural Funds under successful operational programmes for tourism.  Direct State investment in promoting tourism has progressively reduced and in years to come EU funding will be very insignificant.  The clear message is that the Lord helps those to help themselves.  It is important that in the remaining years the funds we have are well spent in the areas of greatest need.  After 2000 we will be in a huge marketplace and it is important that we are ready for the challenges.</P>
    <P>We must highlight the need for improved management of Ireland's fragile tourism assets. There must also be a real appreciation by the Government of the key factors likely to impinge on our ability to continue to succeed in extremely competitive international markets. Such success cannot and should not be taken for granted.  The Minister said the markets doubled over ten years, but we cannot take this for granted.  We must encourage enterprise.  The Minister is hoping people will take the risk of borrowing high risk money and working unsociable hours.  There is little or no incentive for developers or business people.  In certain business the proprietor can to endure all the pressure while employees have all the profit. There is much pressure and risk in taking on engagements, booking cabaret shows and pursuing niche markets.  We see from last summer the extent of dependence on existing conditions.</P>
    <P>We must define our key competitive advantages and, through high level research, identify potential high yield customers.  We should go after niche markets as Ireland has a huge amount to offer.  While we must be competitive there are people who can afford to spend.  There must also be increased investment in marketing Ireland in its broadest sense, both North and South.</P>
    <P>A number of weeks ago the Minister launched the marketing forum for Sligo.  He saw at close quarters what a county marketing forum can do. I heard the very effective advertisement which resulted from the forum on radio today; it will attract people to Sligo.</P>
    <P>There are 1.5 million people in the North who are looking to the Twenty-six Counties as a potential tourism market.  We must recognise and exploit the opportunities presented by tourism for the creation of employment for many of our long-term unemployed.  The Minister must undertake that job.  Employers in this sector must be encouraged to recruit many of the long-term unemployed.  Business is now perceived in a broader sense.  Business courses provided in our <Col N="715" /> educational institutions focus on marketing skills and encourage people to take business risks and borrow the necessary money to set up their own businesses.  We must encourage initiative and enterprise.  If we do not foster those skills, we will have a confined market controlled by a small number of operators.  We must be careful to spread the load and encourage students who will graduate in five years' time and people who are new to the market to set up their own businesses. We should encourage them to buy a restaurant, a pub or a hotel.  We must create opportunities for people to go into business.  Banks require applicants seeking a loan to set up their own businesses to have a good track record, the necessary work experience and to have completed a feasibility study in respect of the proposed business project.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Doyle Hotel Group was sold to the Jurys Hotel Group.  That is an example of big business getting bigger.  While big business is superbly effective, I have the greatest respect for sole operators who provide a good service, are effective and adopt a hands on approach to management.  We must ensure there is always a place for private enterprise and for the small operator to expand.  If we do not, the growth of big operators will pose a threat to competition in trade.</P>
    <P>We must develop national structures to address the fragmented nature of what essentially is a cluster of small economic units which aspire to industrial status.  A group of hotels may not be under the same ownership, but they can be marketed together.  There should be a cross-Border marketing of hotels in Northern Ireland and a marketing of hotels in Sligo to ensure hotel proprietors work together to promote tourism.  Promotional funding should be provided for that purpose. An increase in investment in overseas and domestic tourism promotion is required.  Domestic tourism promotion is important and the way it is promoted in Sligo is a good example of how it should be done.</P>
    <P>Tax and social welfare barriers to job creation should be removed.  Many people would like to take up work, but it does not pay them to do so under the current system.  A husband would have to pay more tax if his wife were to return to work and her tax free allowance would decrease.  A minimum wage of £4.40 is proposed, but major tax reform is required before that is put in place. Essentially, employees require an increase in their net incomes.  We must not make it impossible for employers to take on staff.  If they are required to pay employees £4.40 per hour, which is £200 per week, they will try to find ways not to create jobs.  We must ensure it pays employers to take on staff and that it pays employees to take up work.  Unless a proper system is in place, employers will decide not to create jobs because they will have to pay too much tax and employees will not take up work for the same reason.</P>
    <P>The owner of two hotels in the west told me he <Col N="716" /> had to recruit two chefs from France because he could not get qualified chefs here to take up those jobs.  There is something dramatically wrong with the system.  It is important to be a good European and to recruit chefs from other countries, but that hotel owner did not recruit those chefs because they had training in French cuisine.  He recruited them because he could not get people here to take up those jobs and he was prepared to pay them £10, £12 or £15 an hour.  CERT training in this area must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>There are many misconceptions about the tourism sector, but recent evidence indicates it is critical to our economic future.  The agricultural sector is in crisis and farming as a future career is not a realistic prospect.  Farming is perceived by many to be an occupational therapy because farmers require another job to run their farms. The Minister could assist farmers by promoting agri-tourism and making it viable to provide bed and breakfast accommodation.  That would provide them with an additional income and encourage them to remain on their holdings.  Having regard to REPS and the disincentives to farmers to progressively improve their farms, we must provide alternatives.</P>
    <P>Coming from Donegal, the Minister will appreciate that the west has a great deal to offer rural holidaymakers.  People from the middle of London travel to remote parts of Donegal or Sligo.  They enjoy the remoteness and the peace and tranquility.  If the agricultural sector was given assistance, it could develop agri-tourism.  If we are to make that vision a reality, many traditional beliefs will have to be discarded and a new positive dynamic mindset adopted.  We are lucky to have a Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation from a Border county at this important time in the history of our State when the changes in Northern Ireland have never been as great.</P>
    <P>This week Dublin Tourism rejected Dublin Corporation's concept of imposing a room occupancy tax on hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments and I am pleased the Minister commented on that.  The Exchequer benefits to the tune of £1.2 billion from tourism. It would be more appropriate to pledge additional promotional funds to promote tourism. That would be a sound economic decision because the Exchequer receives a great return on money invested in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination in America.  If Dublin Corporation and other local authorities require additional funding, that should be addressed under the heading of local government finance.  Tourists should not be used as a soft hit.  That proposal sends out the wrong message and I am delighted the Minister strongly opposed it.  We extend a céad míle fáilte to tourists, but it would be hypocritical to tax tourists who come to Dublin simply for that privilege.</P>
    <P>Many new hotels have opened in Dublin.  I compliment the McEniff Group on opening a fine hotel in Dublin and I wish it the best of luck. <Col N="717" /> Investment in hotels in Dublin is unparalleled in other European cities.  Millions of pounds are being invested and up to £20 million has been invested in one hotel.  They must be run in an efficient manner and Dublin hotels, collectively, should contribute to the promotion of Dublin, which is a very different tourism market from that in the west.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline his plans to streamline the administration of European Regional Development Fund grants?  It is unfair that applicants for those grants, who incurred substantial expense in preparing feasibility studies and market plans, were not told prior to incurring those expenses that there was very little funding available. That appears to be the case.  Bord Fáilte's primary role is to market Ireland and it is welcome that the licensing of hotels and restaurants has been passed to a consultancy company.  The primary job of Bord Fáilte is the promotion of this country abroad.  The increase in capital investment for non-repayable grants from £22 million to £50 million is welcome.  What grants are repayable and under what guidelines are they repaid?  We must be careful to ensure there are proper guidelines to cover the allocation of grants given to operators.  Projects must be viable and profitable and not driven solely by the fact that they qualify for grants.  The Minister should provide some of that funding for seed capital to assist those who wish to set up their own businesses. The financial institutions will always back a winner. Often they will not consider an applicant who has a good feasibility plan.</P>
    <P>Applicants for European Regional Development Fund grants, who have completed feasibility studies which may have cost £8,0000 or £9,000, often find there are no funds available, and such plans are often left in filing cabinets.  The only ones who gain are the consultants.  If the Minister were to check out the number of concluded enterprise feasibility studies in comparison to the number commissioned it would be one in ten. Before consultants embark on such studies the Department should say that it will recommend ideas for feasibility because in certain cases the consultants charge £25,000 or £30,000 and will not deliver the studies until they get their cheques, which are guaranteed.  They are only interested in picking up a cheque after giving a glossy presentation when publishing the reports.</P>
    <P>Access to the west of Ireland is most important for the growth of tourism in the area.  It is most important that a quality road network is constructed to ensure it is possible to travel between Dublin and Sligo or Galway within three hours. There have been dramatic improvements along the N4 but the road running along the west coast from Donegal and Sligo through Galway and Limerick to Cork and Killarney should be upgraded as a quality route.  I ask the Minister to make this a strategic priority for tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister was in Knock a number of weeks ago and it is important for tourism that people should be flown in there.  I heard last week that <Col N="718" /> an airplane leaves Dublin Airport every two minutes.  Unfortunately, Knock Airport only has three or four flights per day even though it can cater for the same aircraft as Dublin Airport.  The Minister should ensure in terms of our regional airport policy that a number of direct flights from America land in the west so that tourists at least have the opportunity to visit there, though their final destination might be Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he wanted an enhanced partnership approach to local development with a particular emphasis on improving the quality of life of communities characterised by high levels of social deprivation.  It is important that he lives up to that commitment.  He should explore the merits of a designated tourism traffic channel, particularly for those who hire cars, which would not only highlight the dangers on our roads for tourists but also promote tourist attractions, etc. Unfortunately, the number of tragedies on our roads today is frightening, not only involving Irish people but also foreigners who drive on the wrong side of the road.  However, an information channel could easily be introduced at little or no expense, particularly with the huge volume of traffic.  Local radio could be utilised by the Department, taking up a daily slot to highlight the dangers on the roads.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister plans to rationalise the duplication in spending of scarce American resources which occurs when county tourism organisations, regional tourism authorities and Bord Fáilte do not co-ordinate their activities?  It has improved but it is important that he looks at it.  It is time for Bord Fáilte to take on a wider role to ensure there is co-ordination by all organs promoting tourism so that everybody sings from the one hymn sheet.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the domestic tourism initiative is most important in generating off season business.  Currently, the domestic market provides the greatest opportunity for growth while the economy is doing well and this is encouraging people in remote areas to take a risk.  Is it intended to continue the initiative in 1999 and will the Minister pledge more funding for it?  I know he pledged £5 million and it has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is expected to benefit most from the positive economic effect of peace in Northern Ireland to which the Minister referred.  Cross-Border tourism co-operation has evolved over several years and there is potential with EU, US and Government assistance to further develop tourism.  The Minister has a role in exploiting that in the area most affected &mdash; the Border counties, which have experienced a total dearth of tourists for 30 years.  People in the industry who fought the battle in hard times with a burning ambition to succeed would not be here today otherwise.</P>
    <P>While tourism in the north-west has grown significantly the region has fallen well behind the rest of the country.  It is impossible to quantify how the region has been adversely affected by the <Col N="719" /> terrorist violence in its neighbouring counties and the negative image which this has portrayed over the past 25 years.  The Minister is from Donegal and recognises the potential for growth in the area.  There are fine hotels there and the McEniff group and others have fought hard.  It is great to see that they have the opportunity to benefit now after the pain of the past number of years and the negative worldwide attention the Border counties received.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it should be noted that following the ceasefires inquiries to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board rose considerably.  Economists estimate that employment in tourism in the North could double over a period of years from its current level of 10,000.  Consultants have given an indication of the potential for tourism growth but it is estimated that the North's tourism revenue of £250 million could have been 30 per cent higher without the troubles.  This shows what the 32 counties have to offer and the potential spin-off for the north west is considerable.</P>
    <P>Reduced peripherality and the peace dividend increase the natural hinterland of the north-west to include a potential 1.5 million people.  It will also have a significant impact on reducing the region's perceived remoteness.  There is a window of opportunity to build a foundation for cross-Border investment while political and media attention is focused on the region.  Unfortunately, there is little EU funding for initiatives currently. While there is £50 million available, I am not sure how the Minister will focus it on the Border counties. A reply to a parliamentary question a number of months ago stated there was only £430,000 available for the six Border counties in INTERREG funding.  The British Government has invested £150 million in the North.  Further funding must be anticipated under INTERREG initiatives.  However, the Minister indicated that EU funding looks bleak in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government will look at other initiatives given that the British-Irish Agreement outlines the level of cross-Border co-operation that will exist.  Hopefully, a fund will be set up to target the areas which have suffered the greatest loss over the past years.  IBEC and the CBI, the joint business council, have acted as a catalyst to maximise the level of trade and economic co-operation on the island since 1992.  It states that more than 600 firms have already participated in the council's business development programme, including many from the region.</P>
    <P>Companies in the north-west reckon the new emphasis on North-South links can provide safeguards to ensure the Dublin-Belfast corridor is not pursued at the economic expense of the north-west.  A balance must be struck.</P>
    <P>The North-West Region Cross-Border Group is concerned primarily with public sector activities but has acted as a focus for a diverse set of private sector initiatives.  The completion of the Internal Market and the abolition of customs procedures in 1993 created a single market on the <Col N="720" /> island.  It completely changed the business environment in the region.  Cross-Border trade links are not as strong as those with other member states.  I appreciate Bord Fáilte is working with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board but every effort should be made to get the officers of the hotel federations and the vintner associations, among others, around the table to develop Cross-Border links and thus promote tourism.</P>
    <P>The gap in employment costs has to be closed. Unlike here, the introduction of a minimum wage in the United Kingdom &mdash; £3.60 per hour &mdash; will be accompanied by major tax reform.  The rate proposed here is £4.40 per hour.  There are also differences in the area of business taxation, including VAT rates.  This will have to be looked at if emphasis is to be placed on 32 county tourism promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short but important Bill. I commend the Minister on its introduction.  Its purpose is to increase the funding available to Bord Fáilte from £22 million to £50 million to support tourism capital development works.  Bord Fáilte plays a pivotal role in the development of tourism which is fast becoming our most important industry.  I pay tribute to Mr. McNulty on the work he has done at home and abroad. When the excellent members of staff who were lost earlier in the year are replaced, adequate resources should be available to develop the industry and thus provide sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>The leisure and tourism industry is growing at an unprecedented rate worldwide.  Ireland stands to benefit more than any other EU member state. According to the strategy report of the Tourist Industry Federation, by 2002 tourism will be our leading industry, accounting for 8 per cent of GDP and 16 per cent of the total workforce.  It is crucial that all parts of the country benefit and that the needs of every tourist are catered for. As can be seen from the figures, there is a heavy concentration on one area.  The Minister made a special allocation to the regional tourism organisations to ensure the benefits are spread more evenly.  There are many tourist attractions in my constituency.</P>
      <P>There is a labour shortage in the tourism industry. Hotels, restaurants and public houses cannot fill vacancies.  Contributory factors include unsocial working hours, low rates of pay and the lack of training opportunities.  CERT, the responsible agency, is producing highly-qualified personnel but is under growing pressure to meet increasing demand.  I understand that with proper training there are up to 6,000 jobs available. There is a responsibility on us to ensure CERT has the capacity to fill these positions.  With the promise of good job prospects many young people who find it unattractive to enter the labour force could be attracted to the industry by the offer of high quality training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent weeks about regionalisation in the context of EU funding. <Col N="721" /> As Deputy Perry said, there is a need to distribute tourism income more evenly throughout the regions to prevent rural decline.  I object to the proposal of Dublin City Council to introduce a room tax.  Last week the city manager mentioned that a similar tax has been introduced in Spain.  The documentation I have received in the meantime confirms that there is no such tax.  The proposal has been submitted to various Ministers, including the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  It would set a dangerous precedent to introduce such a tax to subsidise infrastructural developments which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, either directly or through the rating structure.  It should not be seen as a fundraising exercise.  If underpinned by legislation, every other council would have the authority to introduce various taxes to tap into sources they consider ripe for picking.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the committee makes the final decision on this next week it will reject it and ask the Government not to accept any such proposal.  It would constitute an unfair playing pitch for those who compete in the tourism industry and a double taxation on hotels and room owners since they already pay rates.  This raises the spectre of unapproved accommodation. Obviously, only those who provide hotel or approved accommodation will be expected to pay this tax while people who provide unapproved accommodation will escape.</P>
    <P>We must achieve a fairer distribution of hotel facilities throughout the country.  In Dublin there has been a mushrooming of hotel accommodation but this is market driven.  The provision of hotel accommodation and other tourist amenities in rural areas, however, is driven by tax incentives, rates incentives, urban renewal schemes and the like.  The only way to get people with money to contemplate such investment is by providing tax relief opportunities.  On the other hand the hotel industry in Dublin is booming and is market led. It is doing extremely well.</P>
    <P>Everybody would like to see a fairer distribution of the tourism income to all regions.  It would help to tackle the decline in agriculture, which has resulted in almost 5,000 young people leaving rural areas each year.  At present, nothing of significance is being done to prevent this decline except, perhaps, through programmes such as the Leader programme.  However, most of these programmes cannot be availed of by people involved in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Investment in tourism in rural areas will go some way towards halting rural decline.  Investment should be targeted at agri-tourism, heritage towns, outdoor pursuits, signposting and improved access by air and road to all regions. Urban populations as well as foreign tourists would welcome more opportunities to visit rural areas, agricultural museums, open farms and more opportunities to take part in hill walking and other outdoor pursuits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> We have the necessary natural resources to make this happen but we need the investment and support of Bord Fáilte.  The current concept is to keep rural areas open and our committee has received submissions from an organisation which believes in that concept.  This means minimising the incidence of trespass and avoiding the development of a claims mentality.  There are wonderful areas in my constituency and throughout Munster where there are tremendous facilities for pursuits such as pony trekking, hill walking and so forth.</P>
    <P>National newspapers daily carry numerous advertisements for short autumn breaks in a multitude of locations throughout the country. However, the opportunities to avail of such breaks are limited for tourists who do not have access to a car.  That must be taken into account when trying to coax people out of the cities and into the countryside.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and other transport providers must play their role in this regard. There is a need to develop a transport infrastructure to facilitate the development of tourism.  It is worth considering the numerous disused railway lines whose tracks have been removed.  These routes are lying idle and could be used for walking and cycling in safety, away from the national primary and secondary routes which are now so busy with agricultural and other traffic.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports the establishment of cross-Border bodies to promote tourism.  This is not only in keeping with the British-Irish Agreement but it also presents an opportunity to capitalise on the expanding tourism industry.  The current situation whereby the North and South are marketed as two destinations is wasteful. Increased co-operation will encourage increased movement of tourists across the Border and to Ireland as a whole.  I hope more progress will be made not only in the establishment of the Executive and in dealing with the other issues that have arisen but also in establishing cross-Border bodies. There is no better sector for full co-operation than tourism where there is already a high degree of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the operational programme which is due to conclude in 1999.  My experience of making representations to Bord Fáilte under this programme was traumatic. Before the last election, I and other Members of the Oireachtas from my constituency made strong and well documented cases to the special select group in Bord Fáilte for assistance for the EXEL project.  The Minister is aware of that project and saw the nucleus of it when he visited my constituency.</P>
    <P>The select group gave us a blank refusal.  It sought numerous items as well as changes in the plan, all of which were forthcoming at considerable expense to the local voluntary group promoting the project.  Political agendas were adopted prior to the election and I was seen as having failed to deliver the balance of the funding necessary to progress the project.  Last week, <Col N="723" /> however, the same select group of experts under a different Administration was able to give the go ahead.  People are now swanning around the constituency accepting the credit for something that was purported to be the prerogative of an expert committee and not due to political pressures or representations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of Bord Fáilte to fund the EXEL project in full.  It should have funded it from the start because the project will stand up to critical analysis and will be of tremendous benefit to a rural area such as Tipperary.  When the Minister saw the project he supported it but it must be said that Bord Fáilte made it extremely difficult.  I do not know how I managed to survive the election after that project but I am still a Member of the House and am able to talk about the experience.</P>
    <P>Having thus rapped Bord Fáilte on the knuckles, it must be said that it does an excellent job of marketing this country abroad, sometimes in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  I am aware, from first hand experience and through contacts with representatives in other countries, that the board does a magnificent job of selling this country.  That is why proposals such as that made by the Dublin city manager make the headlines in places such as America.  I have read headlines which stated that holidays in Ireland will now cost people £250 more because of the £3 tax. The tax is perceived to be in place and the sooner the Government publicly states that it rejects that proposal, the sooner tourists contemplating booking their holidays for next year will be able to decide that Ireland is still good value for money and that they will get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>The contribution tourism is making to the economy cannot be underestimated.  Last year it was responsible for generating £2.8 billion in our economy and, as a result of the work of Bord Fáilte and other groups working in tourism, five million people visited this country.  I am sure the vast majority of them were happy with their visit. Ireland is a special place and no matter what one says about costs, prices and so forth, it is certainly a match for any other tourism location in Europe or throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It has my full support.</P>

      <P>Given that the purpose of this Bill is to increase the statutory limits on the aggregate amount of Exchequer grant in aid which can be paid to Bord Fáilte and to support tourism capital development works, it is to be welcomed and I commend the Minister on bringing it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an example of the Government's commitment to the expansion of tourism, and I <Col N="724" /> congratulate the Minister.  In the distribution of any extra moneys that arise from whatever source, I hope the bigger picture of Ireland is always kept in mind.  Nationally the number of visitors to Ireland has exceeded 5 million and foreign earnings of £2 billion represent an increase of 9 per cent on the previous year.  Unfortunately, the increase in visitors nationally has not been seen in every region.  Some areas can say they had as good a summer as last year, but last year's summer was described as relatively poor.  Tourist figures in areas like north Donegal are still relatively poor, and as a result the tourism product still has massive scope for development.  Any extra support the Bill offers should be focused and targeted where it is most needed, though that need not particularly mean money.  We must look at the overdevelopment of Dublin, and the matters debated day in day out in this Chamber, such as traffic congestion, the centralised nature of the city and the pressure this exerts on all those living here, never mind the visitor.  No matter how many bed nights are provided, there are areas of the country where there are still not enough beds for those bussed and flown into them, while other areas remain empty.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a beautiful island, and very few countries can boast the views, atmosphere, cultural heritage and historical sites that can be found from Malin Head to Mizen Head, and from east to west.  There is no longer a justification for not having a more balanced spread of visitors; in that way everybody will win.  I know that is the Minister's aim.  I acknowledge the additional £8.5 million allocated for tourism marketing, and it is in marketing that regions like mine need support.  I was utterly disgusted to read media reports on job creation in the area as recently as last summer which sounded as though electricity and outside toilets have not yet hit Inishowen and Donegal. Such negativity is extremely unfair and unwarranted.</P>
    <P>Great work has already been done by the various tourism bodies on counteracting this type of reporting and on supporting the positive marketing of Donegal, as the Minister knows.  Donegal can sell itself to the visitor who experiences it, but due to our location there have been many difficult years that I now trust have passed with the significant milestone of the British-Irish Agreement. Donegal, and particularly Inishowen, has in the past been too close to the troubles for the tourist.  It has also been too close to the North for the Northern holidaymaker who wishes to get away for a couple of weeks.  After the terrible trauma of August 15, I hope this issue has moved on, but the mindset that sees Donegal as too far and too poor has yet to be changed.</P>
    <P>Last week I travelled by car to Cork to help a young woman, Sinéad Behan, to get elected to the Dáil.  I wish her well, but it took me four hours to get from Dublin to Cork.  On many occasions I have travelled from Dublin to Moville in less time, and Moville would be considered fairly far north even in Donegal.  Donegal is only <Col N="725" /> as far away as one makes it.  I see a need for a change in mindsets, but there is also a need for support for infrastructural access projects, among other matters.  I am delighted that there is an airport in the county at Carrickfin, but I would look forward to the advancement of City of Derry Airport, which would serve the east and north-east of Donegal.  There has been keen interest in a Derry to London air link, and we look forward to confirmation of this.  I ask the Minister for his continued support in this regard; I know he is working with other Ministers to continue to ensure that this type of development is furthered, as it has great tourism and business potential for our constituency.</P>
    <P>The need for a direct train service from Derry to Dublin is also obvious and would assist many other areas, relieving the congested roads into Dublin from both Derry and Belfast.  Cross-Border interaction and interdependence is understood by few outside the region, but for those of us in Donegal North-East, what improves access to Derry improves access for us all, though &ldquo;What Derry gets, we need too&rdquo; may seem a strange statement.</P>
    <P>I eagerly await confirmation that due to our fulfilling the criteria for Objective One status we will receive those funds.  There has been much debate on how 13 counties are going to take something away from the other 13 counties, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Under the criteria, Ireland can only receive aid in Objective One in transition status if it remains a unit, but 13 counties can be given full Objective One status if they are regionalised.  I ask those who begrudge us something they cannot receive to look at the situation.  For example, if the Six Counties were given Objective One status and the Border counties were not, this would cripple Donegal completely, as the Six Counties is our natural hinterland as well as our competition.  The positive edge that Objective One offers has to be matched.  I trust when we retain Objective One status that we will be able to develop our tourist infrastructure even further for projects such as the Inishowen 100, the coastal roads and maritime projects; the Minister will be aware of them.</P>
    <P>I referred to access to the county, but once we have tourists in the county, it sells itself.  The variety of scenery, inland and coastal, and the variety of activities can entertain the most active or inactive holidaymakers.  The most basic tourist requirement is a bed, and the need for varied types of accommodation remains.  I believe studies should be focused on and moneys directed to accommodation black spots.  I congratulate the many entrepreneurs in Donegal North-East who have invested their time and money in developing tourist accommodation, often without a great deal of grant aid being available.  They have created and sustained jobs for many local people and provided various towns and villages with an important focal point.  However, there are still black spots, and we must look imaginatively at the development of a variety of accommodation <Col N="726" /> types with supporting funding being made available. I acknowledge that much work is being done on this issue, but certain specific areas need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Tourism accounts for 115,000 jobs, and Donegal is a county that has so much scope for development that it could absorb a large percentage of the 35,000 jobs the Minister is aiming to develop in the EU Operational Programme, if given the necessary support.  Great ideas are continually coming forward from both business people and voluntary groups.  Agencies like Bord Fáilte have frequently not had sufficient funding to explore them fully.  I trust that the increase in finance included in this Bill will help continue the quest to increase the many projects that will deliver an expansion of the tourist season in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the interdependence of Donegal with places like Derry.  The development of an all-Ireland tourism concept is a vital consideration. The Minister mentioned the progress that has been made on a cross-Border basis. Funding programmes like the International Fund for Ireland and the European Union Peace and Reconciliation Programme have given great support to our region.  I commend them for their work in the area.</P>
    <P>The North West Region Cross Border Group consists of Donegal County Council, Derry City Council, Limavady Borough Council and Strabane District Council; they have worked together for well over 20 years as a cross-Border group and its tourism task team has seen the common problems we have as well as the success we can achieve working together.  I encourage the Minister to support this group in its endeavours, be they the development of the car ferry from Magilligan to Greencastle, the Columban heritage trails that entwine the counties or other projects.  The need for working together is seen within the counties too, and different organisations at various levels co-operate.</P>
    <P>During the summer there were visible signs of the good work done by local historical groups and communities.  For example, there were weekly festivals held throughout the peninsula; the commemorative plaque unveiled at Tramone &mdash; the point from which Thomas D'Arcy Magee fled from Ireland and later became such an influential character in the formation of Canada; the Wolfe Tone commemorations in places like Buncrana; the famine stones unveiled at various points in Inishowen; the Foyle Oyster Festival; the Charles Macklin Autumn School; the Ladies Open and Pro-Am competitions at Ballyliffen; and dozens of other events aimed directly or indirectly at attracting people to the area outside high season.</P>
    <P>Given the volume of activity currently taking place, a certain level of co-ordination is needed to minimise duplication and help maximise the work being done, although I realise it is difficult to achieve a balance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's heart is in developing tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> We are fortunate to have a Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who comes from our county because he is very aware of the great asset we have in Donegal North-East.  I hope there will be a focused examination of the regions and that moneys are directed to the areas in which they are needed to ensure they are developed.  We have a beautiful island and everybody should have an opportunity to see it all.  Donegal does not mind being discovered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1998.  It is a straightforward Bill which provides for an increase in the statutory limit from £22 million to £50 million in the aggregate amount of grant in aid that may be paid to Bord Fáilte to support tourism capital development works.  The Bill also provides Members with an opportunity to comment generally on the tourism industry.  All of us in this House consider ourselves to be experts on the tourism industry. Already the Minister has had at least 2,000 suggestions put to him in relation to tourism.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the proposal from the Dublin City Manager to introduce a room tax of £3 per bed night about which I am greatly concerned. I did not expect Deputy Ferris to make reference to this matter but it is a proposal which will have national consequences.  I fully support the views of the Irish Hotels Federation in this regard that such a proposal will impact negatively on the tourism industry throughout the country, not just in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This proposal will result in a further tax on visitors who are already over-taxed.  It will increase costs for overseas visitors.  Ireland has the fourth highest VAT rate in Europe at 12.5 per cent compared to France at 5.5 per cent, Spain at 7 per cent and Portugal at 5 per cent.  A further tax will only provide another disincentive to visitors.  The tax will also make Dublin less competitive internationally. It is a discriminatory, inequitable tax in that it will affect hotels and guesthouses while many other sectors providing tourist services will not be hit by it.  It will affect a sector already contributing in the form of commercial rates and is an untypical form of revenue.</P>
      <P>Many other countries do not have a similar tax in place.  The tax will make Dublin an unattractive first stop for tourists and that should be of concern to all of us involved in the tourism industry, particularly those in the Dublin area.  This proposal has already resulted in negative publicity for Dublin internationally.  I accept that resources are needed to develop facilities for tourism, but this is not the way to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister received any other advice in relation to the introduction of such a tax at a national level?  I recall a kite being flown during the summer by some group who also proposed <Col N="728" /> that this should be introduced by Government at a national level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is attractive to overseas visitors because it is perceived to have a clean environment.  Our green image is a major selling point but we need to carefully examine this perception. Any analysis of our environmental indicators would suggest that in comparison to other countries, our environment is only average.  We need to examine the air quality in our cities, river and lake water quality, our waste management policies, the use of agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, to name but a few.  We must not become complacent about our so-called green image. There is much work to be done to ensure our environment remains clean and healthy.</P>
      <P>Most surveys indicate that tourists are aware of a litter problem in this country.  The problem seems to be getting worse despite the passing of legislation such as the Litter Pollution Bill.  Existing law is not being enforced.  Local authority structures seem incapable of dealing with the problem and councils are not providing the necessary resources to clean up our streets and countryside.</P>
      <P>The problem of litter is a scandal and has the potential to damage our tourism industry.  One hundred years ago we referred to dear old dirty Dublin.  I wonder how much progress has been made since then when one sees the litter problem that confronts us.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the work of the regional tourism organisations &mdash; the Minister did so also in his contribution &mdash; and in particular to Dublin Tourism, of which I was once a member. Dublin Tourism has been to the forefront in initiating major capital projects, along with the local authority, such as the Tourist Office in Suffolk Street, the Malahide Castle tourist attraction and Newbridge House in the north county Dublin area.  The tourism organisations are to the forefront in promoting and developing tourism in the various regions and they should be fully supported in that regard.</P>
      <P>I congratulate all those involved in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race and the world's biggest annual sporting event, the Tour de France, which came to Ireland this year.  Both events captured the public imagination and generated a great deal of publicity abroad for Ireland.  They proved that Ireland is capable of hosting international sporting events in a friendly and efficient way, and we should continue to do that in the future.  The tall ships race created a wonderful Mardi Gras type atmosphere in Dublin this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the St. Patrick's Day Festival which created a similar atmosphere.  For many years, Dublin Tourism organised the St. Patrick's Day Parade on a shoestring budget.  Its members did a good job with the resources available and I have no doubt that if they had sufficient resources they could have <Col N="729" /> organised a very successful parade.  I welcome the change to a festival held over a number of days, which has been a success.  Frank McDonald, in articles in <i>The Irish Times,</i> was particularly constructive in that regard, something to which the Minister referred in his contribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress made, albeit at a late stage, in relation to the national conference centre. I note what the Minister said about the proposal from Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited.  I am delighted the development will be situated in the docklands.  It is late in the day to be building such a facility, but it is to be hoped it will be built this millennium. It will be a major part of our tourism promotion.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said about how tourism can damage the environment.  Frank McDonald, in that same series of articles during the summer, referred to that and to how towns can be completely destroyed by over-development of tourism.  That is something of which we need to be very conscious.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the future development of the tourism industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of the Bill which deals with the fastest growing industry which will, in coming years, be the largest, far exceeding agriculture.  I am disappointed the Minister said the Bill does not commit the Government to increasing funding for Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry.  Many more resources need to be allocated to capital expenditure within Bord Fáilte to promote the type of projects some of my colleagues mentioned earlier. Over the past 12 months, I have met with a number of potential investors interested in developing projects in County Roscommon. However, as there are no funds available at present from Ireland West Tourism, Bord Fáilte or the Leader groups, it is impossible to start many of the projects.  If additional moneys were put in place, they would help initiate many of them.</P>
      <P>The Leader groups have carried out a tremendous job over the years in promoting tourism and developing these types of projects.  Sadly, much of the funding is now exhausted.  There was also a problem with this funding in that the amount of grant aid it provided for tourism projects was low. It did not encourage people to enter the self-catering accommodation area of the tourism sector. A number of projects involving the rethatching of old houses, something which should be encouraged as it is a valuable skill which is dying out, did not bother to apply for Leader funds because, by the time all the paperwork was completed, only a small grant would be given.  It was not worthwhile for the people involved to fill out the applications and bring their project up to Bord Fáilte standard because they would lose money.  In the end, they abandoned the project and the house has now collapsed.  The types of projects being funded and the amount of funding made available must be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> The Minister is well aware that Roscommon and many midland counties have failed to obtain a fair slice of the tourism cake.  Bord Fáilte must take a fresh approach to developing inland tourism. Non-coastal counties are only used as access to other tourist areas.  One of Bord Fáilte's major objectives is to promote fair and balanced tourism on a regional basis, and this should include counties without a coast.  These have been neglected in the past, being travelled through from Dublin to Galway, Sligo and Donegal.  Foreign tourists must be encouraged to stop in these counties for a night or two.  They need not stay a full two weeks.  One or two nights of a stopover would be of major benefit to these counties and a huge boost to their tourism revenues.</P>
    <P>Many of them have hidden tourist attractions which are not exploited to their full potential.  For example, Roscommon has a huge potential for fishing and shooting holidays.  I was informed recently by a person developing a project in the county that he had a contact in England who could bring a busload of fishermen to a specific area in County Roscommon every week.  The problem was that there was no accommodation for them and adequate facilities do not exist for the development of the angling industry in the county.  An inadequate supply of accommodation is inhibiting the development of the market in many inland counties.</P>
    <P>While tax incentives for hotels in many underdeveloped counties are worthwhile, Bord Fáilte has a great deal of market research and promotion to conduct within the tourism industry and among tourists to ensure the incentives are availed of by developers.  Bord Fáilte and travel operators should encourage people to see parts of hidden Ireland.  There were problems in Kerry this summer because it was black with tourists, yet other parts of the country did not have many tourists.  There needs to be a more even spread. Counties such as Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon have much to offer but are not being adequately promoted by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues in developing any industry, but especially the tourism industry, is infrastructure. The roads to Galway and Westport have been very poorly resourced.  The road from Dublin to Westport is a national disgrace.  It is very hard to encourage tourists in Dublin to hire a car and travel to the west when they must drive on such substandard roads.  The same applies to the road to Galway.  Investment in roads and the rail network, especially the lines to Sligo and Westport, must be examined.  If the resources of the Department of the Environment and Local Government are not put into basic infrastructure, it is hard to encourage tourists to travel.</P>
    <P>Signposting was mentioned by the Minister and Deputy Ferris and is a huge issue.  Anyone who travels through the country will notice the lack of signposting.  I do not know if it is due to vandalism or poor signposting in the first place.  I came from Donegal today.  There was a diversion and I missed a turn on the road.  One would have <Col N="731" /> thought it was not that difficult to get from Donegal to Dublin and that the road would have been well signposted.  We must be conscious of signposting for tourists.  I was made aware of a person developing a small tourism project requiring the erection of five or six signs who was charged £26 per signpost per year by Roscommon County Council.  It will not be worth his while to erect those signs; it is a huge inhibitory cost.  The issue must be examined.</P>
    <P>Other facilities such as sewerage must be considered. In County Roscommon, in Castlerea and Ballintubber, raw sewage pours into the River Suck, which is a major angling river.  Another is Roscommon swimming pool, about which the Minister is fully briefed.  If there is not an adequate swimming pool in the county, it is difficult to encourage families to holiday there.</P>
    <P>One of major issues on the River Shannon is the shortage of moorings for people to tie their boats to so they can visit some of the villages along the river.  The Shannon is a huge corridor for tourism and a huge asset for the midland counties which border it.  A great many boats travel the river during summer, but there is a shortage of mooring spaces, in summer and in winter. A tax incentive or other device must be considered to encourage private developers.  The development of a marina in Lanesborough is being examined.  A valuable asset such as the River Shannon should be fully developed to exploit its full potential.  Perhaps the Minister could examine that.</P>
    <P>I commend an organisation set up in Knock to develop tourism in counties Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon and Leitrim.  It is trying to encourage tourists to fly into Knock International Airport. There are problems with the amount of traffic in Dublin Airport and much of it could be diverted to Knock and Shannon airports.  It would be a valuable asset to counties in the west.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways to get tourists into a locality is by developing flagship projects and County Roscommon has the Hudson Bay Hotel, which is a tremendous asset.  It is a tribute to what both Roscommon County Council and Bord Fáilte have done in developing that facility on the River Shannon.  Another valuable asset in County Roscommon is Lough Kee Forest Park, about which I have written to the Minister.  It has huge potential for development.  It is one of the finest parks in the country.  There are plans for a hotel which would be the kernel for developing tourist facilities for the north-west region, not just for County Roscommon but for the west and the north-west.  It would bring people to the region and they could then go on to Counties Donegal, Sligo and Mayo.  It is a huge asset but Coillte has been sitting on it for years.  At present we are trying to push Coillte on this matter.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to get Coillte to make a commitment on this and to secure a hotel for that area.  We have a site picked out already. We also need a commitment of grant aid for this <Col N="732" /> project.  I am sure that both Bord Fáilte and the Department would be fully committed to this type of thing.</P>
    <P>Tourism promotion is a huge issue for Bord Fáilte, one of the main reasons for its existence. However, many counties are missing out on tourism promotion by Bord Fáilte.  For example, County Roscommon is not even on many of the tourist maps.  Many of these maps do not make reference to any towns in Roscommon or to a road going through the county.  How can we bring tourists to the county if there is no road leading to it?  It is hard to get people to book into a hotel when there is not even a town or a focal point on the maps.  County Roscommon is completely obliterated from many of the Bord Fáilte maps. Many of the midland counties are treated in the same way.  They do not exist unless they are on a national primary route.  I would ask the Minister to look into this.</P>
    <P>Lough Kee Forest Park, to which I referred earlier, is another place which is not in any of the tourism brochures of Bord Fáilte.  Issues like that must be tackled if we are to develop tourism on a regional basis, to which the Minister is committed. This Bill is about putting capital expenditure into these types of projects but we cannot do it unless there is basic promotion.  We are fighting an uphill battle.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at the regional policy of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>We have a valuable asset in our local radio stations which can be used for tourism promotion. In the south-east the local radio station is doing a tremendous job.  It advertises on signposts that tourist information will be broadcast on the radio at certain times.  We should look at developing that promotion through all local radio stations.</P>
    <P>We need to look at new ways of developing tourism in many of the underdeveloped counties of the hidden Ireland like Roscommon.  The county has a strong heritage background.  There is Clonalis House, Strokestown Park House and the King House in Boyle, which was the former capital of Connacht.  Places like these need to be developed and promoted, as do golf and walking holidays if there is to be a regional basis for tourism.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte needs to take the initiative in relation to the driving on the left campaign which has been run for a number of years.  About 12 per cent of accidents in Ireland involve a foreign driver, which is not to say that 12 per cent of accidents are caused by foreign drivers.  There are not enough signs highlighting the danger of driving on the wrong side of the road.  Some of the budget to which the Minister referred should be put into this type of promotion.  Signs should be erected to inform incoming tourists that they must drive on the left hand side of the road.  Information should be provided in hotels and in all brochures, especially those in aircraft.  A section in brochures should set out the driving regulations and procedures in Ireland because the car hire companies have failed us on this issue.  We must look seriously at how we will tackle this problem.  The <Col N="733" /> figure of 12 per cent translates into a considerable number of accidents and the Government is committed to improving road safety.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and look into the possibility, which we debated at the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, of giving relief on car tax to the car hire companies if they install devices, such as audio warning devices, to warn people to drive on the left hand side of the road.  These devices are being developed at present but the car hire companies say they are too expensive.  If we reduced the tax for cars which have these devices installed, everyone could benefit.  We could reduce the number of accidents on the roads and there would be a net benefit to both the tourism industry and the population.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this debate go without mentioning Objective One status, to which the Minister is committed.  He spoke about the European perspective on funding the tourism industry and about capital developments, etc.  I am sure he is well aware that unless Objective One status is retained in the west, the midlands and Border counties, the Government will be restricted in the amount of funds it can funnel into developing the tourism industry there, it will be restricted in the type of tax designation which it can give to these areas and it will restrict Bord Fáilte in the amount of funds it can distribute in these regions.  I hope the Minister will put those issues on the Cabinet table.  There is no point in talking about a Bill which will promote tourism capital expenditure unless we have Objective One status because, as the Minister knows, we will be limited to the amount of funding we can provide for this type of tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Bord Fáilte and CERT need to look seriously at the jobs crisis in the tourism sector. Deputy Perry mentioned that one hotelier had to bring in chefs from France.  The issue is becoming more serious every day.  I doubt there is a hotel in Ireland which is not short of staff and would not take on staff in the morning if they could get them.  If we are to develop this industry, we need to have staff.  The shortage of staff is one of the key issues which will develop within the tourism industry over the coming years.  Now is the time to tackle that through Bord Fáilte, the Department and CERT.  It should be promoted because the two biggest industries, farming and tourism, which are seen as the poorest paying industries in Ireland, are the kernel of economic activity in every county outside the main urban areas.  The farming organisations need to look at the promotion of their industry and the same thing needs to be done within the tourism industry to promote it as a viable industry with career prospects and well paid jobs.  This is a serious concern for many people.  I ask the Minister to look into this issue.</P>
    <P>I commend and support the Bill, but I ask the Minister to ensure that further funds are provided by Bord Fáilte and that it looks on a regional <Col N="734" /> basis to promote counties such as Roscommon and Longford.  The Hudson Bay Hotel in County Roscommon is advertised as being in County Westmeath, which speaks volumes for Ireland-West Tourism.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that there are only three sections to the Bill, it is important legislation and must be supported in an effort to implement the national tourism policies of this Government.  I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit from £22 million to £50 million on the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid that may be paid to Bord Fáilte to support tourism capital development work.  The proposals in the Bill will not involve the recruitment of additional staff. This subject is of deep personal interest to me, given that I have been involved in the tourism business for many years.  The industry is going from strength to strength but that brings with it some problems which need to be ironed out.  The remarkable growth in the tourism industry in the past decade represents an important chapter in the success story of the modern economy.  The increasing number of visitors to Ireland each year and the increasing foreign revenue makes a significant contribution in terms of prosperity and jobs.</P>
      <P>A report by the Economic and Social Research Institute estimates that between 1994 and 1999, over 30,000 jobs will be created in tourism-related jobs in Ireland.  This means that the tourism industry is developing and prospering and it is most likely this trend will continue in the next few years.  Between 1994 and 1999, £369 million will have been spent under the Tourism Operational Programme.  This accounts for over 8 per cent of the overall budget of the EU Structural Funds being spent in Ireland during this period. This money has helped to develop the tourism industry in recent years and the growth potential is there for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government is formulating a national development plan for the years from 2000 to 2006 which will be forwarded to the European Commission outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the seven year period post-1999. This plan is being organised in the context of the negotiations which will take place at European level, relating to the drawdown of the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish tourism should continue to receive EU Structural Funds under the next round of EU moneys to consolidate, underpin and develop progress which has been made in this sector in recent years.  If one considers that between 1994 and 1999 over 30,000 jobs have been created in <Col N="735" /> the tourism industry alone, how many more jobs will be created in this sector during the seven year period post-1999, under the next round of EU Structural Funds?  There is no reason the tourism industry should not receive a similar percentage of EU Structural Funds during the period 2000 to 2006 as currently.  We recognise the amount of EU Structural Funds will be reduced during this period but the tourism industry must not be forgotten or neglected when the national development plan is finally submitted to the EU Commission for its consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to another issue which relates to the need to develop the domestic tourism market in Ireland.  While the increase in the number of foreign tourists is welcome, we must not and cannot lose sight of the importance of developing the domestic tourism market.  This market is worth 24 per cent, almost one quarter of our overall earnings from tourism.  Last year tourism earnings from the domestic market amounted to £671 million, an increase of 16 per cent on the previous year.  That is an encouraging statistic.  It means our own people gave a resounding vote of confidence in Irish holidays, to the tune of nearly £700 million.  It is up to all of us in the tourism industry to ensure this trend continues.  Many more people take an overseas holiday but with the strength of our economy, growing numbers are in a position to take a second holiday or an extended break. An added attraction for the industry is that these extended breaks are usually taken in the off-peak season.  We have to spread the message that there is no more attractive place for that break or that second holiday than right here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important that all regions and sectors of the tourism business share as far as possible in the successful growth of our tourism industry. With that objective in mind, Bord Fáilte and our industry partners must mount a special effort to promote off-season holidays, short-term breaks and a second holiday for the autumn and winter period.  I welcome the fact that the regional tourism marketing initiative is continuing and that £500,000 is to be spent on TV, radio and press publicity promoting off-season holidays.</P>
    <P>In considering the overall performance of tourism, we must take account of the major expansion in accommodation.  This year the number of registered guesthouses is 422, last year it was 377; town and country homes and bed and breakfasts have risen to 4,415, an increase of 358 and in the self-catering sector an additional 833 new premises bring the total to 6,151.  In hotel bedroom capacity terms, the first six months of this year had an overall increase of 15 per cent.  The substantial increase in accommodation is a vote of confidence in the ongoing growth of tourism. Despite any difficulties experienced due to weather or other factors this year, the task for the industry is to work together with Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities to fill those rooms next year and in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of tourists has not <Col N="736" /> been achieved by accident; it is the result of investment in tourism products and marketing on a scale that is unprecedented in our history.  Our strategy is based on a partnership between the State and the private sector to market Ireland aggressively in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>I turn to another issue which relates to the need to continue to invest in our regional and national airports to accommodate the increase in tourist numbers.  Regional airports play a real and tangible role in bringing tourists to Ireland.  The transport network of regional airports plays a constructive role in guaranteeing the decentralisation of tourist traffic in Ireland.  We listened to the debate concerning regionalisation of EU moneys.  Policies must be put in place which ensure that tourists travel to all parts of Ireland so as to pass the benefits of tourism spending nationwide.</P>
    <P>To achieve this sensible, political and social objective, it is important that moneys continue to be invested in our secondary and county road network. If this infrastructure deficit was redressed it would play a part in spreading tourist traffic more evenly across the country.  Various regions in Ireland must be marketed separately to maximise the number of tourists to different areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent Government allocation of £110,000 set aside for the marketing of the midwest region.  The traditional strengths of Ireland in the marketplace are its people, scenery, cultural heritage and environmental quality. However the improvement in the range and quality of tourist facilities has added a dynamic new dimension to Ireland as a place to visit.</P>
    <P>The increase in foreign tourists to Ireland has been boosted by developments in the peace process. We cannot deny that the violence on this island had an effect of rupturing our tourism industry.  It is difficult to market a destination for holidays if violence is taking place in the country. Many Europeans and Americans refuse to holiday in Ireland because of the violence since 1969.  Ireland is small in geographical size.  Many prospective tourists refused to recognise that violence was primarily restricted to the counties of Northern Ireland and took the safe and easy option of simply ruling out Ireland as a holiday destination.</P>
    <P>We all witnessed the horrors of war in the Balkans. Many parts of the Balkans have been untouched by the violence since 1992, nevertheless they all lost tourism revenue because people refused to travel there.  Notwithstanding the protestations of some people, violence in Ireland has affected the tourism industry since 1969.  Peace on the island should ensure we win back those tourists who refused to travel here because of the violence of the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>There have been downsides to the tourism industry in recent years.  The primary problem relates to the recruitment of staff where there are now wholesale shortages.  It is a problem not only restricted to Dublin city.  The growth in the industry has not been matched by a similar growth in <Col N="737" /> the number of qualified people to work in hotels. It is basically a problem of supply and demand where too many hotels in demand are unable to find an appropriate supply of staff.  The Minister and CERT must look closely at possible ways of increasing the number of trained and qualified people in what was known as the food and beverages operations.</P>
    <P>However, overall, the future is bright for the tourism industry.  More people are taking holidays and leisure time is becoming increasingly important.  The imminent arrival of the single European currency will lower the cost of holidays for European tourists as transaction costs will be eliminated and <i>bureaux de change</i> will disappear. We must take advantage of these changes in a structured and co-ordinated way so as to benefit the workings of the tourism industry to the maximum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I hope the increase in Exchequer grant in aid to Bord Fáilte will bear fruit in the coming years.  When we speak about tourism we become parochial because we are here to represent our own county and constituency.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry is now the second largest in the country.  It will be in need of continued support from the EU and the Exchequer.  In this regard the Minister will face the challenge of funding the expectations of the industry in the years ahead.  There has been tremendous investment by the private sector, small communities and voluntary groups in providing a better tourism environment, such as small focal points in areas and heritage sites, and in trying to provide new facilities for tourists.</P>
      <P>However, much of this work and the Minister's support for the regional spread and the expansion of the tourism season will be in vain unless the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority work with him in providing a proper infrastructure for the regions.  It is very unrealistic to expect people to travel across the country from Dublin or Shannon.  Given the location of your constituency, Sir, you will be aware of how difficult it is to do this, or to travel from North to South without encountering problems of access.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental aspect of providing a proper infrastructure to the regions will have to be looked at.  It would complement the regional airports, which must be commended for making a huge impact in providing services for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a quality product and are doing our best to market it.  Following the British-Irish Agreement I hope that we, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, will be able to market the island in its entirety and to use all the access points, including Belfast International Airport <Col N="738" /> and the ports.  We should work together to provide a new impetus to the industry, especially in the north-west.</P>
    <P>We in County Donegal were terribly affected by the troubles in Northern Ireland, although we have benefited from a thriving trade, where many people from Northern Ireland have taken their holidays in County Donegal and the Border regions.  However, there will be challenges in working with the Northern Ireland authorities to ensure that we have a quality product and can compete with the large regions, such as Dublin. Dublin has expanded to the extent that I worry about value for money and the problems of overload in one county, to the detriment of the rest of the east coast.  Every time one travels to Dublin a new hotel is being opened, which gives rise to concern about how beds will be filled.  In addition, things have become very expensive in Dublin.  In view of this, I support the Minister's views on value for money.  If people travel to Dublin and see it is very expensive it acts as a turn-off and it then becomes very difficult to encourage them to travel to the regions.</P>
    <P>With regard to training and the availability of staff, I agree with the view expressed by all speakers that it is very difficult to access good qualified staff in the tourism trade and in catering.  Many people from abroad now work here as chefs, waiters and waitresses.  From my experience in the tourism college in Killybegs I know it is difficult to get young people interested in the business. Anybody who has worked in the tourism trade and the hotel business realises that the hours are not nine to five and that working with the public is very difficult.</P>
    <P>The way we attract people into the industry will be very important.  One aspect will be to provide a proper wage for those working in the industry and to engender in them pride in what they do because it is they who extend the Irish welcome. We will have huge difficulties if people travelling to Ireland do not meet Irish people in the tourism industry.  I hope CERT will work with the Minister in consultation with the industry to try to address these very serious problems.</P>
    <P>One matter which is a bone of contention &mdash; I am sure the Minister is demented listening to it &mdash; is &ldquo;deontasitis&rdquo;.  Everybody wants a grant, but there are many people in the industry, especially in small family-run hotels and guesthouses who have not received any support for the development of their produce.  It is very difficult for them if they are to compete with large hotels which receive tax incentives, etc.  While there are huge amounts of accommodation in some areas and it is difficult to fill beds, there are other areas where the Department, with the regional tourism organisations, should look at the strategic development of accommodation whereby grant aid would be given to upgrade small family-run businesses and hotels to provide what is now expected as the norm in the tourism trade.</P>
    <P>If measures are introduced for one sector demand will multiply, nevertheless, there are <Col N="739" /> strategic areas where there is very little accommodation or where it is of less than desirable quality.  We should consider an investment programme to support people involved in these areas.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister introduced an excellent programme for seven counties which were chosen for a specific investment.  This has been very slow to take off and I hope those who are going to invest do so very quickly so that we can see the fruits of the work done by the Minister, his Department and the Department of Finance.  This is a tremendous opportunity to invest in the product and I would like that to happen as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to value for money, there have been a number of complaints about the cost of car rental.  I know from travelling that it is less expensive to hire a car in Northern Ireland than in the Republic.  We must address that problem if we are to encourage fly-drive tourism into the regions.  It might be a difficult commercial decision to make, but there is great potential to help those who come here by making car hire less expensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  As many speakers have said, tourism is our second biggest industry.  Unfortunately, if the current trends in farming continue, it might not be too long before it is our biggest industry.  We welcome the Minister's proposals to allow the necessary funding to be made available to create an industry which can carry us into the next millennium.</P>
      <P>As has already been said, tremendous movement has taken place on the island as a whole. However, as the Minister is aware, through no fault of successive Governments, we in the Border areas, especially Cavan-Monaghan which was not a traditional area for tourism, have suffered significantly from a lack of interest in tourism over the past few years due to the difficulties across the Border.  It is to be hoped that peace, and the continuation of that process, will augur well for the future.  None of us can afford to act in a single-minded way on this issue, as we have seen some individuals doing in this House and elsewhere recently.  Peace is a very delicate issue and everyone will have to co-operate fully in trying to understand the other side if it is to continue. It was agreed some years ago that there would be joint co-operation between the Northern Ireland tourist authority and Bord Fáilte.  The chief executive of the Northern Ireland tourist board comes from Clones and he understands what needs to happen if the two groups are to work together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the exact figures, but bed nights in Northern Ireland hotels have dropped significantly <Col N="740" /> over the past 30 years as a direct result of the Troubles.  We must hope that will not happen in the future.  Tourism is one of the areas which can, and should, benefit most from the co-operation of the two Governments and the new structures which we hope will be put in place in the next few days.  We in the Border region have a great deal to look forward to in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was in Canada recently as part of a delegation from Monaghan County Council which was promoting the idea of tourists returning to trace their roots, in which there was a great deal of interest. It was clear from those who had visited Southern Ireland in the past that they did not get much encouragement when they arrived in Dublin Airport to travel to the North.  They were advised about the scenery in Wicklow, Killarney, Galway and even Donegal, but there was no great enthusiasm for advising them to visit my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>We hope the joint co-operation between North and South will bring many North American tourists into Belfast Airport, which would automatically bring them into that region.  Monaghan County Council and other bodies are trying to facilitate that co-operation to ensure we get those tourists for at least a few days.  Some of the best hotels in Ireland are in the Border counties, particularly Monaghan, and we can certainly cope with the numbers that are likely to come.  Belfast Airport and the Larne to Stranraer and Belfast to Stranraer routes will be very important connections for tourism in the Border regions in the future.</P>
    <P>It will have a major impact if we get Objective One status for the Border regions.  There has been a lack of finance for infrastructure.  Deputy Coughlan, the Minister's colleague, and others on that side of the House have spoken about the difficulties caused by the lack of infrastructure. However, while Donegal has airport facilities, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that Cavan-Monaghan has neither airports nor railways and the only access for tourists is by road &mdash; unless the Minister wishes to come by helicopter, which he is welcome to do.  I realise why the Minister flies by helicopter to Donegal.  There is no by-pass between Dublin and Monaghan, which is an indication of the difficulties we experience in getting business and tourists to our county.  There are by-passes across the Border in Ballygawley, Omagh and Lifford but there is no by-pass in Monaghan, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and Ardee and the area covered by the 30 mile speed limit gets longer and longer.  It used to take me an hour and three-quarters to travel to Dublin but it now takes me between two and a quarter hours and two and a half hours.  That will not encourage tourism.  I accept that does not come within the Minister's remit, but he is a member of the Government and must ensure the roads are improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to another important issue in Border counties, guesthouses and farm homes.  As a result of the Troubles, we <Col N="741" /> have not had similar activity in that area as many other counties.  While Leader and other funding bodies have been helpful in the past, there is no finance available from the funding bodies today to help people to set up guesthouses.  That must be examined.  I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the Chamber because he can help the Minister in that regard.  The Celtic tiger must spread to the Border regions.</P>
    <P>The lack of support for family run hotels is also a major problem.  Many good family run hotels are trying to compete with other organisations which have received major funding for sports complexes and so on.  This puts small family run hotels at a serious disadvantage.  I have asked not just this Minister but his predecessor to address that matter. I am disappointed that successive Governments have not seen the need to provide that help.  The staff issue is one which needs to be seriously addressed.  I will talk about that at length when we return to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>During much of the late 1980s and early 1990s we in the Labour Party and many like us were greatly exercised by issues like corruption, abuse of power, tax evasion and the like. My former party leader, Deputy Spring, made <Col N="742" /> countless speeches in the Dáil criticising the existence of golden circles and old boys networks.  In doing that, we were reflecting a deep unease in society, a feeling that Irish society was basically unfair, that some people were creaming it off at the expense of others and that there was one law for the rich and one law for the poor.</P>
      <P>Taxation was and still is the core of the issue for many people.  PAYE workers have long believed that they are treated unfairly by the taxation system.  It is now nearly 20 years since hundreds of thousands of workers took to the streets of Dublin and cities throughout the country to protest against the system which extracted and continues to extract every last penny of liability from PAYE workers but seems incapable of bringing the richest in our society to account.  In truth, we did not know how right we were.</P>
      <P>The revelations of the past fortnight have done immense damage to the financial institutions of this State.  We now know beyond a shadow of doubt that tens of thousands of people actively and deliberately engaged in wholesale tax evasion for a period of time in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  We also know that two of the largest banks in this State connived in and facilitated tax evasion.</P>
      <P>Colleagues in this House have said on previous occasions that these revelations have evoked a significant level of anger among the public.  That is right, but something even more important is happening.  A large number of people are not just angry, they are also cynical and resigned.  It is important that we in this House acknowledge this basic harsh truth.  That truth is that very many people are angry with what happened but they have little or no confidence that the Government and this House will do anything to put it right.  In that sense, these revelations and this crisis are a problem not only for the banking sector; it is an important test for our democratic institutions and, in particular, for this House.  It is a test which we cannot and must not fail.</P>
      <P>There are at least three things which we must seek to do.  First, we must ensure that all the facts are put before the public.  Second, we must satisfy ourselves and the public that proper accounting has been given and that the matter has been brought to an end in a way that is fair to all concerned. Finally, we need to be sure that nothing of this kind is going on as we speak and we need to put in place structures and institutions which are capable of ensuring and charged to ensure that nothing of this kind happens again.  All of this must be done speedily and in a cost effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us is strictly limited in what we are seeking to do.  We have been advised, and we know the committee has been advised, that it has already strayed beyond its normal terms of reference.  The role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to scrutinise the way in which public funds are spent.  It has no role, on the face of it, in carrying out an investigation of the kind in which it has embarked.  I applaud the committee <Col N="743" /> and, in particular, its chairperson for taking the initiative in dealing with this issue.  The fact, however, remains that the committee has currently no legal power to deal with the issue.  In tabling this motion this evening, we, in the Labour Party, are seeking to play our part in putting that matter right.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is entitled to charge any committee of the House with any task it chooses to give to it.  Since the Committee of Public Accounts has no inherent power to deal with an issue of this kind, it is necessary that the Dáil should delegate that power to the Committee of Public Accounts or some other committee.  Our motion seeks to do just that.  In particular, and without going into the details of the motion, we are seeking to instruct the committee to examine and report to the Dáil having considered, in the course of its examination, the appropriation accounts of the Revenue Commissioners and the position in relation to outstanding liabilities for DIRT on the part of AIB.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the original text of the motion was placed on the Order Paper last Tuesday.  We, particularly my party leader, Deputy Quinn, indicated to the Taoiseach during the Order of Business last week that we were willing to talk to him and his officials about the wording of any motion.  I welcome the fact the Government has agreed to a revised motion which is now before the House.  The matter is still one of considerable urgency and that is why we, in the Labour Party, took the opportunity to raise it during our Private Members' time this week.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has already strayed beyond its normal remit.  So far, it has done so with the voluntary co-operation of the individuals concerned.  However, it does not require much foresight to see that there are significant problems looming on the horizon.  The moment the committee starts getting too close to the bone, the moment it hits a raw nerve, as sure as night follows day a High Court injunction will be sought to stop it in its tracks.  The road block is there for all to see.  It is time for this House to act promptly, anticipate the problem and solve it as soon as possible.  Let me spell out the position in even more clear-cut terms.  I and the Labour Party believe that it would be very unwise for the committee to hold any further hearings until such time as its investigation is put on a sound legal basis.  This can only be done by passing this motion this evening.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter of precedent.  It is by no means the first time the committee or any other committee has undertaken work of this kind, but it is one of the first.  I had the experience of being on the committee which, broadly speaking, inquired into the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in 1994 and early 1995.  It was, to say the least, an interesting experience and much of the material before the committee was of considerable public interest.  However, it became very clear to us at an early stage that the <Col N="744" /> committee was seriously circumscribed in what it could do.  We were advised by the then senior counsel, Gerry Durkan, who was adviser to the committee, that it would be unwise, for example, for us to make findings of fact.  It seems clear that advice still holds and I know it has been repeated in advice given to the committee this week.  The committee in that sense can only offer an opinion but that is not to say it does not nonetheless have a seriously important role in bringing out the facts and laying them before the committee and the Dáil and indirectly, therefore, before the public.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that when we consider how we go about this business this week we need to have an eye to the future.  We need to establish the role of the Oireachtas and its committees &mdash; not necessarily the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; in speedily investigating matters of public importance in a way which brings out the facts and which is cost effective.  We must make it clear that we have learned from the experience of the beef tribunal and subsequent tribunals and that there is a better way of doing business, a way which establishes the legitimacy of this House in investigating matters of public interest.</P>
    <P>It is not just sufficient that we give terms of reference to the committee to allow it to do that work.  Further legislation will also be necessary.  I understand the committee will look at the possibility of having investigative work carried out on its behalf by another agency or body, be it the Comptroller and Auditor General or somebody else.  That too will require a change in legislation and I am happy to confirm on behalf of the Labour Party that we will facilitate the passage of such legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand the committee intends to hold additional public hearings and is only right and fair that it should do so.  It is important that committees are fair and are seen to be so in the way in which they do their business.  The Committee of Public Accounts must give an opportunity to those whose names and activities have been mentioned during the course of its deliberation to give their side of the story.  It must also give an opportunity to representatives of banks other than AIB to clear their name and to indicate to the committee and the public whether activities of a questionable nature were going on in their banks during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Directors of AIB made it clear last week that they consider this problem to be an industry-wide one.  The public is entitled to know if this is the case.  For their part, the other banks are entitled to an opportunity to put the record straight.  The committee must decide whether it requires further powers of investigation or discovery to facilitate additional hearings.  It appears inevitable that such powers will be required.  The Labour Party will facilitate the provision of such powers.</P>
    <P>Throughout this matter, we must remain focused on what we are seeking to achieve.  In the first instance we need information.  We need answers to some of the questions which have arisen in the past fortnight.  We need to know in <Col N="745" /> simple terms who is telling the truth.  We need to be told whether there was a settlement of the bank's liability for DIRT.  We need to know what information was given by the bank to the Revenue Commissioners.  We need to know what understanding, if any, existed between the bank and the Revenue Commissioners about previous liabilities.</P>
    <P>We need to know whether or to what extent the Central Bank and the Government at the time knew what was happening in Allied Irish Bank and the other banks.  We should be told what action, if any, was taken by the bank or the Revenue Commissioners to make the individual holders of bogus accounts responsible for their actions.  We must be told whether any settlement was made with other banks or financial institutions in relation to the liability for DIRT for the period in question.</P>
    <P>Once the committee has received all this information, it will be a matter for it and its members to draw conclusions and make recommendations. I do not intend or wish to pre-empt those conclusions but the least to which the public is entitled is an assurance that those abuses have ended.  The least the public will demand is that all arrears of taxes will be paid and those responsible for tax evasion in the past will be brought to book in as much as that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is important for the future that we establish structures and mechanisms to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that something like this does not happen again.  These events, and events earlier in the year in National Irish Bank, demonstrate major problems regarding the way in which we seek to regulate and supervise financial institutions. In response, I understand the Government announced today its intention to set up a single regulator or a financial supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate about this issue has been badly informed.  There is a great deal of fuzzy thinking about it.  I wish to set out the Labour Party's position as clearly as possible.  The Central Bank is responsible for the prudential supervision and regulation of banks.  It derives that power from the Central Bank Acts.  These Acts were amended as recently as a few months ago to deal with the implications of EMU.  However, it is important to note that the power of the Dáil to define the role of the Central Bank in the commercial banking sector is seriously limited by the European banking directives issued over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The European Monetary Institute, the EMI, which is the precursor to the ECB, has set out clearly the role of the Central Bank and that of national central banks in other countries in relation to the banking sector.  As the Minister is aware, we have little or no flexibility in giving the bank additional functions or in taking away some of its existing functions in prudential supervision. The Central Bank has no function or role in consumer rights, nor does it have a role in the collection of taxes.  More importantly, it cannot be <Col N="746" /> given such a role because the Dáil is prohibited by the European treaties and the ECB from doing so.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we are clear about this aspect. Matters such as the maintenance of huge numbers of bogus non-resident accounts and the non-payment of DIRT or any other tax are of concern to the Central Bank only in as much as they infringe on the stability of the banking sector or any particular bank.  They are not concerned with those issues as such.  It is fair to criticise the Central Bank for not looking at the matters which have been raised in the context of the overall prudential supervision of the banking sector or the stability of a particular bank, in this case the AIB. However, it is not reasonable to criticise the Central Bank for not exercising powers which it does not have.  It is not fair to criticise the bank and its employees because it did not exercise a function which it did not have and which the Dáil did not and could not have given it.</P>
    <P>This problem is common to all EU states and almost all of them have moved to fill the gap in regulation by setting up a unitary regulator or a financial supervisory authority.  This regulator should look after the interests of the consumers both individually and collectively.  The regulator should have the power and the duty to notify the Revenue Commissioners and any other relevant authority of irregularities it comes across.  It should not be bound by the strictures of confidentiality which currently govern the activities of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The financial services sector is expanding all the time.  Building societies and credit unions are now providing a much expanded range of services. The number of financial advisers and intermediaries is multiplying all the time.  It is likely that economic and monetary union will make the entire sector even more competitive at least in the first instance with all the risks and opportunities that implies.  As matters stand, virtually all the providers of financial services, including banks, building societies, insurance companies, investment intermediaries, advisers, the Stock Exchange and others, are subject to independent and separate regulation and supervision.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to those concerned to acknowledge that the system of regulation is infinitely better now than it was five or ten years ago. However, so too are the challenges to the system. Other EU countries have dealt with the problems that have arisen by establishing a separate financial supervisory authority.  The former Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment considered this issue several years ago and recommended the establishment of such an authority in Ireland.  Earlier this year the Committee on Finance and the Public Service considered the proposal in the context of the revelations about NIB and others.  This committee also concluded that a single regulator was the best way forward.  The arguments are persuasive and conclusive.  The expertise built up over a number of years in the <Col N="747" /> separate regulatory authorities can be pooled and shared between the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal in detail with the argument for a regulatory authority.  The Minister is aware of it and I assume from his announcement today that it has been essentially conceded. However, I do not understand why it is necessary to wait a further six months before it is possible to implement the decision.  There are plenty of other precedents in other parts of Europe.  In conjunction with other members of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I had the opportunity to visit several Nordic countries and Germany in early summer.  We held detailed discussions with representatives of the equivalent authorities in those countries and it is fair to state that we were impressed by what we found and persuaded of the case to introduce such an authority. The experience exists in other countries of introducing authorities and regulators of this nature. We can learn a great deal from that experience.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the newspapers this morning suggested that we would follow the British precedent in this.  However, the Minister is aware that the British precedent has been in place for only a relatively short period.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced it only a few months ago.  It occasionally frustrates and surprises me that we appear to be so quick and anxious to borrow from British practices, in this case a recently established practice, rather than look further afield at precedents and experience that is embedded a great deal longer.</P>
    <P>I was struck and interested by the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank last week.  We need to be clear and fair about the role of the bank as it is currently constituted.  There are many people in the Central Bank who have experience and expertise gained over the years in the business of supervising financial institutions, principally banks.  It is obvious that this experience and expertise should continue to be available to the State in seeking to do this job in the future.  In the past, the business of supervision and regulation has been carried out almost exclusively by public servants and it is only right that this should be so.  I expect that it will continue to be the case.  However, it would also be useful if we could benefit from the experience of people who have worked in financial institutions in the industry in seeking to regulate them in the future.  To that end, the supervisory authority may seek to draw from the experience of the private sector as well as the expertise which currently exists in the public sector and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The experience of the past two weeks has not been good for banking and financial institutions. However, if we handle the challenge competently and properly and deal with the problems in an honest and upfront manner, the system as a whole may be better for the experience.  The people who made the revelations have done us <Col N="748" /> all a service and they have provided us with an opportunity.  They have told us what we were entitled to know and they have given us an opportunity to expose the weaknesses in the system in a way which presents no threat to it.  If we can get it right and rise to the challenge, the banking and taxation systems and our democratic institutions will be all the better for the experience.</P>

      <P>This motion is important for the House, for politicians and, most importantly, for our constitutents who are outraged by the allegations in recent weeks.  If passed, this motion will remove any doubt that the Committee of Public Accounts may not be acting within its powers in its investigation of the avoidance of DIRT on supposedly non-resident accounts by customers of AIB and all financial institutions.  As a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts I congratulate the Comptroller and Auditor General, John Purcell, the chairman, Deputy Mitchell, and the members for the initiatives they have taken.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is acting in response to the mood of massive public outrage.  Our motion represents the first step towards putting in place appropriate measures to allow a full and proper investigation of all the revelations which have outraged the public.  Like the Minister, I too felt this outrage during the past two weeks in my constituency and in Cork South Central where I met people who campaigned by way of tax marches of the early 1980s, when we had one of the highest tax rates in Europe.  The people are outraged by what they see as double standards in the collection of taxation and the allegations that have been made.  Those who suffered from the vicious cutbacks in health, education and social welfare between 1987 and 1991 are astounded at the effrontery of the double standards in taxation which have been revealed.</P>
      <P>Many journalists have pointed out the severity with which the legal system dealt with a handbag snatcher and someone who defrauded a bank of £500 and they have contrasted this with what they view as criminal acts, based on the <i>prima facie</i> evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts, and are looking to this House and the Committee of Public Accounts to take action.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I asked the Minister to re-examine a study on the black economy carried out by a professor of economics at Linz University, based on money flows and methods of calculating GDP.  This study estimated that the black economy could be up to 16 per cent larger than thought.  However, the only response from the Department of Finance was the usual bland statements that this was not the case, that the House had nothing to worry about and that Members should return to their regular work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Committee of Public Accounts is critically important.  It would be naive to deny that there is a suspicion among the public that politicians are not determined to get to the bottom <Col N="749" /> of this affair.  It is in our collective interest to dispel these fears by supporting the committee and its work.</P>
    <P>The report of the beef tribunal and attempts by the Committee of Public Accounts to shadow some of the allegations made at that tribunal have highlighted the public's concern at the existence of a golden circle.  There is a fear that, during the last decade, at least one senior politician was bailed out by the bank which is the subject of the current allegations.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House does not cut across the options open to the Committee of Public Accounts or its chairman.  If the Committee of Public Accounts believes that an agent should act on its behalf on the compilation of evidence, the Labour Party will play a constructive role in ensuring that it receives the appropriate power. However, we will not be limited to any request for additional powers made by the committee and we will seek to strengthen those powers if we consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>I was proud to be a Labour Member of the Committee of Public Accounts during the four and half years of the 27th Dáil.  The then committee was well assisted by the outstanding services of the former and current Comptrollers and Auditor General.  Before the passing of the compellability of witnesses legislation, brought to the fore by the Labour Party, the Committee of Public Accounts had no power to demand the attendance of persons or the production of documents. In cases of fairly serious fraud against the State we had little or no power to carry out the kind of investigation which could have led to a detailed memorandum for the Director of Public Prosecutions or the National Bureau of Fraud Investigations. To his credit, the comptroller has carried out many value for money reports, some of which have made interesting comments on the financial and economic habits of this House and State agencies.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts was hamstrung when dealing with the rip-off of intervention stocks and the massive tax evasion which took place in the beef industry.  Our proceedings could not even be broadcast because our minutes took months and sometimes years to be approved by the House.  However, in one article Fintan O'Toole claimed to have seen the Committee of Public Accounts on television.  To my knowledge our proceedings were not broadcast until recently.  The Labour Party proposes that this archaic system be brought to an end to ensure that the committee becomes, as it was intended to be, an investigative body with real teeth.  This is why we will be proposing strengthening legislation for the Committee of Public Accounts during the coming week.</P>
    <P>There is a clear obligation on the House to get to the bottom of the conflicting evidence presented to the Committee of Public Accounts in the past few days.  At the centre of the dispute is whether a £14 million settlement was reached between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB in <Col N="750" /> respect of a liability of £100 million.  Any such settlement which involved AIB, a financial institution bailed out by the State only five years before, would be unacceptable.  Many Members of this House believed in the mid 1980s that that bail out should only have been permitted on the basis that the State took a stake in AIB.  AIB could and should pay its full liability as should any other body engaging in such practices.</P>
    <P>The conflicting and irreconcilable accounts given to the Committee of Public Accounts by Mr. Tom Mulcahy and Mr. Dermot Quigley are truly remarkable.  It is crucial that the only written record of the meeting between the AIB and the Revenue Commissioners seems to be a memo written by Mr. Jimmy O'Mahony, AIB's group taxation manager.  The memo refers to all financial institutions putting their houses in order with no retrospection prior to 5 April 1990, and states that any irregularities discovered after 30 June 1991 will be subject to prosecution.</P>
    <P>At the time, the Revenue Commissioners raised concerns about the practice of branch managers accepting declarations on bogus non-resident accounts, and at AIB's alleged ability to use offshore facilities in a possibly illegal way.  Apparently Mr. Mac Carthaigh of the Revenue Commissioners wrote to Mr. Jimmy O'Mahony following the disputed meeting and stated that all bogus offshore accounts discovered after 30 June 1991 would be the subject of a DIRT payment without penalty and retrospection.  However, Dermot Quigley, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, vehemently denies that his officials negotiated any sweet deal with AIB in 1991, let alone £14 million in settlement of an alleged tax liability of £100 million.</P>
    <P>On the Revenue side, the key point relates to the power Mr. Mac Carthaigh or any other commissioner had to negotiate taxes legally owed to this State.  The income tax Acts in force from 1991-3 clearly deemed it an offence to make an incorrect statement or fraudulent declaration.  As the distinguished journalist, Mr. Vincent Browne, correctly estimated under the 1967 Act, the liability of £100 million calculated by Mr. Jimmy O'Mahony would incur a payment with penalties by AIB of £200,000,100.</P>
    <P>On the evidence given by Mr. Tom Mulcahy to the committee, the obvious question that arises is why he and his officials could not estimate the number of bogus accounts in the relevant period. I understand members of the committee attempted unsuccessfully to elicit that information. Nor did Mr. Mulcahy address the issue of the missing 17,000 non-resident account certificates outlined in the audit material published in <i>Magill.</i>  Indeed, much of the tenor of Mr. Mulcahy's statement to the Committee of Public Accounts is very disturbing.  I am thinking of phrases such as &ldquo;forward looking,&rdquo;- used in relation to what were clearly legal obligations and liabilities and criminal offences taking place across the industry &mdash; settlements being reached &ldquo;without penalty or publication&rdquo; and &ldquo;a pragmatic <Col N="751" /> solution to a sensitive issue&rdquo;.  Off the cuff estimates were outlined in regard to the 53,000 bogus accounts.  Can it be true that, as AIB representatives claimed, the bank did not make any profit from this when much of the money was clearly channelled to another branch of the organisation?  Was it not the case in 1991 that bank officials known by the Revenue Commissioners to be in any way aiding and abetting the making of false tax declarations could be prosecuted under section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983 with the possible imposition of fines up to £10,000 and a jail term of five years?  Why did this not happen?</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts must resolve all these questions.  If and when that occurs, a clear signal should go out from this House that no stone will be left unturned in the State's efforts to recover its money.  If there is evidence that bankers or others colluded or assisted in defrauding the Exchequer, they must face the full rigours of the law.  It is difficult to believe there was not widespread collusion in the banking system in regard to the establishment of bogus non-resident accounts by AIB and other banks.  I wrote to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to ask whether such a practice constitutes fraud against the taxpayer.  The Minister may be interested to know that I received a reply this morning from a Superintendent Glacken in which he indicates that he is waiting for a formal complaint about the matter.  He states:</P>
    <P>Should you have evidence of a breach of the criminal law and make same available to us, we will conduct a full and thorough investigation.</P>
    <P>As members of the media have pointed out in recent weeks, these are matters for the Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  There cannot be two standards, one for the 800,000 people who do their best to meet their income tax liabilities and another for a golden circle of cute hoors.</P>
    <P>In their evidence to the committee, AIB representatives stated they were only now computing their DIRT liability for the relevant years and disputed the figures of the internal auditor, Mr. Spollen.  They maintain the liability is far less than £100 million.  Perhaps this is the case, but AIB must give a firm commitment to pay the amount due when they have computed it.</P>
    <P>Some of the evidence submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts was disingenuous in the extreme.  Mr. Mulcahy informed the committee that the very existence of the banking system was in danger at that time.  The Minister took the same line in a radio interview on Sunday morning in which he focused on the issue of stability and relegated the issues of probity and fairness way down the list.  AIB disputed the £100 million figure, alleging that the actual figure was much lower.  A much lower figure would not, of course, pose such a threat.  Whatever way one looks at the matter, the circle cannot be squared.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners also have questions <Col N="752" /> to answer.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I raised the issue of non-compliance with the taxation code year after year, but was informed there was little or nothing to worry about.  This has proven not to be the case.  I have with me the 1992 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners stated that if any investigation undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners revealed that a taxpayer had failed to disclose relevant information resulting in underpayment of tax, legal proceedings could be instigated. The report also outlines various types of liabilities.  There is no mention of the fact that at the time the matter of the disturbing amounts of tax owed was being raised, the chairman, in defiance of the committee to some extent, made an outrageous settlement with AIB.  In a later report in 1994, I was struck by the fact that outstanding taxes were estimated to amount to £2.2 billion.  Once again, no reference appears to major liabilities by AIB or any other banks.  An incredible double standard seems to have been in operation.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of the serious criminal offences with which we are dealing.  Any person who knowingly aids, abets, assists, incites or induces another person to make or deliver knowingly or willfully any indirect returns, statements or accounts in connection with any tax is guilty of an offence for which there is a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The revelations made in recent years in connection with the conduct of tax and public affairs in this country, particularly in the 1980s, have been increasingly disturbing.  The extent of noncompliance with tax laws by many of the State's citizens is an affront to the vast majority of compliant taxpayers, especially within the PAYE sector. Yet the 1980s and early 1990s, a period synonymous with greed, have given rise to three tribunals, a number of high court investigations and the current investigation by the PAC.  Those of us who argued that something serious was amiss in Irish society were often decried as whingers and moaners.  Sadly, we have been proven right.  Thus far, we have failed to bring anyone fully to book for these actions and that is damaging the reputation of politicians and, more importantly, of politics itself.  I think it was Dick Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i> who said that when politics is damaged, it is those who believe in politics most who suffer most.  Like many Deputies, I count myself among such people.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is charged with a difficult task.  However, it also has an opportunity to restore the reputation of our profession among the general public.  That is an opportunity this House cannot afford to miss.  My party tabled this motion because we believe it is imperative we act with a sense of urgency.  This measure is but one move which must be taken immediately and does not cut across the granting of any other legal powers the committee may request.  The substance of the motion, as agreed <Col N="753" /> by the Government, differs little from motion No. 49<i>a</i> on today's original Order Paper.  It gives the committee the competence to invoke its compellability powers under the 1997 legislation although that Act will need to be amended to allow compellability in regard to issues concerning taxation.  The agent chosen by the committee, if it decides to use one, may also need to be given powers of discovery along the lines provided to High Court inspectors.  This too will probably require legislation.  In regard to the cost of these investigations and any other costs necessitated by a Garda investigation, I have proposed that the Minister should seek to ensure the banks themselves pay for this.  It might, if necessary, be done through a renewal of the bank levy based on the estimated cost of getting to the bottom of the matter.  This is what the public wants.  I support my colleague's comments in relation to the financial regulator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ardagh.</P>
      <P>I emphasise to the House that the Government is fully conscious of the public concerns about the recent developments in regard to DIRT collection and in consequence would like to assist the Committee of Public Accounts as much as possible in continuing its investigative role in regard to this matter.  I congratulate the committee on the rapid progress it has already made in its investigations. It has moved with commendable speed to follow up a matter of major public concern.</P>
      <P>I understand the committee is considering whether it needs any additional powers to pursue its investigations fully.  It is also considering whether legislative changes are needed for this purpose, which could involve increasing the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In light of the committee's ongoing deliberations on this important issue, I look forward to its conclusions and recommendations on what legislative or other changes it sees as necessary to finalise its work.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the role of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, I wish to outline why DIRT was introduced and how it has operated.  I also wish to set out the position in regard to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.  Prior to the introduction of deposit interest retention tax in 1986, banks paid interest gross to their depositors without deduction of tax but were obliged to report to Revenue any case in which interest exceeding £50 in a year arose. Building societies, in contrast, deducted tax on the interest due to their depositors and shareholders under a composite rate arrangement and were not obliged to make returns of interest to Revenue.  At that time banks did not have to return details of deposit interest over £50 where the account holder served a notice on the bank declaring on a form, known as Form F, that the beneficial owner of the interest on the account was not ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, under section 17 of the Finance Act, <Col N="754" /> 1983, a bank was obliged to require an affidavit from a person claiming non-resident status where the bank was not satisfied that the person was non-resident.  These claims and affidavits were to be retained and made available to the Revenue Commissioners if requested.</P>
    <P>A budget day financial resolution in 1986 which was incorporated into Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act, 1986, introduced deposit interest retention tax.  The introduction of DIRT was intended to harmonise the tax treatment of deposit interest across the range of financial institutions, to increase tax revenue and to counter tax evasion more effectively.  With effect from 6 April 1986, a retention tax, at the standard rate of income tax which was then 35 per cent, was deducted at source out of interest paid or credited on bank and building society deposits in the beneficial ownership of residents.  The composite tax arrangement with the building societies was terminated from that date.</P>
    <P>DIRT requires financial institutions to deduct tax at source from deposit interest earned by individuals who are tax resident in Ireland.  Between 1986 and 1993 the rate of deduction was the standard income tax rate and DIRT was deducted in two half yearly instalments in October and April. From 1986 onwards banks and building societies were treated in the same way, both deducting tax from the interest paid to residents, and the obligation to notify Revenue of deposit interest was done away with.</P>
    <P>Companies could offset the DIRT retained against liability to corporation tax.  In addition to DIRT, between 1986 and 1993 individuals liable at the higher rates of income tax were liable to tax on their gross interest at the difference between the standard rate and the appropriate higher rate and were obliged to declare this to Revenue when completing their tax returns.  In other words, depositors faced an income tax liability at their marginal rate in respect of the interest income, with credit for the DIRT already paid.</P>
    <P>DIRT does not apply where the account holder is non-resident and makes a formal declaration to that effect to the financial institution.  The law requires that the declaration should contain, <i>inter alia</i>, the name, address and country of tax residence of the person entitled to the deposit interest.  The financial institution has a duty under the legislation to satisfy itself that a deposit is exempt from DIRT before it pays any interest gross.  To qualify for exemption the deposit taker has to hold a valid declaration in respect of the deposit showing the name and address outside the State of the person beneficially entitled to the interest.  The declaration is made available to the Revenue Commissioners on request.</P>
    <P>The advent of EU-wide capital liberalisation from 1 January 1993 led to the very real danger that Irish depositors would choose to evade tax by transferring their funds to other EU countries without declaring interest on these foreign accounts to Revenue.  It was considered that a tax driven outflow of funds would lead to upward <Col N="755" /> pressure on interest rates as well as an unacceptably high loss of tax revenues.  In order to deal with this the DIRT regime was altered in three principal respects.  These measures were intended to protect Exchequer revenues to the maximum extent consistent with the need to avoid significant capital outflows.</P>
    <P>The three principal changes may be set out as follows.  Special savings accounts, or SSAs, were introduced on 1 January 1993 subject to final liability DIRT at the low rate of 10 per cent.  This rate was increased to 15 per cent in the 1995 budget and was further increased to 20 per cent in the 1998 budget.  This latter increase was effective from 6 April 1998.  SSAs are targeted at the more mobile funds held by small to medium investors and offer a higher net return than ordinary deposit accounts.  There are a number of conditions, most notably that an individual may hold no more than £50,000 in an SSA.  However, a married couple may hold two individual SSAs separately or two joint SSAs, each with a maximum of £50,000.</P>
    <P>Standard rate DIRT tax now satisfies the depositor's full liability to income tax in respect of his interest income, even if he pays income tax at the higher 46 per cent rate on his marginal income.  In other words, DIRT became a final liability tax.  However, the interest subject to the standard rate DIRT remains liable to PRSI and the other levies and must be included in the taxpayers return of income.  This measure was designed to reduce the incentive for depositors to transfer funds into either low DIRT SSAs or foreign accounts.</P>
    <P>Companies may now operate DIRT free accounts, although the interest income is subject to corporation tax.  This measure provides a cash flow advantage for businesses and so reduces the incentive for them to operate overseas accounts.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of DIRT there have been two special categories of individuals who could receive a refund of DIRT paid.  These are individuals over 65 years of age and disabled individuals who would not be liable, or fully liable, to income tax on their deposit interest because their taxable income would be too low.  Such individuals are entitled to a subsequent refund or partial refund of DIRT paid to Revenue.  Almost £12 million in refunds was paid in 1997, representing about 7.25 per cent of the gross DIRT yield.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1986, the DIRT system has resulted in the collection of about £2.5 billion by the State.  The yield, net of refunds for each year, is as follows: 1986 &mdash; £137 million; 1987 &mdash; £297 million; 1988 &mdash; £206 million; 1989 &mdash; £185 million; 1990 &mdash; £271 million; 1991 &mdash; £261 million; 1992 &mdash; £255 million; 1993 &mdash; £260 million; 1994 &mdash; £90 million; 1995 &mdash; £114 million; 1996 &mdash; £126 million; 1997 &mdash; £148 million; 1998 &mdash; £67 million.  The total amount is £2,415 million.</P>
    <P>While the annual yield was as high as £271 million in 1990, the amount of moneys collected has since fallen.  The reduction in yield reflects among <Col N="756" /> other things the significant decline in interest rates, the introduction of the special savings accounts with their low rate of DIRT and the general decline in the standard rate of DIRT.  The yield to date for 1998 is £66.7 million.  However, this does not include the October payment which accounts for somewhere in the region of two-thirds of the total yield.</P>
    <P>At present it is the general practice of member states not to tax the interest income of non-residents and this has created opportunities for evasion leading to an erosion of national tax revenues. Member states have experienced large capital outflows to other member states from individuals seeking to evade domestic tax.  It is anticipated that this problem will be reinforced by the adoption of the euro which will create a single currency market within the participating states, thus allowing investors to move their funds to other member states without any exchange rate risks.  In the past the Commission has favoured tackling the problem by way of an EU-wide withholding tax at a minimum rate of 15 per cent.  However, when the issue was last discussed in 1994, a withholding tax solution was not acceptable to certain member states.</P>
    <P>Like other member states we do not tax non-resident deposits.  However, at the ECOFIN meeting in December 1997, member states agreed that a common EU framework to ensure a minimum of effective taxation of interest would be pursued.  It was agreed that the Commission's proposal, based on the coexistence model, would form the basis for progressing the matter.  The adoption of the coexistence model would give member states the option of either applying a withholding tax, levied at a proposed 20 per cent minimum rate by the paying agent, or providing information on savings income to other member states, or using a combination of both systems.  This model envisages that each member state will be required to either operate a withholding tax or provide other member states with information on savings income paid to their residents. The proposal would also take account of the need to preserve the competitiveness of EU financial markets.</P>
    <P>In principle Ireland has no objection to a common EU framework provided it is effective in safeguarding tax revenues but does not at the same time undermine the competitiveness of member states' capital markets.  Ireland supports the general thrust of these proposals.</P>
    <P>At this stage the draft directive is under active consideration by an EU Council working group. While it is the intention of EU Finance Ministers to complete the process by the middle of next year, there are a number of significant issues which still need to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last April that there was a sizeable number of bogus non-resident accounts in the AIB and other banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s has given rise to considerable and understandable concerns. I make very clear once again the Government's intolerance of those who engage in tax evasion <Col N="757" /> and those who assist or abet tax evaders. Deputies will appreciate that the pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. It has always been accepted that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Government get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a wide range of powers to combat tax evasion.  They have powers to access bank accounts although only in certain specified circumstances.  The powers available to Revenue were last added to significantly in 1992 when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  These new powers included: provision of third party returns to Revenue on an automatic basis; reporting by domestic institutions who act as intermediaries in the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents; provision of information on dealings by related parties such as suppliers; extended inspection powers in relation to certain tax records and accounts, and attachment of amounts owed by third parties to a defaulting taxpayer.  These were added to further in 1993 and in 1995 when reporting arrangements and other duties were imposed on certain company advisers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance in 1992 and most Members of the House will recall the criticisms he faced from many quarters when he brought forward the proposals to strengthen Revenue's powers to collect the State's taxes.  The reaction in 1992 was mild compared with the furore in 1995 when Deputy Quinn brought forward measures in the Finance Bill which became known as the &ldquo;whistle-blower's section&rdquo;.  Some enterprising student might find it interesting to go back many years and assess the reaction inside and outside the House to any proposals at various times to strengthen Revenue's powers.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to Revenue's powers in relation to bank accounts.  The main power is in section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This section, which emanates from the 1983 Finance Act, empowers Revenue to apply for a High Court order to require a financial institution to furnish certain information regarding an individual who is ordinarily resident in the State.  The preconditions necessary to make an application to the High Court are: that the individual failed to deliver a required return of income; or such return is unsatisfactory; and the authorised officer is of the opinion that the person has undisclosed accounts with the institution, or the institution has information which indicates that the individual's return is false.  Where an order is given, the High Court may, on application of the authorised officer, freeze bank accounts of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Similar powers are available under section 907 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.  Under this section, which was introduced in 1983, the appeal is made to the appeals commissioners rather than to the court and the authorised officer must send a copy of any application to the taxpayer and the bank before the hearing.  The taxpayer and the <Col N="758" /> institution may also attend and present arguments during the hearing of the application and there are no account freezing powers.  It is important to emphasise that neither section 907 nor section 908 applies to non-resident accounts. The general right of a Revenue officer to enter a business premises to examine records, a basic requirement in relation to audit, does not apply to a premises where banking business is carried on.</P>
    <P>I indicated on several occasions that, following the report of the McCracken tribunal, I asked Revenue and my Department to examine whether new powers are needed for Revenue in tackling tax evasion.  This review is a wide-ranging one and includes the question of extra powers in relation to bank accounts and the examination of the affairs of banking institutions.  The outcome of this review will be examined in the light of the report of the Moriarty tribunal so that whatever measures are considered necessary in this area can be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Moriarty tribunal is charged with looking specifically at &ldquo;whether the Revenue Commissioners availed fully, properly and in a timely manner in exercising the powers available to it in collecting or seeking to collect the taxation due by Mr. Michael Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey .&rdquo; and also at the adequacy of the current tax laws for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud and evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts.  Many aspects of the problems relating to offshore accounts will be similar to those relating to the issue of bogus non-resident accounts which are being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will fully support any measures which can assure that the liability of persons and companies to tax can be reasonably and effectively pursued.  Any such proposals would need to be carefully gone into to ensure they would be effective, could not be easily circumvented, would not needlessly disrupt the affairs of compliant, law-abiding taxpayers, and would be proportionate in their effect on the financial sector when measured against the problems to be tackled.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing review of Revenue's powers, officers from the Department of Finance and Revenue visited a number of other countries to compare Irish powers of access to bank information with those in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, France and New Zealand.  This review found that all those countries, except for Sweden and New Zealand, adopt a policy similar to Ireland of providing the tax authority with the minimum access to bank information necessary to properly administer the tax system.  However, within these parameters the tax authorities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France appear to have greater access powers than the Revenue Commissioners have under existing Irish law.</P>
    <P>This international comparison will provide very <Col N="759" /> useful background for the completion of the review of Revenue's powers.  Deputies will acknowledge that in completing this review the Government will have to ensure that a balance must be struck between having wide-ranging powers to reassure the public of the equity of the tax system and the need to encourage taxpayers to be compliant and to make it possible to settle liabilities.  Revenue attaches great importance to promoting voluntary compliance as well as increasing powers.</P>
    <P>While the public climate at present may dictate additional Revenue powers, and there appears to be scope for such moves, the poor reception in the business community in the past has to be borne in mind.  The extra powers given to Revenue in the past have been used wisely by it.  I have no doubt that any further powers will be used just as wisely, but as a people we have to decide carefully how far we want to go in giving the State wide-ranging powers of surveillance.</P>
    <P>While the Revenue Commissioners have come in for a certain amount of criticism over the past year or so, I am very aware of the proficiency, expertise, perseverance and balance shown by the them in pursuing their task.  I complimented the Revenue in the past and I do so again tonight on how well it has improved its performance and delivery of services during the past ten years. Over that period the amount of taxes collected by the Revenue has more than doubled to £19 billion gross.</P>
    <P>Developments which have been implemented by Revenue in recent years include the introduction of a self-assessment system, the use of targeted and random audits, more effective enforcement through the sheriffs and other mechanisms, the extended use of the tax clearance system, the development of a new prosecution system, and a charter of taxpayers rights.  These are all developments for which we can compliment Revenue on the changes it made within the organisation to ensure that the tax system works far better now than it did ten years ago.  The challenge of managing and administering the tax system over the years should not be underestimated.  I firmly believe that, in recent times, the strong growth in tax revenues is due, in no small part, to the determination of Revenue to continue to improve the tax collection system.  Vast strides have been made in this area which is strongly reflected in the advances made in overall tax compliance.  The greater efficiency and effectiveness achieved by Revenue has been one of the significant contributing factors towards the achievement of national budgetary and economic objectives.</P>
    <P>The role of the Central Bank has come in for some scrutiny in recent weeks.  Some of the comments on the bank fail to recognise the objectives set for it by this House.  The bank's role in the financial services sector is that of prudential regulator. The purpose of this regulation is, as the Governor of the Bank correctly pointed out to the Committee of Public Accounts last week, to <Col N="760" /> protect depositors' funds and the stability of the financial system as a whole.  Although prudential supervision plays a critical role in helping to avoid bank failure, it should be stressed that the object of this supervision as it exists in Ireland and in the EU is not the prevention of bank failure at any cost.</P>
    <P>If the main focus was on preventing bank failure regardless of cost, this could be achieved only at the expense of stifling competition, innovation and efficiency and would ultimately be self-defeating. Neither is supervision designed to eliminate risk, but to set the parameters within which risk should be contained.  We cannot compare banks with other commercial companies unless we first acknowledge that banks have high levels of borrowings, in forms of deposits and interbank loans, even after taking into account the stringent prudential limits set by the Bank. This is in the nature of banking, not only in Ireland but everywhere else.  The Central Bank's prudential supervision has provided Ireland with a safe banking environment for the ordinary saver, whether personal or business, and it is in all our interests to ensure that we do not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>The expertise and experience required to conduct prudential regulation in a manner which guards against bank failure is invaluable and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that the Central Bank has performed this role with distinction and success.  A recent survey in the 1998 Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum placed it third in the world in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness in this regard.  The bank's record bears this out.</P>
    <P>The range of services which the Central Bank oversees has developed significantly since legislative provision for supervision was first made in 1971.  The bank's powers and duties in financial services supervision are now spread across a wide range of primary and secondary legislation.  They encompass the regulation of banks, building societies, non-bank financial institutions, including those located in the IFSC, as well as investment intermediaries and the Stock Exchange. The bank also operates the deposit protection scheme, and recently was appointed the supervisory authority for investor compensation under the Investor Compensation Act, l998.</P>
    <P>Developments in the area of prudential supervision by the bank have been influenced primarily by evolving international standards as well as financial innovation in Ireland and worldwide.  Most directly, however, the bank has been influenced by the development of EU law, which has been a key influence on the evolution of its statutory role as prudential regulator of financial service providers.</P>
    <P>Mention of European law leads to an issue which has been the subject of debate in this House on a number of occasions in recent times &mdash; confidentiality.  Indeed, the Governor referred to this in his address to the Committee of Public <Col N="761" /> Accounts last week.  Confidentiality is a core element in the prudential supervision of financial institutions not only in Ireland but internationally. It is seen as a necessary balance to the extremely wide powers of intrusion and information gathering provided to the Central Bank and prudential regulators in other developed countries in legislation.</P>
    <P>Supervisors need access to such sensitive information relating to bank capital and high exposure loans in order to assess the risks to the financial entities that they supervise.  This information has to remain confidential because it may relate to problems in a bank which the supervisor is helping to resolve, and which, if disclosed, could lead to a lack of confidence in the bank, and consequent loss to customers and the State. Supervisors have access to sensitive commercial data which, if released, would impinge on a bank's competitiveness.  It is, as the Governor also pointed out, the guarantee of confidentiality which facilitates and promotes supervisory co-operation with prudential supervisors in Ireland and elsewhere with a view to providing a comprehensive international and domestic framework for supervising the financial sector.</P>
    <P>International exchanges of information occur daily.  Supervisory authorities must be assured that, when transmitting confidential information to their counterparts elsewhere, the information transmitted is also subject to stringent professional secrecy requirements in the receiving institution.  This is why EU law is so strict on the issue of confidentiality and Irish law, which reflects this EU law, is equally stringent.  If the Irish regulatory authority cannot be assured of the confidence of regulators in other countries the effectiveness of our regulatory system would be severely dented.</P>
    <P>At its meeting today, the Government decided to establish a single regulatory authority for financial services.  Agreement was reached on the establishment of an implementation group to furnish proposals on the role and functions of the new authority and progress the work necessary to enable the required legislation to be drawn up.  A press release giving more details and the terms of reference of the group is being prepared for issue tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to assisting the Committee of Public Accounts to progress its investigations as rapidly as possible and to reach early conclusions.  We await the committee's recommendations on what further assistance can be given to them to achieve this and we undertake to facilitate it with whatever powers or assistance the House considers necessary and appropriate for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies McDowell and Broughan cast doubt on whether the Committee of Public Accounts has the power to do what it is doing currently.  Deputy McDowell stated there was no legal power to deal with this issue and referred to the committee straying beyond its <Col N="762" /> normal remit.  There is no normal or extraordinary remit; there is one remit set out under Standing Order 149.  The Committee of Public Accounts is currently examining the 1997 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, particularly its deliberations on Vote 9 &mdash; the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It includes a figure for the amount of arrears and income tax collected and under that heading we are examining whether a sufficient amount was included for DIRT.  Any deliberations come fully under that remit.  Deputy McDowell stated he wanted to see the examination carried out in a cost effective manner.  None of us wants a situation involving costs similar to various tribunals of inquiry in recent years and that is not the purpose of this examination.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has operated exceptionally well in its function as the prudential guardian of the banking system and when the Governor of the bank appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts he acquitted himself well in that regard at all times.</P>

      <P>All parties in the House have seen the need for a regulatory authority for financial services and I am delighted the Government is about to establish one.</P>
      <P>The last thing the Committee of Public Accounts needs now is to be restricted in the many possibilities and permutations available to it.  The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, only came into operation through a resolution in August. Despite this, its use by any committee will need the consent of a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; effectively, it needs the consent of the party Whips.  Not only are we getting into how the Committee of Public Accounts will work in examining this, it will be the first opportunity to see how the compellability Act works in practice.  It will set a precedent for other committees in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the original motion tabled by the Labour Party was changed because it mentioned a settlement amount between the AIB and the Revenue Commissioners.  It was obvious to those who followed the proceedings of the Committee <Col N="763" /> of Public Accounts last week that the major difference between the evidence on both sides was whether a settlement had been reached.  The main force of the original motion flew in the face of the conflicting evidence given by both sides and to ask the Committee of Public Accounts to report on the basis of an explicit premise which in itself was the crux of the matter was ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the motion is agreed by all parties but I have reservations about paragraph (c)(ii) which deals with the use of non-resident accounts in the banking system generally for the purposes of tax evasion.  It states &ldquo;The information known or available to the directors and officers of the bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank concerning this practice and the steps being taken to bring it to an end are to be examined and reported on.&rdquo; I do not know whether that should come under the remit of the single regulatory authority because the Committee of Public Accounts is set up to examine the £19,000 million gross taxes collected by the Revenue Commissioners and its expenditure.</P>
    <P>The problem in this case arose on the question of DIRT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>The circumstances surrounding the purported settlement by AIB of its outstanding liabilities for DIRT comes within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts and I have no problem with that.  The motion reflects some confidence in the Committee of Public Accounts and pays tribute to my competent and able fellow members of the committee, because of the way in which power and assistance of the House will be given in this matter.  Expectations should not be raised that we satisfy all the demands being made by Members and the public but we will do our duty to the best of our ability with the resources and assistance the motion will give to us.  While everyone will not be satisfied, I hope the many concerns expressed by Deputies and the public will be addressed in a manner that will reflect well on Members and their ability to deal effectively with matters of major public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To insert &ldquo;and other relevant financial institutions&rdquo; after &ldquo;AIB&rdquo; in each place where it occurs.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes the motion is legally defective. The Committee of Public Accounts has acted not only expeditiously but fairly.  It is at great pains not to transgress the rights of any individual or institution.  It has stepped carefully through what could be a legal minefield and it has had the benefit of expert legal advice in so doing.  The House would be well advised not to fall into the legal traps so carefully avoided by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion does not name any financial institution <Col N="764" /> other than the AIB.  It was the revelations in respect of bogus non-resident accounts held by the AIB for the purpose of evading DIRT which gave rise to the present controversy.  There appears to be agreement that the practice was widespread in the banking industry.  The House is unwise to accept the motion because it focuses on the AIB and gives rise to the possibility of legal proceedings by the AIB on the grounds of unfair practice on the part of the House.  By adding the words &ldquo;any other relevant financial institution&rdquo; after &ldquo;AIB&rdquo; in the two instances where it occurs in the motion the amendment gets over this difficulty. I strongly urge the proposer of the motion and the Government to accept it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell, the Labour Party Finance spokesperson, dedicated a large proportion of his contribution to this issue.  He explained how carefully the Committee of Public Accounts had to proceed, the rights of individuals and institutions, and the fact that no person's rights can be transgressed if we are to proceed in a manner which will not leave us open to legal challenge.  He said that no further meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts should be held until its powers are enhanced because, as soon as it gets close to the bone, an action will be taken in the High Court.</P>
    <P>By agreement between the Labour Party and the Government, the House is about to accept a motion &mdash; this is the advice to which I have access &mdash; which transgresses the prescriptions laid down by the proposer of the motion.  I ask the Government to accept the amendment.  If this were simply an Opposition motion, it would not carry the same weight.  It is unusual that the Government would proceed with a motion of consequence out of a Private Members' motion.  If the motion was being taken in Government time it would have been checked by the legal offices of the State, including the Attorney General.  The motion should be subject to equal scrutiny.  My party cannot agree to it because of that flaw.</P>
    <P>I understand the Committee of Public Accounts will publish its interim report tonight. It will require careful consideration.  Whatever powers are requested by the committee, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General, should be granted.  Any additional resources required by the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General to properly carry out the task being entrusted to them by the House should be allocated without quibble. The Supplementary Estimate necessary to finance the additional work, which will be undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General, should be readily agreed by the House.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the adequacy of the motion without a careful study of the interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  To a degree, we are being asked to buy into a motion which may be inadequate when measured against the requests and recommendations of the committee. I regret I cannot commit my party to supporting the motion as proposed.  Fine Gael will <Col N="765" /> carefully consider the recommendations of the interim report tomorrow and measure the adequacy of the motion against them.  Fine Gael expects the House to accept my amendment.  We will state clearly our voting position on the motion during the debate tomorrow evening.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael wants a full investigation into the evasion of DIRT through the use of bogus non-resident accounts.  Fine Gael believes the Committee of Public Accounts, with the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is well equipped to carry out this investigation.  I congratulate the committee on the significant progress it has made to date and wish in particular to congratulate the chairman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, on the way he has so expeditiously come to terms with this matter of great public concern. Fine Gael supports the political consensus in the House to give the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General any additional powers or assistance which may be necessary to enable them to complete their investigations.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael demands that any outstanding liability for DIRT by any financial institution be paid in full.  The evasion of DIRT through the use of bogus non-resident accounts was an industry wide problem, not confined to the AIB.  This was claimed by one of the AIB witnesses who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and, except in the case of one institution, has not been rebutted by any of the others. All financial institutions which owe DIRT should pay it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael demands that the Minister for Finance ensures all outstanding tax is paid in full. Fine Gael demands that the Minister state the policy of the Government on the collection of outstanding DIRT and that he arrange to meet the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners immediately to discuss these matters.  Fine Gael demands that the Minister state what contact and discussions took place between the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in 1991 before the Revenue Commissioners entered into the arrangement with the AIB, the subject of the present controversy.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael calls on the Revenue Commissioners to fully explain all their actions, in particular why they waived DIRT due by the AIB or any other financial institution in 1991 and 1992.  Fine Gael requests the Revenue Commissioners to state in what way they believe their powers to be defective and what amendments they propose to enable them to crack down on tax evasion.  Fine Gael believes the financial services industry needs a new independent regulator.  We proposed this in March.  The Fine Gael members of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service pursued this policy.  The joint committee, under the effective chairmanship of Deputy Michael Ahern, unanimously agreed that such a regulator should be established and recommended this in its report presented in July.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael requested a clear statement from the Central Bank stating where, in its opinion, its <Col N="766" /> present statutory remit ends, if it considers it has any responsibility to the consumer other than that arising from prudential considerations and if its opposition to the establishment of a single independent regulatory authority for the financial services industry arises from the fact that it considers such a body unnecessary or because it believes the Central Bank should carry out whatever new functions Dáil Éireann considers necessary to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>I will expand on my party's policy positions on this issue.  On a number of occasions the House has had to inquire into certain activities and, in recent years, it has established judicial tribunals to carry out such inquiries.  An occasion now presents where the appropriate forum to conduct an inquiry is the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>However, that committee, even with the amended powers it will request, will not be effective without the mediation of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He is uniquely placed to carry out whatever investigatory task the committee allocates to him.  He knows the Revenue Commissioners, has access to them on an annual basis and reports on them annually.  The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is critical of certain practices in the Revenue Commissioners, particularly the paucity of random audits and the reduction in comprehensive audits undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923 has never previously been invoked by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under that section the Houses may direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a particular task.  There might be legal difficulties with the section.  The powers of direction are extremely strong in the 1923 Act, which predates the Constitution, and might not stand up to constitutional challenge based on a Constitution which places such emphasis on personal rights.  An amendment might be required to the legislation but I await the interim report of the committee.  I presume it took this as well as other matters into account.</P>
    <P>As a matter of principle, whatever the exact powers are or wherever there is a meeting point between the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the powers of the committee, the appropriate forum to carry this inquiry forward under the instructions of Dáil Éireann is the Committee of Public Accounts together with the Comptroller and Auditor General who reports to that committee.  An interim report is due tonight and a full report will be produced in a matter of months.  At that time the substantive issue will again be placed before the House when whatever further action must be taken by either the Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners or the Central Bank will be decided.</P>
    <P>This is how the House should proceed.  There is consensus in the House about this principle and Fine Gael is prepared to discuss the details either in the conclusion of this debate tomorrow night or when the Minister for Finance introduces the <Col N="767" /> legislation which will be deemed necessary by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>All outstanding liability for DIRT should be met.  There is a conflict of evidence between the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the representatives of AIB.  The chairman said no settlement was reached in respect of outstanding DIRT liabilities with AIB.  While there is a conflict of evidence, it appears to lie in the narrow interpretation of the words used.  My understanding is that the Revenue Commissioners regard a settlement as an arrangement where a lesser amount than the amount due is imposed on the person or institution with the liability.</P>
    <P>According to the evidence before the committee, no lesser amount was required of AIB.  All that was required of AIB was that it would be forward looking and that in future years it would adhere to the rules set by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of payment.  However, the question of arrears was never dealt with by way of settlement.  Not £1 of arrears was required to be paid in the discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB so there was no settlement.</P>
    <P>AIB did not use the word &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; but believed it had an amnesty.  However, an amnesty requires legislation.  There were two tax amnesties and they required legislation from the Department of Finance.  Therefore, in the case of AIB no amnesty was granted by this House.  The Revenue Commissioners are correct in stating there was no amnesty.  It is clear, however, that AIB paid an additional £5 million in respect of its liabilities in 1991 and £9 million in respect of further liabilities in 1992.  It was a forward looking arrangement.</P>
    <P>If there were arrears of DIRT between 1986 and 1991, nothing was paid.  If nothing was paid, there was no settlement.  There is much playing with words about this matter and the Minister for Finance has a responsibility to establish whether there was a liability between 1986 and 1991. There appears to be a <i>prima facie</i> case that there was such a liability not only in AIB but in other institutions.  This House and the taxpayer demands that all outstanding liabilities are met. The semantics of &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; and &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; must be put aside and what is due must be paid. The Minister has a responsibility to state that bluntly to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The function of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect the tax due under law.  It is the duty of the House to make that law but it is also the duty of the Minister for Finance to form the policy under which the Revenue Commissioners collect taxes.  It is time for the Minister to intervene with a policy direction on this matter.  If the money is owed, there is no settlement or amnesty.  The banks must pay up.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also intervene in another area.  He must state what policy was in operation in 1991.  What policy discussions, if any, took <Col N="768" /> place between the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners?  What policy considerations, if any, were taken into account by the Minister of the day?  There has been a series of statements suggesting that the policy was that money would flee the country, that this would lead to a rise in interest rates and also to a financial crisis.  These statements were made by a number of people, including the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in his evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Policy is a matter for Ministers and, if that was the policy, what discussions took place between the Minister's representatives in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners before the policy was established not to collect the arrears due and to have a forward looking arrangement simply to ensure that amounts owed for a specific date would be paid?</P>
    <P>The Government has now adopted a policy to establish a single regulatory committee for financial services.  I proposed such a body in the past. It was processed through the Joint Committee on Finance and General Affairs whose report had the unanimous support of Deputies from all parties.</P>
    <P>The press statement released after today's Cabinet meeting was the most unusual such statement ever to emerge.  The Government has decided in principle to establish a single regulatory body for the financial services industry but says it must now consider the body's role and function.  One would have thought one would consider the role and function first before deciding what type of body or authority would carry out that function.  The Government committing itself to establishing an authority without even considering its role and function is really a case of putting the cart before the horse.  I regret I do not have enough time to deal with the funnier aspect of this statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue. Women were crying in my clinic yesterday because they did not know if they would receive payments for Christmas.  Will the position be like last year, when payments were not made until March or April?  A few weeks ago the Minister announced that he would pay the headage and premium payments early.  People were waiting for the cheques, but there was no sign of those cheques and no word from the Department. Those people contacted their public representatives or the area aid unit of the Department of Agriculture and Food where an answering <Col N="769" /> machine message says: &ldquo;We will be contacting you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 26 May 1998 the Minister announced a reorganisation of the area aid unit.  It was to be divided into five sections, with Donegal, Mayo and Sligo forming one section.  We were told that there would be 11 telephone lines into that office, but today if one calls it there is an answering machine.  Where have all the staff gone?  Where has the Minister gone?  He is missing, as he has been for the past few weeks.  Farmers are not being told that there is a problem with their area aid.  I ask the Minister of State to fly to Brussels with the Minister and the other Minister of State and get a derogation in order that all area aid funding can be paid.  If there is a problem, that can be dealt with next year when the Department of Agriculture and Food gets its act together.  I do not blame the Department's staff.  I am critical of them at times, but I cannot criticise them now. They are doing their best and can do no more. There is not enough staff and it is the Minister's responsibility to get the staff into the section to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>This has been the worst year for agriculture in 30 years.  Since the present Government took office 18 months ago agriculture has gone down the drain, particularly the beef, sheep and pig sectors. A fortnight ago it was announced that headage and premium payments were to be made, and now problems have occurred with area aid for people who never had such problems before.  People who were paid last year and the year before cannot now get a telephone line into the Department; they get an answering machine. Is that progress in 1998?  No, it is a step backwards. Farmers and their wives come to see me and they are upset by pressure from the banks, which give them an umbrella on a fine day and take it back on the wet day.  I am glad there is some pressure on the banks now and the boot is on the other foot, as farmers and their families are under tremendous pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an announcement last week that beef prices would be up this week, but what has happened?  They have gone down.  I am told the Minister was on television this evening but nothing is happening on the ground even though prices are disastrous.  The Minister must put extra staff in the area aid unit and, if necessary, pay them overtime so that farmers will know what is happening and will get payments.  Even my Dublin colleagues, some of whom may be anti-farmer, would say that fair is fair and that the farmers have a problem.  They would not mind if farmers are paid.  The Minister of State has lost control, he reminds me of Glenn Hoddle.  He is under pressure, as is the Minister and the other Minister of State.  I know what I would like to do, but I am not the Taoiseach and do not wish to be disrespectful. I will give the Minister of State one more chance, though he does not deserve it.  The Department of Agriculture and Food has to get its act together and pay these hard pressed farmers. <Col N="770" /> Enough is enough.  The farmers are not looking forward to Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that a parliamentary question is not answered for a Member, no matter what that question is.  I ask the Chair, as our representative, to ensure that an answer such as the one I was given &mdash; that the question could not be answered because of the problems in Agriculture House &mdash; is not given again.  It is my right as a Member to have my questions answered.  I want no more such replies.  If I inquire about a problem I want responses.</P>

      <P>I am happy to give Deputies an update on progress in the processing of area aid applications in my Department.  As Members will be aware, from its introduction in 1996, the land parcel identification system, known as LPIS, aspect of the area aid processing arrangements was both complex and difficult to implement. Consequently, the Department was forced to seek from the European Commission derogations from its provisions in 1996 and again in 1997.  It was made quite clear by the Commission that a similar derogation would not be available for 1998 or subsequent years.  In the circumstances it was necessary to undertake a major reorganisation of the area aid unit, which was completed last April.  It involved a new management structure, including the reorganisation of the unit into five sections, each with responsibility for a specified group of counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first task of the reorganised unit was to eliminate a 19,700 case backlog from the 135,000 1997 applications.  This task had to be completed quickly and it was not possible, therefore, at that time for the unit to continue to devote almost its <Col N="771" /> entire staff resources to taking thousands of telephone calls daily from the public.  Consequently it was unable to receive telephone calls or personal callers in Hume House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The achievement of this task involved communicating with and enabling payments to be made to the farmers affected within a month.  The unit then commenced the processing of 1998 area aid applications.  The intention was to be in a position to enable payments to be made in all eligible cases in line with commitments set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers.</P>
      <P>The key dates are: headage payments to commence in September and be completed in all eligible cases by 31 October; special beef premium/suckler cow premium advance payments of 60 per cent to commence on 1 November with all eligible applicants to be paid by 31 December; arable aid to commence on 16 October and be completed in all eligible cases by 31 October; and ewe premium scheme payments of each instalment to commence within seven days of formal EU adoption and be completed within one month.  Up to last Thursday, £0.5 billion was paid out in those schemes to Irish farmers, which should be on the record.  The Opposition should know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the difficult circumstances for farmers arising from poor weather conditions and the fall in beef cattle prices it was decided to bring forward the cattle headage payments date by three weeks and to get Commission approval for earlier payment on 16 October of special beef and suckler cow premia at a higher rate of 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>These necessary actions greatly reduced the processing time available to the area aid unit to complete its task.  In fact, the early payment of cattle headage commenced while the processing of a sizeable number was ongoing.  As a result, the unit was unable to finalise the processing as it was inundated with phone calls from the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that this short disruption in service has enabled my Department to make significant levels of payments to a great number of farmers.  As the Deputy will be aware, the normal arrangements for comprehensive replies to parliamentary questions has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has placed considerable emphasis on customer services and has made significant improvements to that aspect of its functions. <Col N="772" /> However, it has to be understood that a large volume of payments are concentrated into a relatively short period.  Therefore, the primary emphasis in our customer plan has to be on getting payments out quickly, and I believe we will be vindicated in this approach.</P>
    <P>We have a 98 per cent success rate in the payment of those premium schemes.  That high success rate is greatly admired by the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue of residential places for persons with a learning disability, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region.  I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will be aware, there are waiting lists in all of the health board regions but nothing like the scale of those in the Eastern Health Board area.  A particular cause for concern is the fact that, despite promises by successive Governments to clear waiting lists, the lists are growing and the indications are that they will reach crisis proportions if immediate action is not taken.</P>
      <P>The number of persons now requiring immediate admission is 528, an increase of 80 on last year.  Therefore, despite commitments given to systematically reduce this backlog, it is clear that the funding available annually is simply not sufficient to stabilise the list, much less clear it.</P>
      <P>Each year, as the Minister is aware, there are unforeseen emergency admissions for a number of reasons, for instance, the death or ill health of a carer.  Increasingly, children are born with multiple handicaps and survive birth due to better medical care.  These children require an ongoing level of care which would be impossible in the ordinary family home, and they go from hospital into residential care where the necessary back-up services &mdash; 24 hour care, supervision and medical care &mdash; are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the number of emergency cases rising, and the cost <i>per capita</i> of their care also rising, we have a situation in the Eastern Health Board where most of next year's expected additional allocation is already committed and, as a result, no inroads will be made into the list.  These adults and children have to be provided for but the reality for those on the waiting list is that they <Col N="773" /> simply stay on the list with their prospect of admission diminishing each year.</P>
    <P>Outlining statistics and talking about waiting lists masks the reality of these people's lives. Behind each of these 528 families is a story of extreme human misery, ongoing distress and complete exhaustion which comes with giving 24 hour care on a continuous basis.  These people are not reneging on their responsibilities or seeking to be a burden on the taxpayer.  In most cases they are very elderly people, widows or widowers, who have devoted their whole lives to the care of their handicapped children and now, in their old age, they find they cannot get a place for their children.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that providing a place for a handicapped person is expensive but it is a finite problem.  If the Minister dealt with this backlog there would be sufficient beds in the system to provide for each year's emergencies simply through natural wastage.</P>
    <P>A parents' federation was formed recently and its members had a meeting with the Minister for Finance to seek funding for residential places; I understand those parents got an unsympathetic hearing.  I appreciate there are many calls on the public purse but taxpayers do not want a reduction in their tax at the expense of these parents.</P>
    <P>Having devoted their whole lives to the care of their children, these parents should not have to face old age not knowing what will happen to their sons or daughters after their death.  They are currently facing that uncertainty and dying with it.  This is evidenced by the fact that a siblings group has now been formed.  The sisters and brothers are now taking over the responsibility of care from their parents.  It is neither right nor just that parents or siblings have to squander their precious resources and reserves of energy lobbying Ministers, TDs, councillors and health boards to get care for their relatives.  It is our job to provide that for them and it is a shame on all of us that it has not been done.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do all he can in the forthcoming budget to provide as much funding as possible to clear the backlog and end this scandal once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for putting down this matter on the Adjournment and giving me an opportunity to comment on it.</P>
      <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001, which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That assessment identified a requirement of 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services is in the region of £63.5 million over that period and <Col N="774" /> continuing thereafter at that increased level of funding.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to allocate additional funding of £21 million in 1998 to continue the process of delivering the services identified in the assessment of need.  This funding, which includes £10.75 million in revenue and £5.25 million funding from the new national capitation programme, is being used to meet identified needs in existing services and provide new residential and day care places.</P>
    <P>The capacity of existing facilities to absorb the additional places in the coming years and to provide the specialist services for disturbed clients is now limited.  A programme of building is essential to deliver the volume and quality of services required.  Late last year, I announced a major national capital programme of £30 million, the first time people with mental handicap had designated to them a tranche of capital funding over a multi-annual period.  The problem in planning for this service in the past has been that, at the end of each year, they did not know what they would get the following year, which was usually very little.</P>
    <P>While I accept the sincerity of Deputy Mitchell's contribution, and her acknowledgment that successive Governments did not deal with this problem, an objective assessment of the amount of money we have put into this area since coming into office compares very favourably with what was put into it beforehand.  I do not want to engage in a point scoring exercise, but it is a financial fact.</P>
    <P>The £30 million to which I referred was put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in the assessment of need.  Over the next four years, this capital programme will provide for new residential and day care facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities; the provision of alternative accommodation for persons with a mental handicap currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, and the upgrading of existing facilities which will continue to be used in the medium to long-term future; and the provision of facilities for persons with a mental handicap who require specialist services in a secure environment, another provision we have to identify and address.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £30 million I announced late last year, I have allocated another £5 million this year because I recognise the need to accelerate the process of providing the facilities required to deliver both the necessary volume and quality of services.</P>
    <P>Together with the £4 million capital funding I allocated late last year, this brings to £25 million the total additional funding I have allocated to services for persons with a mental handicap in the past year.</P>
    <P>As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap and <Col N="775" /> the level of funding I have allocated to date underlines that commitment.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is a problem to be dealt with and I share Deputy Mitchell's view that these families are doing an extraordinary job in difficult circumstances.  It should not be underestimated. A total of 25,000 people have a service, but 2,500 do not and that is being addressed.  It is sometimes forgotten that a service exists for many people.  There is also the further complication of the growing cost of maintaining the existing level of service.  The Deputy made a good point about emergency cases which arise and which must be dealt with.  These obviously militate against people obtaining placements as quickly as they would like.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult problem but I am committed to solving it.  We have made an unprecedented level of funding available for this area compared to funding made available in other years.  I acknowledge that more needs to be done and I will try to do more by working with the parents concerned to deal with what is still a difficult situation for many of them.</P>

      <P>It is in the interests of any country, particularly one which has experienced the devastating unemployment levels which were visited upon Ireland in recent decades, to protect its job market as much as possible.  However, there is a balance to be struck and this arises in the case of the small and highly skilled group of non-EU nationals who are here as resident aliens to pursue postgraduate studies in universities and other higher education institutions.</P>
      <P>Such people are not permitted to work legally for the duration of the period they are in the country if they are here on a bona fide postgraduate studies basis.  It is a condition of the permission granted that they do not engage in any employment or business activity.  I am aware that it is the opinion of officials within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the United States Embassy that this condition is unfair in its application by Irish authorities to postgraduate students from the United States given the lenient US position allowing non-national postgraduate students to work there legally.</P>
      <P>I hope to hear from the policy section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that this is not a blindly entrenched position which is inherited and anachronistic and that the Department is prepared to examine the issue on its merits.  A passports for investment scheme was operated in the past for those endowed with large amounts of capital.  Can temporary work permits not be granted to postgraduate students who, by virtue of their academic accomplishments, have won places at postgraduate level in our institutions of further education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the merits of including this small and <Col N="776" /> highly skilled group in the workforce would be the encouragement of outside investment and job creation because of the availability of technically and academically highly skilled workers.  Universities would gain the ability to attract the best and most qualified scholars and not just the best of the independently wealthy scholars, despite the limited funding available for non-EU citizens studying at postgraduate level.  Making postgraduate study less financially punitive for non-EU nationals could increase the revenue of the universities since non-EU nationals are required to pay up to 300 per cent more in fees than their EU counterparts.</P>
    <P>Changes to the current restrictive regime could be made with sensitivity to protect the interests of Irish and EU citizens.  The number of hours worked per week could be limited, annual income capped, employment options restricted to short-term or contract positions and work permits granted in a head to head exchange with Irish citizens studying in, for example, the United States.</P>
    <P>Given the historical, political and familial relations between Ireland and the United States, it seems reasonable to foster the academic relationship between the two countries.  How many distinguished Irish figures hold honorary doctorates from American universities and vice versa?  The Taoiseach received a doctorate from the University of Notre Dame this week.  Many in the House are contributing something to such an exchange by hosting participants in the IPA internship programme.  Allowing postgraduate students to legally earn the money to help with their weekly rent and groceries would be a simple way of achieving a lofty goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of non-European economic area nationals are admitted to Ireland each year to pursue courses of study.  A large and successful industry has grown up in this area and it now contributes significantly in terms of employment and export earning.  Irish universities and higher education institutions are not the only bodies involved but have played a major part in this development.</P>
      <P>Persons are admitted to study in Ireland, whether they are from a visa required or other non-EEA state, subject to a number of conditions. The most important of these are: that they are genuine, full-time students enrolled in a recognised education institution, that they have paid their fees and have sufficient funds to maintain themselves without access to public funds, and that they do not take up employment.  These conditions are regarded as being interrelated.  A person who has sufficient funds should not need to take up employment.  Similarly, if a person is a bona fide full-time student, they should not be in a position to devote time to a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the conditions are concerned, no distinction is made between undergraduate or postgraduate, or between degree and diploma programmes and other courses of study.  I would <Col N="777" /> not be enthusiastic about subdividing the student visa conditions into a range of subcategories. Some people find the application process complicated enough as it is.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment operates a work permits scheme whereby firms can apply to employ non-EEA nationals when they cannot find the skills they need in Ireland or elsewhere in the EEA.  This scheme works well and 3,800 permits were issued this year up to September.  In general, a firm cannot obtain a work permit for a person here as a student.</P>
    <P>An exception to the prohibition on work is made in the context of persons with some element of work experience built into their full-time studies, even if it is remunerated.  For example, postgraduate medical students have for many years been working as temporary registered doctors in the medical sector while completing postgraduate training.  The same principle is applied to other courses and I am happy to examine equivalent programmes and to ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider adopting a similar approach, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of enabling persons to take up work whose principal stated purpose when resident here is to pursue a course of studies.  I am concerned that admitting students to work would greatly undermine our existing system which protects the domestic labour market from uncontrolled access by third country nationals and the consequent negative effects on the wages and working conditions of Irish people.  I am not prepared to take that risk.  The Government has also decided to introduce legislation making it an offence to employ someone without a work permit and for which fines and, possibly, jail sentences could be imposed.  This is an indication of how seriously the problem of unregulated work is taken.  Enabling persons here as students to take up work could undermine the successful operation of such legislation.</P>
    <P>Permitting students to work would distort the operation of student visas generally.  My Department is already concerned at the extent to which visas obtained to pursue courses of study are abused and is working with the industry to address these issues while responding to the demands of bona fide students.  The Deputy's proposals would not assist in this.  The incentive to register oneself as a student to work or to extend one's period of study to continue to work would surely be very high.  To attempt to police attendance to weed out those not genuinely attending a course would be extremely expensive in terms of Garda resources, if not completely unworkable.  Similarly, to attempt to apply particular entitlements to certain types of students, such as postgraduates, would be difficult to monitor.</P>
    <P>People who study here and who wish to return here to work can do so under the work permits scheme and many do.  I would prefer if the skills <Col N="778" /> of non-EU nationals required by firms could be accessed in this way rather than on a part-time and temporary basis while they are supposed to be studying.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise the issue and thank the Minister for being present to address it.  The most recent report given to the vocational education committee on 12 October was that the Department is unwilling to proceed to the appointment of a design team until the schedule of accommodation is agreed at the school.  The Department has submitted a schedule for 350 students which is insufficient for the numbers now attending the school.  The numbers over the past five years and anticipated numbers for the coming five years are averaging about 380 students.  This information was submitted to the Department some time ago but it has not been taken on board by the planning section of the Department.</P>
      <P>One of my first tasks when I came into this House in 1981-82 involved a similar problem with the Department using numbers to delay the development of a new school which was required.  This year the Department and the Minister accepted that a new school will be provided.  Now there is an argument between the Department, which is talking about providing a school for 350 students, and the VEC.  The VEC says that on the basis of the numbers, the extra houses which are being built and the extra students which will be around over the next five years, the number will have increased to 380.</P>
      <P>I take exception to the Department using a delaying tactic here.  I have no doubt that is what is being done because I know that the same type of tactics have been used in many other projects in which I have been involved in my constituency on the basis of the numbers game.  Nothing will happen until this item is agreed.  The Estimates for 1999 will be agreed and no money will be allocated for the provision of the design team so that money can be allocated from the Estimates for work.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me, the board of management and the County Meath VEC that he will immediately resolve the disagreements and the school will be provided on the basis that provision needs to be made for 380 students given the projected extra population in the locality of Oldcastle and north Meath?  I do not accept that the planning section of the Department can state that it will not move until such time as there is an agreement.  Ministers are there to make decisions on behalf of all the people.  Here there is an organised disagreement so that progress cannot be made, in other words the design team cannot be appointed, and no money will be allocated in the Estimates for 1999 so that work can commence. I ask the Minister to get rid of this logjam and to get a decision so that work can commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Farrelly for giving me this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new school building at St. Oliver's, Oldcastle, County Meath.</P>
      <P>I will give some details regarding the background to this case.  In 1996 a feasibility study was carried out by consultants to determine whether the old building in the school should be refurbished and a new extension provided, or whether there was a need for a new school on a green field site.</P>
      <P>This feasibility study was examined by the building unit in my Department and in 1997 the consultants were asked to submit an expanded comprehensive feasibility study which examined and compared the following options: refurbishment of existing buildings with a new extension provided; demolition of the existing 1950s block and the provision of new accommodation and refurbishment of existing buildings; or the provision of a new school building on a green field site.</P>
      <P>In April of this year the expanded feasibility study was received in the Department and was examined by my Department's technical staff. The report concluded that it was not feasible to refurbish the whole school on financial grounds. The proposal for the demolition of the entire school and the building of a new school on the site of the demolished old buildings was also rejected due to the financial implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building unit, having examined all the options put forward by the consultants and the cost implications involved, accepted the proposal to construct a new school building of 1,800 square <Col N="780" /> metres and the retention and refurbishment of a portion of the existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Department is convinced this option represents the best value for money while at the same time answering the educational needs of the school.  A schedule of accommodation was drawn up by the Department's senior inspector to cater for 350 pupils and this schedule was presented to County Meath VEC for its approval.  County Meath VEC has asked my Department to review the number of pupil places to be provided for as enrolments at the school are now close to 400. The planning section of my Department is reviewing these figures and a decision will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>A design team for this project will be formally appointed when the planning section has made a decision on the number of students to be catered for.  This appointment will be made shortly and every effort will be made to expedite the architectural planning of the project.</P>
    <P>This project is receiving priority attention.  Crucial to its progress is that the Government has almost doubled funding allocated to second level buildings versus the amount provided in the 1997 budget.</P>

    <P>In 1997 there were 256 cases reported to the Garda, which is an increase of 42 per cent on 1996 figures.  Some 28 per cent of the increase, or 21 cases, were related to cases of rape perpetrated in previous years but not reported until 1997.  The majority were historical child abuse cases.  While the available statistics point to an increase in the incidence of rape, it seems that there is also a greater willingness by the victim to report rape.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in a previous reply to the House, a number of victims do not come forward to the Garda to report such incidents and we must ascertain the reasons for this.  My Department is about to commission a research project into the reasons there are such high rates of attrition in bringing prosecutions in rape cases. This project will analyse, on a step by step basis, the reasons rape victims do not report rape and what they consider are the obstacles in progressing through the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department, is looking at, among other issues, ways of providing a multi-disciplinary respose to victims of all forms of violence which will include rape and sexual assault.  The steering committee has established regional committees in each of the eight health board areas.  The committees are facilitating greater communication and co-operation between the service providers and I am confident they will lead to the development of a more comprehensive service and a better response to victims of sexual crime.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, earlier this year I published a discussion document on the law on sexual offences, which I hope will promote a wide public debate on the issue which will assist me in developing any future legislative reforms the Department will undertake.</P>

      <P>The comments referred to by the Deputy relate to the obligation on banks, other credit institutions and other bodies designated under the money laundering provisions of <Col N="784" /> the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to report to the Garda Síochána where they suspect that a money laundering offence has been or is being committed.</P>
      <P>Detailed advice on compliance with the obligations of the 1994 Act are available to credit institutions and other designated bodies, in the form of guidance notes which have been issued with the approval of a Government money laundering steering committee.  Arising out of the concerns to which the question refers, this committee is currently conducting a review of the guidance notes in order to ensure a full and consistent understanding of the obligation under the 1994 Act to report suspicions of money laundering.</P>
      <P>In relation to the comments made by the head of the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, GBFI, I wish to inform the Deputy that in overall terms the Garda Síochána is satisfied with the level of co-operation it receives from the financial institutions in relation to the reporting of suspicious transactions under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The instances referred to by the head of the GBFI have been raised at the money laundering steering committee and, arising from the review of the guidance notes which I have already mentioned, the firm aim is that revised procedures will be put in place to ensure that these problems will not arise again.</P>
      <P>As previously announced, I am committed to extending the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to include solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and estate agents and, in addition, I am currently reviewing the relevant legislation to see if any additional changes are required.</P>

    <P>Provisional figures for the period 1 January 1998 to 19 October 1998 show that 355 persons were killed in 310 fatal road accidents.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that the Government and the Garda authorities are determined to confront the unacceptably high level of deaths and injuries on our roads.  The Deputy will be aware the Government launched the national strategy on road safety &mdash; The Road to Safety &mdash; on 31 July 1998.  The primary target of the strategy is to reduce Irish road fatalities by 2002 by a minimum of 20 per cent on their 1997 level and to achieve a similar reduction &mdash; at least 20 per cent &mdash; in the number of serious injuries from road accidents.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have taken the following measures in recent years.  The Garda national traffic policy bureau, under the direction of a Chief Superintendent, was established in July 1997.  The primary focus of the bureau is policy development, with particular emphasis on formulating proactive enforcement strategies aimed at reducing road deaths and road accidents.  Operation Lifesaver was launched on 14 July 1997 in the Louth-Meath area and was subsequently extended nationwide in the autumn of 1997.</P>
    <P>As a result of Operation Lifesaver, the Garda has identified the following key offences, which are the focus of its enforcement campaign, as major factors in fatal and serious injury accidents: excessive speed, drink driving, non compliance with seat belt wearing and dangerous and careless driving.</P>
    <P>Operation Lifesaver involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks, in addition to an extensive road safety publicity campaign, which involves media campaigns using national and local radio stations, and schools programmes which are designed to educate all road users on the need to take care on our roads.  The Operation Lifesaver strategy, which is endorsed in the national strategy on road safety, is to continue up to 2002.</P>
    <P>Another measure introduced in recent years was the introduction of an on-the-spot speeding fine of £50.  Since the introduction of Operation Lifesaver, in excess of 120,000 such fines have <Col N="786" /> been issued to date.  The voluntary payment rate is 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that I have funded, and will continue to fund, additional resources identified by the Garda for the effective enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  At present, the Garda has two GATSO units &mdash; a mobile speed detection unit with on board cameras and computer facilities.  A further three are being acquired and will be brought into use in the near future.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of the Government's national strategy on road safety, it is planned to place automated speed detection cameras i.e. fixed cameras in the Louth-Meath division on a pilot basis.  The Garda also has a wide range of other speed detection equipment such as tripod mounted lasers, in-car video systems and hand held radar guns which assist them in detecting road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of additional powers for the Garda, the Government's national strategy on road safety identified the following measures which are designed to strengthen the powers of the Garda in combating road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>First, extending the range of on-the-spot fines to include the following offences: non wearing of seat belts, stop/yield infringements, traffic light infringements, box junction violations and defective tyres.  The draft regulations which will govern the introduction of these on-the-spot fines are currently being considered by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in conjunction with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Second, a phased introduction throughout the country of evidential breath testing.  Provision has already been made for this measure in the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  Its use will automatically record the driver's alcohol level without the need for further medical or analytical process.</P>
    <P>Third, the introduction of a penalty points system which would trigger disqualification following repeated driving offences.  This recommendation is currently under consideration by all the agencies involved in road safety, including the Garda authorities and my Department.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Deputies that the Garda will continue to use all available resources and to co-operate with all agencies involved in an effort to make our roads safer and reduce the number of deaths and injuries.  The high level of Garda enforcement, along with the increased use of new technology, improvements to infrastructure and proactive strategies, can all contribute to reducing accidents and fatalities.  However, long-term sustained reductions will only be achieved by a change in the mind set of drivers and other road users to one of compliance with the law, a fundamental change in driving habits, including courtesy, together with a considerable improvement in driving behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>In regard to overtime in the Garda Síochána, Garda management must have the flexibility to respond to particular incidents by drawing on extra manpower resources at short notice and the most cost effective and feasible way to do this is by use of overtime.  Some level of overtime will, therefore, always be required because of the nature of Garda work.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the level of overtime expenditure suddenly increased in the period 1995-97 &mdash; from £16.8 million to £43.4 million &mdash; and that this trend has continued into the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concerns, Garda management, in conjunction with officials from my Department and the Department of Finance, looked at Garda overtime expenditure over the last three to four years.  It has been established that the areas of activity which have contributed most to the increase are investigation of crime, <Col N="788" /> special operations &mdash; in particular, the anti-BSE operation &mdash; and attendance at court.</P>
    <P>I am determined to see a Garda force which is both effective and gives the taxpayer value for money.  There is scope for improvement in every organisation and I am of the view that the level of Garda overtime can be reduced without adversely affecting operational effectiveness.  This is a matter that I will pursue with vigour.  In particular, legislative changes are being implemented which should reduce the level of overtime expenditure associated with court attendance.</P>
    <P>Developments in the area of management information systems now allow better monitoring of expenditure trends and I am insisting on a more proactive management of Garda overtime by senior gardaí using this facility.  In the light of changing circumstances, the anti-BSE operation in the Border areas has been reoriented and no longer requires a substantial element of overtime. As Deputies know, the Government is committed to increasing the size of the force to 12,000 and as the increased numbers come on stream, this will ease the need for overtime.</P>
    <P>Prisons overtime has been a problem for many years and this has been exacerbated by the pressure arising from overcrowding in our prisons and the opening of new accommodation.  Basically, overtime in the Prison Service is needed when the number of staff available for duty on any given day is less than the number required to staff the posts which have been approved as being required to provide good order and safe custody. Additional demands in respect of escorts to courts, hospitals and other prisons and absences due to sick leave may also give rise to overtime.</P>
    <P>My Department has been taking a strategic approach to solving the overtime problem since 1996 when the prison service operating cost review group was set up.  This group comprises representatives from both the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance, prison governors, the Prison Officers' Association and people from the wider public and private sectors.  The group reported in August 1997 and concluded that the problem was not amenable to piecemeal reforms or <i>ad hoc</i> cuts.  Rather, it recommended a strategic approach which should commence with a thorough reassessment of staffing requirements aimed at establishing how the tasks of the Prison Service could be performed without overtime working.</P>
    <P>It further recommended that this work should be followed by a process of consultation and joint design of an implementation programme with staff representatives.  The report envisaged that the final phase of the project would involve negotiations with staff interests prior to implementation. The importance of a partnership approach with staff in order to ensure joint ownership of the future staffing arrangements of the service was emphasised by the group.</P>
    <P>A dedicated team comprising senior Department and prisons management has now been set up to carry out this detailed review of prisons <Col N="789" /> staffing issues and practices.  The team has available to it the services of consultants from Europe and the UK who are expert in this area.  I hope to receive the group's report in about six months, at which stage we will embark on the design and implementation phases of the project.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department will be pushing ahead with the productivity measures which were agreed with the Prison Officers' Association in the 1997 settlement under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  We are also following a clear management policy aimed at controlling sick leave which accounts for a substantial portion of the overtime bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 48 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill, 1997, was intended to prohibit discrimination in non-employment areas on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community. The prohibition on discrimination would have applied to services or facilities of any nature which are generally available to the public, including access to and the use of buildings.</P>
      <P>The Bill was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on 19 June 1997.  The Bill fell because it contained two provisions which were identical to provisions of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which had earlier been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Revised employment equality legislation, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, has since been enacted to take account of the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Revised equal status legislation is now being developed on the same general lines as that found to be unconstitutional but amended to meet the Supreme Court's requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its consideration of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, the Supreme Court did not scrutinise the entire Bill and preparation of revised equal status legislation is, therefore, a more complicated process <Col N="791" /> than development of the revised employment equality legislation.  It was necessary to seek extensive legal advice before proceeding with the development of a revised measure.  It was also necessary to await the passing of the Employment Equality Act before proceeding with the detailed drafting of the Equal Status Bill based on the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>The revised Equal Status Bill, which is being developed in accordance with the legal advice received on a wide range of issues, is expected to be published in early 1999.</P>

      <P>The rule of law under which parents are immune from criminal liability in respect of the physical chastisement of their children where such chastisement is moderate and reasonable is kept under review in my Department. The recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A. <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom which found that the UK was in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights as it did not provide adequate protection to a child from his stepfather against treatment or punishment contrary to Article 3, is being studied in my Department as part of the ongoing review I have referred to.</P>
      <P>In this context it has to be borne in mind that the European Court of Human Rights limited its examination to the specific facts of the case before it.  These were that the child had bruising consistent with the use of a garden cane, applied with considerable force, on more than one occasion.  The stepfather had been charged before an English court with assault causing actual bodily harm and tried before a jury.  The defence contended that the beatings inflicted by the stepfather amounted to reasonable punishment and came within the scope of the aforementioned rule of law.  The jury acquitted the stepfather by a majority verdict.  It is a matter for conjecture whether a similar finding in similar circumstances would issue from an Irish court.</P>
      <P>I might add that in line with a 1994 recommendation of the Law Reform Commission the rule of law under which teachers were immune from criminal liability in respect of physical chastisement of pupils was removed in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that the programme for Government listed as one of its key priorities, in the measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug-related offences.  In accordance with this commitment, I requested the working group on a courts commission, chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to consider the establishment of a drug courts system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On 25 September 1998, I announced that the Government had approved the publication of the fifth report of the working group on a courts commission &mdash; drug courts &mdash; which sets out details and experiences of drug courts in the USA and other European jurisdictions.  I also announced that I had secured Government approval for the establishment of a drug courts planning committee to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court early in the new year.  The terms of reference of the planning committee are currently being finalised and I expect to be in a position to appoint the members of the committee shortly. As part of its remit, the planning committee will be asked to examine the resource issues surrounding the establishment of a pilot project.</P>
      <P>The development of a drug courts system on a pilot basis marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with the less serious and non-violent drug offenders.  It is the beginning of a fundamental realignment of the response of the criminal justice system to those involved in less serious drug-related offences.  In effect, drug courts afford persons in trouble with the law on foot of having committed minor or non-violent drug related offences an opportunity to be treated under courts supervision as an alternative to the more ususal penal sanctions which can be imposed.  I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course and if the US experience, which shows that criminal activity for drug-related crimes decreases or is eliminated as a result of treatment, is repeated here, I believe that this initiative is likely to have a profound effect over time on how we as a society deal with less serious drug-related crime.</P>

    <P>It can be seen from these figures that the staffing strength of the Waterford Garda district has risen substantially in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Garda management is also responsible for the policing arrangements of the entire Waterford-Kilkenny Garda division and any changes in policing arrangements in Waterford district are made having regard to this overall responsibility and the policing requirements of all other districts in the division.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have further informed me that the staffing situation in the Waterford district will continue to be kept under review and that each time additional personnel become available, the needs of the Waterford district will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of other Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The number of cases referred to the Probation and Welfare Service by the courts has increased steadily in recent years and I wish to advise the Deputy that I am aware that the Probation and Welfare Service is not in a position at present to meet all the demands made upon it.  It was with this and other developments in mind that I established an expert group towards the end of last year to examine the role of the Probation and Welfare Service having regard to recent and current developments; the needs of the service, in the context of its proper role, to deliver an effective and efficient service and the organisational status of the service; and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am now in receipt of the expert group's first report.  I am considering the group's recommendations and I hope to publish the report shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the juvenile diversion programme, to which I presume the Deputy is referring, juvenile offenders who meet certain conditions may be dealt with under the Garda juvenile diversion programme, juvenile liaison scheme, as an alternative to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The programme commenced in 1963 and following a review by a working party a number of procedural changes were introduced in 1991 and the national juvenile office was established.  The primary aim of the programme is crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The programme is under constant review and assessment in all respects, including resources, staffing and administrative procedures.  Adjustments within the programme take place whenever and wherever appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996, when enacted will place the operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory footing.  The Bill also includes provision for the holding of family conferences as part of the programme to be held in a Garda station convenient to the persons attending, or in the offender's home or in exceptional circumstances some other place.  The convening of a family conference would allow the offender's problems to be aired and a programme of corrective measures to be suggested, in the presence of the offender, his or her parents, wider family members, health board officials and others interested in the offender's welfare.  The victim of the offence committed by the offender would in some cases also attend the conference.</P>
      <P>In the light of the above developments the national juvenile office is currently examining the implications of enactment of the Bill and will report to the Commissioner in due course.</P>

      <P>There are three conventions concerning legalisation of documents, namely the Hague Convention abolishing the requirement of legalisation of foreign public documents, 1961, the European Convention on the abolition of legalisation of documents executed by diplomatic or consular officers, 1968, and the Convention abolishing the legalisation of documents in the member states of the European Communities, 1987.</P>
      <P>The bringing into effect of these conventions is dependent on the completion of the necessary ratification procedures which, in turn, require that relevant rules of court be prepared and that certain changes be made to a 1964 Companies (Forms) Order.</P>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that considerable progress has been made on this matter over the time period to which he refers, although I would have to say that ensuring that the necessary arrangements were put in place did prove more complex than had, perhaps, been anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, rules of court have been finalised by the Superior Courts Rules Committee and I understand that the forms order, which was a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has now been finalised by the parliamentary draftsman.  A decision has also been taken to make a declaration under Article 6.3 of the Convention Abolishing the Legalisation of Documents in the member states of the European Communities which will ensure that this convention will apply at an early stage as between Ireland and other member states which have <Col N="798" /> made the same declaration &mdash; currently four in number.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the conventions will come into force on the same day and the Department of Foreign Affairs is working to ensure that the necessary synchronisation can be achieved.  The likelihood is that the ratifications will be timed to ensure that the conventions are in force for Ireland by spring of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill can cater for up to ten offenders at any one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies. All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are found to be suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the next programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>
      <P>Transfers of prisoners from one institution to another takes place for operational reasons.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that a prisoner participating in the treatment programme would not be transferred except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>All sex offenders are encouraged to avail of treatment, however, they cannot be compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.  The clinical psychology service and Probation and Welfare Service actively encourage sex offenders to address their needs around their offending behaviour.  Important work in this regard is done in individual sessions by members of both services.  An integral part of this work is preparing sex offenders for, and encouraging them to apply for, the sex offender programme at Arbour Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> My Department has commissioned the clinical psychoogy department at University College Dublin to conduct a detailed evaluation of the group treatment programme at Arbour Hill.  This will take a number of years to complete and should eventually provide empirical data that demonstrates the efficacy of treatment, as measured by reduced recidivism amongst treated offenders compared to an untreated group.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am keen to increase the number of group treatment places available for sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is actively examining the possibility of locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh place of detention.  In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme it is taking some time to put a new programme in place.  Of course, any prisoner currently there may apply to participate in the dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that a new non-therapeutic programme for offenders, &ldquo;The Thinking Skills Training Programme&rdquo;, was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison earlier this year.  A significant number of sex offenders in Arbour Hill have commenced this new programme.  A similar programme has also been introduced in Cork prison.  This programme is designed to target a range of offenders, including sex offenders. The programme will be run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service.  The skills in this new programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &mdash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people, and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively.</P>
    <P>Such structured interpersonal work with offenders represents a significant development of the role of the prison officer and a new and challenging development within the Prison Service.</P>

    <P>*Figures are provisional.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from these statistics that the staffing strength of the Waterford-Kilkenny Garda division has increased substantially in the recent past.  While there has been a rise in reported crime in recent times the crime detection rate has also risen substantially.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have further informed me that the staffing situation in the division will continue to be kept under review and that each time additional personnel become available, the needs of the division will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of other Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As far as An Garda Síochána is concerned, the potential crime prevention capacity is the most important consideration when evaluating an application for a Garda CCTV system.  It should further be noted that CCTV systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing Garda resources. The extension of these systems to other areas must, therefore, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. <Col N="801" /> An advisory committee comprising senior officers in the Garda Síochána and a representative from my Department was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine the future of CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  While their main objective was to evaluate the potential crime prevention capacity of each of the applications received, they were also required to evaluate each application from a technical and telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business-community sources.</P>
    <P>At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  They are as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin &mdash; South Central &mdash; Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee has received 26 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective levels of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.  The applications on hand, including Waterford, are still under consideration and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit.  It is also only fair to say, however, that the commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>

      <P>Following the initial preliminary consideration of the paper, the Austrian Persidency agreed to revise it to take account of the views expressed by the member states.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 320 together.</P>
      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused.  Our system of recruitment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
      <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties.  While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand that they hold similar meetings.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £50,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training.  I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission both in a consultation paper and its report on the matter.  Action has already been taken on a number of recommendations contained in the report, for example the Criminal Law Act, 1997, abolished the penalties of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Other recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission report are being considered at present.  Any proposals which may emerge from this examination will be announced in the usual way.  I should point out, however, that the report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  It is also the case that the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report, which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that, as an aid for consistency in sentencing, the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, gives powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against what appears to the director to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 353 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is probably aware that up to December 1995 the Probation and Welfare Service assisted the courts by providing reports in family law cases although there was no statutory requirement to do so.  The Family Law Act, 1995, and subsequent family law legislation has put a statutory obligation on the Probation and Welfare Service to provide reports to the courts. However, due to increasing work demands, <Col N="804" /> especially in regard to criminal law work, the Probation and Welfare Service has not been able to deliver a family law service since the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the pressure on the Probation and Welfare Service from the courts and other developments affecting the service I established an expert group towards the end of 1997 to examine the Probation and Welfare Service with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To examine- (a) the role of the Probation and Welfare Service having regard to recent and current developments (b) the needs of the service, in the context of its proper role, to deliver an effective and efficient service (c) the organisational status of the service and to make recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The expert group has now furnished its first report which I hope to have published shortly.  I am awaiting the group's next report which I hope will make recommendations in relation to the role of the Probation and Welfare Service in civil cases.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission report on the family law courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments to which the Deputy refers were the subject of a recent court case.</P>
      <P>While I accept that there may have been a departure from some of the prison rules, any departure was in the context of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, being outdated and in some cases obsolete.  The court did not find that this departure had brought about conditions which would seriously endanger the applicant's life or health or subject him to inhuman or degrading treatment.</P>
      <P>I, too, share the court's concerns and I am conscious of the need to implement new prison rules to replace the Rules for Government of Prisons, 1947, at the earliest opportunity.  My Department has given the court an assurance that new rules will be implemented at the earliest possible moment and, in any event, not later than 30 June 1999.  The court has since rejected the applications for <i>habeas corpus, mandamus</i> declarations, etc., and no order of any substantive kind was made.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to implementing new prison rules is that these are in the process of being drafted and have been so for some time now.  Draft new prison rules were originally prepared by my Department and published in the policy document, &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;, in 1994.  The draft rules were then referred to the Attorney General's Office which subsequently advised that the rules would have to be substantially redrafted.  My Department has continued working on the new rules in consultation, when appropriate, with the Attorney General's Office in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that this matter will be given priority and that the new rules will be prepared and implemented at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>The increase in waiting times at the board's law centres is attributable to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  In the calendar year of 1997, the Legal Aid Board provided legal services to 13,805 people.  The number of legal aid cases requiring representation in court increased from 4,460 to 6,021, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>This was the seventh successive year in which there was an increase in the level of service provided by the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.  For example, 165 of the 910 appointments offered in law centres in September 1998 were for priority matters.  None of those accorded priority was put on waiting lists.  In the Dublin area, 122 appointments were offered through the private practitioner scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and when, for whatever reason, they become excessive, appropriate remedial action is taken where possible.  The board has a number of vacancies for solicitor staff and I am advised that a competition for the recruitment of solicitors for its law centres was held recently and a number of <Col N="808" /> appointments will be made shortly.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely and I will give the board every assistance in dealing with problems.</P>
    <P>On 25 June 1998, when responding to a Priority Question from Deputy O'Sullivan concerning waiting times, I said that I was optimistic that further resources would be secured for the Legal Aid Board to enable it to meet with the ever increasing demands on its services.  Subsequently, in July 1998, I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board.  Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for the law centres.  In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff in the law centres, three relief solicitors and three clerical officers, and the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.  I am confident that these additional staff will be allocated by the Legal Aid Board in such a manner as to make the greatest impact on waiting times at the board's law centres.</P>

    <P>The expert working group on child care which is chaired by my Department was established in July 1997 to devise a national framework for the development of quality child care services in Ireland which involves considering the following issues: financial and employment implications of a national framework; registration, training and qualifications; resourcing and sustaining child care within urban disadvantaged areas; resourcing <Col N="810" /> and sustaining child care within rural areas; needs and rights of children; equality of access and participation; early childhood education, and regulations and standards.</P>
    <P>Members have also considered the appropriate structures and mechanisms necessary to implement a national framework.  The group intends to finalise a report of recommendations by December 1998.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the great concern regarding the large number of joy-riding incidents, in particular following two deaths in Cork on 5 October; the steps, if any, he has taken to alert young persons to the great dangers associated with this activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20261/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The offence commonly referred to as joyriding is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended, which prohibits the taking of a vehicle without the owner's consent.</P>
      <P>The problem of joyriding is, of course, part of the problem of urban crime and disorder, the causes of which are widely accepted as multi-factoral. Solutions can only be found by addressing a wide range of socioeconomic issues.  I stress, however, that the approach to this problem in major urban areas, where there is a high density of local development and where inevitably there is a mix of a large young population, high unemployment and a serious lack of basic community facilities, cannot be approached on a purely law and order basis.</P>
      <P>This problem is not new and has in fact diminished significantly from the high figures in the mid-1980s.  However, there appeared to be an increase last year in this activity in the Cork area. The Garda is pursuing a policy to curtail this activity and evidence to date suggests that the policy is very effective.</P>
      <P>Part of the policy involves the Garda working closely with the local community in youth diversion programmes.  Since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have supported and funded these programmes, which are community based with the support of the Garda Síochána and which are designed to divert young people away from crime, including joyriding. These are 14 such schemes in existence throughout the country.  Three are in the Cork area, where there is also the Cork auto diversion project which comes under the auspice of my Department's Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These programmes are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting or otherwise, counselling, informal group work, education, group family and after care support <Col N="813" /> programmes, anti-vandalism/pro-environment programmes and other activities deemed appropriate in each of the specific catchment areas.</P>
    <P>The aim is to prevent crime, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal/anti-social behaviour, to improve the quality of life of young people, to provide activities aimed at improving life and communicating skills and personal development and to promote Garda/community relations.  These programmes are managed by members of the Garda, the Probation and Welfare Service and various voluntary and statutory groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, the schools programme run by the Garda Síochána community relations section is an ongoing active programme throughout the country.  The objective of this programme is to make young people aware of the dangers of involving themselves in crime generally and to promote a greater safety awareness among young people.</P>
    <P>Other measures taken by the Garda to combat joyriding include higher visibility patrols using four wheel drive vehicles and regular checkpoints. In addition, the Garda air support unit has been used successfully on a number of occasions. Also, under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, the gardaí have the power to stop and seize vehicles they believe to be driven by drivers who are under age.  In addition, the Garda uses the vehicle stopping device, known as the stinger, in appropriate circumstances.  It has acquired 172 such devices.  Garda personnel from each division have been trained in its use.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Garda will not let up in its ongoing anti-joyriding campaigns, and will continue to liaise with local authorities, community groups and State services so that all possible steps are taken to eradicate the scourge of joyriding from our society.</P>

      <asker>Mr. O'Shea</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he will provide statistical evidence of the successes, if any, of zero tolerance.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20264/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The signs of success of zero tolerance are promising as evidenced by the trend emerging from the Garda Síochána crime statistics which show that indictable offences, since this Government took office, were down by approximately 11 per cent on the previous 12 month period. The detection rate during that time was 41 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined before in the House what is involved in the concept of zero tolerance.  There are three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime.  First, a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime.  Second, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly <Col N="814" /> equipped and resourced to deal with crime and third, a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>As regards the targeting of particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which is before the House.  This is clear, practical evidence of the Government's policy of zero tolerance towards crime; particularly, but not exclusively, towards drug trafficking. The Bill contains a series of very strong measures which are, regrettably, all too necessary as a response to those who inflict such harm on our community.</P>
    <P>An aggressive policy is being pursued by the Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts.  This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that any long-term anti-crime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  In order to elicit the views of the public, I established a National Crime Forum which held public sessions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Sligo during the year.  This has given a unique opportunity to the public to contribute openly to the debate on the wide range of issues which impact on crime and I look forward to receiving the report of the forum in due course.  I also intend to establish a permanent community-based crime council to continue this open approach to crime policy development and I will also be publishing a White Paper next year to address the priority issues.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Courts Services Act, 1998, was signed into law on 16 April 1998, thus establishing an independent Courts Service.  I am pursuing a similar course of action in the case of prisons and a fundamental review of the Probation and Welfare Service is also under way.  As the Deputy may be aware the process of implementing the recommendations of an SMI review of the Garda Síochána is also under way.</P>
    <P>This year has also seen the introduction of a witness security programme in the area of serious organised crime, most notably in the drugs and money laundering areas.  The programme ensures that the criminal justice system can take prosecutions in cases which, by their very nature, attract the most serious and hardened of criminals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware also that the most extensive prisons building programme ever undertaken in the history of the State is under way and that there is also a firm commitment to raise the strength of the Garda to 12,000 within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The approach being taken, therefore, is a wide ranging and cohesive one which seeks to tackle various categories of criminals and to address the underlying causes of crime.</P>

      <P>My commitment to address the needs of victims of crime is a matter of record. In line with this commitment I have allocated funding to the organisation Victim Support in the current year totalling £645,000, an increase of over 100 per cent on the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>This orginisation provides a wide range of services to victims of crime.  These include a home visiting service which is operated in conjunction with the Garda and provides counselling, advice and support for victims at their homes.  The organisation also operates a service for tourists who fall victim to crime while visiting this country. A new scheme which has been recently introduced on a pilot basis is the hospital project through which it is intended to offer emotional support to victims who may be hospitalised as a result of crime.  A 24 hour telephone helpline which provides advice, support and a referral service is also available to all victims.</P>
      <P>Victim Support also provides a specialist service for the families of homicide victims.  This service which is available nationally is operated by a corps of specially trained volunteers and is aimed at providing emotional support and practical assistance and advice to families and relatives of the deceased person.</P>
      <P>As part of the ongoing courts building programme, it is now the policy of my Department to provide dedicated facilities in all new or renovated court buildings for victims of crime where they can await their cases in privacy and some degree of comfort.  For example, such accommodation has recently been provided in the new courthouses at Tallaght, the Richmond courthouse and Carrick-on-Shannon and at Naas courthouse, which was refurbished recently.  The video link system which enables persons under 17 years of age to give evidence and be cross-examined in trials of sexual offences or offences involving violence from a location outside of the courtroom, has now been in operation since 1994 at the Four Courts, Dublin.  There are plans in hand at present to add a second system at the Four Courts and to install a system at a venue outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court victim witness programme to which I presume the Deputy is referring is operated by Victim Support.  The programme provides a service for victims who are required to attend court as witnesses or for other reasons.  It is operated by volunteers who help alleviate any distress which may ensue from the court proceedings as well as providing general non-legal explanations of the court procedures.  The service which was initially available in Dublin has now been <Col N="816" /> extended to Cork, Sligo, Portlaoise, Carlow and Athlone.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to accurately average the time being taken to process applications for asylum. Cases can go through all or some of the stages &mdash; Dublin Convention, manifestly unfounded, substantive assessment and appeals at all these stages.  Also some staff are assigned to dealing with new applications while others are assigned to dealing with the backlog.  In addition, a high proportion of applicants do not turn up for scheduled interviews or respond to communications. However, it is my hope that with the additional staff sanctioned for my Department's asylum division, new cases will generally be finalised in a matter of months.  The number of applications refused to date in 1998 is 756.  Most of these would relate to applications from previous years.</P>
    <P>In the absence of exit controls, statistics on the number of applicants who have left the country voluntarily are not available.  According to records held in my Department, 69 persons have withdrawn their applications and indicated that they wished to leave the country.  Some of these would have been deported under escort and are included in the deportation figure below.  Others would have departed without escort.  In total, 36 persons who sought asylum and for whom deportation orders exist have departed without escort, including persons whose cases have been processed to finality.</P>
    <P>A total of 51 persons have been deported under escort to 14 October this year.  Of these, 22 <Col N="817" /> were deported pursuant to the Dublin Convention. Some 12 persons who had been refused refugee status were returned to their country of origin. A further 17 persons were deported under escort of whom a number had at one stage in their stay made an application for asylum but subsequently withdrew it.</P>
    <P>In May 1998 my Department sought tenders from persons interested in establishing and maintaining an independent refugee legal service.  Five tenders were received and following the detailed evaluation process conducted by a committee comprising one representative each from my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the UNHCR, it was recommended that the tender process be abandoned and no contract awarded.  I have accepted this recommendation and further options are being considered.  It is hoped to finalise arrangements shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>There is an important distinction to be made between those offenders released having served their sentences with remission and those granted temporary release.  All prisoners serving determinate sentences, other than those committed to custody for periods of one calendar month or less, can earn remission of part of their sentence for good behaviour.  Full temporary release may be granted in cases where the offender is nearing the end of his or her sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to provide the precise information sought by the Deputy in the time available. However, I can inform the Deputy that there were a total of 355 prisoners on temporary release as of Friday, 16 October, 1998.  The daily numbers on temporary release has decreased considerably over the past 12 months.  There were, for example, 518 prisoners on temporary release on 16 October, 1997.  I point out that the vast majority of these prisoners were granted renewable temporary release and, therefore, required to report back to the prison from which he or she was released on a weekly basis.  It is also a condition of renewable temporary release <Col N="818" /> that offenders report to their local Garda station on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The granting of temporary or early release, called parole in other jurisdictions, is a feature of prisons systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  Temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</P>
    <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours, for example, to attend a funeral, early temporary release which must be renewed weekly or on full temporary release in the last weeks of their sentences.</P>
    <P>In addition, in a substantial number of cases the granting of temporary release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation, in other words, prisoners may be released earlier than planned due to overcrowding.  This has been the case for several years.  However, it would be wrong to suggest that serious offenders are being released simply because of accommodation problems and without reference to other criteria.</P>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration.  The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public.</P>
    <P>In this regard it should be noted that persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as sex offences, importation or supply of drugs, armed robbery and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of temporary release except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that since taking office, 70 spaces have been provided in Limerick prison together with 152 at the new prison in Castlerea. My Department's prison building programme is on target to make available approximately 1,300 additional prison places by end 1999.  These additional spaces will help eliminate the problem of overcrowding and thereby tackle the need to grant temporary release for that reason in a meaningful way.</P>

      <P>My Department took over the Fort Mitchel, Spike Island, complex from the Department of Defence on 29 March 1985.  Early development at the prison after the initial take over was carried out by trades staff of the Prison Service under the professional direction of the Office of Public Works.  Materials and supplies were provided by the governor in charge of works.  Prisoners would have assisted trades staff in the early refurbishment projects.  Records of expenditure in the early years are not readily available and it would take a considerable amount of time and resources to co-ordinate the required information.</P>
      <P>In recent years a number of major projects have been carried out at Spike Island, for example, refurbishment of education unit, workshops, staff mess, staff quarters, gymnasium, fresh water supply, public lighting, upgrading of office accommodation, upgrading of pier and the re-surfacing of the roadway from the pier to the prison. The total capital expenditure incurred in relation to these projects since 1994 is as follows: 1994, £495,173.45; 1995, £256,170.42; 1996, £834,529.55; 1997, £472,556.98; 1998, £326,384.71.</P>

      <P>The creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences is a key feature of the Government's programme to combat the drugs problem. In accordance with this commitment, I requested the working group on a courts commission, chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to consider the establishment of a drug courts system in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 September 1998, I announced that the government has approved the publication of the fifth report of the working group on a courts commission on this subject.  I also announced that I had secured Government approval for the establishment <Col N="821" /> of a drug courts planning committee to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court early in the new year.  The terms of reference of the planning committee are currently being finalised and I expect to be in a position to appoint the members of the committee shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to progressing the implementation of the drug courts pilot project in the District Court.  Given the integrated cross service strategy involved in the project, bringing together as it does the courts, the other arms of the criminal justice system and community services, the committee will immediately address the financial and resources issues arising.  This task will involve identifying existing resources already being used in this area and potential savings which implementation of the scheme may secure in the criminal justice, health and community services fields.  I am also making resources available to support the work of the planning committee and I will consider the recommendations of the committee with regard to resources for the pilot scheme when they come to hand.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>Work on the establishment of a human rights commission, with a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the proposed human rights commission in Northern Ireland, is currently under way in my Department.  In this regard, I hope to be in a position to bring heads of a Bill to Government in the near future.  While, strictly speaking, it is not an essential requirement, I hope that it may be possible for both commissions to become operational at roughly the same time.</P>
      <P>As referred to in my reply to a question on 25 June 1998, this work has involved extensive contact and co-operation with relevant agencies in the neighbouring jurisdiction in view of the commonality of the commitments entered into by both Governments in this area.  My Department will, of course, take note of any views expressed by other interested groups in regard to the proposed commission.  A meeting has already taken place at official level with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to discuss the proposals in broad outline.  Furthermore, my Department has already been in contact with organisations which have a particular interest in this area.  The Deputy can be assured that the opportunity for a full debate on the proposed legislation will be afforded the House at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that due regard is being paid to the Paris Principles in the context of my deliberations on the proposed human rights commission.</P>

A study on methodology for compiling county income estimates has been undertaken for the Central Statistics Office, CSO, by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and is currently being analysed.  It is expected that county income estimates for a number of years will be published in mid-1999.</P>
      <P>Regional accounts published by the CSO for the years 1991-95 give a measure of the output of each regional authority area using gross value added, GVA, as the indicator.  GVA is the measure of the goods and services produced in a region; it is not a measure of the income of a region.  These estimates are not available at county level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the independent review of the community employment programme, CE, carried out by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to examine if CE is working effectively as a labour market programme to enhance the chances of participants and if CE in its current manifestation is the best way of targeting our investment in tackling long-term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche reported to my Department in September and I immediately arranged for publication of the review and its circulation to stakeholders as I know there is a great deal of interest in the review and the package of recommendations it proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the utilisation of CE by statutory bodies, the review found market linkages in this area to be weak <Col N="825" /> with few of the participants finding equivalent work subsequently.  For that reason the review recommended the gradual phasing out of CE places in the statutory sector with the onus for delivery of the relevant service resting with the appropriate Department.  Commenting on the education sector the review describes the work being done on community employment as &ldquo;very valuable but the question is whether these supports should in fact be provided directly by the Department of Education and Science&rdquo;.  Any proposals I bring forward to amend the community employment programme will reflect a process of consultation with the social partners and with ministerial colleagues who have a departmental interest in this area.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there is one company in the Irish insurance market quoting car insurance for persons with a disability; if the declined cases agreement applies in respect of persons with a disability; if insurance companies unwilling to quote for this business can be forced to make an insurance offer which constitutes a fair load; and her views on whether present practice constitutes a breach of spirit or of the law on equal treatment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the present situation in relation to disabled drivers is that while only one motor insurer is currently quoting for new business, other insurers are providing insurance cover for disabled drivers under existing policies.</P>
      <P>We are not legally empowered to compel authorised motor insurers to accept or reject individual insurance risks or classes of insurance, or to impose guidelines regarding conditions or loadings attached to such risks.  Risk assessment of individual applications for motor insurance is strictly a matter for each insurance company based on its underwriting experience and prudential requirements.  The underwriting results for motor insurers have been particularly poor over the past two years.  Insurers' underwriting experience indicates that drivers with certain disabilities represent a greater than average risk, particularly where the disabled person is a learner or young inexperienced driver.  In these circumstances, assessment of disabled drivers by motor insurers as constituting a higher risk category could hardly be regarded as breaching the spirit or the law on equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of loadings applied to disabled drivers, has been pursued by the Department on many occasions, both with individual insurance companies and with the Irish Insurance Federation. Following referral of the subject of disability loadings to the former Motor Insurance Advisory Board, it was agreed that provided the <Col N="826" /> driver remained claims free, a maximum disability loading of 20 per cent would apply in the first year of insurance.  This would decrease to 15 per cent in the second year of claims free insurance and no loading at all would apply thereafter provided that the driver remained claims free.</P>
    <P>Our understanding is that these arrangements are being operated satisfactorily by authorised motor insurers.  The Irish Insurance Federation would look at individual cases where the arrangements are not being observed.  However the arrangements do not apply in the cases of degenerative illnesses.  They are also subject to the insurer's right to call for a medical examination.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently reconstituted the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  The question of insurance companies' treatment of disabled drivers is one of the areas that will usefully be looked at by the new enlarged board.</P>
    <P>The present criteria used for assessing disabled drivers as an insurance risk are a considerable improvement on that which previously applied. Prior to the introduction of the current system loadings ranged from 10 per cent &mdash; 150 per cent depending on the insurer in question and the nature of the disability.</P>
    <P>The declined cases agreement applies in all cases where a motor insurance quote has been refused, including cases of disabled drivers, and a quote will be available, subject to the loading system referred to above.</P>

Implementation of the recommendations contained in the Competition Authority's report is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. I have written to him, informing him that I fully accept the conclusions of the Competition Authority's <Col N="827" /> study which point overwhelmingly to the need to overhaul the current liquor licensing system in the interests of consumers and competition, and urging him to examine the relevant legislation and proceed with proposals for the necessary legislative repeals and changes required to implement the authority's recommendations as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The amount of training allowance is graduated according to the age of the trainee and, in the case of trainees aged 18 and over, on whether the training involved is full or part-time.  In addition to these training allowances, trainees may also qualify for accommodation and meals allowances. I am providing the Deputy with a detailed schedule of the sums involved.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the fact that where a trainee's social welfare allowance exceeds the amounts listed in the schedule, a training allowance equivalent to that amount is paid.  In addition, if a trainee has one or more dependants, he or she will receive and additional payment of £12 per week.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that FÁS training allowances at their current level are generally satisfactory, taking into account their relationship with social welfare payments and the benefits in employability which accrue to persons who undertake training.  I am considering, however, whether any additional steps need to be taken to increse the attractiveness of FÁS training courses to people who are long-term unemployed.</P>

The QSR project is part of a wider assessment of the marine environment of the north east Atlantic, which is being carried out under the auspices of the OSPAR Convention.</P>
      <P>Given that phosphates in coastal waters arise mainly from inputs from rivers and lakes, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorous) Regulations, 1998, which may colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, made earlier this year.  These regulations provide for specified improvements in water quality conditions in rivers and lakes based on phosphorous concentrations or related water quality classifications.  The regulations also provide for periodic reporting in relation to progress in implementing the requirements of the regulations. These regulations give effect to certain requirements arising under Council Directive 76/464/EEC on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my answer to his question of 6 October that the missile attacks on 20 August on a chemical plant near Khartoum and on a target in Afghanistan, were a response to the attacks on the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, which resulted in the deaths of 263 people.  At the time, the US indicated that it had acted upon credible and compelling evidence identifying those who had perpetrated the Embassy bombings and that those individuals were planning further attacks.</P>
      <P>Since the missile attack on Sudan, there has been questioning of the basis for that decision, including the evidence available to the US that the targeted plant was engaged in producing chemical weapons.  Following a request by Sudan to the Security Council and the involvement of a number of other states in the region, informal consultations have taken place in New York on the possible tabling of a draft resolution requesting the UN Secretary General to dispatch a fact finding mission to Sudan to study whether the Al Shifa factory was involved in the production of chemical weapons ingredients and whether any links exist between the factory and the Usama Bin Laden terrorist network.  I am not aware of conclusive developments in these consultations. No draft resolution has yet been formally tabled.</P>
      <P>With our EU partners, Ireland views the fight against terrorism as one of the priority aims of our common foreign policy.  To be effective, that fight requires maximum international co-operation and confidence between governments to ensure that those responsible for terrorist acts are brought to justice.  We have noted that the US stated to the UN Security Council that additional information would be provided on the background to the attacks, and we have welcomed the fact that informal consultations involving members of the UN Security Council, with Sudan and other governments, regarding the basis for the missile attack have taken place.  It is important that this issue be resolved between the United States and Sudan in accordance with the principles to the UN Charter and of international justice and in a manner which will contribute to the fight against international terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Deputy in his question refers also to attacks on Iraq in 1992 and 1996, and he refers to &ldquo;repeated acts of aggression by the United States Government&rdquo;, and &ldquo;state terrorism&rdquo;.  I do not accept the sweeping generalisatiosn used by the Deputy.  I would point out to the Deputy that, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Security Council has a responsibility to determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 30 September, I remain extremely concerned at the situation in Algeria, particularly the continuation of appalling massacres of innocent civilians including women and children.  There have been very disturbing reports of torture and death of detainees by Algerian authorities which would be in clear violation of fundamental human rights.  I have expressed my particular concern to the Algerian authorities on a number of occasions about these reports.</P>
      <P>My concerns in this regard have been reinforced by the conclusions of the recently published report of the UN Committee on Human Rights.  These referred to &ldquo;the persistent allegation of collusion of members of the security forces in terrorist attacks&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While there is no clear evidence linking the Algerian Government to the massacres, the lack of transparency will only encourage suspicions. For this reason Ireland has pressed the Algerian Government to accede to a request for a visit by UN human rights inspectors.  Last March at the session of the UN Commission for Human Rights, Ireland strongly urged the commission to address this issue and succeeded in securing a strong EU statement at the conclusion of the session. Regrettably, the commission was not persuaded of the need for specific action.</P>
      <P>I will seek to ensure that the situation in Algeria is raised by the European Union in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly during its current session.  In the light of the outcome of the debate, I will consider further the possibility of co-sponsoring a resolution on the issue.</P>
      <P>I will also seek to ensure that, as Algeria moves towards presidential elections in the near future, every effort is made to encourage the forces for democratic reform in that country.</P>

      <P>On 1 June 1996, the British Government introduced new civil service nationality rules.  These regulations apply on a UK-wide basis, including to the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  As I stated in reply to a similar question on 26 May last, the effect of the 1 June development was to place Irish citizens on the same footing as Commonwealth and other European Economic Area (EEA) nationals with regard to civil service recruitment in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The position of the British Government was that these changes were necessary to protect itself against the possibility of legal challenges in the European Court of Justice by nationals from other EEA countries, in light of the freedom of movement of workers' obligations arising under the Treaty of Rome.  It was also conveyed to us that, despite the new restrictions, Irish citizens would continue to be eligible for some 75 per cent of the total UK Civil Service posts, including in the Northern Ireland Civil Service.</P>

      <P>On 15 October 1998, during the course of my visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York, I signed, on behalf of the Government, a Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the United Nations in regard to the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS.  The UNSAS has the aim of improving the response times within which troops can be deployed in peacekeeping operations to trouble spots around the world.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to identify the resources which Ireland has indicated it will provide to the United Nations for use in peacekeeping operations under specified conditions.  Ireland has agreed to contribute troops up to a maximum of 850 personnel.  Participation can be fulfilled by the redesignation to UNSAS of personnel currently serving with the UN.  There would be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and, as at present, Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent of more than 12 personnel to a specific operation.</P>

      <P>However, I am delighted to report that there were no problems with the numbers of volunteers for the new battalion which departs over the next two weeks for service with UNIFIL.  It is expected that all positions in the battalion will be filled by the rotation dates.  For the first time in years, there is a waiting list of privates to serve in Lebanon. This is a testimony to the Government's policy of ongoing continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>This case appears to be one in which some but not all of the shareholders are in favour of division.  An application was made to the Land Commission for compulsory division of the commonage under the Land Acts.  A scheme for division was prepared but not approved before the Land Commission had suspended the use of its compulsory division powers and ceased work on all compulsory division cases as a result of an appeal to the High Court by objectors against the compulsory division of a commonage in County Mayo.  An interim judgment was delivered in 1994 but the case is not yet finally resolved.  The Land Commission will reassess its policy and procedures with regard to the compulsory division of commonage in the light of the final judgment of the court when delivered.</P>

      <P>My Department purchased this farm and has recently sold part of it.  This has not affected animal health investigations on the farm, which are now being finalised.  No final decisions have yet been taken in relation to the disposal of the remainder of the lands.

    <P>As regards the condition referred to by the Deputy, I understand that lesions of multiple eosinophilic granulomata were found in a six month old bovine from another farm in the area which was diagnosed as suffering from a chronic viral infection.  The lesions were attributed to parasites.  As part of the overall animal health investigations and having regard to the findings of the recent scientific report already mentioned <Col N="844" /> in the Dáil, I have arranged to have these lesions, and also tissues from a range of similar conditions, investigated for the presence of aluminium. As regards future investigations, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 91 and 101 of 6 October last.</P>

The eligibility period for the 1997-98 hardship grant was between 1 November 1997 and 30 April 1998. The herd of the person named was depopulated in July 1997 and the holding was de-restricted on 21 November 1997.  A hardship grant application was completed by the person named on 3 November 1997.  However, as his herd had been depopulated and no animals were being retained, his applicatiion did not meet a fundamental conditon of the hardship grant.

      <P>Annual estimates of agricultural incomes are provided by two sources namely, the CSO in its estimates of agricultural output, input and income and Teagasc in its national farm survey. The CSO provides an estimate of aggregate farm income.  The CSO separately provides data relating to farm numbers, although this information is not available in respect of each of the past ten years.  Applying these numbers to aggregate farm income, it is possible to arrive at one estimate of average farm income.  A table showing the results of this disaggregation follows.  Included also are figures derived from Teagasc's national farm survey. The methodologies and definitions of &ldquo;income&rdquo; employed in both estimates are different and lead to differing results.</P>

      <P>The procedure for authorising new plant protection products involves a review of the data relating to the physical, chemical and technical properties of the product, the residue profile in food, toxicological profile, fate and behaviour in the environment and ectotoxicological profile. The time laspse for this evaluation can be up to four years.  In the case of a new product which is similar to one already on the market a &ldquo;permission to market&rdquo; authorisation may be granted within one year of application.  The review process for new products is now more detailed and complex and it is not correct to compare the time involved with that taken in 1990.</P>

      <Quest>the regulations under which his Department can claw back milk quotas from farmers in certain circumstances; if he will give details of these circumstances; if his attention has been drawn to the huge annual income reduction that can be involved for a farmer who purchases a farm with quota and loses 20 per cent of his purchased quota; if his attention has further been drawn to any other business where similar penalties apply; and the reason this practice is acceptable to his Department.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions for the operation of the milk quota system in Ireland are set down in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, S.I. No. 266 of 1995.  Under the EU and national regulations milk quota is attached to land, and quota is transferred with the lands to which it is attached.  The quota system as operated in Ireland provides for the sale and lease of milk quota. Where these transactions take place under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes, the system gives priority to smaller and more vulnerable producers who wish to increase their quota.</P>
      <P>The clawback measure was introduced under Regulation 4(19) of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995.  The purpose of the clawback is to ensure that sufficient milk quota is available under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes and thus in turn available for redistribution to small scale producers. Specific land transactions such as family transfers or renewals of existing arrangements are exempt from milk quota clawback.</P>
      <P>Similar mechanisms operate in a number of other member states and in some cases the rates are much higher than those in Ireland.  I have asked the milk quota review group to review all aspects of the operation of the milk quota regime in Ireland, including the clawback arrangement.</P>

      <P>The scheme of installation aid was suspended on 7 August 1997 when the funding available under the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry was exhausted.  The terms of a revised, more focused installation aid scheme targeted towards those young farmers most in need of assistance was submitted for approval last July to the Department of Finance and the European Commission.  The Commission recently raised questions about some aspects of the proposal.  My Department has responded in detail to the Commission and again stressed my desire to secure the earliest agreement for the new measure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 165, 166, 167 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>Lands owned attract REPS payments as do lands leased for a minimum of five years.</P>
      <P>REPS participants with owned commonage lands or with other lands, in natural heritage areas (NHAs), including special areas of conservation (SACs) and special protection areas (SPAs), whether owned or leased for a minimum of five years, can under the new REPS measure claim payments on this land up to a maximum of 300 acres at the following rates: £80 per acre for the first 100 acres; £8 per acre between 101 and 200 acres; and £6 per acre between 201 and 300 acres.  Leased commonage lands are not eligible under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of payments under the scheme <Col N="854" /> up to the new limit of 300 acres applies only to those REPS participants who have lands in these designated areas.  Where the lands in the NHAs and commonages is less than 40 hectares (100 acres), the higher REPS payment is made on the actual area of NHA or commonage.</P>
    <P>The new REPS measure requires that a framework plan for low intensity farming and environmental management be drawn up for each commonage. The framework plan will set the stocking levels necessary for the environmentally optimum grazing of lands and to allow the regeneration of vegetation.  It is not possible to say in advance of the availability of each commonage framework plan what level of destocking, if any, will be required.  However, each commonage shareholder will be allocated a grazing entitlement <i>pro rata</i> to his-her owned share of the commonage. Each framework plan will be prepared by independent agricultural and environmental consultants.</P>
    <P>The introduction of cross compliance was recommended by an independent report and was agreed by the Government in early 1997.  As a result cross compliance applies to farmers with over grazed commonages, including any overgrazed commonages with designated NHAs and SACs.  In order to qualify for livestock premia and headage payments farmers with lands in NHAs including SACs have the option of following an agri-environmental plan under either REPS or a national scheme operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Farmers have been notified that unless they participate in an agri-environmental plan they will not be paid premia or compensatory payments in 1999.  The new measure in REPS is designed to provide significant compensation for farmers in these areas for applying environmental measures.</P>

      <P>Applications under the scheme of early retirement from farming are dealt with on a regional basis rather than a county basis.  There are some 50 applications to be processed in the region in which Westmeath is situated.  These are <Col N="860" /> dealt with in order of receipt.  There are three applications on hand from Westmeath two of which were received in May and the other in June.  These are due to be processed in the next couple of weeks.  I point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer.  The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt of a valid application in the Department determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

On foot of this commitment, it was decided, in November 1997, that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>I consider that, in the context of the major debt relief package announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I on 16 September, it is now appropriate for Ireland to honour its proposed contribution to ESAF.  Subscription to ESAF would be consistent with and should enhance the attainment of Ireland's wider overseas development co-operation objectives.  I accept the need for reform of certain aspects of ESAF programmes and note the positive response of the IMF to the external evaluation of the facility.  I will continue to seek to ensure that the lessons learnt from the external review will be brought to bear as regards the planning, design and implementation of ESAF programmes.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of interest paid on certain home loans, a qualifying residence is a residential premises which is used as the sole or main residence of the individual or the former or separated spouse of the individual.  Interest relief can therefore be claimed in respect of both the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; properties.</P>
      <P>The extent of interest relief due is governed by the basis under which the individual is assessed to income tax.  The following examples illustrate this point.</P>
      <P>Individuals who are divorced and have not remarried and individuals who are separated and taxed as single people can avail of tax relief up to £2,500 in respect of interest payments they make on qualifying residences, including that of a former spouse.  An upper limit of £5,000 applies in cases where an individual was divorced and has now remarried and is jointly assessed to income tax with his spouse.  The upper limit of £5,000 may also apply where an individual is separated but he-she and his-her separated spouse have opted for joint assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintenance arrangements may provide for payments to a former or a separated spouse.  The terms of the arrangement may provide, in respect <Col N="863" /> of the &ldquo;old&rdquo; residence, either (a) that the individual making the maintenance payments, will pay the interest repayments directly, or (b) that the beneficiary will directly be liable to meet such payments.</P>
    <P>In the case of (a), the individual making the payment will be regarded as having paid interest on a qualifying residence and can claim a deduction for that interest in addition to the interest he may pay on a &ldquo;new&rdquo; property, subject to the limit of £2,500.</P>
    <P>In the case of (b), the total payment will be regarded as a deduction for income tax purposes for the person making a maintenance payment.  It will be regarded as a taxable source of income in the hands of the beneficiary.  However, the beneficiary may claim tax relief in respect of the interest paid on the qualifying residence.</P>
    <P>However, a separated couple, who are not divorced, may opt to be taxed jointly as a married couple.  If they opt for this, the maintenance arrangements are ignored for tax purposes and they are taxed as though they were still living together and taxed in accordance with section 1017, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The effect of this is that they can claim interest relief on the upper limit of £5,000.</P>
    <P>I have no proposal to alter the current arrangements in this area.</P>

      <P>Tax will only arise from any possible increase in land values attributable to rezoning in the event of a disposal of such rezoned land at which point capital gains tax would be charged on any gain arising.</P>
      <P>The value to the Exchequer of any capital gains tax arising should landowners dispose of such rezoned land will, in general, be 40 per cent of the landowner's chargeable gain.  The chargeable gain accruing on the disposal of an asset is calculated by deducting from the consideration received for the disposal the cost of the acquisition of the asset and any expenditure incurred on its enhancement.  The amounts so deductible may be adjusted to take account of inflation.  In the case of a disposal of development land this indexation relief is confined to the amount of the current use value of the land at its time of acquisition or at 6 April 1974, if acquired prior to that date.  The first £1,000 of an individual's chargeable gains in any year of assessment is exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, introduces a provision whereby gains on disposals in the period 23 April 1998 to 5 April <Col N="864" /> 2002 of development land which on the date of disposal has planning permission for residential development will be liable to capital gains tax at 20 per cent.  In addition, disposals of land in that period to a housing authority for the purposes of the Housing Acts will qualify for the 20 per cent rate whether or not the land has planning permission. From 6 April 2002 onwards the rate of tax on gains on disposals of all land zoned for residential purposes will be 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax is administered under the self-assessment system.  This means that taxpayers are obliged to make returns and payments in relation to capital gains tax without being requested to do so by Revenue.  Payments of capital gains tax must be made by 1 November in the tax year after the tax year in which the chargeable gain arises.  The payment made on this date is known as preliminary tax and must be at least 90 per cent of the full capital gains tax liability.  Any balance of capital tax outstanding must be paid by 31 January in the tax year after the preliminary tax date at the latest and the capital gains tax return must also be submitted by that date.</P>
    <P>Finally, as with all returns submitted under the self-assessment system, capital gains tax returns are subject to audit by Revenue for verification purposes.  Taxpayers who submit incorrect or late returns, or who make underpayments, in relation to capital gains tax are liable to a number of penalties depending on the severity of the default. These penalties can include the imposition of interest, surcharges and monetary fines, including fines imposed by the courts.</P>

    <P>(i) Excludes the effects of the 1988 tax amnesty;</P>
    <P>(ii) and (iii) exclude yields from the 1993 tax amnesty in 1993 and 1994 respectively.</P>
    <P>Notes on Table</P>
    <P>(a) <i>PAYE figures</i></P>
    <P>(i) Income tax collected throught the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(ii) The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of tax paying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1987 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1987-88.</P>
    <P>(a) <i>Farming figures</i></P>
    <P>(i) In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units assessed to tax for the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, for example the 1987 receipt is divided by the number assesesd for the year 1987-88.</P>
    <P>(ii) The figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.  Farm tax represents a fraction of their <Col N="867" /> overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be precisely distinguished.  Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>(c) <i>Other Self-employed figures</i></P>
    <P>(i) The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>General Notes</P>
    <P>(i) A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on one or other of them is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii) Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii) Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangement are not included in the calculations. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

      <P>With regard to child care, in my budget speech last December I said &ldquo;it is not possible to introduce all the new measures one would wish in a single budget.  I have examined carefully the possibility of a tax relief on child care at the standard rate of tax but have decided not to proceed with it this year.  I will review the situation for my next budget in the light of the reports due next year from the Working Group on Child Care set up under Partnership 2000 and from the Household Review Group and the Commission on the Family set up by the previous Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In considering these matters in the run up to the forthcoming budget, I intend to take into account the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Family, published in May and any findings that emerge from the other working groups mentioned above which have yet to report.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that as far as possible income from all sources should be subjected to taxation.  Deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, is levied at either 20 per cent or 24 per cent.  The 20 per cent rate applies to special savings accounts, SSAs.  DIRT is the collection mechanism by which tax is withheld at source on deposit interest and in all cases is a final liability tax on such interest income.  The yield from DIRT net of refunds, was £150 million in 1997 and as such is an important source of Exchequer revenue.  I have no plans to cut the rate of DIRT on interest income in the event of a fall in interest rates.  Naturally any further cuts in the standard rate of income tax, now 24 per cent, will be reflected in a cut in the standard rate of DIRT.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the concerns of the Road Hauliers Association of Ireland relate to the extension of relevant contracts tax, RCT, to certain additional operations in the meat processing industry, including haulage of meat, and also to the alleged lack of publicity relating to the introduction of these new measures.  The extension, which became effective <Col N="869" /> from 6 October 1998, brings the meat industry into line with other industries, such as construction and forestry, in which haulage activities have been subject to RCT for many years.</P>
      <P>RCT requires principal contractors to deduct tax at 35 per cent from payments to subcontractors other than certified subcontractors.  A certified subcontractor is one to whom Revenue has issued a certificate of authorisation, known as a C2, and for whom the principal contractor has received a relevant payments card, authorising him to make payments without deduction of tax.</P>
      <P>Details of the extension were included in the June edition of <i>Tax Briefing,</i> which is issued by Revenue to all tax practitioners on their records. A further, more detailed, article was included in the September editions of <i>Tax Briefing.</i>  It is understood that details of the amendment were also notified to accountants and tax practitioners through their professional bodies.  However, it appears that the Irish Road Hauliers Association and most hauliers were unaware of the effect of the change.</P>
      <P>RCT deducted by principal contractors is available for set-off against tax liabilities of the subcontractor, including income tax, PAYE, PRSI and VAT liabilities.  Subject to any outstanding tax liabilities, a monthly claim for RCT can be made.  Because of the particular difficulties of hauliers, Revenue will accept RCT repayment claims from hauliers at shorter intervals.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they will, in the initial period, give priority to processing applications for C2s and to claims for repayment or set-off of RCT received from hauliers in the meat industry.  Only a small number of applications for a C2 have been received from hauliers to date and all such applications are being dealt with expeditiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1995, introduced a provision which allowed the Revenue Commissioners to require information from health boards concerning premises for which they make payment for the purpose of rent or rent subsidy.  The information which may be required includes the name and address of the owners of the premises.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the return of rent allowance payments are required for tax rather than calendar years. Accordingly, the reference in the question to the year 1997 is being taken to mean the tax year 1997-98.  It is not possible to provide details of health board returns to the Revenue Commissioners for the tax year 1997-98 as such returns are not due until 31 January 1999.</P>
      <P>It is understood that health board records do not readily allow for the identification of the landlord in respect of whose premises a rent allowance payment is made.  Information relating to rent allowances is recorded on the individual applicant's file and the extraction of the landlord details from those files is causing difficulties for the health boards.  As an interim measure, agreement was reached with the Eastern Health Board to provide Revenue with the computer record of rent allowance payments which, in addition to details of the individual applicants, also contains details of the properties to which the payments relate.  However, as these records do not contain the names and addresses of the landlords of the relevant properties, this information has been of limited value to Revenue.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, on behalf of the health boards, with a view to having comprehensive returns made by all health board for all years.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of landlords come within the self-assessment system of taxation and landlords, in common with all other self-assessed taxpayers, are required to make an annual return of income detailing all sources of income.  Landlords who have not made a return are targeted, in the same way as other non-filers, for appropriate action by Revenue, to ensure that returns are made.</P>
      <P>The landlord's return of income is processed under self-assessment and may be subject to Revenue audit.  Information received by Revenue from various sources regarding income from rents is available to Revenue auditors as a check on the return of income.  This information includes third party information such as claims for the income tax rent allowance made by individual tenants, third party returns made by persons in receipt of rent on behalf of landlords, information supplied to Revenue by anonymous sources and the return of properties made by the Eastern Health Board and other health boards when these are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Because rental income forms only part of the income of a large number of individuals and companies, it is not possible to isolate the amount of tax paid in respect of such income or the tax outstanding which is specifically referable to such income.</P>

    <P>Figures for rental income are net of capital allowances and expenses.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that compliance in the rental income sector generally is governed by the principles underlying self-assessment.  This means that individual landlords are obliged to make annual returns of rental income, pay preliminary tax on 1 November of the tax year in which the rental income arises and are subject to Revenue audit for verification purposes in respect of returns submitted. Landlords who have not made a return are targeted in the same way as other non-filers for appropriate action by Revenue to ensure that returns are made.  Such action may also lead to the imposition of penalties such as additions for surcharges and interest, monetary fines, including court fines, and publication of the taxpayer's name in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, I have been advised by Revenue that there is no evidence that compliance levels in the rental income sector are not comparable to compliance levels generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the low level of uptake of places on the psychiatric nursing registration-diploma programme this year.  Last January, when announcing details of the arrangements for this year's competitions I specifically referred to psychiatric nursing as a rewarding and worthwhile career, and to the substantial increase in the number of training places available in that discipline. The same message was conveyed by my Department to educational correspondents of the national newspapers and to schools guidance counsellors throughout the country, as part of a concerted recruitment drive.</P>
      <P>Despite the efforts to raise the profile of psychiatric nursing, particularly among school leaving students, only 92 of the 201 places available on the psychiatric nursing registration diploma programme were filled this year.</P>
      <P>In the light of this disappointing outcome, I believe that all of the relevant agencies need to redouble the efforts to attract more entrants to psychiatric nursing training.  We have a declining school leaving population who have a greater range of third level courses to choose from than ever before.  This is the environment in which we have to compete for student nurses.</P>
      <P>As a first step, a seminar the issues in relation to the recruitment of students to psychiatric nursing and to make recommendations on future action will be held this Friday, 23 October 1998. All agencies involved in the provision of psychiatric nursing education and training will be represented at this seminar, which is being organised by my Department.  An Bord Altranais has also been invited to send representatives.</P>
      <P>My Department is engaged in separate discussions with An Bord Altranais in relation to the development of further promotional literature and video materials for use in an ongoing recruitment drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of training places available this year in the three schools of psychiatric nursing referred to by the Deputy and the actual number <Col N="874" /> of places accepted by successful applicants is as follows:</P>

    <P>I have been informed by the Local Appointments Commission, which administered the application and selection processes for places on this year's general and psychiatric nursing registration-diploma programmes, that none of the 11 applicants who originally accepted places in the Mid-Western or North-Western Health Board schools of psychiatric nursing indicated a second preference for a place in the South-Eastern Health Board school of psychiatric nursing in their application forms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>At present the average waiting time for commencement of foreign adoption assessments in the Southern Health Board area is three years in Cork and 12 months in Kerry.  The average length of the assessment is six to eight months.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health board that there has been a considerable increase in the number of applications for assessment in the Cork area this year and, due to the withdrawal of two registered adoption societies from this work, the Southern Health Board is now the only agency providing an assessment service.  In view of the long waiting period for assessments, the position is being reviewed by the Southern Health Board and additional resources are being allocated to the area immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to parliamentary questions on the issue of waiting times for foreign adoption assessments on 30 September last, I made a detailed statement outlining the initiatives I am taking to <Col N="875" /> deal with this issue generally.  I have attached a copy of my reply for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of women awaiting mammograms in the five major Dublin hospitals dealing with breast cancer are, Mater, Beaumont, St. James's, St. Vincent's and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital, is approximately, 1,700.</P>
      <P>The average waiting time for routine referrals, those which are not considered to be medically urgent varies, between four and eight weeks. Urgent appointments are normally seen within a few days of referral.</P>
      <P>Routine or asymptomatic cases are dealt with as soon as possible, but must be subject to careful prioritisation.  In view of the demands placed on mammography services, some hospitals may refer asymptomatic women to their general practitioner for a further assessment of priority. Hospitals review their caseload regularly, to ensure that women with an urgent cause for concern are seen without delay.  The criteria for urgent cases include the existence of a breast lump, previous family history of breast cancer or other high risk indicators.</P>
      <P>Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait for a mammography, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.</P>
      <P>I am committed to developing mammography services in line with the principles of the national cancer strategy.  In the Eastern Health Board area, the regional directors of cancer services are preparing proposals for the further development of services for the treatment of cancer, including breast cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the provision of mammography services, work is continuing on the introduction of a formal breast screening programme aimed at detecting breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Phase one of the programme comprises the Eastern, Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas.  I am committed to starting the screening <Col N="877" /> programme as soon as possible.  To this end I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start-up costs and minor capital equipment needs of the programme.  In addition, I recently approved a capital allocation of £1.035 million towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street, Mater Hospital, as a screening and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme, and a capital allocation of £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The existing breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital is due to be completely upgraded as part of phase one of the £50 million general redevelopment programme approved for the hospital.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start-up date for the breast screening programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were placed in the national press.  Once the relevant staff are ready to take up their appointments they should be in a position to start the programme.</P>

      <P>The number of patients awaiting treatment at Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital at the end of September 1997 was 1,169; the figure at the end of September in the current year was 1,547.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have contributed to the increase in the numbers awaiting treatment at the hospital.  These include an increase in the number of younger people who require orthopaedic treatment, an expansion of the range of procedures now being carried out, the number of persons presenting for revision surgery in respect of procedures first carried more than 20 years ago, and in 1997 and 1998 additional and replacement consultant appointments have been made at the hospital.  These consultants have developed their own waiting lists.  The provision of additional funding will be considered in the context of the funding available for the continued development of hospital services at 1999 and the competing demands on that funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of procedures performed at Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital in 1997 was 3,219. From January 1998 to September 1998, the most recent period for which figures are available, a total of 2,769 procedures had been carried out <Col N="878" /> and the hospital anticipates that this figure will rise to 3,310 by the end of the year.  The average waiting time between referral and surgery for both years is six to nine months.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the importance of minimising the extent to which patients living in Dongal have to travel to Dublin hospitals for oncology treatments. When the North-Western Health Board's oncology treatment services are in place, the numbers having to travel to Dublin will be substantially reduced, as envisaged in the national cancer strategy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  I have had inquiries made of the board and I have been informed that it is aware of the extended waiting times for those on the priority two waiting list for occupational therapy.  In an attempt to reduce waiting times, the board has established a small group to work with occupational therapists and other professionals in the community to draw up a protocol in relation to a variety of needs presenting as category two.  It is envisaged that this initiative will enable the board to provide a more proactive response to those needs.  The board is also endeavouring to eliminate delays due to dual assessment, particularly in relation to the supply of appliances, by establishing closer links between occupational therapists in the community and their counterparts in hospitals.</P>
      <P>The board has assured me that the person referred to in the Deputy's question will be visited by an occupational therapist immediately.</P>

I have been advised by the board that the number of patients on the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment is 658.

      <P>The health board orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.

I understand the Midland Health Board is continuing its efforts to recruit a consultant orthodontist.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as part of phase 1 of the national breast screening programme, St. Vincent's Hospital was selected as one of the two central units for the screening, assessment and treatment of women.  I am committed to providing the necessary resources to facilitate the commencement of the national programme and to this end I have recently approved funding of £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital. The programme will commence at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that the existing breast clinic at St. Vincent's is due to be completely upgraded as part of phase one of the £50 million general redevelopment programme approved for the hospital.  Planning work on this development is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the hospital management that waiting times for an appointment at the breast clinic are approximately seven to eight weeks.  The hospital stresses, however, that general practitioners can request an appointment at the next clinic for patients whom they classify as urgent.</P>
      <P>The level of activity at the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital has been steadily increasing in recent years and the hospital is continuing to put measures in place in order to maintain and improve services for patients.  In terms of improving appointment schedules the majority of new patients now attend the morning clinic, as they may require access to diagnostic facilities on the same day.  The majority of return patients are now seen in the afternoon.  In addition, the hospital is continuing to operate specialist nurse-led clinics on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The hospital has also introduced a new computerised appointment system and has appointed an additional senior administrative officer who acts as liaison officer to improve patient services.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this package of developments will impact favourably on the level and quality of services for women attending the clinic.</P>

The implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality, is being examined by an interdepartmental task force chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will report to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, in December 1996, additional funding of £3.688 million was provided in the early part of 1997. Since taking office the Government has provided an additional £10 million in 1997 and £8.4 million this year for the development of these services. The co-ordinating committees for the development of services in the sector recommended in the report have been established in each health board.  Following a successful pilot project, my Department is in the process of establishing a committee to oversee the setting up of the database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities recommended by the group.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitments given in Partnership 2000, further progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the reports will take place within overall expenditure parameters.  I am not in a position to say what additional funding will be available in 1999.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  Childminders looking after not more than three children were exempted from the provisions of Part VII of the Act in order to avoid interfering with arrangements made by working parents with a relative or neighbour, to look after their children for them.  The regulations provide for a notification rather than a registration system.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  I have recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce further regulations in this area.  However, the expert group on child care, established under Partnership 2000, to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector, is examining the possible regulation of the child care and childminding industry in its broadest sense.  The expert group, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is expected to finalise its report in December 1998.  The Department of Health and Children is represented on the expert group and on a number of sub-groups of the expert group.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will recall that in my reply to a parliamentary question from her on 8 October 1998, I indicated that, in response to current difficulties, the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, has established a task group to examine the full nature and extent of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.  While the task group has not yet completed its work, the HSEA has indicated to my Department that, while a shortage of nurses exists, it is not evenly distributed. For instance, while there is not a nationwide shortage of nurses, there is difficulty in recruiting specialist nurses, ICU, theatre, etc., in many hospitals.  According to the HSEA task group, there is, however, a general shortage of nurses in acute hospitals in the Dublin area, which are carrying some 450 vacancies.  There is also a difficulty in the recruitment of psychiatric nurses in the eastern and southern regions.</P>
    <P>The task group has identified a number of contributory factors and my Department is considering a number of specific short-term initiatives which have been put forward by the HSEA to address the shortage.  It is hoped to outline details of these initiatives to the nursing unions shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board has set a series of priorities in relation to major capital developments for the acute hospitals in its area.  These priorities are: the completion of phase 2A of the development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar; the capital project that is in preparation at Tullamore General Hospital; and the completion of phase 2B at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Since these priorities were established some years ago, I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made.  Phase 2A in Mullingar is fully operational.  Good progress is being made in relation to the planning process for the capital development at Tullamore General Hospital.  In addition, planning is proceeding for important and much-needed developments at Portlaoise General Hospital.  These comprise an acute psychiatric unit, paediatric unit and other facilities, including renovation of the catering department and ground floor wards.</P>
      <P>Phase 2B at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar involves a ward block and theatre suite.  The facilities have been constructed to the &ldquo;shelled out&rdquo; phase, involving construction of the outer walls, roof, floors and windows.  The completion and commissioning of phase 2B will be considered in the light of available funding as work on the Midland Health Board's other capital priorities proceeds.</P>

      <P>Each year hospitals are notified of their non-capital allocation and a service plan is drawn up by them and agreed with the Department.  This plan <Col N="891" /> sets down parameters for activity for the year and hospitals are required to maintain activity levels within the hospital's agreed parameters.  Detailed decisions in relation to hospital spending are a matter for the hospital management.  In this regard the hospital's chief executive officer advised my Department last week that as part of its service planning within budget it will be closing beds in the gastrointestinal unit until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As a result of this, I understand the hospital has cancelled 345 appointments in this unit from 1 January to 31 December 1998.  I have been advised by the hospital authorities that the only out-patient appointments which they have had to cancel since 1 January have occurred in this unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>Departmental policy in relation to domiciliary births is informed by the report of the mother and infant care review group which was circulated to interested parties in April 1997. This report gives a strong endorsement to the policy that the safest place to have a baby is in a well equipped and staffed maternity hospital or unit.  In this light, it would be inappropriate for my Department to encourage women to have their babies at home.</P>
      <P>Submissions to the review group suggested that one of the main reasons why women opt to give birth at home is their desire for a positive experience in friendly, familiar surroundings where they retain full control.  In response to this, the review group recommended that certain approaches be pilot tested such as the setting aside of accommodation in a maternity hospital to facilitate delivery in a homely, non-clinical manner and a domiciliary care in and out of hospital &mdash; DOMINO &mdash; approach which would allow the midwife/general practitioner to monitor the mother throughout her pregnancy, be with her in hospital and to continue to provide care on her return home.</P>
      <P>The report recognised that arrangements must be made to cater for those women who wish to give birth at home and an expert group has been established under the chief executive officers of the health boards to pilot the approaches suggested by the review group and to draw up procedures and protocols on domiciliary births.  I understand that this group is due to present its report shortly.</P>

      <P>As announced on 13 May 1998 the Government has agreed a comprehensive package of measures which will improve the protection given to the built heritage. As part of the package I will shortly publish a planning Bill which will introduce comprehensive legislative protection for buildings and structures which are of architectural interest.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in consultation with my Department, will prepare guidelines for planning authorities to assist them in performing their functions under the proposed Act.  The guidelines will promote consistency of application of the new legislation amongst all planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to trees, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities concerning the use of tree preservation orders in March 1994 which reminded planning authorities of the important role they play in preserving trees of amenity value in their area.  In the current review of planning legislation I will examine the existing provisions in the planning code regarding tree <Col N="897" /> preservation orders in order to update and simplify the procedures used to make tree preservation orders.</P>

      <P>It is open to local authorities to utilise existing housing land banks, or to acquire land, to make housing sites at low cost available for the purposes of assisting persons in housing need to provide their own housing.  Such housing may be provided either individually with the help, if necessary, of the other social housing measures including shared ownership, local authority house purchase loans and the mortgage allowance, or collectively, through the voluntary housing schemes, special group shared ownership projects or housing co-operatives.</P>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for the local authority to decide on the most appropriate use of existing land banks to meet housing needs, taking into account all relevant local factors, including demand for local authority, voluntary or other social housing, the necessity to secure an appropriate social mix in a particular area, etc.  I and my Department regularly encourage local authorities to be creative in their response to the social housing needs of their areas and, in particular, to avail of the full range of options available to them.  I regard the provision of low cost sites by local authorities as an important element in their response to their housing needs.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week &mdash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &mdash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the fuel and light component of the Consumer Price Index measures the changes in fuel costs.  These data show that fuel prices have fallen slightly in the last two years.  Increasing the rate of fuel allowance could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account increases in primary weekly payment rates.  In that regard, the Deputy will recall that substantial increases of either £3 or £5 per week were paid from June 1998 in all the social welfare primary payments.</P>

      <P>To qualify for old age (contributory) pension, a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age; (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid, and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The yearly average condition has been further reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age (contributory) pension which came into effect from 21 November 1997.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the purpose of these qualifying conditions is to ensure entitlement to the pension is based on a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>In relation to social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts, any such contributions can already be taken into account in meeting the first two conditions above.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many people as possible.  I am fully conversant with the issue raised by the Deputy and I would like to reassure the House that the matter is receiving my detailed attention.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards.  Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement. Participants on certain specified schemes, such as community employment and <Col N="905" /> back to work allowance may have an income up to £250 per week and retain their entitlement to rent or mortgage interest supplements subject to certain conditions.  However, people participating in FÁS training courses are not covered by these special arrangements.  FÁS training allowances are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a rent or mortgage supplement.</P>
    <P>The position in the case raised by the Deputy is that the person concerned was in receipt of a rent supplement of £69.90 up to the 19 September 1998.  When she moved address and applied for a rent supplement in respect of her new address, she informed the health board that she was participating in a one year FÁS course in child care and was in receipt of an additional income of £94 per week from the course.  As her total means of £185.70 weekly exceeded the standard SWA limit for a household in her circumstances, she was no longer entitled to a rent supplement.  An appeal was lodged and the Appeals Officer upheld this decision.</P>
    <P>Any change in the current position to permit the automatic payment of rent supplement to FÁS trainees would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  An additional payment of 50 per cent of the basic rate is paid to carers who are caring for more than one person.</P>
      <P>There were 11,138 persons in receipt of carer's allowance at the end of September 1998, of whom 1,286 (11.5 per cent) were in receipt of a higher payment for caring for more than one person.</P>
      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
      <P>In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance has been completed and was published earlier this month.  The specific proposals in the review will be examined in detail in the context of the 1999 budget.</P>

      <P>In particular, the enhancements included the introduction of a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins, in recognition of the additional difficulties which may be faced by the parents of twins.

      <P>The back to education allowance, which with effect from January 1998 merged the former third level allowance and second level allowance into a unified scheme, provides for a standard weekly rate of payment to participants equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit and the retention of secondary benefits such as rent or mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of participants of the allowance are in receipt of the maximum rate of their unemployment payment where they go onto the allowance and continue to receive their rent-mortgage supplement at the same level as previously. The issue raised by the Deputy concerns participants who were previously in receipt of a reduced rate of unemployment payment and who, on the commencement of the back to education allowance, receive an increase in their basic payment to the maximum rate.  Because the level of rent-mortgage supplements depends on the income level of the recipient, the increase in basic payment to the maximum rate has the effect of reducing the level of their supplement.  I am <Col N="908" /> examining the whole question of retention of secondary benefits at present and following this examination I will be bringing forward proposals to address a number of anomalies in the present arrangements.  The issue raised by the Deputy will also be addressed in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are aware my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was again allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  The closing date for applications for the scheme was 22 May and applications received before that date are currently being considered in the Regional Offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  There has again been a very high level of demand in relation to the scheme this year.</P>
      <P>As I already announced, I have obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme in 1998.  I envisage that the 1998 grants will be made, within the revised allocation, within the next few weeks. The additional allocation brings the amount made available over the past two years to £10 million.  This represents a significant increase in the level of support for this scheme and will provide the necessary resources to meet the volume of worthwhile applications received.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that an application has been received from a group in respect of the individual mentioned in the Deputy's question.  My Department expect to be in a position soon to advise this group of the decision regarding their application under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pensioin age; (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid, and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a Retirement Pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>This yearly average condition has been further reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age (contributory) pension which came into effect from 21 November 1997.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of old age (contributory) pension which was introduced in 1961.  However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age (contributory) pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) pension is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>I consider these qualifying conditions to be reasonable and I have no plans to amend these at this time.</P>

      <P>Different categories of social welfare recipients have differing needs and the social welfare system must be flexible to <Col N="910" /> respond adequately to these needs.  The different methods of assessing income as between the various social assistance payment schemes reflects specific policies which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>
      <P>For example, under improved arrangements, which were introduced earlier this year, the first £2,000 of payments under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) is disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent, for the purposes of the unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age (non-contributory) pension schemes.  This measure is designed to help improve the take-up of REPS, especially for low income farmers receiving social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the special contribution which carers make to our society, the carer's allowance scheme provides for a substantial disregard of £150 a week in the amount of income which the spouse of a recipient may have without affecting the carer's entitlement.  In addition, where the carer is one of a couple, then the carer's means are taken to be half of the joint means.  This means that where the spouse of a carer is farming and receives a REPS payment, the £150 weekly earnings disregard (£7,800 per annum) will apply to that payment.  In addition, any REPS payments which are in excess of the yearly £7,800 limit would be assessed at 50 per cent.  These provisions are therefore, more favourable than those applying in the case of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>However, this income disregard does not currently apply if the REPS payment is being made to the carer.  The specific issue of income regards for carers in their own right was discussed in the recent review of the carer's allowance scheme. The issues contained in this review are currently being examined in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government Programme: An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, has sought to protect the habitats of the species referred to by the Deputy through the designation of special protection areas (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive and a land acquisition programme.  In addition Dúchas also manages the National Parks with a view to the conservation of the natural habitats within their areas.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the increasing pressure from sheep overgrazing has led to a substantial deterioration of red grouse habitats.  In the Owenduff/Nephin Beg complex Dúchas has pursued an extensive land acquisition policy and has acquired over 9,700 h. in the SPA.  These purchases represent a significant contribution to the protection of the site, which will provide conservation dividends by assisting in the reduction of grazing pressures to sustainable levels.</P>
      <P>In view of the necessity to prevent overgrazing problems, and to enable vegetation recovery in areas currently overgrazed, my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food have jointly sought to alleviate and recover the situation. The rural environmental protection scheme, operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food was amended recently to include new provisions for the conservation of natural heritage areas and commonages.  The revised scheme requires commonage framework plans to be prepared for each commonage; these plans will prescribe sustainable stocking levels for each commonage and specify other conservation measures designed to encourage the vegetation to recover.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is no specific tax designation scheme available as referred to by the Deputy.  However there are a number of measures available which I have briefly outlined below and which may be explored in relation to the situation at Ballyknockaun village.  These include: section 19, Finance Act, 1982.  This provides tax relief from income tax and corporation tax for the owner or occupier of an approved building in respect of certain expenditure incurred in respect of repair, maintenance and restoration.  An approved building in this context means that it is a building which is intrinsically of significant, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and that reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public. Application forms for a determination may be obtained from Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, Tel (01) 6613111 ext.  2361.  If Dúchas makes a determination that a building is an approved building under the legislation, application can then be made to the Revenue Commissioners for a claim for tax relief.</P>
      <P>National Inventory of Architectural Heritage Bill, 1998.  The Government has agreed to the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings which will commence in 1999.  I have separately sent to the Deputy a leaflet on measures for the protection of the architectural heritage (including the new grants scheme for listed buildings) agreed by Government and announced by both me and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in May, 1998.  The new grants scheme will be administered by local authorities and will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum.  It will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards to be drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of the two Departments and the Heritage Council.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="913" />The Heritage Council &mdash; An Chomhairle Oidhreachta &mdash; The Heritage Council is at present the main source of public funding for private heritage projects in this country (Tel: 0506-70777, Fax: 056-70788).  It should be noted that although my Department provides funding to the Heritage Council, it has no function in relation to decisions by the council on the disbursal of grants.</P>
    <P>The Urban and Village Renewal Subprogramme.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, due to a decision of the previous Government, no money was granted for Bóithre Aise in 1996 and until I became Minister of State in 1997.  As a result, my Department received a very large number of applications under Scéim na mBóithre Áise this year, and I was unable to provide funds for all necessary works from the moneys available to me to repair all the eligible roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child care services are provided by many Government Departments as an outcome of other policy objectives.  The expert working group set up under Partnership 2000 reviewed this position and considered that my Department should aim to provide a co-ordinated framework through which the childcare outcomes of all Departments and agencies would be co-ordinated. It considered that no one Department on its own would be in a position to meet all childcare needs and that what was needed was a co-ordination mechanism which would ensure that the various policies which resulted in childcare provision would be delivered within a co-ordinated framework.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 20 April 1998 that I should have responsibility for drawing the different elements of childcare together, in consultation with other concerned Ministers, in order to consider the preparation of a co-ordinated national plan.</P>
      <P>My Department chairs the expert working group on childcare which was established by the Government in July 1997 to devise a national framework for the development of childcare facilities in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group is considering a range of childcare issues, many of which fall within the responsibility-remit of a number of Government Departments or statutory bodies viz: financial <Col N="916" /> and employment implication of an integrated approach to the development of childcare facilities in Ireland; registration, training and qualifications; resourcing and sustaining childcare in urban disadvantaged areas; resourcing and sustaining childcare in rural areas; needs and rights of children in relation to a national framework; equality of access and participation in relation to a national framework; standards and regulations; and early childhood education.</P>
    <P>The expert working group is currently preparing a report and recommendation which it intends to finalise in December 1998 including proposals for the necessary structures and mechanisms to implement and monitor a national framework for childcare.</P>
    <P>Membership of the expert working group includes a number of Government Departments which have roles in the area of childcare including the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It also includes representatives from statutory bodies, social partners, non-governmental organisations, parents and individuals who have expertise in the area of childcare.</P>
    <P>My Department is also currently establishing a central database to improve the co-ordination and impact of childcare measures and actions supported in Ireland by the EU.  The database will document and quantify the range and extent of childcare provision and training being supported under the community support framework and establish baseline data on other facilities-services in childcare being supported by the State.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Ltd., who are administering the database on behalf of my Department, will gather information on the level of existing services in terms of quantity and quality through a local county &ldquo;audit&rdquo; of group based services.  From this information it will be possible to identify areas of low/non existent provision and gather evidence of the demand in excess of current provision.  The results of this audit will be fed into a specially designed database and the details in relation to type and location will be superimposed on the county maps.  These maps will also show child population, levels of disadvantage based on census data and agreed deprivation indicators.</P>
    <P>It is planned to pilot the childcare audit in 1998. Following the pilot experiment it is planned to carry out the full childcare audit and database in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309, 336 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>Treatment for drug addicted offenders is available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation will be supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling. It is, unfortunately, the case that despite the availability of the treatment options many offenders continue to fail to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.  While the majority of offenders are imprisoned for offences which are not drug related, many commit offences as a direct result of their drug abuse history.</P>

    <P>The majority of offenders with drugs problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.  During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison received the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison.  The drug treatment unit has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's Health Care Unit since July 1996.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  The programme is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  Over <Col N="919" /> 130 inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit since it opened.  In the short time available it is not possible to get details from the prisons on the number of offenders currently on rehabilitation treatment.  The cost of this treatment is not immediately available as it would include elements of the Probation and Welfare Service, Clinical Psychology Service, nursing and medical staff, the time of prison officers and <i>exgratia</i> payments to non-governmental organisations involved in counselling services.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options open where inmates have completed the detoxification programme in the drug treatment unit.  They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population; if they are considered suitable they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they may transfer to the drug free unit.  This unit provides a sympathetic yet closely monitored setting in which those prisoners who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs.  The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to both the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual inmates who have the motivation to deal with their addiction.  I recognise, however, that more needs to be done and I am currently examining options to improve the level of services available to drug addicted offenders.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that Esat Digifone, the second mobile phone operator, approached the Garda Síochána with a proposal to co-locate their equipment on certain Garda radio masts or sites.  The Garda station at Passage West was included on the list of sites of interest to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the desire to avoid a proliferation <Col N="920" /> of such masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators, as recommended in the Department of the Environment Guidelines for Planning Authorities concerning Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to the company complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will therefore appreciate that careful and detailed consideration was given to the company's proposal and that the agreement with the company is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment.  Should any doubt arise in this regard it would be a matter for the relevant planning authority and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to consider.  In this regard, I understand that the proposed development at Passage West will require planning permission.  Therefore, residents in the area will have the opportunity to voice their objections to the relevant planning authority at the appropriate time.  Under the terms of the contract with Digifone, except for a contravention by them of any of the conditions mentioned above, I am not at liberty to refuse them access.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department attend meetings of Council of Europe committees where asylum and migration issues are discussed. The Department has access to all Council of <Col N="922" /> Europe documentation in these areas and other areas, e.g., human rights, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>As the situation in the country of origin of asylum seekers is a most important factor in the determination process, it is essential that such information is researched in detail.  For this purpose, my Department obtains information from, <i>inter alia,</i> the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the media and other EU member states.</P>
      <P>An applicant for refugee status must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear exists the applicant will be granted refugee status.  Each application is individually examined and it is only after such examination is completed that a decision on its well-foundedness can be taken.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts applications for refugee status from persons of many different countries of origin.  All these applications are examined in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention to determine if Ireland is the appropriate State to consider the applications.  Following this examination, the applications are considered in accordance with the definition of a refugee as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This section defines a refugee as someone who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.  An applicant must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear does not exist the application will be rejected and the applicant refused refugee status in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International experience is that there are those who intentionally misuse asylum procedures for illegal immigration purposes.  Last year I attended an international conference with almost 40 other Ministers and representatives of international institutions which examined the world-wide problem of illegal immigration.  At that conference, I was interested to hear the UNHCR representative speak on discouraging the abuse of asylum procedures.  He said that a number of migrants seeking employment, rather than protection from persecution, circumvent legal immigration regulations and request asylum.  He emphasised, and I agree with him, that attempts to obtain asylum, by people with no valid claim to international protection, take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures.  He went on to say that, moreover, such abusive claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and, in turn, reflect negatively on the asylum institution and, hence, on bona fide refugees. The UNHCR also underlined another <Col N="923" /> major concern of states and the UNCHR alike namely, the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have found, or could have found, protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere.  Movements of this kind have a destabilising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>While recognising that there is a problem with abuse of asylum procedures, as a means of facilitating illegal immigration, it is nevertheless critically important that we do not prejudge cases, that each application is fully and fairly considered and that each applicant has access to an independent appeals system.  These are the principles by which I am operating and will continue to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is proceeding in my Department on taking forward the commitments made by the Government in the British-Irish Agreement in relation to those elements of the Agreement for which my Department is responsible. These arise in a number of areas covered by the Agreement including, in particular, those sections dealing with rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, decommissioning, security and prisoners.</P>
      <P>Giving effect to those elements of the Agreement for which the Department is responsible is identified as an important objective in the Department's recently published Strategy Statement covering the period between now and 2000. This is in keeping with the Department's key high level goal of contributing to the establishment of a lasting peace on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The necessary administrative arrangements, including making the necessary budgetary and personnel provision, have been and continue to be made to enable the Department to fulfil these obligations.  In addition, a mechanism has been established to co-ordinate the work involved and to ensure that the targets which I have set, consistent with the terms of the Agreement, for this purpose are met.  This work is further assisted by my Department's participation in the InterDepartmental Steering Group of Officials established by the Government to co-ordinate the implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has already been made in giving effect to commitments made in the Agreement. Measures that have been taken to this end include: the appointment of former Tánaiste John Wilson to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place, in this jurisdiction, to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland; the enactment of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, in June.  Arrangements are in train to begin to bring the Act into operation at an early date; the making of the Decommissioning Act, 1997 (Decommissioning) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 216 of 1998) and the related Decommissioning Act, 1997 (Sections 5 and 6) (Commencement) Order, 1998 (S.  I. No. 215 of 1998) on 29 June, 1998; the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, and the establishment of the Release of Prisoners Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Act in July 1998.  To date, seven prisoners have been granted early release under the Act.  In addition, the Probation and Welfare Service are examining implementation of the commitment in the Agreement to measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community; <Col N="928" /> and, as already indicated in the Government's legislation programme announced by the Chief Whip on 28 September for the current Dáil session, steps to bring forward, in the context of the Agreement, a Bill to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.</P>
    <P>Work is also moving forward on the other aspects of the Agreement which fall within my Department's area of responsibility: steps, comparable with those being taken in respect of Northern Ireland, which are to be taken by the Government in strengthening and underpinning human rights are being taken forward by a new Human Rights Division in my Department, in particular, matters associated with the establishment of a Human Rights Commission in this jurisdiction and examination of the question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Work on both these issues is proceeding a pace, and in this connection I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to my replies to oral questions earlier today on these issues; and a revised Equal Status Bill is now being developed, following the taking of extensive legal advice, to meet the requirements set out by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 19 June 1997 finding the Equal Status Bill, 1997, unconstitutional.  The revised Bill is expected to be published in early 1999.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the local divisional officer is satisfied that the present opening hours of Ballincollig Garda station are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area.  The staffing of Ballincollig Garda station on a 24-hour basis would mean a reduction in the amount of members available for outdoor patrolling where in the view of Garda management, they can be utilised to best effect. However, I am also informed that the situation is constantly monitored to ensure that an adequate policing service is maintained.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that five Garda stations in the Cork city division operate on a 24-hour basis.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the correspondence received from the solicitors acting in respect of the person referred to by the Deputy was replied to on 30 September 1998. A reply to similar correspondence was sent to the Deputy on the same date.</P>
      <P>I have noted the various concerns in respect of the detention of the person referred to by the Deputy in the Central Mental Hospital including the request for a transfer to alternative accommodation nearer his home.  However, in the absence of alternative facilities incorporating both security and therapeutic aspects, I am not in a position to authorise any such transfer for this person.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Central Mental Hospital is providing both the secure environment and psychiatric care appropriate to this person's particular needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of alternative therapeutic programmes located nearer one's home is primarily a matter for the health agencies, not the criminal justice agencies.  In this regard, there have been ongoing discussions with the Department of <Col N="930" /> Health and Children and the relevant health agencies concerning both the provision of general psychiatric services to offenders and the absence of alternative facilities, programmes, etc.  I understand this particular issue has been identified as a matter of legislative need which may be addressed in pending mental health and separate insanity legislation.</P>

      <P>The gardaí possess a range of sophisticated speed detection equipment, including the GATSO unit, a mobile speed detection unit with on board cameras and computer facilities.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are two GATSO units at present in operation.  Three further units are being acquired and will be brought into use in the near future.  In addition, the gardaí have a wide range of speed detection equipment such as tripod mounted lasers, in-car video systems and hand-held radar guns which assist them in detecting breaches of the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>In response to the unacceptable level of road deaths, the Government launched on 31 July, 1998 the National Strategy on Road Safety &mdash; The Road to Safety.  The following proposals, set out in the strategy, are being considered by all the agencies involved, including my Department and the Garda authorities:&mdash; to extend the use of automatic speed detection systems, including the installation of fixed cameras; to commence evidential breath-testing for drink driving; to extend on the spot fines to non-wearing of seat belts and other offences; and to develop a penalty points system which would trigger disqualification following repeated driving offences.  It is planned to place automated speed detection cameras, i.e., fixed cameras, in the Louth-Meath Division, an area with a high incidence of fatal accidents, on a pilot basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda operates two GATSO units at present.  Three further units have been ordered and will be delivered in the near future. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the GATSO system is an effective and efficient means of reducing the speed at which people drive vehicles on our roads.  For example, I understand that a reduction in average speed from 55 miles per hour to 47 miles per hour has been noted in an area where the GATSO unit has been used.</P>
      <P>Fines on the spot notices are now issued where speeding offences are detected by the GATSO unit.  I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that in excess of 75 per cent of these fines are paid when the ticket is issued and that a further 10 per cent of tickets issued are paid when summonses are issued.</P>
      <P>The result of the use of GATSO combined with the use of fines on the spot for speeding has also the effect of reducing the amount of time spent by gardaí in court.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I have said in the House before that the preparatory process to the publication of a Government White Paper on crime policy requires the consideration of structured, broadly-based and well-informed public discussion on crime issues.  As part of the process, I established a National Crime Forum earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forum was a significant initiative and an important step in seeking the views of the public on the future direction of crime policy.  The forum held public sessions on 12 days and has met a number of times in closed session.</P>
      <P>I have also signalled my intention to establish a crime council as a standing forum to facilitate continuing informed public debate and consultation on the subject of crime.  I consider it right that the details of the council should be open to discussion and I have asked the National Crime Forum to outline what it considers to be the necessary requirements.  The initiatives as outlined above will facilitate the development of a comprehensive policy for tackling crime in a measured and balanced way.</P>
      <P>The report of the proceedings of the forum are at an advanced stage and I expect the report of the forum will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy has only recently been brought to my attention.  I have not as yet had an opportunity to consider the report in detail.  However, it is my understanding that the purpose of this report was to identify from the available research evidence interventions that are likely to be effective in reducing crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report concentrates on measures to reduce criminality, local initiatives as regards crime prevention, reducing the opportunities for crime, community crime prevention, effective policing, sentencing policy, interventions with offenders and drug users.  The report makes a number of interesting findings in seeking to identify a coherent and co-ordinated strategy to reduce crime.  I am of course willing to consider these findings and accordingly, I have asked my officials to examine the report with a view to considering <Col N="938" /> those measures most likely to be effective if implemented here.</P>

      <P>At present there are a significant number of Information Technology projects which are under way in the Department, Garda Síochána and courts areas.  These projects, which include the PULSE project in the Garda Síochána, will provide operational information for the agencies involved.  My Department is also working on a set of projects which will allow for integration of systems across the various agencies. Specifically, these projects will address the following key areas: development of a common data model to address the identification of common data elements, such as offence codes etc., which will then be made common across the various systems; development of common identifiers to ensure that, where possible, relevant data can be examined across the systems; and development of interfaces between systems to address on a system by system basis, information which can be exchanged without the need for duplicate reentry of data.</P>
      <P>It is planned that the analysis projects will be completed by January 1999 and that all operational systems due for delivery in 1999 and onwards will have built the results of the analysis into the system design.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already informed the House that quite apart from the impasse in relation to the appointment of the Refugee Commissioner, I am of the view that the Act in its current form is unworkable. The administrative procedures provided in <Col N="940" /> the Act could not cope with the large number of applications being made and the backlog of cases thus generated.</P>
    <P>It is intended to review the question of the implementation of the Act in the light of the conclusions of a comparative study between Irish and EU member states refugee legislation which has been commissioned and is due to be completed by the end of the year and the experience gained in my Department in the operation of the current procedures.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some states have designated certain countries as &ldquo;safe countries&rdquo;. However it is important to note that it does not mean that the applicant from &ldquo;a safe country of origin&rdquo; is refused access to asylum procedures. It does mean that an applicant from &ldquo;a safe country&rdquo; may be admitted to the process but subject to accelerated procedure akin to our manifestly unfounded procedure.  Ireland does not operate on a &ldquo;safe country&rdquo; basis.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts applications for refugee status from persons of many different countries of origin.  All these applications are examined in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention to determine if Ireland is the appropriate state to consider the applications.  Following this examination, the applications are considered in accordance with the definition of a refugee as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This section defines a refugee as someone who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.  An applicant must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear does not exist the application will be rejected and the applicant refused refugee status in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am firmly committed to maximising the opportunities for special needs children to participate in the mainstream education system.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium gives particular priority to this area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties.  Where special needs children are concerned, it is necessary to view each case on an individual basis.  For some children, the nature of the special need may be such that the child can function quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher, or a visiting teacher.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated an additional 26 posts of resource teacher to national schools bringing the total number of resource teachers now in place to 104.  In addition, a further 60 remedial teacher posts were recently allocated to national schools. There are now 1302 remedial teachers employed in national schools.  It is my intention to continue to develop these services as resources permit.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>However, I am conscious of a particular need for further improvements in the child care assistant area.  I am currently reviewing provision in this area to ensure that all available resources are utilised to maximum effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that I have recently received representations from St. Paul's national school in relation to the provision of caretaking and clerical services.  The submission is being considered by officials within my Department and a <Col N="944" /> response to the points raised in the submission will be communicated to the school shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding toward the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services. This is the scheme which applies to St. Paul's national school.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who have discretion as to how the grants are to be applied to these services.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>St. Paul's national school is currently in receipt of £14,340 per annum 478 pupils x £30 which is the maximum amount available to the school under the current terms of the scheme.  Since this is the appropriate amount payable under the scheme, it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to the school.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 373, 382, 390, 392, 408, 421, 424, 425, 426 and 445 together.</P>
      <P>The pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes in respect of ordinary enrolments in second level schools since 1970 is set out in the following table.  The ratio shown does not take account of ex-quota or concessionary posts which have been a significant feature of allocations in more recent years.</P>
      <P>A <i>de facto</i> ratio of 16 to 1 applies in the case of enrolments in certain programmes including leaving certificate applied, leaving certificate vocational programme, vocational preparation and training programme and PLC courses.  This ratio was first introduced in 1984 in respect of VPTP courses.</P>
      <P>When all pupils and teachers are taken into account, the pupil teacher ratio at second level in the school year 1997-98 is of the order of 15.7 to 1.  The question of reducing the ratio and thereby reducing class sizes in second level schools must be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department are currently examining all aspects of the local contribution. When that review has been completed I will be in a position to make any necessary decisions on the future of the local contribution.</P>
      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  Since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. In effect, therefore, the required local contribution has already fallen well below the traditional 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the State is obliged <Col N="950" /> under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services. This is the scheme which applies to the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The level and extent of services provided is a matter for local school management who have discretion as to how the grants are to be applied to these services.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of £14,340 per annum &mdash; 478 pupils × £30 &mdash; which is the maximum amount available to the school under the current terms of the scheme.  Since this is the appropriate amount payable under the terms of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to this school.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>I recently launched the report of the steering group on the establishment of a teaching council and I am happy to inform the Deputy that preparation of the scheme of a Bill to establish the council on a statutory basis has already commenced in my Department.  It is my intention to submit the scheme to the Government as soon as possible for approval to begin the drafting of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The teaching council will be an autonomous, statutory, self-regulating body, with the role of setting and promoting the highest professional standards for first and second level teachers.  It will have a statutory role in relation to the regulation of the profession and the professional affairs of teachers and an advisory role in relation to other matters.</P>
      <P>The composition of a teaching council will reflect the scope of its work.  The council will be composed of a majority of teachers.  Other parties who have a legitimate interest in the affairs of the teaching council, such as school managerial associations, educational institutions involved in teacher education at primary and post-primary level, parents and the Minister, will also be represented on the council.</P>
      <P>As the Bill to establish the teaching council has not yet been drafted, it is not possible to indicate a likely timescale for the remainder of the work. However, I am confident that the work can be completed without any unnecessary delay.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a teaching council represents an essential step towards the recognition of teaching as a fully fledged profession.  I consider that it is particularly timely that a statutory teaching council be established to protect and promote the status of teaching and the advancement of the profession</P>

      <P>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>The priority has been to extend the scheme to include schools which have no provision for these services already rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each service.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure, to the current figure of 195 pupils.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  In the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am examining a range of options, including the level of capitation rates to primary schools, with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.  It is important to note, however, that the difference in grant level between primary and post primary levels reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second-level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than <Col N="958" /> those in primary schools.  In addition, the second-level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures including paying a portion of each teacher's salary.</P>
    <P>I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.</P>

      <P>The supply scheme is one of a series of initiatives which is designed to provide a pool of trained substitute teachers to replace teachers absent on paid leave of various categories.  The supply panel does not represent the only mechanism for the provision of trained substitute teachers.

      <P>I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three-year B.

      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one-year conversion course for degree holders, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case made by the school in question for the allocation of a concessionary teacher post to address problems of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in meeting the special needs of children with disabilities in integrated settings.  Resource teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  I recently allocated 26 such posts to primary schools with effect from September 1998.  Unfortunately, the school in question was not successful in its application for a resource post on this occassion.

      <P>The enrolment at Castletara national school on 30 September 1997 was 53 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one assistant teacher for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>The above arrangement may be deviated from in cases where the school's enrolment is such that it cannot be organised without breaching the guidelines on maximum class size.

      <Quest>his views on the recent suggestion by the chief executive of NCCA that the junior certificate has lost much of its relevance; if he will respond to the concerns of the NCCA for disadvantaged students and early school dropouts at second level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The remarks attributed to the chief executive of the National Council for Assessment and Certification are based on a contribution made some months ago at a conference organised by the education commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland (CORI) on the role of Assessment and Certification.  Given that 82 per cent of the age cohort now follow a leaving certificate programme he stated that, for those who proceed to further education and training beyond the period of compulsory education, the award of the junior certificate has lost much of its meaning. Thus the junior certificate is no longer the terminal qualification for this cohort.</P>
      <P>The NCCA is undertaking a review of the junior certificate.  The junior certificate school programme has been developed as a curricular provision relevant to the needs of those disadvantaged pupils who are unable to meet the demands of the full junior certificate programme. The NCCA is reviewing the question of access to this programme from a wider range of schools to provide for disadvantaged pupils and also potential early school dropouts.  A review of assessment procedures is also part of the current examination of the junior certificate by the NCCA.  The variety of assessment procedures currently available in the leaving certificate applied are considered to be pertinent to how disadvantaged students might be catered for in a more meaningful way within the context of the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>Taken alongside a one-school community liaison, expansion of traveller education, the 8-15 project for early school leavers and an expansion of Youthreach, in the context of increasing the compulsory school attendance to 16 years of age, the current work and review of the junior certificate by the NCCA is timely and appropriate.</P>

      <P>I have received the report of the planning group which I appointed to prepare proposals and make recommendations on the introduction of a national educational psychological service.  As recommended by the planning group I have established an implementarion group of officials within my Department to make preparatory arrangements, for the introduction of the service including an estimate of costs over a development period of five years beginning in 1999.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year 15 additional psychologists were recruited for my Department's psychological service as part of a special three year development project which will be evaluated.  I have announced recently that a further ten psychologists will be recruited in this context by the end of the year.  When the arrangements for the national educational psychological service are finalised and approved, it is envisaged that existing educational psychological services will become part of the new service when it is established.</P>

      <P>The pupil teacher ratio for primary schools in the current school year is approximately 21.2 to 1, compared with 25.2 to 1 in 1992-93.  I am determined to ensure that the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio will continue in the future.  From time to time my Department receives applications for extra funds and extra staff from primary schools in various parts of the country.  Such applications are not recorded on a county basis and therefore details relating to County Kilkenny are not readily available to me.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware of ongoing concerns among school authorities generally in regard to the level of funding allocated to primary schools. In this connection, I am happy to reaffirm the Government's commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, where I provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the funding of primary schools.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to confirm that my Department has sanctioned a medical grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements in this case, with effect from September, 1998.  The grant may be claimed at the end of each school year. Medical grants may be allowed where a pupil is severely medically handicapped, and cannot be accommodated on the ordinary network of school transport.  The amount payable is based on the distance from the pupil's home to the nearest appropriate school.  As the pupil in question resides 6.5 miles from the school, the maximum annual amount payable in this instance is £580.</P>

      <P>The boy's school building, in the area referred to by the Deputy, needs to be replaced. However, the identification and acquisition of a site for a replacement school building, in the general vicinity of this school, has proved difficult. The only site available at present is in close proximity to another school in the parish.  Accordingly, the question of a central school to accommodate all the schools in the parish was raised.</P>
      <P>Local consultations were carried out with the boards of management and parents of all the schools to ascertain their views on the matter.  Of the four the schools in the parish, three favoured the provision of a central school.  The board of management and parents of the remaining school reserved their position.</P>
      <P>At the request of the board of this school, an official from the planning section of my Department met with the school authorities and parents on 23 September last to clarify certain issues in relation to the proposal.  The meeting unanimously decided to vote again on participation in a central school when a definitive response had been received from the country council in relation to planning permission for the nominated site.  A decision on the planning application will be made in the very near future.</P>

This funding has been allocated to vocational education committees on foot of joint applications from vocational education committees and area based partnerships.  A flexible approach has been adopted under which the funds can be used for direct provision of cre che facilities, including staffing, overheads and refurbishment; purchase of places on existing cre ches, subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child for full sessions, and <i>pro rata</i> adjustments for shorter sessions; and payment to childminders subject to the same maxima, subject to appropriate invoicing arrangements, compliance with registration requirements under the Child Care Act and satisfactory implementation of tax clearance arrangements. This investment is complemented by investment in child care services by area development management and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

A teacher absent on paid compassionate leave may be replaced by a substitute teacher.  However, except in the case of principals in one teacher schools, the salary of the substitute is not borne by my Department.  As an alternative to appointing a substitute teacher, a board of management may opt to redistribute the class(es) of the absent teacher among the remaining teaching staff.</P>

      <Quest>the number of primary schools in County Westmeath which had and which had not the services of a remedial teacher at September for each of the years from 1993-98; and when a remedial teacher service will be available to all necessitous pupils in County Westmeath.</Quest>

      <P>Following is the detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to schools in <Col N="977" /> County Westmeath.  My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I recently allocated 60 remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998.  There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in national schools, following the recent appointments.</P>
      <P>I will continue to review needs in this area.  In the event of additional remedial teacher posts becoming available for allocation, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools in County Westmeath will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>A key consideration in relation to the issuing of examination results is to ensure that they are received by all candidates on the same day.  This is important in minimizing the stress and anxiety on students.  An Post can guarantee next day delivery of the results to the 800 second level schools.  whose address are long established and well known.  A similar next day success rate could not be achieved in the case of more than 60,000 items where additionally there would be a degree of address change.</P>
      <P>The experience with the direct posting of results to external candidates at the leaving certificate supports the view that it would be extremely difficult to reach all students on the one day other than through the schools.  I propose to keep this matter under review in consultation with the education partners and An Post.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my announcement, the funding in question is part of the special package of supports made available to schools which have been designated as disadvantaged and schools which have been included in the breaking the cycle pilot project.  The payments to which I referred represent part of the overall disadvantaged areas fund, an overall funding package amounting to £4.44 million in 1998, which is specifically targeted on disadvantaged areas.  The remainder of this fund is also being expended on a range of further initiatives which are targeted on schools and projects in disadvantaged areas. Final decisions in relation to the allocation of the remainder of the fund will be taken shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential purpose of the announcement to <Col N="979" /> which the Deputy refers was to draw attention to the significant level of special support which, contrary to some recent comments, is actually provided to assist pupils in disadvantaged areas. I would also point out that funding allocations under the disadvataged area fund do not include the salary costs of the significant number of special teachers and home school community liaison co-ordinators who are in place to assist pupils in disadvantaged areas.  In common with primary schools generally, the number of pupils enrolled in schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and in breaking the cycle changes from year to year.  The payments to which I referred were based on student numbers in the schools in question in September 1997.</P>
